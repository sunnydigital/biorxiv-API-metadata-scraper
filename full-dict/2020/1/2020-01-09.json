    "abstract": "In nutrient-limited conditions, plants rely on rhizosphere microbial members to facilitate nutrient acquisition, and in return plants provide carbon resources to these root-associated microorganisms. However, atmospheric nutrient deposition can affect plant-microbe relationships by changing soil bacterial composition and by reducing cooperation between microbial taxa and plants. To examine how long-term nutrient addition shapes rhizosphere community composition, we compared traits associated with bacterial (fast growing copiotrophs, slow growing oligotrophs) and plant (C3 forb, C4 grass) communities residing in a nutrient poor wetland ecosystem. Results revealed that oligotrophic taxa dominated soil bacterial communities and that fertilization increased the presence of oligotrophs in bulk and rhizosphere communities. Additionally, bacterial species diversity was greatest in fertilized soils, particularly in bulk soils. Nutrient enrichment (fertilized vs. unfertilized) and plant association (bulk vs. rhizosphere) determined bacterial community composition; bacterial community structure associated with plant functional group (grass vs. forb) was similar within treatments but differed between fertilization treatments. The core forb microbiome consisted of 602 unique taxa, and the core grass microbiome consisted of 372 unique taxa. Forb rhizospheres were enriched in potentially disease suppressive bacterial taxa and grass rhizospheres were enriched in bacterial taxa associated with complex carbon decomposition. Results from this study demonstrate that fertilization serves as a strong environmental filter on the soil microbiome, which leads to distinct rhizosphere communities and can shift plant effects on the rhizosphere microbiome. These taxonomic shifts within plant rhizospheres could have implications for plant health and ecosystem functions associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling.\n\nImportanceOver the last century, humans have substantially altered nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Use of synthetic fertilizer and burning of fossil fuels and biomass have increased nitrogen and phosphorous deposition, which results in unintended fertilization of historically low-nutrient ecosystems. With increased nutrient availability, plant biodiversity is expected to decline and bacterial communities are anticipated to increase in abundance of copiotrophic taxa. Here, we address how bacterial communities associated with different plant functional types (forb, grass) shift due to long-term nutrient enrichment. Unlike other studies, results revealed an increase in bacterial diversity, particularly, of oligotrophic bacteria in fertilized plots. We observed that nutrient addition strongly determines forb and grass rhizosphere composition, which could indicate different metabolic preferences in the bacterial communities. This study highlights how long-term fertilization of oligotroph-dominated wetlands could alter the metabolism of rhizosphere bacterial communities in unexpected ways.",

    "abstract": "Random noise has been shown to improve the detection of suboptimal signals in humans and machines. Based on that, transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) has aimed to improve human behaviour by targeting neuronal activity. To uncover the poorly understood mechanistic underpinnings of tRNS, we recorded electroencephalography data during arithmetic training while delivering active or sham tRNS above the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). By successfully removing the tRNS artefact in the time and frequency domains, we examined the mechanisms that underlie its behavioural improvement. We found that active tRNS improved arithmetic performance and impacts specific ERPs components that are associated with attentional mechanisms. Furthermore, the tRNS effect was maximal in individuals with suboptimal arithmetic ability and neurophysiological measures of top-down control and excitation/inhibition ratio. These results providing a novel mechanistic explanation for the effect of tRNS on human behaviour and highlight how suboptimal task-specific behaviour and neurophysiology predicts its effect.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning provides an opportunity to automatically segment and extract cellular features from high-throughput microscopy images. Many labeling strategies have been developed for this purpose, ranging from the use of fluorescent markers to label-free approaches. However, differences in the channels available to each respective training dataset make it difficult to directly compare the effectiveness of these strategies across studies. Here we explore training models using subimage stacks composed of channels sampled from larger,  hyper-labeled, image stacks. This allows us to directly compare a variety of labeling strategies and training approaches on identical cells. This approach revealed that fluorescence-based strategies generally provide higher segmentation accuracies but were less accurate than label-free models when labeling was inconsistent. The relative strengths of label and label-free techniques could be combined through the use of merging fluorescence channels and out-of-focus brightfield images. Beyond comparing labeling strategies, using subimage stacks for training was also found to provide a method of simulating a wide range of labeling conditions, increasing the ability of the final model to accommodate a greater range of experimental setups.",

Thus, a controlled disease trial was performed on 120 full-sib families to i) quantify and characterize the potential of genomic selection for S. agalactiae resistance in Nile tilapia and to ii) select the best genomic model and optimal SNP-chip for this trait.\n\nIn total, 40 fish per family (15 fish intraperitoneally injected and 25 fish as cohabitants) were selected for the challenge test and mortalities recorded every 3 hours, until no mortalities occurred for a period of 3 consecutive days. Genotypes (50,690 SNPs) and phenotypes (0 for dead and 1 for alive) for 2472 cohabitant fish were available. The pedigree-based analysis utilized a deep pedigree, going 17 generations back in time. Genetic parameters were obtained using various genomic selection models (GBLUP, BayesB, BayesC, BayesR and BayesS) and traditional pedigree-based model (PBLUP). The genomic models were further analyzed using 10 different subsets of SNP-densities for optimum marker density selection. Prediction accuracy and bias were evaluated using 5 replicates of 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nUsing an appropriate Bayesian genomic selection model and optimising it for SNP density increased prediction accuracy up to [~]71%, compared to a pedigree-based model. This result is encouraging for practical implementation of genomic selection for S. agalactiae resistance in Nile tilapia breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Injuries to the intra-articular knee joint ligament (anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)) together with the extra-articular medial collateral ligament (MCL) result in significant joint instability, pain and immobility for the affected individual. Moderate endurance type exercise has been shown to increase ligament strength, however little is known on the effect of short-term high intensity exercise regimes such as treadmill training on the ACL and MCL and whether they may be beneficial to the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure of these ligaments. This study aimed to identify the effect of short-term high intensity exercise on the proteome of the rat ACL and MCL using mass spectrometry. Sprague Dawley male rats (n=12) were split into equal groups of control and exercise animals, which were subjected to high intensity training and followed by proteomic analysis of the ACL and MCL. Knee joint and ligament health was assessed using OARSI scoring or using a validated histological scoring system. Histopathological analyses demonstrated no significant changes in the ACL, MCL or cartilage of the knee joint, indicating that the exercise regime used in this study did not have substantial impact on tissue structure and health of several tissues within the rat knee joint. Some proteins were found to be significantly more abundant in the ACL in the exercised group than the control group. However, no proteins with a significantly different expression were identified between MCL control and MCL exercised groups. The majority of proteins expressed at higher levels in the ACL exercise group were cytoskeletal proteins, ribosomal proteins and enzymes. Several matrisomal proteins were also more abundant such as collagen proteins and proteoglycans in ACL exercise group. In conclusion, our results indicate that short-term high intensity exercise has an impact on ACL ECM protein expression, with the majority of differential expressed proteins being cellular proteins such as actins, ribosomal and heat shock proteins, indicative of metabolic and molecular responses. Further study is necessary to determine the impact of these short-term changes on ligament structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other primate species are experts at recognizing affective information from body movements but the underlying brain mechanisms are still largely unknown. Previous research focusing on the brain representation of symbolic emotion categories has led to mixed results. This study used representational similarity and multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques to investigate how postural and kinematic features computed from affective whole-body movement videos are related to brain processes. We show that body posture and kinematics differentially activated brain regions indicating that this information might be selectively encoded in these regions. Most specifically, the feature limb contraction seemed to be particularly relevant for distinguishing fear and it was represented in several regions spanning affective, action observation and motor preparation networks. Our approach goes beyond traditional methods of mapping symbolic emotion categories to brain activation/deactivation by discovering which specific movement features are encoded in the brain, and possibly drive automatic emotion perception.",

    "abstract": "Effort-based decision making is often described by choices according to subjective value, a function of reward discounted by effort. We asked whether a neural reinforcement learning signal, the feedback related negativity (FRN), is modulated not only by reward outcomes but also physical effort. We recorded EEG from human participants while they performed a task in which they were required to accurately produce target levels of muscle activation to receive rewards. Participants performed isometric knee extensions while quadriceps muscle activation was recorded using EMG. Real-time feedback indicated muscle activation relative to a target. On a given trial, the target muscle activation required either low or high effort. The effort was determined probabilistically according to a binary choice, such that the responses were associated with 20% and 80% probability of high effort. This contingency could only be known by experience, and it reversed periodically. After each trial binary reinforcement feedback was provided to indicate whether participants were sufficiently accurate in producing the target muscle activity. Participants adaptively avoided effort by switching responses more frequently after choices that resulted in hard effort. Feedback after participants choices which revealed the resulting effort requirement for the subsequent knee extension did not elicit an FRN component. However, the neural response to reinforcement feedback after the knee extension was increased during and after the time period of the FRN by preceding physical effort. Thus, retrospective effort modulates reward processing which may underlie paradoxical behavioral findings whereby rewards requiring more effort to obtain can become more powerful reinforcers.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen making decisions, we typically select more rewarding and less effortful options. Neural reinforcement learning signals reinforce rewarding actions and deter punishing actions. When participants received feedback that their choices would require easy or hard physical effort, we did not observe reinforcement learning signals that are typically observed in response to feedback predicting reward and punishment. Thus, the reinforcement learning system does not strictly treat effort as loss or punishment. However, when the effort was completed and participants received feedback indicating whether they successfully achieved a reward or not, reinforcement learning signals were amplified by preceding effort. Thus, retrospective effort can affect neural responses to reinforcement outcomes, which may explain how effort can enhance the motivational effect of reinforcers.",

Here we used constraint-based modeling of the gut microbiome, using a gene-expression based algorithm called FALCON, to simulate metabolic flux differences in the microbiome of controls vs. metabolic disease patients. We discovered that several major pathways, previously shown to be important in human host metabolism, have significantly different flux between the two groups. We also modeled metabolic cooperation and competition between pairs of species in the microbiome, and use this to determine the compositional stability of the microbiome. We find that that the microbiome is generally unstable across controls as well as metabolic microbiomes, and metabolic disease microbiomes even more unstable than controls.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires is achieved by a combination of two intrinsically stochastic steps: random receptor generation by VDJ recombination, and selection based on the recognition of random self-peptides presented on the major histocompatibility complex. These processes lead to a large receptor variability within and between individuals. However, the characterization of the variability is hampered by the limited size of the sampled repertoires. We introduce a new software tool SONIA to facilitate inference of individual-specific computational models for the generation and selection of the TCR beta chain (TRB) from sequenced repertoires of 651 individuals, separating and quantifying the variability of the two processes of generation and selection in the population. We find not only that most of the variability is driven by the VDJ generation process, but there is a large degree of consistency between individuals with the inter-individual variance of repertoires being about ~2% of the intra-individual variance. Known viral-specific TCRs follow the same generation and selection statistics as all TCRs.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous parasite Toxoplasma gondii exhibits an impressive ability to maintain a chronic infection of its host for prolonged periods. Despite this, little is known regarding if and how T. gondii bradyzoites, a quasi-dormant life-stage residing within intracellular cysts, manipulate the host cell so as to maintain a persistent infection. A previous proteomic study of the cyst wall, an amorphous layer of proteins that forms underneath the cyst membrane, identified MYR1 as a putative cyst wall protein in vitro. As MYR1 is known to be involved in the translocation of parasite derived effector proteins into the host cell, we sought to determine whether parasites transitioning toward the bradyzoite life stage retain the capacity to translocate proteins via this pathway. By epitope tagging the endogenous loci of four known effectors that translocate from the parasitophorous vacuole into the host cell nucleus, we show by immunofluorescence that most effectors accumulate in the host nucleus at early but not late timepoints post-infection during the tachyzoite to bradyzoite transition and when parasites farther along the bradyzoite differentiation continuum invade a new host cell. We demonstrate that the suppression of interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, previously shown to be mediated by the effector TgIST, also occurs in the context of prolonged infection with bradyzoites, and that TgIST export is a process that occurs beyond the early stages of host cell infection. These findings have important implications as to how this highly successful parasite maintains a persistent infection of its host.\n\nIMPORTANCEToxoplasma bradyzoites persist within tissue cysts and are refractory to current treatments, serving as a reservoir for acute complications in settings of compromised immunity. Much remains to be understood regarding how this life-stage successfully establishes and maintains a persistent infection. In this study, we investigated whether the export of parasite effector proteins into the host cell occurs during the development of in vitro tissue cysts. We quantified the presence of four previously described effectors in host cell nuclei at different timepoints post-bradyzoite differentiation and found that they accumulate largely during the early stages of infection. Despite a decline in nuclear accumulation, we found that one of these effectors still mediates its function after prolonged infection with bradyzoites and provide evidence that this effector is exported beyond early infection stages. These findings suggest that effector export from within developing tissue cysts provides one potential mechanism by which this parasite achieves chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "The brain is comprised of neural circuits that are able to flexibly represent the complexity of the external world. In accomplishing this feat, one of the first attributes the brain must code for is whether a stimulus is present and subsequently what sensory information that stimulus contains. One of the core characteristics of that information is which sensory modality(ies) are being represented. How information regarding both the presence and modal identity of a given stimulus is represented and transformed within the brain remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how the brain represents the presence and modal identity of a given stimulus while tactile, audio, and audio-tactile stimuli were passively presented to non-human primates. We recorded spiking activity from primary somatosensory (S1) and ventral pre-motor (PMv) cortices, two areas known to be instrumental in transforming sensory information into motor commands for action. Using multivariate analyses to decode stimulus presence and identity, we found that information regarding stimulus presence and modal identity were found in both S1 and PMv and extended beyond the duration of significant evoked spiking activity, and that this information followed different time-courses in these two areas. Further, we combined time-generalization decoding with cross-area decoding to demonstrate that while signaling the presence of a stimulus involves a feedforward-feedback coupling between S1-PMv, the processing of modal identity is largely restricted to S1. Together, these results highlight the differing spatiotemporal dynamics of information flow regarding stimulus presence and modal identity in two nodes of an important cortical sensorimotor circuit.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is unclear how the structure and function of the brain support differing sensory functions, such as detecting the presence of a stimulus in the environment vs. identifying it. Here, we used multivariate decoding methods on monkey neuronal data to track how information regarding stimulus presence and modal identity flow within a sensorimotor circuit. Results demonstrate that while neural patterns in both primary somatosensory (S1) and ventral pre-motor (PMv) cortices can be used to detect and discriminate between stimuli, they follow different time-courses. Importantly, findings suggest that while information regarding the presence of a stimulus flows reciprocally between S1 and PMv, information regarding stimulus identity is largely contained in S1.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases affect 1 in 5,000 live births around the world. They are caused by inherited or de novo mutations in over 350 nuclear-encoded and mtDNA-encoded genes. There is no approved treatment to stop the progression of any mitochondrial disease despite the enormous global unmet need. Affected families often self-compound cocktails of over-the-counter vitamins and generally recognized as safe nutritional supplements that have not received regulatory approval for efficacy. Finding a new use for an approved drug is called repurposing, an attractive path for mitochondrial diseases because of the reduced safety risks, low costs and fast timelines to a clinic-ready therapy or combination of therapies. Here I describe the first-ever drug repurposing screen for mitochondrial diseases involving complex I deficiency, e.g., Leigh syndrome, using the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a model system. Unlike the more commonly used yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae but like humans, Yarrowia lipolytica has a functional and metabolically integrated respiratory complex I and is an obligate aerobe. In 384-well-plate liquid culture format without shaking, Yarrowia lipolytica cells grown in either glucose-containing media or acetate-containing media were treated with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (3{micro}M and 6M, respectively) of the natural product and complex I inhibitor piericidin A. Out of 2,560 compounds in the Microsource Spectrum collection, 24 suppressors of piercidin A reached statistical significance in one or both media conditions. The suppressors include calcium channel blockers nisoldipine, amiodarone and tetrandrine as well as the farnesol-like sesquiterpenoids parthenolide, nerolidol and bisabolol, which may all be modulating mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Estradiols and synthetic estrogen receptor agonists are the largest class of suppressors that rescue growth of piericidin-A-treated Yarrowia lipolytica cells in both glucose-containing and acetate-containing media. Analysis of structure-activity relationships suggests that estrogens may enhance bioenergetics by evolutionarily conserved interactions with mitochondrial membranes that promote mitochondrial filamentation and mitochondrial DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProtease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) is activated by proteases involved in allergy and triggers airway epithelial secretion and inflammation. PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells.\n\nObjectiveWe tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization.\n\nMethodsEndogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states.\n\nResultsPAR-2 signaling in airway squamous cells activated calcium and inflammatory responses. Squamous cells cultured at air liquid interface (ALI) responded to PAR-2 agonists applied both apically and basolaterally. Primary well-differentiated nasal epithelial ALI cultures responded only to basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Primary cultures exposed to IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, or reduced retinoic acid responded to both apical and basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Nasal polyp tissue, but not control middle turbinate, exhibited apical calcium responses to PAR-2 stimulation. However, isolated ciliated cells from both polyp and turbinate maintained basolateral PAR-2 polarization.\n\nConclusionsSquamous metaplasia and/or loss of cilia enhances apical PAR-2 responses. Altered PAR-2 polarization in dedifferentiated or remodeled epithelia may contribute to increased sensitivity to inhaled protease allergens in inflammatory airway diseases.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterized by deterioration of bone tissue in later life. The set of genetic factors contributing to osteoporosis is not completely specified. High-risk osteoporosis pedigrees were analyzed to identify genes that may confer susceptibility to disease. Candidate predisposition variants were identified initially by whole exome sequencing of affected-relative-pairs, approximately cousins, from ten pedigrees. Variants were filtered on the basis of population frequency, concordance between pairs of cousins, affecting a gene associated with osteoporosis, and likelihood to have functionally damaging, pathogenic consequences. Subsequently variants were tested for segregation in 68 additional relatives of the index carriers. A rare variant in MEGF6 (rs755467862) showed strong evidence of segregation with the disease phenotype. Predicted protein folding indicated the variant (Cys200Tyr) may disrupt structure of an EGF-like calcium-binding domain of MEGF6. Functional analyses demonstrated that complete loss of the paralogous genes megf6a and megf6b in zebrafish resulted in significant delay of cartilage and bone formation. Segregation analyses, in-silico protein structure modeling, and functional assays support a role for MEGF6 in predisposition to osteoporosis.",

Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) line intranodal lymphatic sinuses and organize lymph and antigen distribution. LECs also directly regulate T cells, mediating peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, and play a major role in many diseases including cancer metastasis. However, little is known about the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of LN LECs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively defined the transcriptome of LECs in murine skin-draining LNs, and identified new markers and functions of distinct LEC subpopulations. We found that LECs residing in the subcapsular sinus have an unanticipated function in scavenging of modified LDL and also identified a specific cortical LEC subtype implicated in rapid lymphocyte egress from LNs. Our data provide new insights into the diversity of LECs in murine lymph nodes and a rich resource for future studies into the regulation of immune responses by lymph node LECs.",

Despite this well-known collateral damage, the activity spectrum of the different antibiotic classes on gut bacteria remains poorly characterized. Having monitored the activities of >1,000 marketed drugs on 38 representative species of the healthy human gut microbiome4, we here characterize further the 144 antibiotics therein, representing all major classes. We determined >800 Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and extended the antibiotic profiling to 10 additional species to validate these results and link to available data on antibiotic breakpoints for gut microbes. Antibiotic classes exhibited distinct inhibition spectra, including generation-dependent effects by quinolones and phylogeny-independence by {beta}-lactams. Macrolides and tetracyclines, two prototypic classes of bacteriostatic protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibited almost all commensals tested. We established that both kill different subsets of prevalent commensal bacteria, and cause cell lysis in specific cases. This species-specific activity challenges the long-standing divide of antibiotics into bactericidal and bacteriostatic, and provides a possible explanation for the strong impact of macrolides on the gut microbiota composition in animals5-8 and humans9-11. To mitigate the collateral damage of macrolides and tetracyclines on gut commensals, we exploited the fact that drug combinations have species-specific outcomes in bacteria12 and sought marketed drugs, which could antagonize the activity of these antibiotics in abundant gut commensal species. By screening >1,000 drugs, we identified several such antidotes capable of protecting gut species from these antibiotics without compromising their activity against relevant pathogens. Altogether, this study broadens our understanding of antibiotic action on gut commensals, uncovers a previously unappreciated and broad bactericidal effect of prototypical bacteriostatic antibiotics on gut bacteria, and opens avenues for preventing the collateral damage caused by antibiotics on human gut commensals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMetabolic reprograming, non-mutational epigenetic changes, increased cell plasticity and multidrug tolerance are early hallmarks of therapy resistance in cancer. In this temporary, therapy-tolerant state, cancer cells are highly sensitive to ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that is caused by oxidative stress through excess levels of iron-dependent peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). However, mechanisms underpinning therapy-induced ferroptosis hypersensitivity remain to be elucidated.\n\nMethodsWe used quantitative single cell imaging of fluorescent metabolic probes, transcriptomics, proteomics and lipidomics to perform a longitudinal analysis of the adaptive response to androgen receptor-targeted therapies (androgen deprivation and enzalutamide) in prostate cancer (PCa).\n\nResultsWe discovered that cessation of cell proliferation and a robust reduction in bioenergetic processes were associated with multidrug tolerance and a strong accumulation of lipids. The gain in lipid biomass was fueled by enhanced lipid uptake through cargo non-selective (macropinocytosis, tunneling nanotubes) and cargo-selective mechanisms (lipid transporters), whereas de novo lipid synthesis was strongly reduced. Enzalutamide induced extensive lipid remodeling of all major phospholipid classes at the expense of storage lipids, leading to increased desaturation and acyl chain length of membrane lipids. The rise in membrane PUFA levels enhanced membrane fluidity and lipid peroxidation, causing hypersensitivity to glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) inhibition and ferroptosis. Combination treatments against AR and fatty acid desaturation, lipase activities or growth medium supplementation with antioxidants or PUFAs altered GPX4 dependence. Despite multidrug tolerance, PCa cells displayed an enhanced sensitivity to inhibition of lysosomal processing of exogenous lipids, highlighting an increased dependence on lipid uptake in the therapy-tolerant state.\n\nConclusionsOur work provides mechanistic insight into processes of lipid metabolism that underpin the acquisition of therapy-induced GPX4 dependence and ferroptosis hypersensitivity to standard of care therapies in PCa. It demonstrated novel strategies to suppress the therapy-tolerant state that may have potential to delay and combat resistance to androgen receptor-targeted therapies, a currently unmet clinical challenge of advanced PCa. Since enhanced GPX4 dependence is an adaptive phenotype shared by several types of cancer in response to different therapies, our work might have universal implications for our understanding of metabolic events that underpin resistance to cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Animals have evolved multiple mechanisms to protect themselves from the cumulative effects of age-related cellular damage. Here we reveal an unexpected link between the TNF (tumour necrosis factor) inflammatory pathway, triggered by the metalloprotease ADAM17/TACE, and a lipid droplet (LD)-mediated mechanism of protecting retinal cells from age related degeneration. Loss of ADAM17, TNF and the TNF receptor Grindelwald in pigmented glial cells of the Drosophila retina leads to age related degeneration of both glia and neurons, preceded by an abnormal accumulation of glial LDs. We show that the glial LDs initially buffer the cells against damage caused by neuronally generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), but that in later life the LDs dissipate, leading to the release of toxic peroxidated lipids. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of a conserved pathway in human iPS-derived microglia-like cells, which are central players in neurodegeneration. Overall, we have discovered a pathway mediated by TNF signalling acting not as a trigger of inflammation, but as a cytoprotective factor in the retina.",

    "abstract": "Plant diseases pose a serious threat to sustainable agriculture as controlling them in eco-friendly manner remains a challenge. In this study, we establish RAV1 as a master transcriptional regulator of defense genes in model plant Arabidopsis. The overexpression of AtRAV1 provided disease resistance against necrotrophic fungal pathogen (Rhizoctonia solani) infection in A. thaliana. The transgenic lines exhibited enhanced expression of several defense genes including mitogen associated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the amplitude of their expression was further enhanced upon pathogen infection. Conversely, the atrav1 mutant plants were unable to induce the expression of these defense genes and were highly susceptible to infection. Our data suggests that upon pathogen attack, AtRAV1 transcriptionally upregulate the expression of MAPKs (AtMPK3, AtMPK4 and AtMPK6) and AtMPK3 and AtMPK6 are essential for AtRAV1 mediated disease resistance. Further, we demonstrate that AtRAV1 is a phosphorylation target of AtMPK3 (but not AtMPK6) and the phospho-defective variants of AtRAV1 are unable to induce disease resistance in A. thaliana. Considering the presence of AtRAV1 orthologs in diverse plant species, we propose that they can be gainfully deployed to control economically important diseases. In deed we observe that overexpression of tomato ortholog of AtRAV1 (SlRAV1) provides broad spectrum disease resistance against bacterial (Ralstonia solanacearum), fungal (R. solani) and viral (Tomato leaf curl virus) infections in tomato.",

    "abstract": "Simulating transcranial electric stimulation is actively researched as knowledge about the distribution of the electrical field is decisive for understanding the variability in the elicited stimulation effect. Several software pipelines comprehensively solve this task in an automated manner for standard use-cases. However, simulations for non-standard applications such as uncommon electrode shapes or the creation of head models from non-optimized T1-weighted imaging data and the inclusion of irregular structures are more difficult to accomplish.\n\nWe address these limitations and suggest a comprehensive workflow to simulate transcranial electric stimulation based on open-source tools. The workflow covers the head model creation from MRI data, the electrode modeling, the modeling of anisotropic conductivity behavior of the white matter, the numerical simulation and visualization.\n\nSkin, skull, air cavities, cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and gray matter are segmented semi-automatically from T1-weighted MR images. Electrodes of arbitrary number and shape can be modeled. The meshing of the head model is implemented in a way to preserve feature edges of the electrodes and is free of topological restrictions of the considered structures of the head model. White matter anisotropy can be computed from diffusion-tensor imaging data.\n\nOur solver application was verified analytically and by contrasting tDCS simulation results with another simulation pipeline (SimNIBS 3.0). An agreement in both cases underlines the validity of our workflow.\n\nOur suggested solutions facilitate investigations of irregular structures in patients (e.g. lesions, implants) or of new electrode types.

    "abstract": "The Myriapoda including millipedes and centipedes is of major importance in terrestrial ecology and nutrient recycling. Here, we sequenced and assembled two chromosomal-scale genomes of millipedes Helicorthomorpha holstii (182 Mb, N50 18.11 Mb mainly on 8 pseudomolecules) and Trigoniulus corallinus (449 Mb, N50 26.78 Mb mainly on 15 pseudomolecules). Unique defense systems, genomic features, and patterns of gene regulation in millipedes, not observed in other arthropods, are revealed. Millipedes possesses a unique ozadene defensive gland unlike the venomous forcipules in centipedes. Sets of genes associated with anti-microbial activity are identified with proteomics, suggesting that the ozadene gland is not primarily an antipredator adaptation (at least in T. corallinus). Macro-synteny analyses revealed highly conserved genomic blocks between centipede and the two millipedes. Tight Hox and the first loose ecdysozoan ParaHox homeobox clusters are identified, and a myriapod-specific genomic rearrangement including Hox3 is also observed. The Argonaute proteins for loading small RNAs are duplicated in both millipedes, but unlike insects, an argonaute duplicate has become a pseudogene. Evidence of post-transcriptional modification in small RNAs, including species-specific microRNA arm switching that provide differential gene regulation is also obtained. Millipede genomes reveal a series of unique genomic adaptations and microRNA regulation mechanisms have occurred in this major lineage of arthropod diversity. Collectively, the two millipede genomes shed new light on this fascinating but poorly understood branch of life, with a highly unusual body plan and novel adaptations to their environment.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms efficiently coordinate phenotype expressions through a decision-making process known as quorum sensing (QS). We investigated QS amongst heterogeneously distributed microbial aggregates under various flow conditions using a process-driven numerical model. Model simulations assess the conditions suitable for QS induction and quantify the importance of advective transport of signaling molecules. In addition, advection dilutes signaling molecules so that faster flow conditions require higher microbial densities, faster signal production rates, or higher sensitivities to signaling molecules to induce QS. However, autoinduction of signal production can substantially increase the transport distance of signaling molecules in both upstream and downstream directions. We present approximate analytical solutions of the advection-diffusion-reaction equation that describe the concentration profiles of signaling molecules for a wide range of flow and reaction rates. These empirical relationships, which predict the distribution of dissolved solutes following zero-order production kinetics along pore channels, allow to quantitatively estimate the effective communication distances amongst multiple microbial aggregates without further numerical simulations.\n\nAuthor SummaryMicrobes can interact with their surrounding environments by producing and sensing small signaling molecules. When the microbes experience a high enough concentration of the signaling molecules, they express certain phenotypes which is often energetically expensive. This microbial decision-making process known as quorum sensing (QS) has been understood to confer evolutionary benefits. However, it is still not completely understood how transport of the produced signaling molecules affects QS. Using a mathematical approach investigating QS across a range of environmentally relevant flow conditions, we find that advective transport promotes QS downstream yet also dilutes the concentration of signaling molecules. We quantify the importance of microbial cell location with respect to both other microbes and flow direction. By analyzing complex numerical simulation results, we provide analytical approximations to assess the distribution of signaling molecules in pore channels across a range of flow and reaction conditions.",

This prospective cohort study included 112 patients with acute tonsillitis (AT) and PTA recruited at a tertiary hospital emergency department between February and October 2017. All patients completed a questionnaire concerning their current disease. Serum amylase (S-Amyl) and C-reactive protein (S-CRP) levels, tonsillar findings, and pus aspirate samples and throat cultures were analyzed. Eight of 58 PTA patients (13.8%) had no signs of tonsillar infection. The absence of tonsillar erythema and exudate was associated with low S-CRP (p<0.001) and older age (p<0.001). We also observed an inverse correlation between S-Amyl and S-CRP levels (AT, r= -0.519; PTA, r= -0.353). Therefore, we observed a group of PTA patients without signs of tonsillar infection who had significantly lower S-CRP levels than other PTA patients. These findings support that PTA may be caused by an etiology other than AT. Variations in the S-Amyl levels and a negative correlation between S-Amyl and S-CRP levels may indicate that minor salivary glands are involved in PTA development.\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE1b",

In order to inform future developments, it is important to understand the benefits and impact of prescribing by allied health professionals including physiotherapists and podiatrists.\n\nAim: to compare outcomes of Physiotherapist and Podiatrist Independent Prescriber (PP-IP) patients with those of Physiotherapist and Podiatrist non-prescribers (PP-NPs). Outcome measures included patient satisfaction, ease of access to services, quality of life and cost implications.\n\nDesign: a quasi-experimental, post-test control group design\n\nMethods: Using mixed methods outcomes were compared between 7 sites where care was provided from a PP-IP (3 podiatrist and 4 physiotherapist IPs) and 7 sites from a PP-NP (3 podiatrist and 4 physiotherapist NPs). Patients were followed up for 2 months (2015-2016).\n\nResults: 489 patients were recruited: n=243 IP sites, and n=246 NP sites. Independent prescribing was found to be highly acceptable, and equivalent in terms of quality of life (p>0.05) and patient satisfaction (p[&le;]0.05) compared to care provided by NPs. PP-IP care delivery was found to be more resource intensive than NP-PP, with longer consultation duration for IPs (around 6.5 mins), and a higher proportion of physiotherapy patients discussed with medical colleagues (around 9.5 minutes).\n\nConclusionThis study provides new knowledge that PP-IPs provide high levels of care. PP-IP care delivery was found to be more resource intensive. Further research is required to explore cost effectiveness. A more focussed exploration within each profession using targeted outcome measures would enable a more robust comparison, inform future developments around the world and help ensure non-doctor prescribing is recognised as an effective way to alleviate shortfalls in the global workforce.",

    "abstract": "Meloidogyne partityla is the dominant root-knot nematode (RKN) species parasitizing pecan in Georgia. This species is known to cause a reduction in root growth and a decline in yields from mature pecan trees. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of this RKN is required to control this nematode disease and reduce losses in pecan production. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed for simple, rapid and on-site detection of M. partityla in infested plant roots and validated to detect the nematode in laboratory and field conditions. Specific primers were designed based on the sequence distinction of internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-18S/5.8S ribosomal RNA gene between M. partityla and other Meloidogyne spp. The LAMP detection technique could detect the presence of M. partityla genomic DNA at a concentration as low as 1 pg, and no cross reactivity was found with DNA from other major RKN species such as M. javanica, M. incognita and M. arenaria, and M. hapla. We also conducted a traditional morphology-based diagnostic assay and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine which of these techniques was less time consuming, more sensitive, and convenient to use in the field. The LAMP assay provided more rapid results, amplifying the target nematode species in less than 60 min at 65{degrees}C, with results 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (~2-3 hrs). Morphology-based, traditional diagnosis was highly time-consuming (2 days) and more laborious than conventional PCR and LAMP assays. These features greatly simplified the operating procedure and made the assay a powerful tool for rapid, on-site detection of pecan RKN, M. partityla. The LAMP assay will facilitate accurate pecan nematode diagnosis in the field and contribute to the management of the pathogen.",
