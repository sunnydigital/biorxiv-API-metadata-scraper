    "abstract": "Different learning strategies are thought to fall along a continuum that ranges from simple, inflexible, and fast \"model-free\" strategies, to more complex, flexible, and deliberative \"model-based strategies\". Here we show that, contrary to this proposal, strategies at both ends of this continuum can be equally flexible, effective, and time-intensive. We analyzed behavior of adult human subjects performing a canonical learning task used to distinguish between model-free and model-based strategies. Subjects using either strategy showed similarly high information complexity, a measure of strategic flexibility, and comparable accuracy and response times. This similarity was apparent despite the generally higher computational complexity of model-based algorithms and fundamental differences in how each strategy learned: model-free learning was driven primarily by observed past responses, whereas model-based learning was driven primarily by inferences about latent task features. Thus, model-free and model-based learning differ in the information they use to learn but can support comparably flexible behavior.\n\nStatement of RelevanceThe distinction between model-free and model-based learning is an influential framework that has been used extensively to understand individual- and task-dependent differences in learning by both healthy and clinical populations. A common interpretation of this distinction that model-based strategies are more complex and therefore more flexible than model-free strategies. However, this interpretation conflates computational complexity, which relates to processing resources and generally higher for model-based algorithms, with information complexity, which reflects flexibility but has rarely been measured. Here we use a metric of information complexity to demonstrate that, contrary to this interpretation, model-free and model-based strategies can be equally flexible, effective, and time-intensive and are better distinguished by the nature of the information from which they learn. Our results counter common interpretations of model-free versus model-based learning and demonstrate the general usefulness of information complexity for assessing different forms of strategic flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Real-world environments are extremely rich in visual information. At any given moment in time, only a fraction of this information is available to the eyes and the brain, rendering naturalistic vision a collection of incomplete snapshots. Previous research suggests that in order to successfully contextualize this fragmented information, the visual system sorts inputs according to spatial schemata, that is knowledge about the typical composition of the visual world. Here, we used a large set of 840 different natural scene fragments to investigate whether this sorting mechanism can operate across the diverse visual environments encountered during real-world vision. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants viewed incomplete scene fragments at fixation. Using representational similarity analysis on the EEG data, we tracked the fragments cortical representations across time. We found that the fragments typical vertical location within the environment (top or bottom) predicted their cortical representations, indexing a sorting of information according to spatial schemata. The fragments cortical representations were most strongly organized by their vertical location at around 200ms after image onset, suggesting rapid perceptual sorting of information according to spatial schemata. In control analyses, we show that this sorting is flexible with respect to visual features: it is neither explained by commonalities between visually similar indoor and outdoor scenes, nor by the feature organization emerging from a deep neural network trained on scene categorization. Demonstrating such a flexible sorting across a wide range of visually diverse scenes suggests a contextualization mechanism suitable for complex and variable real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "The Magnocellular (M) visual pathway is known as a fast route to convey coarse information and facilitates object recognition by initiating top-down processes. It is unclear what exact properties M pathway conveys to accelerate visual object processing. Previous studies suggest that visual systems are highly sensitive to the perception of topological property (TP), which remains unchanged under various shape changes, and the TP is probably processed through a fast subcortical pathway. Here we hypothesize that a subcortical M system contributes to the fast object recognition by processing TP first. We first demonstrate that the facilitation effect of TP processing on object perception occurs mainly in the M visual system, and then support the subcortical M hypothesis of TP processing by the evidence that the early processing of TP was not affected when cortical function was temporarily damaged by the transcranial magnetic stimulation and when stimuli were biased to M system.",

    "abstract": "The G-protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors in the olfactory system function to sense the surroundings and respond to various odorants. The genes encoding for the olfactory receptors in C. elegans are larger in number in comparison to those in mammals, suggesting complexity in the receptor- odorant relationships. Recent studies have shown that the same odorant in different concentration could act on multiple receptors in different neurons to induce attractive or repulsive responses. The ASH neuron is known to be responsible for responding to high concentrations of volatile odorants. Here we characterize a new GPCR, SRX-97. We found that the srx-97 promoter shows expression specifically in the head ASH and tail PHB chemosensory neurons of C. elegans. Further, the SRX-97 protein localizes to the ciliary ends of the ASH neurons. Analysis of CRISPR/based deletion mutants of the srx-97 gene suggest that this gene is involved in the recognition of high concentrations of benzaldehyde. This was further confirmed through rescue and neuronal ablation experiments. Our work gives insight into concentration dependent receptor function in the olfactory system and provides details of an additional molecule that could help the animal navigate its surroundings.",

    "abstract": "When observers make rapid, difficult perceptual decisions, their response time is highly variable from trial to trial. In a visual motion discrimination task, it has been reported that human accuracy declines with increasing response time, whereas rat accuracy increases with response time. This is of interest because different mathematical theories of decision-making differ in their predictions regarding the correlation of accuracy with response time. On the premise that perceptual decision-making mechanisms are likely to be conserved among mammals, we seek to unify the rodent and primate results in a common theoretical framework. We show that a bounded drift diffusion model (DDM) can explain both effects with variable parameters: trial-to-trial variability in the starting point of the diffusion process produces the pattern typically observed in rats, whereas variability in the drift rate produces the pattern typically observed in humans. We further show that the same effects can be produced by deterministic biases, even in the absence of parameter stochasticity or parameter change within a trial.",

Meanwhile, its proper function relies on its 3D supporting environment, including the highly dynamic vascular system that drives energy and material flow. Better understanding of these processes requires methods to capture fast volumetric dynamics in thick tissue. This becomes challenging due to the trade-off between speed and optical sectioning capability in conventional imaging techniques. Here we present a new imaging method, confocal light field microscopy, to enable fast volumetric imaging deep into brain. We demonstrated the power of this method by recording whole brain calcium transients in freely swimming larval zebrafish and observed behaviorally correlated activities on single neurons during its prey capture. Furthermore, we captured neural activities and circulating blood cells over a volume {emptyset} 800 m x 150 m at 70 Hz and up to 600 m deep in the mice brain.",

    "abstract": "While activation of resistance (R) proteins has been intensively studied, the downstream signaling mechanisms leading to restriction of pathogen remain mostly unknown. We studied the immunity network response conditioned by the potato Ny-1 gene against potato virus Y. We analyzed the processes in the cell death zone and surrounding tissue on the biochemical and gene expression levels to reveal spatiotemporal regulation of immune response. We show that the transcriptional response in the cell death zone and surrounding tissue is dependent on salicylic acid (SA). For some genes, spatiotemporal regulation is completely lost in SA-deficient line, while the others show different response, indicating multiple connections between hormonal signaling modules. The induction of NADPH oxidase RBOHD expression occurs specifically on the lesion border during resistance response. In plants with silenced RBOHD, the functionality of resistance response is perturbed and virus spread is not arrested at the site of infection. RBOHD is required for spatial accumulation of SA, and conversely RBOHD is under transcriptional regulation of SA signaling. Using spatially resolved RNA-Seq, we also identified spatial regulation of an UDP-glucosyltransferase, another component in feedback activation of SA biosynthesis, thus deciphering a novel aspect of resistance signaling.",

    "abstract": "Low gibberellin (GA) activity in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) inhibits leaf expansion and reduces stomatal conductance. These lead to lower transpiration and improve water status under transient drought conditions. Tomato has three GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) GA receptors with overlapping activities and high redundancy. We have tested whether mutation in a single GID1 reduces transpiration without affecting growth and productivity. CRISPR-Cas9 gid1 mutants were able to maintain higher leaf water content under water-deficit conditions. Moreover, while gid1a exhibited normal growth, it showed reduced whole plant transpiration and better recovery from dehydration. Mutation in GID1a inhibited xylem vessels proliferation that led to lower hydraulic conductance. In stronger GA mutants, we also found reduced xylem vessel expansion. These results suggest that low GA activity affects transpiration by multiple mechanisms; it reduces leaf area, promotes stomatal closure and reduces xylem proliferation and expansion and as a result, xylem hydraulic conductance. We further examined if gid1a perform better than the control M82 in the field. Under these conditions, the high redundancy of GID1s was lost and gid1a plants were semi-dwarf, but their productivity was not affected. Although gid1a did not perform better under drought conditions in the field, it exhibited higher harvest index.\n\nHighlightThe loss of the tomato gibberellin receptors GID1s reduced xylem proliferation and xylem hydraulic conductance. These contribute to the effect of low gibberellin activity on water loss under water-deficit condition.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic models are key to understanding the intricate dynamics of gene expression. But the simplest models which only account for e.g. active and inactive states of a gene fail to capture common observations in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here we consider multistate models of gene expression which generalise the canonical Telegraph process, and are capable of capturing the joint effects of e.g. transcription factors, heterochromatin state and DNA accessibility (or, in prokaryotes, Sigma-factor activity) on transcript abundance. We propose two approaches for solving classes of these generalised systems. The first approach offers a fresh perspective on a general class of multistate models, and allows us to \"decompose\" more complicated systems into simpler processes, each of which can be solved analytically. This enables us to obtain a solution of any model from this class. We further show that these models cannot have a heavy-tailed distribution in the absence of extrinsic noise. Next, we develop an approximation method based on a power series expansion of the stationary distribution for an even broader class of multistate models of gene transcription. The combination of analytical and computational solutions for these realistic gene expression models also holds the potential to design synthetic systems, and control the behaviour of naturally evolved gene expression systems, e.g. in guiding cell-fate decisions.",

These steps are linked to significant changes in synaptic function, potentially resulting in changes in behavior. Here, we examined the distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) during development of the zebrafish nervous system. Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses on socially-relevant neurons in the ventral forebrain, co-localizing with tyrosine hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a maturation step for synapses in the forebrain that are spatiotemporally related to social behavior.",

    "abstract": "Information processing in the brain depends on synaptic transmission and plasticity, which in turn require specialized organization of neurotransmitter receptors and scaffolding proteins within the postsynaptic density (PSD). However, how these molecules are organized in situ remains largely elusive, limiting our mechanistic understanding of synaptic formation and functions. Here, we have developed template-free classification of over-sampled sub-tomograms to analyze cryo-electron tomograms of hippocampal synapses, enabling us to identify type-A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR) in inhibitory synapses and determine its in situ structure at 19 [A] resolution. We found that these receptors are organized hierarchically: from GABAAR super-complexes with a fixed 11-nm inter-receptor distance but variable relative angles, through semi-ordered two-dimensional receptor networks with reduced Voronoi entropy, to mesophasic assembly with a sharp phase boundary. This assembly aligns with condensates of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and putative presynaptic vesicle release sites. Such mesophasic self-organization may allow synapses to achieve a \"Goldilocks\" state with a delicate balance between stability and flexibility, enabling both reliability and plasticity in information processing.",

    "abstract": "Single cell transcriptome profiling has emerged as a breakthrough technology for the high-resolution understanding of complex cellular systems. Here we report a flexible, cost-effective and user-friendly droplet-based microfluidics system, called the Nadia Instrument, that can allow 3 mRNA capture of [~]50,000 single cells or individual nuclei in a single run. The precise pressure-based system demonstrates highly reproducible droplet size, low doublet rates and high mRNA capture efficiencies that compare favorably in the field. Moreover, when combined with the Nadia Innovate, the system can be transformed into an adaptable setup that enables use of different buffers and barcoded bead configurations to facilitate diverse applications. Finally, by 3 mRNA profiling asynchronous human and mouse cells at different phases of the cell cycle, we demonstrate the systems ability to readily distinguish distinct cell populations and infer underlying transcriptional regulatory networks. Notably this identified multiple transcription factors that had little or no known link to the cell cycle (e.g. DRAP1, ZKSCAN1 and CEBPZ). In summary, the Nadia platform represents a promising and flexible technology for future transcriptomic studies, and other related applications, at cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Although the cerebellum is traditionally associated with balance and motor function, it also plays wider roles in affective and cognitive behaviors. Evidence suggests that the cerebellar vermis may regulate aggressive behavior, though the cerebellar circuits and patterns of activity that influence aggression remain unclear. We used optogenetic methods to bidirectionally modulate the activity of spatially-delineated cerebellar Purkinje cells to evaluate the impact on aggression in mice. Increasing Purkinje cell activity in the vermis significantly reduced the frequency of attacks in a resident-intruder assay. Reduced aggression was not a consequence of impaired motor function, because optogenetic stimulation did not alter motor performance. In complementary experiments, optogenetic inhibition of Purkinje cells in the vermis increased the frequency of attacks. These results establish Purkinje cell activity in the cerebellar vermis regulates aggression, and further support the importance of the cerebellum in driving affective behaviors that could contribute to neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with disease phenotypes. However, the majority of these variants do not alter coding sequences, making it difficult to assign their function. To this end, we present a multi-omic epigenetic atlas of the adult human brain through profiling of the chromatin accessibility landscapes and three-dimensional chromatin interactions of seven brain regions across a cohort of 39 cognitively healthy individuals. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling of 70,631 cells from six of these brain regions identifies 24 distinct cell clusters and 359,022 cell type-specific regulatory elements, capturing the regulatory diversity of the adult brain. We develop a machine learning classifier to integrate this multi-omic framework and predict dozens of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), nominating gene and cellular targets for previously orphaned GWAS loci. These predictions both inform well-studied disease-relevant genes, such as BIN1 in microglia for Alzheimers disease (AD) and reveal novel gene-disease associations, such as STAB1 in microglia and MAL in oligodendrocytes for Parkinsons disease (PD). Moreover, we dissect the complex inverted haplotype of the MAPT (encoding tau) PD risk locus, identifying ectopic enhancer-gene contacts in neurons that increase MAPT expression and may mediate this disease association. This work greatly expands our understanding of inherited variation in AD and PD and provides a roadmap for the epigenomic dissection of noncoding regulatory variation in disease.",

    "abstract": "Host resistance against intracellular pathogens requires a rapid IFN-{gamma} mediated immune response. We reveal that T-bet-dependent production of IFN-{gamma} is essential for the maintenance of inflammatory DCs at the site of infection with a common protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. A detailed analysis of the cellular sources for T-bet-dependent IFN-{gamma} identified that ILC1s, but not NK or TH1 cells, were involved in the regulation of inflammatory DCs via IFN-{gamma}. Mechanistically, we established that T-bet dependent ILC1-derived IFN-{gamma} is critical for the induction of IRF8, an essential transcription factor for cDC1s. Failure to upregulate IRF8 in DCs resulted in acute susceptibility to T. gondii infection. Our data identifies that ILC1-derived IFN-{gamma} is indispensable for host resistance against intracellular infection via maintaining IRF8+ inflammatory DCs at the site of infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryMounting a robust type I innate immune response is essential for resistance against numerous intracellular pathogens. The type I immune response is characterized by the production of IFN-{gamma}, a central cytokine required for multiple non-redundant effector functions against bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Previous work has shown that group 1 innate lymphocyte cells (ILC1s) together with NK and CD4+ T cells play an indispensable IFN-{gamma} mediated protective role against Toxoplasma gondii infection; yet, the pathway of how IFN-{gamma} produced by ILC1s defend against T. gondii remains unknown. In this work we identified that early production of IFN-{gamma} by ILC1 is essential for maintaining dendritic cells (DCs) during infection. Mechanistically, we reveal that ILC1-derived IFN-{gamma} is indispensable for inducing the transcription factor IRF8 that is critical for sustaining inflammatory DCs. Finally, we demonstrate that IRF8+ DCs are critical for parasite elimination.",

Although there are some indirect data about microparticles participation in coagulation activation and propagation, the integral hemostasis test Thrombodynamics allows to measure micropaticles participation in these two coagulation phases directly by influence on the appearance of coagulation centers in plasma volume and on the rate of clot grown from surface with immobilized tissue factor.\n\nMethodsMicroparticles were obtained from platelets and erythrocytes by stimulation with SFLLRN and A23187, respectively, from monocytes, endothelial HUVEC culture and monocytic THP cell culture by stimulation with lipopolysaccharides. Microparticles were counted by flow cytometry and titrated in microparticle-depleted normal plasma in the Thrombodynamics test.\n\nResultsMonocyte microparticles induced the appearance of clotting centres through the TF pathway at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than platelet and erythrocyte microparticles, which activated plasma by the contact pathway. For endothelial microparticles, both activation pathways were essential, and their activity was intermediate. Monocyte microparticles induced plasma clotting by the appearance of hundreds of clots with an extremely slow growth rate, while erythrocyte microparticles induced the appearance of a few clots with a growth rate similar to that from surface covered with high-density tissue factor. Patterns of clotting induced by platelet and endothelial microparticles were intermediate. Platelet, erythrocyte and endothelial microparticles impacts on the rate of clot growth from the surface with tissue factor did not differ significantly within the 0-200{middle dot}103/ul range of microparticles concentrations. However, at concentrations greater than 500{middle dot}103/ul, erythrocyte microparticles increased the stationary clot growth rate to significantly higher levels than do platelet microparticles or artificial phospholipid vesicles consisting of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine.\n\nConclusionMicroparticles of different origins demonstrated qualitatively different characteristics related to coagulation activation and propagation.",

Kinase inhibitors that stabilize an open conformation relieve this interference and reduce LRRK2 filament formation in cells, while those that stabilize a closed conformation do not.

    "abstract": "The recombinase RAD51, and its meiosis-specific paralog DMC1 localize at DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair sites in meiotic prophase nuclei. While both proteins are required during meiotic homologous recombination, their spatial organization during meiotic DSB repair is not fully understood. Using super-resolution microscopy on mouse spermatocyte nuclei, we aimed to define their relative position at DSB foci, and how these vary in time. We show that a large fraction of meiotic DSB repair foci (38%) contained a single RAD51 cluster and a single DMC1 cluster (D1R1 configuration) that were partially overlapping (average center-center distance around 70 nm). The majority of the rest of the foci had a similar combination of a major RAD51 and DMC1 cluster, but in combination with additional clusters (D2R1, D1R2, D2R2, or DxRy configuration) at an average distance of around 250 nm. As prophase progressed, less D1R1 and more D2R1 foci were observed, where the RAD51 cluster in the D2R1 foci elongated and gradually oriented towards the distant DMC1 cluster. This correlated with more frequently observed RAD51 bridges between the two DMC1 clusters. D1R2 foci frequency was more constant, and the single DMC1 cluster did not elongate, but was observed more frequently in between the two RAD51 clusters in early stages. D2R2 foci were rare (<10%) and nearest neighbour analyses also did not reveal pair formation between D1R1 foci. In the absence of the transverse filament of the synaptonemal complex (connecting the chromosomal axes of homologs), early configurations were more prominent, and RAD51 elongation occurred only transiently. This in-depth analysis of single cell landscapes of RAD51 and DMC1 accumulation patterns at DSB repair sites at super-resolution thus revealed the variability of foci composition, and defined functional consensus configurations that change over time.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMeiosis is a specific type of cell division that is central to sperm and egg formation in sexual reproduction. It forms cells with a single copy of each chromosome, instead of the two copies that are normally present. In meiotic prophase, homologous chromosomes must connect to each other, to be correctly distributed between the daughter cells. This involves the formation and repair of double-strand breaks in the DNA. Here we used super-resolution microscopy to elucidate the localization patterns of two important DNA repair proteins: RAD51 and DMC1. We found that repair sites most often contain a single large cluster of both proteins, with or without one additional smaller cluster of either protein. RAD51 protein clusters displayed lengthening as meiotic prophase progressed. When chromosome pairing was disturbed, we observed changes in the dynamics of protein accumulation patterns, indicating that they actually correspond to certain repair intermediates changing in relative frequency of occurrence. These analyses of single meiotic DNA repair foci reveal the biological variability in protein accumulation patterns, and the localization of RAD51 and DMC1 relative to each other, thereby contributing to our understanding of the molecular basis of meiotic homologous recombination.",

    "abstract": "Mutation signatures represent unique sequence footprints of somatic mutations resulting from specific DNA mutagenic and repair processes; however, their causal associations and potential utility for genome research remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed PanCancer-scale correlative analyses to identify the genomic features associated with tumor mutation burdens (TMB) and individual mutation signatures. We observed that TMB was correlated with tumor purity, ploidy, and the level of aneuploidy, as well as with the expression of cell proliferation-related genes representing genomic covariates in evaluating TMB. Correlative analyses of mutation signature levels with genes belonging to DNA damage-repair processes revealed that deficiencies of NHEJ1 and ALKBH3 may elevate TMB levels in cancer genomes accompanying APOBEC overactivity and DNA mismatch repair deficiency, respectively. We further employed a strategy to identify feature-driven, de novo mutation signatures and demonstrated they can be reconstructed using known causal features such as APOBEC overexpression, MLH1 underexpression, POLE mutations, and the level of homologous recombination deficiency. We further demonstrated, that tumor hypoxia-related mutation signatures are similar to those associated with APOBEC suggesting that APOBEC-related mutagenic activity mediates hypoxia-related mutational consequences in cancer genomes, and also, that mutation signatures can be further used to predict hypoxic tumors. Taken together, our study advances mutation signature-level mechanistic insights in cancer genomes, extending categories of cancer-relevant mutation signatures and their potential biological implications.\n\nAuthor summaryMutation signature analysis is powerful in deciphering the causative mutagenic events and their contributions in individual cancer genomes, but the causal relationship of individual mutation signatures are still largely unknown. PanCancer-scaled correlative analysis revealed mutation resource candidates in cancer genomes such as NHEJ1 and ALKBH3 deficiencies that may facilitate the accumulation of mutations in the setting of APOBEC overactivity and DNA mismatch repair deficiency, respectively. A feature-driven mutation discovery approach was employed to identify the mutation signatures representing homologous recombination deficiency and tumor hypoxia, the extent of which may serve as mutation-based phenotypic measures, previously estimated by DNA copy number alterations and mRNA expression signatures, respectively. Our study advances our understanding into the mechanistic insights of mutation signatures and proposes a method to utilize somatic mutations as a molecular proxy in terms of mutation signatures.",

    "abstract": "In spite of treated wastewater presenting itself as an attractive alternative to scarce quality water in the developing countries, the associated contamination of fresh produce by irrigation waters leading to outbreak of foodborne illnesses is on the rise. Horizontal transfer of integrons play important role in the spread and maintenance of antimicrobial resistance among strains of Escherichia coli. This study assessed the effluents from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Wastewater Treatment Plant (UNN-WWTP) as well as vegetables irrigated with the effluent, and vegetables sold in selected markets from Nsukka and Enugu cities for the presence of E. coli and determined the prevalence integrons in multidrug-resistant isolates. Isolation of E. coli was done using eosin methylene blue agar and isolates subjected to Gram staining for identification of presumptive colonies. Confirmation of E. coli was achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, targeting beta-glucuronidase (uidA). Resistance to antibiotics was determined using the Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion assay and the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute criteria. Integrons were detected by multiplex PCR using primers specific for class 1 and 2 integrons. A total of 178 E. coli isolates were obtained from WWTP effluent (41), and vegetables from greenhouse (46), farms (55) and market (36). Multi-drug resistance was detected in all the isolates, ranging from five-drug resistance in a single isolate to 16-drug resistance patterns in two different isolates. Of the total isolates, class 1 integrons were abundantly detected in 175 (98.3%) and class 2 in 5 (2.8%). All the class 2 integrons were found in isolates that were positive for class 1. The high detection of E. coli in the studied effluent and vegetables pose potential public health hazards heightened by observed multidrug resistance in all the isolates and the high prevalence of class 1 integron. It is concluded that the vegetable samples are significant reservoirs for potentially pathogenic E. coli.

    "abstract": "Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcribed, retrotransposable noncoding RNA (ncRNA) elements ubiquitously spread throughout mammalian genomes. While normally silenced in healthy somatic tissue, SINEs can be induced during infection with DNA viruses, including the model murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68. Here, we explored the mechanisms underlying MHV68 activation of SINE ncRNAs. We demonstrate that lytic MHV68 infection of B cells, macrophages and fibroblasts leads to robust activation of the B2 family of SINEs in a cell autonomous manner. B2 ncRNA induction requires neither host innate immune signaling factors nor involvement of the RNAPIII master regulator Maf1. However, we identify MHV68 ORF36, the conserved herpesviral kinase, as playing a key role in B2 induction during lytic infection. SINE activation is linked to ORF36 kinase activity and can also be induced by HDAC1/2 inhibition, which is one of the known ORF36 functions. Collectively, our data suggest that ORF36-mediated changes in chromatin modification contribute to B2 activation during MHV68 infection, and that this activity is conserved in other herpesviral protein kinase homologs.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYViral infection dramatically changes the levels of many types of RNA in a cell. In particular, certain oncogenic viruses activate expression of repetitive genes called retrotransposons, which are normally silenced due to their ability to copy and spread throughout the genome. Here, we established that infection with the gammaherpesvirus MHV68 leads to a dramatic induction of a class of noncoding retrotransposons called B2 SINEs in multiple cell types. We then explored how MHV68 activates B2 SINEs, revealing a role for the conserved herpesviral protein kinase ORF36. Both ORF36 kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions contribute to B2 induction, perhaps through ORF36 targeting of proteins involved in controlling the accessibility of chromatin surrounding SINE loci. Understanding features underlying induction of these elements following MHV68 infection should provide insight into core elements of SINE regulation, as well as dis-regulation of SINE elements associated with disease.",

    "abstract": "The brain is constantly anticipating the future of sensory inputs based on past experiences. When new sensory data is different from predictions shaped by recent trends, neural signals are generated to report this surprise. Existing models for quantifying surprise are based on an ideal observer assumption operating under one of the three definitions of surprise set forth as the Shannon, Bayesian, and Confidence-corrected surprise. In this paper, we analyze both visual and auditory EEG and auditory MEG signals recorded during oddball tasks to examine which temporal components in these signals are sufficient to decode the brains surprise based on each of these three definitions. We found that for both recording systems the Shannon surprise is always significantly better decoded than the Bayesian surprise regardless of the sensory modality and the selected temporal features used for decoding.\n\nAuthor summaryA regression model is proposed for decoding the level of the brains surprise in response to sensory sequences using selected temporal components of recorded EEG and MEG data. Three surprise quantification definitions (Shannon, Bayesian, and Confidence-corrected surprise) are compared in offering decoding power. Four different regimes for selecting temporal samples of EEG and MEG data are used to evaluate which part of the recorded data may contain signatures that represent the brains surprise in terms of offering a high decoding power. We found that both the middle and late components of the EEG response offer strong decoding power for surprise while the early components are significantly weaker in decoding surprise. In the MEG response, we found that the middle components have the highest decoding power while the late components offer moderate decoding powers. When using a single temporal sample for decoding surprise, samples of the middle segment possess the highest decoding power. Shannon surprise is always better decoded than the other definitions of surprise for all the four temporal feature selection regimes. Similar superiority for Shannon surprise is observed for the EEG and MEG data across the entire range of temporal sample regimes used in our analysis.",

    "abstract": "Proteins often get misfolded into highly ordered amyloid aggregates that are found to be associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the dynamical events that lead to such self organization of different types of proteins are still poorly understood due to the experimentally untractable complex molecular mechanism, which governs the process of amyloidogenesis. Herein, we propose a generic and data-driven mathematical modeling approach that enables us to decipher a most probable molecular mechanism responsible for amyloidogensis in a context dependent manner. The preferred model efficiently elucidates various aspects of amyloid forming kinetics as a function of initial protein concentration, and qualitatively predicts the dynamics of amyloidogenesis for point mutated proteins. Importantly, the model analysis reveals that intermediate aggregates formed just after the primary necleation steps plays a vital role in dictating the nature of amyloid forming kinetics. Moreover, our model makes experimentally feasible insightful predictions to formulate better therapeutic measures in future to counter unwanted amyloidogenesis by just fine-tuning the molecular interactions related to amyloidogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn cells, proteins mostly function by being in a native folded conformation. However, under certain circumstances, some of these proteins undergo high degree of aggregation and eventually misfold to form highly stable amyloid aggregates that are often involved in different neurodegenerative disease progression and pathogenesis. To develop appropriate therapeutic strategies to resist such oligomerazation of protein, it is imperative to unravel the molecular interactions that essentially organize the dynamical events of amyloidogenesis. We have proposed a generic computational modeling framework to elucidate the important molecular events that govern the dynamics of amyloid formation. Our model reconciles diverse set of experimental observations including different mutant phenotyes from a dynamical perspective, and predicts possible ways to control the kinetics of amyloid formation experimentally. In future, these insights will be helpful to design drugs to treat patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, our model, in general, will be quite useful to figure out the important molecular events that are orchestrating the amyloidogenesis of different amyloid forming proteins.",

    "abstract": "Phospholipase C{beta}1 is activated by Gq to generate calcium signals in response to hormones and neurotransmitters, and is found at high levels in mammalian neuronal tissue. Besides carrying out this key plasma membrane function, PLC{beta}1 has a cytosolic population that helps, in part, to drive the differentiation of PC12 cells by inhibiting a nuclease that promotes RNA-induced silencing (C3PO). Here, we show that down-regulating PLC{beta}1 or reducing its cytosolic population by activating Gq to drive it to the plasma membrane, returns differentiated PC12 cells to an undifferentiated state. In this state, the cells return to a spherical morphology, resume proliferation and express the stem cell transcription factors nanog and Oct4. Similar changes are seen with C3PO down-regulation. This return to a stem-like state is accompanied by shifts in multiple miR populations, such as increased levels of rno-miR-21 and rno-miR-26a. Surprisingly, we find that de-differentiation can also be induced by extended stimulation of the Gq. In this case, the neurites completely retract over a 10-minute period, and while levels of nanog remain unchanged, the levels of some miRs begin to return to their undifferentiated values. In complementary studies, we followed the real time hydrolysis of a fluorescent-tagged miR in cells where PLC{beta}1 or C3PO were down-regulated. These samples showed substantial differences in miR processing in cells both the undifferentiated and differentiated states. Taken together, our studies suggest that PLC{beta}1, through its ability to regulate C3PO and endogenous miR populations, plays a key role in mediating PC12 cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In the lung, the airway surface is protected by mucus, whose transport and evacuation is ensured through active ciliary beating. The mechanisms governing the long-range directional organization of ciliary beats, required for effective mucus transport, are much debated. Here, we experimentally show on human bronchial epithelium reconstituted in-vitro that the dynamics of ciliary-beat orientation is closely connected to hydrodynamic effects. To examine the fundamental mechanisms of this self-organization process, we build a two-dimensional model in which the hydrodynamic coupling between cilia is provided by a streamwise-alignment rule governing the local orientation of the ciliary forcing. The model reproduces the emergence of the mucus swirls observed in the experiments. The predicted swirl sizes, which scale with the ciliary density and mucus viscosity, are in agreement with in-vitro measurements. A transition from the swirly regime to a long-range unidirectional mucus flow allowing effective clearance occurs at high ciliary density and high mucus viscosity. In the latter case, the mucus flow tends to spontaneously align with the bronchus axis due to hydrodynamic effects.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation that results in the formation of inclusions is strongly correlated with neuronal death and is a pathological hallmark common to many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntingtons disease. Cells are thought to dramatically up-regulate the levels of heat shock proteins during periods of cellular stress via induction of the heat shock response (HSR). Heat shock proteins are well-characterised molecular chaperones that interact with aggregation-prone proteins to either stabilise, refold, or traffic protein for degradation. The reason why heat shock proteins are unable to maintain the solubility of particular proteins in neurodegenerative disease is unknown. We sought to determine whether neurodegenerative disease-associated protein aggregates can induce the HSR. Here, we generated a neuroblastoma cell line that expresses a fluorescent reporter under conditions of HSR induction, for example heat shock. Using these cells, we show that the HSR is not induced by exogenous treatment with aggregated forms of Parkinsons disease-associated -synuclein or the ALS-associated G93A mutant of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1G93A). Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed that intracellular expression of SOD1G93A or a pathogenic form of polyQ-expanded huntingtin (Htt72Q), similarly, results in no or low induction of the HSR. In contrast, expression of a non-pathogenic but aggregation-prone form of firefly luciferase (Fluc) did induce an HSR in a significantly greater proportion of cells. Finally, we show that HSR induction is dependent on the intracellular levels of the aggregation-prone proteins, but the pathogenic proteins (SOD1G93A and Htt72Q) elicit a significantly lower HSR compared to the non-pathogenic proteins (Fluc). These results suggest that pathogenic proteins either evade detection or impair induction of the HSR in neuronal-like cells. Therefore, defective HSR induction may facilitate the initiation of protein aggregation leading to inclusion formation in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) possess optical properties of superbright fluorescence, excellent photostability, narrow emission spectra, and optional colors. Labeled with QDs, single molecules/viruses can be rapidly and continuously imaged for a long time, providing more detailed information than labeled with other fluorophores. While they are widely used to label proteins in single-molecule tracking studies, QDs have rarely been used to study virus infection, mainly due to lack of accepted labeling strategies. Here, we report a general method to mildly and readily label enveloped viruses with QDs. Lipid-biotin conjugates were used to recognize and mark viral lipid membranes, and streptavidin (SA)-QD conjugates were used to light them up. Such a method allowed enveloped viruses to be labeled in 2 hours with specificity and efficiency up to 99% and 98%. The intact morphology and the native infectivity of viruses could be furthest preserved. With the aid of this QD labeling method, we lit wild-type (WT) and mutant Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) up, tracked their infection in living Vero cells, and found that H144A and Q258A substitutions in the envelope (E) protein didnt affect the virus intracellular trafficking. The lipid-specific QD labeling method described in this study provides a handy and practical tool to readily \"see\" the viruses and follow their infection, facilitating the widespread use of single-virus tracking and the uncovering of complex infection mechanisms.\n\nAuthor summaryVirus infection in host cells is a complex process comprising a large number of dynamic molecular events. Single-virus tracking is a versatile technique to study these events. To perform this technique, viruses must be fluorescently labeled to be visible to fluorescence microscopes. Quantum dot is a kind of fluorescent tags that has many unique optical properties. It has been widely used to label proteins in single-molecule tracking studies, but rarely used to study virus infection, mainly due to lack of accepted labeling method. In this study, we developed a lipid-specific method to readily, mildly, specifically, and efficiently label enveloped viruses with quantum dots by recognizing viral envelope lipids with lipid-biotin conjugates and recognizing these lipid-biotin conjugates with streptavidin-quantum dot conjugates. Such a method is superior to the commonly used DiD/DiO labeling and the other QD labeling methods. It is not only applicable to normal viruses, but also competent to label the key protein-mutated viruses and the inactivated high virulent viruses, providing a powerful tool for single-virus tracking.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule-associated protein Tau is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers disease. Increasing evidence suggests that post-translational modifications play critical roles in regulating Tau normal functions and its pathogenic properties in Tauopathies. Very little is known about how phosphorylation of tyrosine residues influences the structure, aggregation, and microtubule- and lipid-binding properties of Tau. In this work, we aimed to address this knowledge gap and determine the relative contribution of phosphorylation of one or several of the five tyrosine residues in Tau (Y18, Y29, Y197, Y310 and Y394) to the regulation of its biophysical, aggregation and functional properties. Towards this goal, we used a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro phosphorylation by c-Abl kinase to generate Tau species phosphorylated at all tyrosine residues, all tyrosine residues except Y310 or Y394 (pTau-Y310F, pTau-Y394F) and Tau phosphorylated only at Y310 or Y394 (4F\\pY310 or 4F\\pY394). Our results show that phosphorylation at all five tyrosine residues, multiple N-terminal tyrosine residues (Y18, Y29 and Y197) or site-specific phosphorylation at residue Y310, itself located in the microtubule-binding and aggregation-prone domain of Tau, was sufficient to abolish Tau aggregation and inhibit its microtubule- and lipid-binding properties. NMR studies demonstrated that these effects were mediated by a local decrease in {beta}-sheet propensity of the PHF6 domain. Our findings underscore the unique role of Y310 phosphorylation in the regulation of Tau aggregation, microtubule and lipid interactions and highlight the importance of conducting further studies to elucidate its role in the regulation of Tau normal functions and its pathogenic properties.",

    "abstract": "The identification and prediction of Drug-Target Interactions (DTIs) is the basis for screening drug candidates, which plays a vital role in the development of innovative drugs. However, due to the time-consuming and high cost constraints of biological experimental methods, traditional drug target identification technologies are often difficult to develop on a large scale. Therefore, in silico methods are urgently needed to predict drug-target interactions in a genome-wide manner. In this article, we design a new in silico approach, named RFDTI to predict the DTIs combine Feature weighted Rotation Forest (FwRF) classifier with protein amino acids information. This model has two outstanding advantages: a) using the fusion data of protein sequence and drug molecular fingerprint, which can fully carry information; b) using the classifier with feature selection ability, which can effectively remove noise information and improve prediction performance. More specifically, we first use Position-Specific Score Matrix (PSSM) to numerically convert protein sequences and utilize Pseudo Position-Specific Score Matrix (PsePSSM) to extract their features. Then a unified digital descriptor is formed by combining molecular fingerprints representing drug information. Finally, the FwRF is applied to implement on Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCR, and Nuclear Receptor data sets. The results of the five-fold cross-validation experiment show that the prediction accuracy of this approach reaches 91.68%, 88.11%, 84.72% and 78.33% on four benchmark data sets, respectively. To further validate the performance of the RFDTI, we compare it with other excellent methods and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. In addition, 7 of the 10 highest predictive scores in predicting novel DTIs were validated by relevant databases. The experimental results of cross-validation indicated that RFDTI is feasible in predicting the relationship among drugs and target, and can provide help for the discovery of new candidate drugs.",

    "abstract": "Mitigating the threat of insecticide resistance in African malaria vector populations requires comprehensive information about where resistance occurs, to what degree, and how this has changed over time. Estimating these trends is complicated by the sparse, heterogeneous distribution of observations of resistance phenotypes in field populations. We use 6423 observations of the prevalence of resistance to the most important vector control insecticides to inform a Bayesian geostatistical ensemble modelling approach, generating fine-scale predictive maps of resistance phenotypes in mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex across Africa. Our models are informed by a suite of 111 predictor variables describing potential drivers of selection for resistance. Our maps show alarming increases in the prevalence of resistance to pyrethroids and DDT across Sub-Saharan Africa from 2005-2017 as well as substantial spatial variation in resistance trends.",

    "abstract": "Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic and progressive subcutaneous mycosis caused mainly by the fungus Fonsecaea pedrosoi. The infection is characterized by erythaematous papules and the histological sections demonstrating an external layer of fibrous tissue and an internal layer of thick granulomatous inflammatory tissue containing mainly macrophages and neutrophils. Several groups have been studying the roles of the innate and adaptive immune systems in F. pedrosoi infection; however, few studies have focused on the role of neutrophils in this infection. In the current study, we verified the importance of murine neutrophils in the killing of F. pedrosoi conidia and hyphae. We demonstrate that phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species during infection with conidia are TLR-2 and TLR-4-dependent and are essentials for conidial killing. Meanwhile, hyphal killing occurs by NETs formation, in a TLR-2, TLR-4 and ROS-independent manner. In vivo experiments showed that TLR-2 and TLR-4 are also important in Chromoblastomycosis infection. TLR-2KO and TLR-4KO animals had lower levels of MIP-2 and KC chemokines and impaired neutrophil migration to the infected site. These animals also had higher fungal loads during infection with F. pedrosoi conidia, confirming that TLR-2 and TLR-4 are essential receptors for F. pedrosoi recognition and immune system activation. Therefore, this study demonstrated for the first time that neutrophils activation during F. pedrosoi is conidial or hyphal-specific, with TLR-2 and TLR-4 being essential during conidial infection but unnecessary for hyphal killing by neutrophils\n\nAuthor SummaryChromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic and progressive subcutaneous mycosis that affects mainly low-income individuals, such as farm workers. CBM have been diagnosed all over the world, but the majority of cases were diagnosed in tropical and subtropical climate countries. The treatment is difficult and involves the combination of antifungal prescriptions, cryo/heat-therapy and, in some cases, surgery to remove all the infected tissue. The treatment is long (at least 6 months) and expensive, leading to a high rate of treatment dropout and disease relapse. However, the understanding of pathogen-host interaction is far from being elucitaded. Our understanding is that this pathogen-host interaction in CBM needs to be uncovered so a different and more effective treatment could be proposed to help those patients that are struggling against this chronic infection. Therefore, our study shed a light in neutrophils and innate immune response against this fungal infection, showing the neutrophils capacity to kill Fonsecaea pedrosoi conidia and hifa, showing the importance of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 in the neutrophil fungicidal capacity against F. pedrosoi conidia but not hyphae. Therefore this work help to the better understanding of how our organism fights back in the CBM infection.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphological defects underlie neurodevelopmental disorders and functional defects. We identified a function for ribosomal protein SA (Rpsa) in regulating neuromorphogenesis using in utero electroporation to knockdown Rpsa, which results in apical dendrite misorientation, fewer/shorter extensions with decreased arborization, and decreased spine density with altered spine morphology. We investigated Rpsas ligand, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and interacting partner on the plasma membrane, Integrin subunit 6 (Itga6). Rpsa, PEDF, and Itga6 knockdown cause similar phenotypes, with Rpsa and Itga6 overexpression rescuing morphological defects in PEDF deficient neurons in vivo. Additionally, Itga6 overexpression increases and stabilizes Rpsa expression on the plasma membrane by preventing ubiquitination of Rpsa. GCaMP6s was used to functionally analyze Rpsa knockdown via ex vivo calcium imaging. Rpsa deficient neurons showed less fluctuation in fluorescence intensity, suggesting defective sub-threshold calcium signaling. Our study identifies a role for PEDF-Rpsa-Itga6 signaling in neuromorphogenesis, thus implicating these molecules in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders and identifying them as potential therapeutic candidates.",

    "abstract": "The SORL1 gene encodes for the protein SorLA, a sorting receptor involved in retromer-related endosomal traffic. Many SORL1 genetic variants increase Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, and rare loss-of-function truncation mutations have been found to be causal of late-onset AD. SORL1 is expressed in neurons and glia of the central nervous system and loss of SORL1 has been reported in AD tissue. To model the causal loss-of-function mutations, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete SORL1 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to test the hypothesis that loss of SORL1 contributes to AD pathogenesis by leading to endosome dysfunction. We report that loss of SORL1 in hiPSC-derived neurons leads to early endosome enlargement, a cellular phenotype that is indicative of  traffic jams and is now considered a hallmark cytopathology AD. We validate defects in neuronal endosomal traffic by showing decreased localization of amyloid-precursor protein (APP) in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and increased localization of APP in early endosomes, a site of APP cleavage by the {beta} secretase BACE1. Microglia, immune cells of the CNS, which play a role in AD pathology also express SORL1. We therefore tested and found no effect of SORL1 depletion on endosome size or morphology in hiPSC-derived microglia, suggesting a selective effect on neuronal endosomal trafficking. Finally, because BACE1 dependent APP fragments can cause endosome enlargement, we treated SORL1 deficient hiPSC-derived neurons with BACE1 inhibitors and demonstrate that endosome enlargement occurs independent of amyloidogenic APP fragments. Collectively, these findings clarify where and how SORL1 links to AD. Moreover, our data, together with recent findings, underscores how sporadic AD pathways that regulate endosomal trafficking, and autosomal-dominant AD pathways that regulate APP cleavage, independently converge on the defining cytopathology of AD.",
