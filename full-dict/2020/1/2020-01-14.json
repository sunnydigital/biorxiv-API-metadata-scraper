    "abstract": "The essential problem in visual detection is separating an object from its background. Whether in nature or human conflict, camouflage aims to make the problem harder, while conspicuous signals (e.g. for warning or mate attraction) require the opposite. Our goal is to provide a reliable method for identifying the hardest and easiest to find patterns, for any given environment. The problem is challenging because the parameter space provided by varying natural scenes and potential patterns is vast. Here we successfully solve the problem using deep learning with genetic algorithms and illustrate our solution by identifying appropriate patterns in two environments. To show the generality of our approach, we do so for both trichromatic and dichromatic visual systems. Patterns were validated using human participants; those identified as the best camouflage were significantly harder to find than a widely adopted military camouflage pattern, while those identified as most conspicuous were significantly easier than other patterns. Our method, dubbed the  Camouflage Machine, will be a useful tool for those interested in identifying the most effective patterns in a given context.",

    "abstract": "Whilst an African origin for Anatomically Modern Humans is well established 1, the timings of their expansions into Eurasia are the subject to heated debate, due to the scarcity of fossils and the lack of suitably old ancient DNA 2. Here, we estimate potential timings and routes out of Africa by deriving anthropologically and ecologically plausible precipitation requirements for human existence, and applying them to high-resolution palaeoclimate reconstructions for the past 300k years. We find that exit routes and timings previously suggested based on archaeological and genetic evidence coincide precisely with the presence of sufficiently wet corridors into Eurasia, while the gaps between the proposed exit timings co-occur with periods of insufficient rainfall. This demonstrates the key role that palaeoclimatic conditions played for out-of-Africa expansions. The challenging environmental conditions outside of Africa that occurred between windows of potential contact, coupled with the lack of a demographic rescue effect from migration and possible competition with other hominins, likely explain the demise of early colonists prior to the large-scale colonisation of the world beginning from [~]65kya.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major class of conserved non-coding RNAs that have a wide range of functions during development and disease. Biogenesis of canonical miRNAs depend on the cytoplasmic processing of pre-miRNAs to mature miRNAs by the Dicer endoribonuclease. Once mature miRNAs are generated, the miRNA-induced silencing complex, or miRISC, incorporates one strand of miRNAs as a template for recognizing complementary target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to dictate post-transcriptional gene expression. Besides regulating miRNA biogenesis, Dicer is also part of miRISC to assist in activation of the complex. Dicer associates with other regulatory miRISC co-factors such as trans-activation responsive RNA-binding protein (Tarbp2) to regulate miRNA-based RNA interference. Although the functional role of miRNAs within epidermal keratinocytes have been extensively studied within embryonic and post-natal mouse skin, its contribution to the normal function of hair follicle bulge stem cells (BSCs) during post-natal hair follicle development is unknown. With this question in mind, we sought to ascertain whether Dicer-Tarpb2 plays a functional role within BSCs during induced anagen development by utilizing conditional knockout mouse models. Our findings suggest that Dicer, but not Tarbp2, functions within BSCs to regulate induced anagen (growth) development of post-natal hair follicles. These findings strengthen our understanding of miRNA-dependency within hair follicle cells to define a boundary for post-transcriptional gene regulation during anagen development.",

Here, we test whether changes in beta frequency are related to the preparation of adapted movements in human, and whether such effects generalise to other species (cat). Eleven healthy adult humans performed a joystick visuomotor adaptation task. Beta (15-25Hz) scalp EEG signals recorded over the motor cortex during a pre-movement preparatory phase were, on average, significantly reduced in amplitude during early adaptation trials compared to baseline or late adaptation trials (p=0.01). The changes in beta were not related to measurements of reaction time or duration of the reach. We also recorded LFP activity within the primary motor cortex of three cats during a prism visuomotor adaptation task. Analysis of these signals revealed similar reductions in motor cortical LFP beta frequencies during early adaptation. This effect was also present when controlling for any influence of the reaction time and reaching duration. Overall, the results are consistent with a reduction in pre-movement beta oscillations predicting an increase in adaptive drive in upcoming task performance when motor errors are largest in magnitude and the rate of adaptation is greatest.",

We studied whether effective connectivity changes with significantly modified melody, between bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFGs) and Heschls gyri (HGs) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Among the 12 connectivities, the connectivity from the left IFG to the right HG was consistently increased with significantly modified melody compared to the original melody in 2 separate sets of the same rhythmic pattern with different melody (p = 0.005 and 0.034, Bonferroni corrected).

    "abstract": "For flightless arboreal arthropods, moving from the understory into tree canopies is cognitively and energetically challenging because vegetational structures present complex three-dimensional landscapes with substantial gaps. Predation risk and wind-induced perturbations in the canopy may further impede the movement process. In the Australian stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, first-instar nymphs hatch on the forest floor and disperse toward tree canopies in the daytime. Here, we address such vertical movements and associated sensory cues in E. tiaratum nymphs. Newly hatched nymphs ascend with high endurance, travelling >100 m within 60 minutes. Navigation toward open canopies is underpinned by negative gravitaxis, positive phototaxis, and visual responses to vertically oriented contrast patterns. Nymphal E. tiaratum also use directed jumping to cross air gaps, and respond to tactile stimulation and potential threat with a self-dropping reflex, resulting aerial descent. Post-hatch dispersal in E. tiaratum thus consists of visually mediated displacement both on vegetational structures and in the air; within the latter context, gliding is then an effective mechanism enabling recovery after predator- and perturbation-induced descent. These results further support the importance of a diurnal niche, in addition to the arboreal spatial niche, in the evolution of gliding in wingless arboreal invertebrates.\n\nSummary statementTo effectively disperse into canopies, ground-hatched stick insects use gravity and visual cues to navigate during midday, jump to cross air gaps and respond to threat or perturbation with self-dropping.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how plant-associated microbial communities assemble and the roles they play in plant performance are major goals in microbial ecology. For nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, assemblages are mostly determined by filtering by the host as well as abiotic soil conditions. However, for legumes adapted to highly variable environments and nutrient-poor soils, filtering out rhizobial partners may not be an effective strategy to ensure symbiotic benefits. As a consequence, this can lead to net increases in rhizobial diversity driven by stochastic (neutral) assembly processes. Here, we addressed whether symbiotic promiscuity of rooibos (Aspalathus linearis Burm. Dahlgren), reflects increases in rhizobial diversity that are independent of the environmental conditions, following a neutral assembly. We performed a common garden experiment to assess whether root system size and location- and habitat-specific rhizobial propagule pools of rooibos affected rhizobial community diversity and composition. We found a dominance of drift in driving taxonomic turnover in the root nodule communities, but operating at different scales in the dominant Mesorhizobium symbionts and the rest of bacterial taxa. Specifically, drift triggered differentiation between the core rhizobial symbionts of rooibos due to dispersal limitation on a regional scale, whereas it dominated the assembly of non-dominant rhizobial taxa at the root level. This suggests the existence of a significant neutral component in rhizobial community assembly when selectivity by the host plant is low. We conclude that in this promiscuous legume neutral processes govern bacterial community root nodule community assembly, but that these operate at different scales in dominant and rare rhizobial symbionts of the plant.",

This scoping meta-analysis aggregates normative reference values for BV and three related volumetrics--gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV) and cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSFV)--from typically-aging adults studied cross-sectionally using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Drawing from an aggregate sample of 9,473 adults, this study provides (A) regression coefficients {beta} describing the age-dependent trajectories of volumetric measures by sex within the range from 20 to 70 years based on both linear and quadratic models, and (B) average values for BV, GMV, WMV and CSFV at the representative ages of 20 (young age), 45 (middle age) and 70 (old age). The results provided synthesize [~]20 years of brain volumetrics research and allow one to estimate BV at any age between 20 and 70. Importantly, however, such estimates should be used and interpreted with caution because they depend on MRI hardware specifications (e.g. scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength), data acquisition parameters (e.g. spatial resolution, weighting), and brain segmentation algorithms. Guidelines are proposed to facilitate future meta- and mega-analyses of brain volumetrics.\n\nDisclosure statementThe author declares that he has no actual or potential conflicts of interest.",

    "abstract": "Collective decisions can emerge from individual-level interactions between members of a group. These interactions are often seen as social feedback rules, whereby individuals copy the decisions they observe others making, creating a coherent group decision. The benefit of these behavioural rules to the individual agent can be understood as a transfer of information, whereby a focal individual learns about the world by gaining access to the information possessed by others. Previous studies have analysed this exchange of information by assuming that all agents share common goals. While differences in information and differences in preferences have often been conflated, little is known about how differences between agents underlying preferences affects the use and efficacy of social information. In this paper I develop a model of social information use by rational agents with differing preferences, and demonstrate that the resulting collective behaviour is strongly dependent on the structure of preference sharing within the group, as well as the quality of information in the environment. In particular, I show that strong social responses are expected by individuals that are habituated to noisy, uncertain environments where private information about the world is relatively weak. Furthermore, by investigating heterogeneous group structures I demonstrate a potential influence of cryptic minority subgroups that may illuminate the empirical link between personality and leadership.",

    "abstract": "Certain facultative anaerobes such as the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can respire on nitrate, a process generally known as denitrification. This enables denitrifying bacteria to survive in anoxic environments and contributes e.g. to the formation of biofilm, hence increasing difficulties in eradicating P. aeruginosa infections. A central step in denitrification is the reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide by nitrite reductase NirS, an enzyme that requires the unique cofactor heme d1. While heme d1 biosynthesis is mostly understood, the role of the essential periplasmatic protein NirF in this pathway remains unclear. Here, we have determined crystal structures of NirF and its complex with dihydroheme d1, the last intermediate of heme d1 biosynthesis. We found that NirF forms a bottom-to-bottom {beta}-propeller homodimer and confirmed this by multi-angle light and small-angle X-ray scattering. The N-termini are immediately neighbored and project away from the core structure, which hints at simultaneous membrane anchoring via both N-termini. Further, the complex with dihydroheme d1 allowed us to probe the importance of specific residues in the vicinity of the ligand binding site, revealing residues not required for binding or stability of NirF but essential for denitrification in experiments with complemented mutants of a {Delta}nirF strain of P. aeruginosa. Together, these data implicate that NirF possesses a yet unknown enzymatic activity and is not simply a binding protein of heme d1 derivatives.",

Although several factors have been described to influence human access (such as presence of roads, rivers, airports and cities), quantifying their specific and combined effects on recorded occurrence data remains challenging. Here we present sampbias, an algorithm and software for quantifying the effect of accessibility biases in species occurrence datasets. Sampbias uses a Bayesian approach to estimate how sampling rates vary as a function of proximity to one or multiple bias factors. The results are comparable among bias factors and datasets. We demonstrate the use of sampbias on a dataset of mammal occurrences from the island of Borneo, showing a high biasing effect of cities and a moderate effect of roads and airports. Sampbias is implemented as a well-documented, open-access and user-friendly R package that we hope will become a standard tool for anyone working with species occurrences in ecology, evolution, conservation and related fields.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationships between organisms and their environments is increasingly important given human impacts on global conditions. However, predicting how community diversity and composition will change in the future remains challenging (Mouquet et al 2015). One recent approach is to use traits to mechanistically inform how environmental conditions affect performance (i.e., trait-environment relationships), under the assumptions that these measures relate to each other in predictive and general ways. Unfortunately, results have been inconsistent, ignore phenotypic plasticity, and rely heavily on observational data (Shipley et al 2016). We evaluated the predictability and generality of trait-environment relationships in a controlled experimental microcosm system of four daphniid species. We cultured each species along a stressful gradient (conspecific density), measuring performance (fecundity) and traits related to performance (body length, 2nd antenna length, eye diameter, relative growth rate, and age at first reproduction). Using structural equation models, we evaluated the role of traits in mediating changes in individual fecundity in response to conspecific density. We built models for each species separately considering within-species trait variation, and for all species together by considering all trait variation across the four species. Results from this controlled system highlight that the relationship between individual traits and the environment (conspecific density) is strong and predictive of performance (fecundity), both within- and across-species. However, the specific trait-environment relationships which predicted fecundity differed for each species and differed from the relationships observed in the interspecific model, suggesting a lack of generality. These results will inform and improve the use of traits as a tool for predicting how changing environments will impact species abundances and distributions.",

To further quantify the association of domain segregation with gene regulation and differentiation, we analyzed in this study the distribution of genes of different tissue specificities along the linear genome, and found that the distribution patterns are distinctly different in forests and prairies. The tissue-specific genes (TSGs) are significantly enriched in the latter but not in the former and genes of similar expression profiles among different cell types (co-activation/repression) also tend to cluster in specific prairies. We then analyzed the correlation between gene expression and the spatial contact revealed in Hi-C measurement. Tissue-specific forest-prairie contact formation was found to correlate with the regulation of the TSGs, in particular those in the prairie domains, pointing to the important role gene positioning, in the linear DNA sequence as well as in 3D chromatin structure, plays in gene regulatory network formation.",

    "abstract": "Genotype and phenotype are two themes of modern biology. While the running principles in genotype has been well understood (e.g., DNA double helix structure, genetic code, central dogma, etc.), much less is known about the rules in phenotype. In this study we examine a yeast phenotype space that is represented by 405 quantitative traits. We show that the space is convergent with limited latent dimensions, which form surprisingly long-distance chains such that all traits are interconnected with each other. As a consequence, statistically uncorrelated traits are linearly dependent in the multi-dimensional phenotype space and can be precisely inferred from each other. Meanwhile, the performance is much poorer for similar trait inferences but from the genotype space (including DNA and mRNA), highlighting the dimension stratification between genotype space and phenotype space. Since the world were living is primarily phenotypic and what we truly care is phenotype, these findings call for phenotype-centered biology as a complement for the cross-space genetic thinking in current biology.",

Severity of rotaviral diarrhoea among children is primarily manifested by different combinations of G and P types. Rotavirus surveillance studies resulted in two ambitious globally licensed vaccine namely, Rotarix and RotaTaq and a few other. However, post-vaccination surveillance studies indicate, vaccine failure and other complications such as intussusception, environmental enteric dysfunction, etc. Herein, we design a multivalent DNA vaccine against rotavirus and tested its efficiency by using in silico tools. Two main neutralizing rotaviral antigens i.e, VP7 and VP8 were taken into account and respectively 390, 450 known sequences of different serogroup have been analyzed to obtain a consensus sequence for epitope prediction. Epitopes specific for MHC-I and -II were predicted using IEDB and chosen based on their best IC50 value and CPR. A good binding profile with a monoclonal antibody specific for B-cell antigens is displayed by all epitopes they were found to be non-allergenic in the human host. Ethnic specificity of the epitopes is also within acceptable range except for South African and Central American populations. We use pBI-CMV1 bidirectional mammalian expression vector to design the DNA vaccine, where we stapled manually integrated epitopes for VP7 and VP8 at MCS1 and 2 respectively. In conclusion, this study provides a new set of data for a new DNA vaccine against rotavirus.",

Sequencing the whole genome of the pathogen(s) in a clinical sample offers one way to improve clinical microbiology diagnostic services, and has already been adopted for tuberculosis in some countries. A key weakness of a genetics clinical microbiology is it cannot return a result for rare or novel genetic variants and therefore predictive methods are required. Non-synonymous mutations in the S. aureus dfrB gene can be successfully classified as either conferring resistance (or not) by calculating their effect on the binding free energy of the antibiotic, trimethoprim. The underlying approach, alchemical free energy methods, requires large numbers of molecular dynamics simulations to be run.\n\nWe show that a large number (N=15) of binding free energies calculated from a series of very short (50 ps) molecular dynamics simulations are able to satisfactorily classify all seven mutations in our clinically-derived testset. A result for a single mutation could therefore be returned in less than an hour, thereby demonstrating that this or similar methods are now sufficiently fast and reproducible for clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is strongly associated with the progression of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite intensive study, the detailed mechanisms leading to HBV induced liver disease have not been fully elucidated. Previously, we reported a mosaic distribution of viral antigens and nucleic acids at single-cell level in liver tissues of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and proposed a  three-stage model of HBV infection in vivo. Here, we explored whether the different stages at cellular level is functionally linked with fibrogenesis. We observed a tight spatial relationship between the invasion of collagen fibers and transitions from S-rich to DNA-rich stage. While S-rich cells mainly localized within minimally fibrotic tissue, DNA-rich cells were often closely surrounded by a milieu of stiffened extracellular matrix (ECM). cDNA microarray and subsequent validation analyses revealed that S-rich cells manifested elevated ribosomal proteins and oxidative phosphorylation genes in a disease phase-dependent manner. On the other hand, DNA-rich cells exhibited gradually deteriorated expression of hepatocyte-specific antigen and transcriptional regulator in parallel with the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Finally, during fibrogenesis, inflammatory genes such as IP-10 were found to be expressed in both portal infiltrated cells and surrounding parenchymal cells which resulted in suppressed antigen expression. Taken together, we propose that liver inflammation and accompanying fibrogenesis is spatially and functionally linked with the transition of virological stages at cellular level. These transitions occur possibly due to an altered hepatocyte transcription profile in response to a transformed ECM environment. The collective viral and host activities shape the histological alterations and progression of liver disease during CHB infection.",

    "abstract": "A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least one month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested through a short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis and selection experiment with wild-type (CC-5082) and cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and nonsynonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest modification of signal transduction and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is associated with the onset of Alzheimers Disease (AD) and involves a complex kinetic pathway as monomers self-assemble into fibrils. A central feature of amyloid fibrils is the existence of multiple structural polymorphs, which complicates the development of disease-relevant structure-function relationships. Developing these relationships requires new methods to control fibril structure. In this work, we demonstrate that mesoporous silicas (SBA-15) functionalized with hydrophobic (SBA-PFDTS) and hydrophilic groups (SBA-PEG) direct the aggregation kinetics and resulting structure of A{beta}1-40 fibrils. The hydrophilic SBA-PEG had little effect on amyloid kinetics while as-synthesized and hydrophobic SBA-PFDTS accelerated aggregation kinetics. Subsequently, we quantified the relative population of fibril structures formed in the presence of each material using electron microscopy. Fibrils formed from A{beta}1-40 exposed to SBA-PEG were structurally similar to control fibrils. In contrast, A{beta}1-40 incubated with SBA-15 or SBA-PFDTS formed fibrils with shorter cross-over distances that were more structurally representative of fibrils found in AD patient-derived samples. Overall, these results suggest that mesoporous silicas and other exogenous materials are promising scaffolds for the de novo production of specific fibril polymorphs of A{beta}1-40 and other amyloidogenic proteins.\n\nSignificance StatementA major challenge in understanding the progression of Alzheimers Disease lies in the various fibril structures, or polymorphs, adopted by Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}). Heterogenous fibril populations may be responsible for different disease phenotypes and growing evidence suggests that A{beta} fibrils formed in vitro are structurally distinct from patient-derived fibrils. To help bridge this gap, we used surface-functionalized mesoporous silicas to influence the formation of A{beta}1-40 fibrils and evaluated the distribution of resulting fibril polymorphs using electron microscopy (EM). We found that silicas modified with hydrophobic surfaces resulted in fibril populations with shorter cross-over distances that are more representative of A{beta} fibrils observed ex vivo. Overall, our results indicate that mesoporous silicas may be leveraged for the production of specific A{beta} polymorphs.",

Clostridium ljungdahlii, one of such microorganisms, has as main fermentation products acetate and ethanol. Multiple research efforts have been directed towards understanding how the metabolism and the product formation of this, and other acetogenic bacteria, can be directed towards increasing productivities and yields; nonetheless, transferring those findings to a particular set-up can prove challenging. This study used a well-established and robust fed-batch fermentation system with C. ljungdahlii to look into the effects of different fermentation pH profiles, gas flow, and the supplementation with additional yeast extract or cysteine on growth, product formation ratios, yields, and productivities, as well as gas consumption. Neither yeast extract nor cysteine supplementation had a noticeable impact on cell growth, product formation or overall gas consumption. The lowering of the pH proved mainly detrimental, with decreased productivities and no improvement in ethanol ratios. The most notable shift towards ethanol was achieved by the combination of lowering both the pH and the gas flow after 24 h, but with the caveat of lower productivity. The obtained results, unexpected to some extent, highlight the necessity for a better understanding of the physiology and the metabolic regulation of acetogenic bacteria in order for this process to become more industrially relevant.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an automatically controlled angiogenic inhibition therapy where the variation profile of the inhibitory agent is generated by a control law that is derived using a back-stepping based control methodology. The angiogenic inhibition is described by a second order model representing the dynamics of tumor and supporting vasculature volumes. Backstepping control recursively stabilizes that dynamics and generates automatic control laws that allows the tumor volume to stay at a desired value. The desired value will be kept at one thousandth of its initial value. This will lead to a very small injection at the steady state. This is important as zero injection may lead to regrow of the tumor. The results will be presented in tabular and graphical forms. Tabular results present the variation of maximum injection rate and setup time. Graphical results present the variation of tumor and supporting vasculature volumes, injection rate and the tracking error between the reference and actual tumor volumes. In addition, we will also perform a simulation to test the capability of the closed loop to accomodate the parametric uncertainties in the rate constants. The uncertainties are represented by a random deviation in the range {+/-}10% times the nominal value of the effected parameter. The control laws will be kept the same and the simulations will be repeated by 1000 times and each result will be superimposed on the graph. The area occupied by the curves will show the relative capability of the designs.",

    "abstract": "The exploration of mechanisms that enable species coexistence under competition for a sole limiting resource is widespread across ecology. Two examples of such facilitative processes are intraspecific competition and spatial self-organisation. These processes determine the outcome of competitive dynamics in many resource-limited patterned ecosystems, classical examples of which include dryland vegetation patterns, intertidal mussel beds and Sub-alpine ribbon forests. Previous theoretical investigations have explained coexistence within patterned ecosystems by making strong assumptions on the differences between species (e.g. contrasting dispersal behaviours or different functional responses to resource availability). In this paper, I show that the interplay between the detrimental effects of intraspecific competition and the facilitative nature of self-organisation forms a coexistence mechanism that does not rely on species-specific assumptions and captures coexistence across a wide range of the environmental stress gradient. I use a theoretical model that captures the interactions of two generic consumer species with an explicitly modelled resource to show that coexistence relies on a balance between species colonisation abilities and their local competitiveness, provided intraspecific competition is sufficiently strong. Crucially, the requirements on species self-limitation for coexistence to occur differ on opposite ends of the resource input spectrum. For low resource levels, coexistence is facilitated by strong intraspecific dynamics of the species superior in its colonisation abilities, but for larger volumes of resource input, strong intraspecific competition of the locally superior species enables coexistence. Results presented in this paper also highlight the importance of hysteresis in understanding tipping points, in particular extinction events. Finally, the theoretical framework provides insights into spatial species distributions within single patches, supporting verbal hypotheses on co-existence of herbaceous and woody species in dryland vegetation patterns and suggesting potential empirical tests in the context of other patterned ecosystems.",

The structure of the simulated population aimed to mimic an aquaculture breeding program. Twenty discrete generations were simulated, considering 50 families and 2,000 offspring per generation, and a trait with a heritability of 0.3. OCS and MS were applied using a differential evolution (DE) algorithm, under an objective function that accounted for genetic merit, inbreeding of the future progeny and coancestry among selection candidates. For OCS, the optimization process consisted of selection based on optimum contribution followed by minimum inbreeding mating. Objective functions using different weights on coancestry were tested. For each application, 20 replicates were simulated and the results were compared based on their average. Both strategies, OCS and MS, were very effective in controlling inbreeding over the generations. In the short-term, MS was more efficient than OCS in controlling inbreeding under the same genetic gain. In the long-term, OCS and MS resulted in similar genetic progress and average inbreeding, under the same penalty on coancestry.",

Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) to capture the inherited susceptibility of obesity were calculated using summary statistics from independent genome-wide association studies of BMI. Gene-environment interactions of the PRS with sociodemographic (European region, socioeconomic status) and lifestyle factors (diet, screen time, physical activity) were estimated.\n\nResultsThe PRS was strongly associated with BMI (r2 = 0.11, p-value = 7.9 x 10-81) and waist circumference (r2 = 0.09, p-value = 1.8 x 10-71) in our cohort. The associations with BMI increased from r2=0.03 in 3-year olds to r2=0.18 in 14-year olds and associations with waist circumference from r2=0.03 to r2=0.14. Being in the top decile of the PRS distribution was associated with 3.63 times higher odds for obesity (95% confidence interval (CI): [2.57, 5.14]). We observed significant interactions with demographic and lifestyle factors for BMI as well as waist circumference.

Furthermore, the risk was attenuated by a higher intake of dietary fiber (BMI: p-interaction=0.0082) and shorter screen times (BMI: p-interaction=0.018).\n\nConclusionsOur results highlight that a healthy childhood environment might partly offset a genetic predisposition to obesity during childhood and adolescence.",

Heat-treatment, however, promotes the formation of so-called Amadori rearrangement products (ARPs), such as fructoselysine.

Here we use bioinformatics combined with molecular and biochemical analyses and show that in E. coli, fructoselysine metabolism is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level. The global regulator Crp (CAP), as well as the alternative sigma factor {sigma}32 (RpoH) contribute to promoter activation at high cAMP-levels and heat stress, respectively. In addition, we identified and characterized a transcriptional regulator FrlR, encoded adjacent to frlABCD, as fructoselysine-6-phosphate specific roadblock repressor.

Their interplay is a perfect adaptation strategy to efficiently utilize fructoselysine within the human gut environment.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/904318v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15bbc3borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a2e3eforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12261c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@412c7e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Enteric parasitic infections are among the most prevalent infections in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and have a profound impact on global public health. While the microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of gut health and human development, the impact of naturally-acquired parasite infections on microbial community structure in the gut, and the extent to which parasite-induced changes in the microbiome may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms, is poorly understood. Enteric parasites are routinely identified in companion animals in the United States, presenting a unique opportunity to leverage this animal model to investigate the impact of naturally-acquired parasite infections on the microbiome. Clinical, parasitological, and microbiome profiling of a cohort of 258 dogs revealed a significant correlation between parasite infection and composition of the bacterial community in the gut. Relative to other enteric pathogens, Giardia was associated with a more pronounced perturbation of the microbiome. Using a database mining approach that allowed us to compare our findings to a large-scale epidemiological study of enteric diseases in humans, we also observed a substantial alteration to microbiome structure in Giardia-infected children. Importantly, infection was associated with a reduction in the relative abundance of potential pathobionts, including Gammaproteobacteria, and an increase in Prevotella - a profile often associated with gut health. Taken together, our data show that widespread Giardia infection in young animals and humans is associated with significant remodeling of the gut microbiome, and provide a possible explanation for the high prevalence of asymptomatic Giardia infections observed across host species.\n\nImportanceWhile enteric parasitic infections are among the most important infections in lower- and middle-income countries, their impact on gut microbiota is poorly understood. We reasoned that clinical symptoms associated with these infections may be influenced by alterations of the microbiome that occur during infection. To explore this notion, we took a two-pronged approach. First, we studied a cohort of dogs naturally infected with various enteric parasites and found a strong association between parasite infection and altered gut microbiota composition. Giardia, one of the most prevalent parasite infections globally, had a particularly large impact on the microbiome. Second, we took a database-driven strategy to integrate microbiome data with clinical data from large human field studies and found that Giardia infection is also associated with marked alteration of the gut microbiome of children, suggesting a possible explanation for why Giardia has been reported to be associated with protection from moderate-to-severe diarrhea.",

    "abstract": "The decoy exon model has been proposed to regulate a subset of intron retention (IR) events involving predominantly larger introns (>1kb). Splicing reporter studies have shown that decoy splice sites are essential for activity, suggesting that decoys act by engaging intron-terminal splice sites and competing with cross-intron interactions required for intron excision. The decoy model predicts that antisense oligonucleotides blocking decoy splice sites in endogenous pre-mRNA should increase productive gene expression by reducing IR. Indeed, we now demonstrate that targeting a decoy 5' splice site in the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) gene reduced IR from [~]80% to [~]20% in primary human erythroblasts, accompanied by increases in spliced OGT RNA and OGT protein expression. The remaining OGT IR was refractory to antisense treatment and might be mediated by independent mechanism(s). In contrast, other retained introns were strongly dependent on decoy function, since IR was nearly eliminated by antisense targeting of 5' splice sites. Genes in the latter group encode the widely expressed splicing factor (SF3B1), and the erythroid-specific structural protein, alpha-spectrin (SPTA1). These results show that modulating decoy exon function can dramatically alter IR, and suggest that dynamic regulation of decoy exons could be a mechanism to fine tune gene expression post-transcriptionally in many cell types.",

    "abstract": "Factor VIII (FVIII) is the coagulation factor deficient in hemophilia A, which is treated by protein replacement. Unfortunately, this regimen is costly due to the expense of producing recombinant FVIII as a consequence of its low level secretion. FVIII expression activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, causes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis. Importantly, little is known about the factors that cause protein misfolding and aggregation in metazoans. Here we identified intrinsic and extrinsic factors that cause FVIII to form aggregates in the ER. We show that FVIII forms amyloid-like fibrils within the ER upon increased FVIII synthesis or inhibition of glucose metabolism. Significantly, FVIII amyloids can be dissolved upon restoration of glucose metabolism to produce functional secreted FVIII. Two ER chaperones and their co-chaperones, BiP and CANX/CRT, promote FVIII solubility in the ER, where the former is also required for disaggregation. A short aggregation motif in the FVIII A1 domain (termed Aggron) is necessary and sufficient to seed {beta}-sheet polymerization and BiP binding to this Aggron prevents amyloidogenesis. Our findings provide novel insight into mechanisms that limit FVIII secretion and ER protein folding in general and have implication for ongoing hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials.\n\nKey Points- FVIII forms amyloid aggregates in the ER that are dissolved in a chaperone- and glucose-dependent manner to produce secreted active FVIII.\n- A short amino acid sequence in the A1 domain causes {beta} sheet polymerization and ER chaperone BiP binding to this site prevents aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Mastermind proteins are required for transcription of Notch target genes, yet the molecular basis for mastermind function remains incompletely understood. Previous work has shown that Notch can induce transcriptional responses by binding to promoters, but more often by binding to enhancers, with HES4 and DTX1 as representative mammalian examples of promoter and enhancer responsiveness, respectively. Here, we show that mastermind dependence of the Notch response at these loci is differentially encoded in Jurkat T-ALL cells. Knockout of Mastermind-like1 (MAML1) eliminates Notch responsive activation of both these genes, and reduced target gene expression is accompanied by a decrease in H3K27 acetylation, consistent with the importance of MAML1 for p300 activity. Add-back of defined MAML1 constructs in knockout cells identifies residues 151-350 of MAML1 as essential for expression of either Notch-responsive gene. Fusion of the Notch-binding region of MAML1 to the HAT domain of p300 rescues expression of HES4 but not DTX1, suggesting that an additional activity of MAML1 is needed for gene induction at a distance. Together, these studies establish the functional importance of the MAML1151-350 region for Notch-dependent transcriptional induction, and reveal differential requirements for MAML1-dependent recruitment activities at different Notch responsive loci, highlighting the molecular complexity of NTC-stimulated transcription.",

Subjects completed an associative learning task in which objects were paired with faces. Critically, the objects consisted of pairs that were identical except for their color values, which were parametrically varied in order to manipulate interference. Performance on associative memory tests confirmed that color similarity robustly influenced interference. Separate tests of color memory showed that high similarity triggered a repulsion of long-term memories, wherein remembered colors were biased away from colors of competing objects. This repulsion effect was replicated across three experiments. In a fourth experiment, the repulsion effect was fully eliminated when task demands promoted integration, instead of discrimination, of similar memories. Finally, we show that repulsion of color memory was highly adaptive: greater repulsion was associated with less memory interference. These findings reveal that similarity between events triggers adaptive distortions in how events are remembered.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONThree supplementary figures are included.",

    "abstract": "Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons are major regulators of adult experience-dependent plasticity. Acute manipulation of PV+ cell activity before learning alters the rate of acquisition of new skills, whereas transient inactivation of PV+ cells interferes with retrieval of previously learned information. However, the effects of sustained PV+ cell manipulation throughout training remain largely unknown. Using chemogenetics in rat auditory cortex during an adaptive sound disrimination task, here we show that PV+ cells exert bidirectional control over the rate of perceptual learning. Down-regulation of PV+ cell activity accelerated learning, but increasing their activity resulted in slower learning. However, both interventions led to reduced gains in perceptual acuity by the end of training relative to controls. Furthermore, longitudinal training performance was functionally correlated with measures of neural synchrony and stimulus-specific adaptation. These findings suggest that, whereas restricting PV+ cell activity may initially facilitate training-induced plasticity, a subsequent increase in PV+ cell activity is necessary to prevent further plastic changes and consolidate learning.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant regulation of metabolic kinases by altered redox homeostasis is a major contributing factor in aging and disease such as diabetes. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which metabolic kinases are regulated under oxidative stress is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of a conserved family of Fructosamine-3-kinases (FN3Ks), which are evolutionarily related to eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs), are regulated by redox-active cysteines in the kinase domain. By solving the crystal structure of FN3K homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFN3K), we demonstrate that it forms an unexpected strand-exchange dimer in which the ATP binding P-loop and adjoining beta strands are swapped between two chains in the dimer. This dimeric configuration is characterized by strained inter-chain disulfide bonds that stabilize the P-loop in an extended conformation. Mutational analysis and solution studies confirm that the strained disulfides function as redox \"switches\" to reversibly regulate FN3K activity and dimerization. Consistently, we find that human FN3K (HsFN3K), which contains an equivalent P-loop Cys, is also redox-sensitive, whereas ancestral bacterial FN3K homologs, which lack a P-loop Cys, are not. Furthermore, CRISPR knockout of FN3K in human HepG2 cells results in significant upregulation of redox metabolites including glutathione. We propose that redox regulation evolved progressively in FN3Ks in response to changing cellular redox conditions. Our studies provide important new insights into the origin and evolution of redox regulation in the protein kinase superfamily and open new avenues for targeting HsFN3K in diabetic complications.",

    "abstract": "Admixture with archaic hominins has altered the landscape of genomic variation in modern human populations. Several gene regions have been previously identified as candidates of adaptive introgression (AI) that facilitated human adaptation to specific environments. However, simulation-based studies have suggested that population genetics processes other than adaptive mutations, such as heterosis from recessive deleterious variants private to populations before admixture, can also lead to patterns in genomic data that resemble adaptive introgression. The extent to which the presence of deleterious variants affect the false-positive rate and the power of current methods to detect AI has not been fully assessed. Here, we used extensive simulations to show that recessive deleterious mutations can increase the false positive rates of tests for AI compared to models without deleterious variants. We further examined candidates of AI in modern humans identified from previous studies and show that, although deleterious variants may hinder the performance of AI detection in modern humans, most signals remained robust when deleterious variants are included in the null model. While deleterious variants may have a limited impact on detecting signals of adaptive introgression in humans, we found that at least two AI candidate genes, HYAL2 and HLA, are particularly susceptible to high false positive rates due to the recessive deleterious mutations. By quantifying parameters that affect heterosis, we show that the high false positives are largely attributed to the high exon densities together with low recombination rates in the genomic regions, which can further be exaggerated by the population growth in recent human evolution. Although the combination of such parameters is rare in the human genome, caution is still warranted in other species with different genomic composition and demographic histories.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn Gram-negative species, {beta}-lactam antibiotics target penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) resulting in morphological alterations of bacterial cells. Observations of antibiotic-induced cell morphology changes can rapidly and accurately differentiate drug susceptible from resistant bacterial strains; however, resistant cells do not always remain unchanged. Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative, biothreat pathogen and the causative agent of melioidosis, an often fatal infectious disease for humans.\n\nResultsHere, we identified {beta}-lactam targets in B. pseudomallei by in silico analysis. Ten genes encoding putative PBPs, including PBP-1, PBP-2, PBP-3 and PBP-6, were detected in the genomes of susceptible and resistant strains. Real-time, live-cell imaging of B. pseudomallei strains demonstrated dynamic morphological changes in broth containing clinically relevant {beta}-lactam antibiotics. At sub-inhibitory concentrations of ceftazidime (CAZ), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC), and imipenem (IPM), filamentation, varying in length and proportion, was an initial response of the multidrug-resistant strain Bp1651 in exponential phase. However, a dominant morphotype reemerged during stationary phase that resembled cells unexposed to antibiotics. Similar morphology dynamics were observed for AMC-resistant strains, MSHR1655 and 724644, when exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of AMC. For all B. pseudomallei strains evaluated, increased exposure time and exposure to increased concentrations of AMC at and above minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in broth resulted in cell morphology shifts from filaments to spheroplasts and/or cell lysis. B. pseudomallei morphology changes were more consistent in IPM. Spheroplast formation followed by cell lysis was observed for all strains in broth containing IPM at concentrations greater than or equal to MICs, however, the time to cell lysis was variable. Length of B. pseudomallei cells was strain-, drug- and drug concentration-dependent.\n\nConclusionsBoth resistant and susceptible B. pseudomallei strains exhibited filamentation during early exposure to AMC and CAZ at concentrations used to interpret susceptibility (based on CLSI guidelines). While developing a rapid {beta}-lactam antimicrobial susceptibility test based on cell-shape alone requires more extensive analyses, optical microscopy detected B. pseudomallei growth attributes that lend insight into antibiotic response and antibacterial mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "Environments exposed to simultaneously occurring extremes are prevalent in the natural world, yet analysis of such settings tends to focus on the effect of single environmental stresses. In this study, quantitative multiplicative and minimising models previously used to study nutrient limitation were applied to the growth of the hydrothermal vent-dwelling organism Halomonas hydrothermalis when subjected to combined nutrient limitation and NaCl-salt stress. Results showed an interactive effect from both salt and nutrient stresses under optimal conditions. However, the fit became more non-interactive as salinity is increased; at which point NaCl-salt had a more dominating effect on growth than inorganic phosphate (Pi). We discuss biochemical hypotheses to explain these data. This work shows that models developed to understand nutrient limitation can be used to quantify and separate the contributions of stresses under other physical and chemical extremes, such as extreme salinity, and facilitate the development of biochemical hypotheses of how extremes may be influencing cell physiology.\n\nImportanceVery few environments in the natural world are exposed to just one extreme or stress at a time. To understand lifes ability to survive in multiple-extreme environments, we must be able to quantify how different extremes interact. Using methods developed for the study of multiple nutrient limitation, this study uses kinetic growth models to investigate at the effect of extreme environments on bacterial growth. Results show that closer to the extremes of life, individual stresses dominate growth; whereas under optimal conditions there is a multiplicative effect from both salt and nutrient stresses. This approach offers a new way to quantify and potentially understand and develop hypotheses for how life operates under multiple extremes.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a cellular process to clear pathogens. Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S.E) has emerged as one of the most important food-borne pathogens. However, major studies still focus on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Here, we reported that AvrA, a S. Enteritidis effector, inhibited autophagy to promote bacterial survival in the host. We found that AvrA regulates the conversion of LC3 I into LC3 II and the enrichment of lysosomes. Beclin-1, a key molecular regulator of autophagy, was decreased after AvrA expressed strain colonization. In S.E-AvrA--infected cells, we found the increases of protein levels of p-JNK and p-c-Jun and the transcription level of AP-1. AvrA-reduction of Beclin-1 protein expression is through the JNK pathway. The JNK inhibitor abolished the AvrA-reduced Beclin-1 protein expression. Moreover, we identified that the AvrA mutation C186A abolished its regulation of Beclin-1 expression. In addition, AvrA protein interacted with Beclin-1. In organoids and infected mice, we explored the physiologically related effects and mechanism of AvrA in reducing Beclin-1 through the JNK pathway, thus attenuating autophagic responses.\n\nImportanceSalmonella Enteritidis is an important pathogen with a public health concern and farm production risk, yet the host-pathogen interactions that govern the survival of S. Enteritidis infections are incompletely understood. Anti-bacterial autophagy provides potent cell-autonomous immunity against bacterial colonization. Here, we report that a new role for effector AvrA of S. Enteritidis in the reduction of Beclin-1 protein expression through the JNK pathway and the attenuation of the autophagic response in intestinal epithelial cells. This finding not only indicates an important role of S. Enteritidis effector in reducing host protein as a strategy to suppress autophagy, but also suggests manipulating autophagy as a new strategy to treat infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a significant cause of hospital-acquired bacteremia. Herein, the discovery is reported that cardiac microlesions form during severe bacteremic E. faecalis infection in mice. The cardiac microlesions were identical in appearance to those formed by Streptococcus pneumoniae during invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, E. faecalis does not encode the virulence determinants implicated in pneumococcal microlesion formation. Rather, disulfide bond forming protein DsbA was found to be required for E. faecalis virulence in a C. elegans model and was necessary for efficient cardiac microlesion formation. Furthermore, E. faecalis promoted cardiomyocyte apoptotic and necroptotic cell death at sites of microlesion formation. Additionally, loss of DsbA caused an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines unlike the wild-type strain, which suppressed the immune response. In conclusion, we establish that E. faecalis is capable of forming cardiac microlesions and identify features of both the bacterium and the host response that are mechanistically involved.\n\nSUMMARYThis work presents the observation of cardiac microlesion formation during severe blood stream infection with Enterococcus faecalis in mice. Moreover, we identify the contribution of a novel enterococcal virulence determinant in modulating microlesion formation and the host immune response.",

    "abstract": "Hyperpolarization-activated calcium channels (HACCs) are found in the plasma membrane and tonoplast of many plant cell types where they have an important role in Ca2+-dependent signaling. The unusual gating properties of HACCs in plants, i.e., activation by membrane hyperpolarization rather than depolarization, dictates that HACCs are normally open at physiological hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials (the so called pump or P-state), thus, if not regulated, they would be continuously leaking Ca2+ into cells. In guard cells, HACCs are permeable to Ca2+, Ba2+ and Mg2+, activated by H2O2 and the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and their activity is greatly reduced by low amounts of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]Cyt) and hence will close during [Ca2+]Cyt surges. Here we demonstrate that the presence of the commonly used Mg-ATP inside the cell greatly reduces HACC activity especially at voltages [&le;] -200 mV and that Mg2+ causes this block. We therefore conclude, firstly, that physiological cytosolic Mg2+ levels affect HACCs gating and that channel opening requires either high negative voltages ([&ge;] -200 mV) and/or displacement of Mg2+ away from the immediate vicinity of the channel. Secondly, based on structural comparisons with Mg2+-sensitive animal inward-rectifying K+ channel, we propose that the likely candidate HACCS described here are cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs), many of which also contain a conserved di-acidic Mg2+-binding motif within their pores. This conclusion is consistent with the electrophysiological data. Finally, we propose that Mg2+, much like in animal cells, is an important component in Ca2+ signalling and homeostasis in plants.",

We observed an enrichment for positive associations between drug sensitivity and knockout of their nominal targets, and by leveraging protein-protein networks we identified pathways that mediate drug response. This revealed an unappreciated role of mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCH5 in sensitivity to MCL1 inhibitors. We also estimated drug on-target and off-target activity, informing on specificity, potency and toxicity. Linking drug and gene dependency together with genomic datasets uncovered contexts in which molecular networks when perturbed mediate cancer cell loss-of-fitness, and thereby provide independent and orthogonal evidence of biomarkers for drug development.

In this work, we used statistical and machine learning methods to analyze 77 NF1 tumors with genomic data to characterize key signaling pathways that distinguish these tumors and identify candidates for drug development. We identified subsets of latent gene expression variables that may be important in the identification and etiology of cNFs, pNFs, other neurofibromas, and MPNSTs.

    "abstract": "Protein oligomerization is a fundamental process to build complex functional modules. Domains that facilitate the oligomerization process are diverse and widespread in nature across all kingdoms of life. One such domain is the Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain, which is functionally (relatively) well understood in the animal kingdom. However, beyond animals, neither the origin nor the evolutionary patterns of PB1-containing proteins are understood. While PB1 domain proteins have been found in other kingdoms, including plants, it is unclear how these relate to animal PB1 proteins.\n\nTo address this question, we utilized large transcriptome datasets along with the proteomes of a broad range of species. We discovered eight PB1 domain-containing protein families in plants, along with three each in Protozoa and Chromista and four families in Fungi. Studying the deep evolutionary history of PB1 domains throughout eukaryotes revealed the presence of at least two, but likely three, ancestral PB1 copies in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). These three ancestral copies gave rise to multiple orthologues later in evolution. Tertiary structural models of these plant PB1 families, combined with Random Forest based classification, indicated family-specific differences attributed to the length of PB1 domain and the proportion of {beta}-sheets.\n\nThis study identifies novel PB1 families and reveals considerable complexity in the protein oligomerization potential at the origin of eukaryotes. The newly identified relationships provide an evolutionary basis to understand the diverse functional interactions of key regulatory proteins carrying PB1 domains across eukaryotic life.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion of malaria parasites contains clinically validated drug targets. Within Plasmodium spp., the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is only 6 kb long, being the smallest mitochondrial genome among all eukaryotes. The mtDNA encodes only three proteins of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and [~] 27 small, fragmented rRNA genes in length of 22-195 nucleotides. The rRNA fragments are thought to form a mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), together with ribosomal proteins imported from the cytosol. The mitoribosome of Plasmodium falciparum has been shown to be essential for maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential and parasite viability. However, the role of mitoribosomes in sustaining the metabolic status of the parasite mitochondrion remains unknown. Here, among the 14 annotated mitoribosomal proteins of the small subunit of P. falciparum, we verified the localization and tested the essentiality of three candidates (PfmtRPS12, PfmtRPS17, PfmtRPS18), employing a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated conditional knockdown tool. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we provided evidence that the mitoribosome is closely associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane in the parasite. Upon knockdown of the mitoribosome, the parasites became hypersensitive to inhibitors targeting the bc1 complex, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and F1Fo ATP synthase complex. Furthermore, knockdown of the mitoribosome blocked the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and reduced the pool of pyrimidine nucleotides. Together, our data suggest that disruption of the P. falciparum mitoribosome compromises the metabolic capability of the mitochondrion, rendering the parasite hypersensitive to a panel of inhibitors targeting mitochondrial functions.",

Developing a new approach while considering gene expression data and topological features like causal relations regarding edge directions will help the investigators to achieve more accurate results.\n\nResultsWe proposed a new pathway enrichment analysis based on Bayesian network (BNrich) as an approach in PEA. To this end, the cycles were eliminated in 187 KEGG human signaling pathways concerning intuitive biological rules and the Bayesian network structures were constructed. The constructed networks were simplified by the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (LASSO), and their parameters were estimated using the gene expression data. We finally prioritize the impacted pathways by Fishers Exact Test on significant parameters. Our method integrates both edge and node related parameters to enrich modules in the affected signaling pathway network. In order to evaluate the proposed method, consistency, discrimination, false positive rate and empirical P-value criteria were calculated, and the results are compared to well-known enrichment methods such as signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA), bi-level meta-analysis (BLMA) and topology-based pathway enrichment analysis (TPEA).\n\nAvailabilityThe R package is available on carn.",

Even with recent advancements in sequencing technologies, many genome assemblies are still not achieving reference-grade. Here, we introduce ntJoin, a tool that leverages structural synteny between a draft assembly and reference sequence(s) to contiguate and correct the former with respect to the latter. Instead of alignments, ntJoin uses a lightweight mapping approach based on a graph data structure generated from ordered minimizer sketches. The tool can be used in a variety of different applications, including improving a draft assembly with a reference-grade genome, a short read assembly with a draft long read assembly, and a draft assembly with an assembly from a closely-related species. When scaffolding a human short read assembly using the reference human genome or a long read assembly, ntJoin improves the NGA50 length 23- and 13-fold, respectively, in under 13 m, using less than 11 GB of RAM. Compared to existing reference-guided assemblers, ntJoin generates highly contiguous assemblies faster and using less memory.\n\nAvailability and implementationntJoin is written in C++ and Python, and is freely available at https://github.com/bcgsc/ntjoin.\n\nContactlcoombe@bcgsc.ca",

Murine WHIMP promotes Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly, but is less potent than other nucleation factors. Nevertheless, WHIMP-mediated Arp2/3 activation enhances both plasma membrane ruffling and wound healing migration, whereas WHIMP depletion impairs protrusion and slows motility. WHIMP expression also increases Src-family kinase activity, and WHIMP-induced ruffles contain the additional nucleation factors WAVE1, WAVE2, and N-WASP, but not JMY or WASH. Perturbing the function of Src-family kinases, WAVE proteins, or Arp2/3 complex inhibits WHIMP-driven ruffling. These results suggest that WHIMP-mediated actin assembly plays a direct role in membrane protrusion, but also results in feedback control of tyrosine kinase signaling to modulate the activation of multiple WASP-family proteins.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe actin cytoskeleton is a collection of protein polymers that assemble and disassemble within cells at specific times and locations. Sophisticated cytoskeletal regulators called nucleation factors ensure that actin polymerizes when and where it is needed, and most nucleation factors are members of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family. Several of the 8 known WASP-family proteins function in cell motility, but how the different factors collaborate with one another is not well understood. In this study, we identified WHIMP, a new WASP-family member which is encoded on the X chromosome of a variety of animals. In mouse cells, WHIMP enhances cell motility by assembling actin filaments that push the cell membrane forward. Unexpectedly, WHIMP also activates tyrosine kinase enzymes, proteins that stimulate multiple WASP-family members during motility. Our results open new avenues of research into how nucleation factors cooperate during movement and how the molecular activities that underlie motility differ in distinct cell types and organisms.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are globally affecting ecosystems, causing local species loss and altering ecosystem functioning. Understanding the success and unfolding of such biological invasions is thus of high priority. Both local properties and the spatial network structure have been shown to be determinants of invasion success, and the identification of spatial invasion hubs directly promoting invasion dynamics is gaining attention. Spatial dynamics, however, could also indirectly alter invasion success by shaping local community structure: in many ecosystems, such as riverine networks, regional properties such as patch size distribution are known drivers of local community structures, which themselves may affect the establishment success of invading species. Using microcosm experiments in dendritic networks, we disentangled how patch size distribution and dispersal along specific network topologies shaped local communities, and, subsequently, affected the establishment success of invading species. We find that inherent patch size distributions shaped composition and diversity of local communities, and, subsequently, modulated invasion success. Specifically, the relationship between local diversity and invasion success changed across an increasing patch size gradient from a negative to a positive correlation, while overall increasing patch size reduced invasion success. Connectivity did not have a direct effect on invasion success but indirectly affected invasions by shaping diversity patterns in the whole network. Our results emphasize the relevance of indirect, landscape-level effects on species invasions, which need to be considered in the management of spatial habitat networks.",

    "abstract": "Infection with the influenza virus triggers an innate immune response aimed at initiating the adaptive response to halt viral replication and spread. However, the metabolic response fueling the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in innate immune cell homeostasis remain undefined. Thus, we compared the metabolic response of dendritic cells to that of those infected with active and inactive influenza A virus or treated with toll like receptor agonists. While influenza infects dendritic cells, it does not productively replicate in these cells, and therefore metabolic changes upon infection may represent an adaptive response on the part of the host cells. Using quantitative mass spectrometry along with pulse chase substrate utilization assays and metabolic flux measurements, we found global metabolic changes 17 hours post infection, including significant changes in carbon commitment via glycolysis and glutaminolysis, as well as ATP production via TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Influenza infection of dendritic cells led to a metabolic phenotype, distinct from that induced by TLR agonists, with significant resilience in terms of metabolic plasticity. We identified Myc as one transcription factor modulating this response. Restriction of either Myc activity or mitochondrial substrates resulted in significant changes in the innate immune functions of dendritic cells, including reduced motility and T cell activation. Transcriptome analysis of inflammatory dendritic cells isolated following influenza infection showed similar metabolic reprogramming occurs in vivo. Thus, early in the infection process dendritic cells respond with global metabolic restructuring that is present in lung DC 9 days following infection and impacts their effector function, suggesting that metabolic switching in dendritic cells plays a vital role in initiating the immune response to influenza infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn response to influenza infection we found that dendritic cells, cells that are critical in mounting an effective immune response, undergo a profound metabolic shift. They alter the concentration and location of hundreds of proteins, including c-MYC, mediating a shift to a highly glycolytic phenotype that is also flexible in terms of fueling respiration. Dendritic cells initiate the immune response to influenza and activate the adaptive response allowing viral clearance and manifesting immune memory for protection against subsequent infections. We found that limiting access to specific metabolic pathways or substrates diminished key immune functions. Previously we described an immediate, fixed, hypermetabolic state in infected respiratory epithelial cells. We now show the metabolic responses of epithelial and dendritic cells are distinct. Here, we also demonstrate that dendritic cells tailor their metabolic response to the pathogen or TLR stimulus. This metabolic reprogramming occurs rapidly in vitro and it is sustained in inflammatory dendritic cells in vivo for at least 9 days following influenza infection. Thus, drugs targeting metabolism are likely to have cell- and pathogen-specific activities in the context of infection. These studies open the possibility of modulating the immune response to viral infection via customizing metabolic therapy to enhance or diminish the function of specific cells.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic bacteria can alter host gene expression through post-translational modifications of histones. We show for the first time that a natural colonizer, Streptococcus pneumoniae, also induces specific histone modifications, including robust dephosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10, during infection of respiratory epithelial cells. Two bacterial factors are important for the induction of this modification: the bacterial toxin PLY, a pore-forming toxin, and the pyruvate oxidase SpxB, an enzyme responsible for H2O2 production. The combined effects of PLY and H2O2 lead to host signaling which culminates in H3S10 dephosphorylation, mediated by the host cell phosphatase PP1. Strikingly, S. pneumoniae infection induces dephosphorylation and associated activation of PP1 catalytic activity. Colonization of cells, which lacked active PP1, resulted in the impairment of intracellular S. pneumoniae survival. Interestingly, PP1 activation mediating H3S10 dephosphorylation is not restricted to S. pneumoniae and appears to be a general epigenomic mechanism favoring intracellular survival.",

In both tasks, mice were either active or passive during stimulus presentation, engaging in body movements or sitting quietly. Irrespective of behavioral strategy, auditory and tactile stimulation activated spatially segregated subdivisions of posterior parietal cortex (areas A and RL, respectively). In the subsequent delay period, in contrast, behavioral strategy rather than sensory modality determined where short-term memory was located: frontomedially in active trials and posterolaterally in passive trials.

    "abstract": "Distracted eating can lead to increased food intake, but it is unclear how. We hypothesized that distraction affects the change in motivated responses for food reward after satiation. To investigate this, 38 healthy normal-weight participants (28F, 10M) performed a detection task varying in attentional load (high or low distraction) during fMRI. Simultaneously, they exerted effort for food rewards (sweet or savory) by repeated button presses. Two fMRI runs were separated by outcome devaluation (satiation) of one of the reward outcomes, to assess outcome-sensitive, i.e. goal-directed, responses. Behavioral results showed no effect of distraction on effort for food reward following outcome devaluation. At an uncorrected threshold (p<0.001), distraction decreased goal-directed responses (devalued versus valued) in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Importantly, these distraction-sensitive rIFG responses correlated negatively (r = - 0.40, p = 0.014) with the effect of distraction on the number of button presses. Specifically, decreased rIFG responses due to distraction related to increased button presses for food reward after satiation, in line with the rIFGs established role in response inhibition. Furthermore, distraction decreased functional connectivity between the rIFG (seed) and left putamen for valued versus devalued food rewards (pFWE(cluster)<0.05). Our results suggest that distraction attenuates the ability to inhibit responses for food reward after satiation by affecting the rIFG. Furthermore, distraction attenuated connectivity between two regions involved in response inhibition - rIFG and putamen - after outcome devaluation. These results may explain why distraction can lead to overeating in our current, distracting, environment. The study was preregistered at: https://osf.io/ad2qk.",

    "abstract": "Experimental research in guard cell metabolism has revealed the roles of the accumulation of various metabolites in guard cell function, but a comprehensive understanding of their metabolism over the diel cycle is still incomplete, given the limitations of current experimental methods. In this study, we constructed a four-phase flux balance model of guard cell metabolism to investigate the changes in guard cell metabolism over the diel cycle, including the day and night and stomata opening and closing. Our model demonstrated the metabolic flexibility in guard cells, showing that multiple metabolic processes can contribute to the synthesis and metabolism of malate and sucrose as osmolytes during stomatal opening and closing. We showed that guard cells can adapt to varying light availability and sucrose uptake from the apoplast during the day by operating in a mixotrophic mode with a switch between sucrose synthesis via the Calvin-Benson cycle and sucrose degradation via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. During stomatal opening, our model predicted an alternative flux mode of the Calvin-Benson cycle with all dephosphorylating steps diverted to diphosphate--fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase to produce PPi, which is used to pump protons across the tonoplast for the accumulation of osmolytes. An analysis of the energetics of the use of different osmolytes in guard cells showed that malate and Cl- are similarly efficient as the counterion of K+ during stomatal opening.\n\nSignificance statementThis work presents the first four-phase metabolic model for predicting guard cell metabolism over the diel cycle, which predicted an alternative flux model of the Calvin-Benson cycle that maximises the production of PPi during stomatal opening. While multiple metabolic processes were shown be important in synthesising and metabolising osmolytes in guard cells of different experimental systems, our model demonstrated that these processes can operate simultaneously and at different rates depending on conditions.",

    "abstract": "When a nanoparticle enters a biological environment, the surface is rapidly coated with proteins to form a \"protein corona\". Presence of the protein corona surrounding the nanoparticle has significant implications for applying nanotechnologies within biological systems, affecting outcomes such as biodistribution and toxicity. Herein, we measure protein corona formation on single-stranded DNA wrapped single-walled carbon nanotubes (ssDNA-SWCNTs), a high-aspect ratio nanoparticle ideal for sensing and delivery applications, and polystyrene nanoparticles, a model nanoparticle system. The protein corona of each nanoparticle is studied in human blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We characterize corona composition by proteomic mass spectrometry to determine abundant and differentially enriched vs. depleted corona proteins. High-binding corona proteins on ssDNA-SWCNTs include proteins involved in lipid binding and transport (clusterin and apolipoprotein A-I), complement activation (complement C3), and blood coagulation (fibrinogen). Of note, albumin is the most common blood protein (55% w/v), yet exhibits low-binding affinity towards ssDNA-SWCNTs, displaying 1300-fold lower bound concentration relative to native plasma. We investigate the role of electrostatic and entropic interactions driving selective protein corona formation, and find that hydrophobic interactions drive inner corona formation, while shielding of electrostatic interactions allows for outer corona formation. Lastly, we study real-time binding of proteins on ssDNA-SWCNTs and find relative agreement between proteins that are enriched and bind strongly, such as fibrinogen, and proteins that are depleted and bind marginally, such as albumin. Interestingly, certain proteins express contrary behavior in single-protein experiments than within the whole biofluid, highlighting the importance of cooperative mechanisms driving selective corona adsorption on the SWCNT surface.

In practice this typically results in the fitting of a new predictive model for each specific type of setup, which is not only inefficient but also requires substantial prior data to be accumulated on each such setup.\n\nResultsHere we introduce the concept of generalized calibration, which is capable of the straightforward mapping of retention time models between different experimental setups. This concept builds on the database-controlled calibration approach implemented in PredRet, and fits calibration curves on predicted retention times instead of only on observed retention times. We show that this approach results in significantly higher accuracy of elution peak prediction than is achieved by setup-specific models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma is a deadly brain tumor with median patient survival of 14.6 months. At the core of this malignancy are rare, highly heterogenous malignant stem-like tumor initiating cells. Aberrant signaling across the EGFR-PTEN-AKT-mTOR signal transduction pathways are common oncogenic drivers in these cells. Though gene-level clustering has determined the importance of the EGFR signaling pathway as a treatment indicator, multiparameter protein-level analyses are necessary to discern functional attributes of signal propagation. Multiparameter single cell analyses is emerging as particularly useful in identifying such attributes.\n\nMethodsSingle cell targeted proteomic analysis of EGFR-PTEN-AKT-mTOR proteins profiled heterogeneity in a panel of fifteen patient derived gliomaspheres. A microfluidic cell array  chip tool served as a low cost methodology to derive high quality quantitative single cell analytical outputs. Chip design specifications produced extremely high signal-to-noise ratios and brought experimental efficiencies of cell control and minimal cell use to accommodate experimentation with these rare and often slow-growing cell populations. Quantitative imaging software generated datasets to observe similarities and differences within and between cells and patients. Bioinformatic self-organizing maps (SOMs) and hierarchical clustering stratified patients into malignancy and responder groups which were validated by phenotypic and statistical analyses.\n\nResultsFifteen patient dissociated gliomaspheres produced 59,464 data points from 14,866 cells. Forty-nine molecularly defined signaling phenotypes were identified across samples. Bioinformatics resolved two clusters diverging on EGFR expression (p = 0.0003) and AKT/TORC1 activation (p = 0.08 and p = 0.09 respectively). TCGA status of a subset showed genetic heterogeneity with proneural, classical and mesenchymal subtypes represented in both clusters. Phenotypic validation measures indicated drug responsive phenotypes to EGFR blocking were found in the EGFR expressing cluster. EGFR expression in the subset of drug-treated lines was statistically significant (p<.05). The EGFR expressing cluster was of lower tumor initiating potential in comparison to the AKT/TORC1 activated cluster. Though not statistically significant, EGFR expression trended with improved patient prognosis while AKT/TORC1 activated samples trended with poorer outcomes.\n\nConclusionsQuantitative single cell heterogeneity profiling resolves signaling diversity into meaningful non-obvious phenotypic groups suggesting EGFR is decoupled from AKT/TORC1 signalling while identifying potentially valuable targets for personalized therapeutic approaches for deadly tumor-initiating cell populations.",

Inhibition of ATR over multiple cell division cycles depletes the pool of pro-resection factors and prevents RAD51 as well as RAD52-mediated DNA repair, leading to toxic end-joining and hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The effect is markedly distinct from acute ATR inhibition, which blocks RAD51-mediated repair but not resection and RAD52-mediated repair. Our findings reveal a key pro-resection function for ATR and define how ATR inhibitors can be used for effective manipulation of DNA end resection capacity and DNA repair outcomes in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Educational attainment is a substantially heritable trait, and it has recently been linked to specific genetic variants by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, the effects of such genetic variants are expected to vary across environments, including countries and historical eras. We used polygenic scores (PGSs) to assess molecular genetic effects on educational attainment in Hungary, a country in the Central Eastern European region where behavioral genetic studies are in general scarce and molecular genetic studies of educational attainment have not been previously published. We found that the PGS is significantly associated with highest educational level attained as well as the number of years in education in a sample of Hungarian volunteers (N=829). In an English (N=976) comparison sample with identical measurement protocols the same PGS had a stronger association with educational level, but not with years in education. In line with previous Estonian findings, we found higher PGS effect sizes in Hungarian, but not in English participants who attended higher education after the fall of Communism, although we lacked statistical power for this effect to reach significance. Our results provide evidence that polygenic scores for educational attainment are valid in diverse European populations.",

    "abstract": "Fecal contamination of waterways in Delaware pose an ongoing problem for environmental and public health. For monitoring efforts, Enterococcus has been widely adopted by the state to indicate the presence of fecal matter from warm-blooded animals and to establish Primary and Secondary Contact Recreation criteria. In this study, we examined sites within the Love Creek watershed, a tributary of the Rehoboth bay, using next-generation sequencing and SourceTracker to determine sources of potential fecal contamination and compared to bacterial communities to chemical and nutrient concentrations. Microbial community from fecal samples of 10 different types of animals and 1 human sample were used to generate a fecal library for community-based microbial source tracking. Orthophosphate and total dissolved solids were among the major factors associated with community composition. SourceTracker analysis of the monthly samples from the Love Creek watershed indicated the majority of the microbial community were attributed to \"unknown\" sources, i.e. wildlife. Those that attribute to known sources were primarily domestic animals, i.e. cat and dog. These results suggest that at the state level these methods are capable of giving the start for source tracking as a means to understanding bacterial contamination.",

Brain atlases are fundamental to this goal, yet many contemporary human atlases cover only the cerebral cortex, leaving the subcortex a terra incognita. We revealed the complex topographic organization of the human subcortex by disambiguating smooth connectivity gradients from discrete areal boundaries in resting-state fMRI data acquired from more than 1000 healthy adults. This unveiled four scales of subcortical organization, recapitulating well-known anatomical nuclei at the coarsest scale and delineating 27 new bilateral regions at the finest. Ultra-high field strength fMRI corroborated and extended this organizational structure, enabling delineation of finer subdivisions of hippocampus and amygdala, while task-evoked fMRI revealed a subtle reorganization of subcortical topography in response to changing cognitive demands. A new subcortical atlas was delineated, personalized to account for individual connectivity differences and utilized to uncover reproducible relationships between subcortical connectivity and individual variation in human behaviors. Linking cortical networks to subcortical regions recapitulated a task-positive to task-negative organizational axis. The new atlas enables holistic connectome mapping and characterization of cortico-subcortical connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Leaf sucrose contents are high in species of the genus Populus and other temperate tree taxa. Sucrose is subcellularly compartmentalized, but assumptions about the physiological relevance of such partitioning remain largely unexplored. In this study, the effects of partial defoliation treatments on water uptake, leaf gas exchange properties, non-structural carbohydrate abundance in source and sink organs, and growth were compared in poplars with normal or impaired intracellular sucrose trafficking. The tonoplast sucrose transporter PtaSUT4 is well expressed in leaves of P. tremula x P. alba (INRA 717-IB4), and its inhibition by RNA-interference (RNAi) is known to affect leaf sucrose abundance. After partial defoliation, maximum photosynthesis rates increased while intercellular CO2 decreased with trajectories that were similar in wild type and SUT4-RNAi lines. Leaf transpiration increased more robustly in wild-type than RNAi plants, while leaf water content increased more in RNAi lines. Stomatal conductance did not differ between genotypes, nor did it increase with defoliation. Post-defoliation reductions in steady-state levels of sucrose, the major hexoses (glucose and fructose) and starch were similar in wild-type and SUT4-RNAi shoot sinks. Water uptake and stem growth after partial defoliation were not as well sustained in RNAi as in wild-type plants. The data suggest that vacuolar efflux of sucrose by PtaSUT4 more clearly facilitated adjustments in water uptake than sucrose export following leaf removal.",

    "abstract": "Reversible protein phosphorylation regulates virtually every cellular process and is arguably the most well-studied post-translational modification. Still, less than 3% of the phosphorylation sites identified in humans have annotated functions. Functionally-relevant phosphorylation sites are known to trigger conformational changes to proteins and/or to regulate their interactions with other proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules - all of which can be reflected in the thermal stability of a protein. Thus, combining thermal proteome profiling (TPP) with phosphoproteomics (phospho-TPP) provides a way to assess the functional relevance of identified phosphorylation sites on a proteome-wide scale by comparing the melting behavior of a protein and its phosphorylated form(s). We performed phospho-TPP experiments in HeLa cells with an optimized protocol, and conclude that phosphorylation does affect protein thermal stability, but to a much lesser extent than previously reported.",

Insertion of a short alternatively-spliced region within Tenms abolishes the Tenm-Lphn interaction and switches Tenm function to specify inhibitory synapses. How Tenms bind to Lphns in a manner regulated by alternative splicing remains unclear. Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the Tenm2-Lphn3 complex, and describe the trimeric Tenm2-Lphn3-FLRT3 complex. The structure reveals that the N-terminal lectin-like domain of Lphn3 binds to the Tenm2 barrel at a site far away from the alternatively-spliced region. Alternative-splicing regulates the Tenm2-Lphn3 interaction by hindering access to the Lphn-binding surface rather than altering it. Strikingly, mutagenesis of the Lphn-binding surface of Tenm2 abolishes the Lphn3 interaction and impairs excitatory but not inhibitory synapse formation. These results suggest that a multi-level coincident binding mechanism mediated by a cryptic adhesion complex between Tenms and Lphns regulates synapse specificity.",

    "abstract": "A main challenge in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data is to reduce technical variations yet retain cell heterogeneity. Due to low mRNAs content per cell and molecule losses during the experiment (called \"dropout\"), the gene expression matrix has substantial zero read counts. Existing imputation methods either treat each cell or each gene identically and independently, which oversimplifies the gene correlation and cell type structure. We propose a statistical model-based approach, called SIMPLEs, which iteratively identifies correlated gene modules and cell clusters and imputes dropouts customized for individual gene module and cell type. Simultaneously, it quantifies the uncertainty of imputation and cell clustering. Optionally, SIMPLEs can integrate bulk RNASeq data for estimating dropout rates. In simulations, SIMPLEs performed significantly better than prevailing scRNASeq imputation methods by various metrics. By applying SIMPLEs to several real data sets, we discovered gene modules that can further classify subtypes of cells. Our imputations successfully recovered the expression trends of marker genes in stem cell differentiation and can discover putative pathways regulating biological processes.",

    "abstract": "PATZ1 is a transcriptional repressor belonging to the ZBTB family that is functionally expressed in T-lymphocytes, as well as in a ubiquitous fashion. PATZ1 targets the Cd8 gene in lymphocyte development and interacts with the p53 protein to control genes important in proliferation and DNA damage response. PATZ1 exerts its activity through an N-terminal BTB domain that mediates dimerization and co-repressor interactions and a C-terminal zinc finger motif-containing domain that mediates DNA binding. Here, the crystal structures of the murine and zebrafish PATZ1 BTB domains are reported at 2.3 and 1.8 [A] resolution respectively. The structures reveal that, like other ZBTB structures, the PATZ1 BTB domain forms a stable homodimer and likely binds co-repressors through a lateral surface groove that is formed upon dimerization. Analysis of the lateral groove reveals a large acidic patch in this region which contrasts previously resolved basic co-repressor binding interfaces in other ZBTB proteins. A large 30 amino acids glycine- and alanine-rich central loop, unique to mammalian PATZ1 amongst all ZBTB proteins, could not be resolved likely due to its flexibility. Modelling of this loop indicates that it can participate in the dimerization interface of BTB monomers.\n\nSynopsisThe crystal structures of the PATZ1 BTB domain in mammals and fish are homodimers. The core dimer conformation of these BTB proteins is dynamically stable, despite the presence of highly flexible regions in the dimerization interface.",

    "abstract": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) plays an evolutionarily conserved role in homeostasis, and its dysregulation often leads to human disease, including diabetes and cancer. IRE1 is a major transducer that conveys endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to biochemical signals, yet major gaps persist in our understanding of how the detection of stress is converted to one of several molecular outcomes. It is known that upon sensing unfolded proteins via its ER luminal domain, IRE1 dimerizes and oligomerizes (often visualized as clustering), and then trans-autophosphorylates. The IRE1 kinase activity is required for activation of its RNase effector domain and for clustering of IRE1. It is not yet clear if IRE1 clustering is a platform for the RNase activity, or if the two represent distinct biological functions. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for helix K between IRE1 kinase and RNase domains in conveying critical conformational changes. Using mutants within this inter-domain helix, we show for the first time that: 1) distinct substitutions (specifically, of Leu827) selectively affect oligomerization, RNase activity, and, unexpectedly, the kinase activity of IRE1; 2) RNase activation can be uncoupled from IRE1 oligomerization, and phosphorylation of S729 marks the former but not the latter; 3) The nature of residue 827 determines the conformation that the IRE1 protein adopts, leading to different patterns of biochemical activities. In summary, this work reveals a previously unappreciated role for the inter-domain helix as a pivotal conduit for attaining the stress-responsive conformation of IRE1.",

To streamline this process, we present hypercluster, a python package and SnakeMake pipeline for flexible and parallelized clustering evaluation and selection.

It is extremely common when analyzing big data from patient samples, or high throughput techniques like single cell RNA-seq. When researchers use unsupervised clustering, they have to select parameters that affect the final result--for instance, how many groups they expect to find or what the smallest group is allowed to be. Some methods require setting even less intuitive parameters. For most applications, it is extremely challenging to guess what the values of these parameters should be; therefore to prevent introducing bias into the final results, researchers should test many different parameters and methods to find the best groups. This process is cumbersome, slow and challenging to perform in a reproducible way. We developed hypercluster, a tool that automates this process, make it much faster, and presenting the results in a reproducible and helpful manner.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal windows of opportunity represent intervals of time within a year during which organisms have improved prospects of achieving life history aims such as growth or reproduction, and may be commonly structured by temporal variation in abiotic factors, bottom-up factors, and top-down factors. Although seasonal windows of opportunity are likely to be common, few studies have examined the factors that structure seasonal windows of opportunity in time. Here, we experimentally manipulated host plant age in two milkweed species (Asclepias fascicularis and Asclepias speciosa) in order to investigate the role of plant species-specific and plant age-varying traits on the survival and growth of monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus). We show that the two plant species showed diverging trajectories of defense traits with increasing age. These species-specific and age-varying host plant traits significantly affected the growth and survival of monarch caterpillars through both resource quality- and resource quantity-based constraints. The effects of plant age on monarch developmental success were comparable to and sometimes larger than those of plant species identity. We conclude that species-specific and age-varying plant traits are likely to be important factors with the potential to structure seasonal windows of opportunity for monarch development, and examine the implications of these findings for both broader patterns in the ontogeny of plant defense traits and the specific ecology of milkweed-monarch interactions in a changing world.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinsons disease (PD), gastrointestinal features are common and often precede the motor signs. Braak and colleagues proposed that PD may start in the gut, triggered by a pathogen, and spread to the brain. Numerous studies have examined the gut microbiome in PD, all found it to be altered, but found inconsistent results on associated microorganisms. Studies to date have been small (N=20 to 306) and are difficult to compare or combine due to varied methodology. We conducted a microbiome-wide association study (MWAS) with two large datasets for internal replication (N=333 and 507). We used uniform methodology when possible, interrogated confounders, and applied two statistical tests for concordance, followed by correlation network analysis to infer interactions. Fifteen genera were associated with PD at a microbiome-wide significance level, in both datasets, with both methods, with or without covariate adjustment. The associations were not independent, rather represented 3 clusters of co-occurring microorganisms. Cluster 1 was composed of opportunistic pathogens; all were elevated in PD. Cluster 2 were short-chain-fatty-acid producing bacteria; all were reduced in PD. Cluster 3 were carbohydrate-metabolizing probiotics; elevated in PD. Depletion of anti-inflammatory short-chain-fatty-acid producing bacteria and elevated levels of probiotics are confirmatory. Overabundance of opportunistic pathogens is a novel finding and their identity provides a lead to experimentally test their role in PD.",

Neuroimaging studies have shown unilateral OFC response to reward-related variables, however, those studies rarely discussed the lateralization of this effect. Yet, some lesion studies suggest that the left and right OFC contribute differently to cognitive processes. We hypothesized that the OFC asymmetrical response to reward could reflect underlying hemispherical difference in OFC functional connectivity. Using restingstate and reward-related MRI data from humans and from rhesus macaques, we first identified a specific asymmetrical response of the lateral OFC to reward in both species. Crucially, the subregion showing the highest reward-related asymmetry (RRA) overlapped with the region showing the highest functional connectivity asymmetry (FCA). Furthermore, the two types of functional asymmetries were found to be significantly correlated across humans. Altogether, our results suggest a similar pattern of functional specialization between the left and right OFC is present in two primate species.",

    "abstract": "Bladder dysfunction is a significant and largely unaddressed problem for people living with spinal cord injury. Intermittent catheterization does not provide volitional control of micturition and has numerous side effects. Targeted electrical microstimulation of the spinal cord has been previously explored for restoring such volitional control in the animal model of experimental spinal cord injury. In this study, the development of the intraspinal microstimulation array technology was continued and evaluated in the feline animal model for its ability to provide more focused and reliable bladder control after a complete spinal cord transection. For the first time, the intraspinal multisite silicon array wad built using novel microfabrication processes to provide custom-designed tip geometry and 3D electrode distribution, better cost efficiency, reproducibility, scalability, and on-the-probe integration of active electronics. Long-term implantation was performed in 8 animals for a period up to 6 months, targeting the dorsal gray commissure area in the S1 sacral cord that is known to be involved in the coordination between the bladder detrusor and the external urethral sphincter. About one third of the electrode sites in the that area produced micturition-related responses. The effectiveness of stimulation increased starting from one month after spinal cord transection (as evaluated in one animal), likely due to supraspinal disinhibition of the spinal circuitry and/or hypertrophy and hyperexcitability of the spinal bladder afferents. Further studies are required to assess longer-term reliability of the developed intraspinal microstimulation array technology in preparation for eventual human translation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThere is a body of evidence that the aging immune system is linked to cancer. Here, we hypothesized that ubiquitination might play a key gatekeeper role in immune system aging and tumorigenesis in CRC. Therefore, we will systematically study the DNA methylation of ubiquitination genes and screen candidate CRC marker that are correlated with both aging and immune cell compositions.\n\nDesignThrough aging- and immune-related DNA methylation data, we investigated the DNA methylation regulation changes in promoters with other regions of genes during aging and their association with the immune cell proportion in the circulating whole blood of healthy individuals. Then, by collecting a cohort of 100 colon cancer patients and 50 healthy individuals, we used nucleic acid mass spectrometry to test whether ubiquitination genes can be used as candidate markers for the early screening of CRC.\n\nResultsThe biological analyses for aging- and CD4 T cell proportion-derived differential genes showed that they are associated with ubiquitination. Among them, DZIP3 was significantly associated with both aging (P-value = 3.86E-06) and CD4 T cell proportion (P-value = 1.97E-05) in circulating blood. Then, we validated that the 1st exon DNA methylation of DZIP3 could predict the onset of early stage CRC (AUC = 0.833, OR = 8.82) and all pTNM stages of CRC (AUC = 0.782, OR = 5.70).\n\nConclusionsThe epigenetically regulated ubiquitination plays an important role in immune aging and tumorigenesis.

In this experiment, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was used to compare the gut microbiota composition of 5 healthy Paa Spinosa and 6 P. spinosa with rotten-skin disease. Results: the gut microbiota composition was significant difference between diseased P. spinosa and the healthy P. spinosa; LEfSe analysis showed that the relative abundance of Methanocorpusculum, Parabacteroides, AF12, PW3, Epulopiscium, and Oscillospira were significantly higher in the diseased P. spinosa, while the relative abundance of Serratia, Eubacteium, Citrobacter, and Morganella were significantly lower. Conclusion: Rotten-skin disease changed P. spinosa gut microbiota significantly; The relative abundance of Epulopiscium and Oscillospira might be related to the health conditions of the host skin and gallbladder; The relative abundance of Serratia and Eubacteium might be important for maintaining the gut microbiota ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Although most previous studies in cognitive neuroscience have focused on the change of the neuronal firing rate under various conditions, there has been increasing evidence that indicates the importance of neuronal oscillatory activities in cognition. In the visual cortex, specific time-frequency bands are thought to have selectivity to visual stimuli. Furthermore, several recent studies have shown that several time-frequency bands are related to frequency-specific feedforward or feedback processing in inter-areal communication. However, few studies have investigated detailed visual selectivity of each time-frequency band, especially in the primate inferior temporal cortex (ITC). In this work, we analyze frequency-specific electrocorticography (ECoG) activities in the primate ITC by training encoding models that predict frequency-specific amplitude from hierarchical visual features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network (CNNs). We find that ECoG activities in two specific time-frequency bands, theta (around 5 Hz) and gamma (around 20-25 Hz) bands, are better predicted from CNN features than the other bands. Furthermore, theta- and gamma-band activities are better predicted from higher and lower layers in CNNs, respectively. Our visualization analysis using CNN-based encoding models qualitatively show that theta- and gamma-band encoding models have selectivity to higher- and lower-level visual features, respectively. Our results suggest that neuronal oscillatory activities in theta and gamma bands carry distinct information in the hierarchy of visual features, and that distinct levels of visual information are multiplexed in frequency-specific brain signals.",

The combined treatment induced the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. This rendered the tumors vulnerable to simultaneous treatment with atorvastatin and further significantly prolonged the survival of the animals.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate high efficacy of a triple combination of quetiapine, atorvastatin and radiation against glioblastoma without increasing the toxicity of radiation.

    "abstract": "Components of cellular signaling systems are organized as hierarchical networks, and perturbing different components of the system often leads to transcriptomic profiles that exhibit compositional statistical patterns. Mining such patterns to investigate how cellular signals are encoded is an important problem in systems biology. Here, we investigated the capability of deep generative models (DGMs) for modeling signaling systems and learning representations for transcriptomic profiles derived from cells under diverse perturbations. Specifically, we show that the variational autoencoder and the supervised vector-quantized variational autoencoder can accurately regenerate gene expression data. Both models can learn representations that reveal the relationships between different classes of perturbagens and enable mappings between drugs and their target genes. In summary, DGMs can adequately depict how cellular signals are encoded. The resulting representations have broad applications in systems biology, such as studying the mechanism-of-action of drugs.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic signals and cues from the external environment drive cell fate decisions. In budding yeast, the decision to enter meiosis is controlled by nutrient and mating-type signals that regulate expression of the master transcription factor for meiotic entry, IME1. How nutrient signals control IME1 expression remains poorly understood. Here we show that IME1 transcription is regulated by multiple sequence-specific transcription factors that mediate association of Tup1-Cyc8 co-repressor to its promoter. We find that at least eight transcription factors bind the IME1 promoter when nutrients are ample. Remarkably, association of these transcription factors is highly regulated by different nutrient cues. Mutant cells lacking three transcription factors (Sok2/Phd1/Yap6) displayed reduced Tup1-Cyc8 association, increased IME1 expression and earlier onset of meiosis. Our data demonstrate that the promoter of a master regulator is primed for rapid activation while repression by multiple transcription factors mediating Tup1-Cyc8 recruitment dictates the fate decision to enter meiosis.",

Currently, IFN- is widely used to treat hepatitis B virus(HBV) infection, but its antiviral effect vary greatly and the mechanism is not totally clear. We found that IFN-/{gamma} induced a marked increase of PD-L1 expression in hepatocytes. Signal and activators of transcription (Stat1) was then identified as a major transcription factor involved in IFN-/{gamma}-mediated PD-L1 elevation both in vitro and in mice. Blockage of the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction by a specific mAb greatly enhanced HBV-specific T cell activity by the gp96 adjuvanted therapeutic vaccine, and promoted HBV clearance in HBV transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate the IFN-/{gamma}-Stat1-PD-L1 axis plays an important role in mediating T cell hyporesponsiveness and inactivating liver-infiltrating T cells in the hepatic microenvironment. These data raise further potential interest in enhancing the anti-HBV efficacy of IFN- and therapeutic vaccines.",

To what extent this generalises to humans in a way that is relevant for behaviour is yet unclear. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess the potential influence of tidal volume and respiration phase on the human motor system. We obtained simultaneous recordings of brain activity, muscle activity, and respiration while participants performed an isometric contraction task. We used corticomuscular coherence as a measure of efficient long-range cortico-peripheral communication.\n\nWe found coherence within the beta range over sensorimotor cortex to be reduced during voluntary deep compared to involuntary normal breathing. Moreover, beta coherence was found to be cyclically modulated by respiration phase in both conditions. Overall, these results demonstrate how respiratory rhythms actively influence brain oscillations in an effort to synchronise neural activity for the sake of computational efficiency. Intriguing questions remain with regard to the shape of these modulatory processes and how they influence perception, cognition, and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Epimutations in fungal pathogens are emerging as novel phenomena that could explain the fast-developing resistance to antifungal drugs and other stresses. These epimutations are generated by RNA interference (RNAi) mechanisms that transiently silence specific genes to overcome stressful stimuli. The early-diverging fungus Mucor circinelloides exercises a fine control over two interacting RNAi pathways to produce epimutants: the canonical RNAi pathway and a new RNAi degradative pathway. The latter is considered a non-canonical RNAi pathway (NCRIP) because it relies on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) and a novel ribonuclease III-like named R3B2 to degrade target transcripts. Here in this work, we uncovered the role of NCRIP in regulating virulence processes and transposon movements through key components of the pathway, RdRP1, and R3B2. Mutants in these genes are unable to launch a proper virulence response to macrophage phagocytosis, resulting in a decreased virulence potential. The transcriptomic profile of rdrp1{Delta} and r3b2{Delta} mutants revealed a pre-exposure adaptation to the stressful phagosomal environment even when the strains are not confronted by macrophages. These results suggest that NCRIP represses key targets during regular growth and release its control when the fungus is challenged by a stressful environment. NCRIP interacts with the RNAi canonical core to protect genome stability by controlling the expression of centromeric retrotransposable elements. In the absence of NCRIP, these retrotransposons are robustly repressed by the canonical RNAi machinery; thus, supporting the antagonistic role of NCRIP in containing the epimutational pathway. Both interacting RNAi pathways might be essential to govern host-pathogen interactions through transient adaptations, contributing to the unique traits of the emerging infection mucormycosis.\n\nAuthor summaryMucormycosis is an emergent and lethal infectious disease caused by Mucorales, a fungal group resistant to most antifungal drugs. Mucor circinelloides, a genetic model to characterize this infection, can develop drug resistance via RNAi epimutations. This epimutational RNAi mechanism interacts with a novel non-canonical RNAi pathway (NCRIP), where the ribonuclease III-like R3B2 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRP1 are essential. The analysis of the transcriptomic response to phagocytosis by macrophage in rdrp1{Delta} and r3b2{Delta} mutants revealed that NCRIP might control virulence in M. circinelloides. These mutants showed constitutive activation of the response to phagocytosis and a reduction in virulence in a mouse model, probably caused by a disorganized execution of the genetic program to overcome host defense mechanisms. The antagonistic role of the NCRIP and the RNAi canonical core is evident during post-transcriptional regulation of centromeric retrotransposons. These retrotransposons are silenced by the canonical RNAi pathway, but this regulation is restrained by NCRIP, proven by an overproduction of small RNAs targeting these loci in NCRIP mutants. These new insights into the initial phase of mucormycosis and transposable element regulation point to NCRIP as a crucial genetic regulator of pathogenesis-related molecular processes that could serve as pharmacological targets.",

    "abstract": "The robust estimate and forecast capability of random forests (RF) has been widely recognized, however this ensemble machine learning method has not been widely used in mosquito-borne disease forecasting. In this study, two sets of RF models were developed for the national and departmental levels in Colombia to predict weekly dengue cases at 12-weeks ahead. A national model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) was also developed and used as a comparator to the RF models. The various predictors included historic dengue cases, satellite-derived estimates for vegetation, precipitation, and air temperature, population counts, income inequality, and education. Our RF model trained on the national data was more accurate for department-specific weekly dengue cases estimation compared to a local model trained only on the departments data. Additionally, the forecast errors of the national RF model were smaller to those of the national ANN model and were increased with the forecast horizon increasing from one-week ahead (mean absolute error, MAE: 5.80; root mean squared error, RMSE: 11.10) to 12-weeks ahead (MAE: 13.38; RMSE: 26.82). There was considerable variation in the relative importance of predictors dependent on forecast horizon. The environmental and meteorological predictors were relatively important for short-term dengue forecast horizons while socio-demographic predictors were relevant for longer-term forecast horizons. This study showed the potential of RF in dengue forecasting with also demonstrating the feasibility of using a national model to forecast at finer spatial scales. Furthermore, sociodemographic predictors are important to include to capture longer-term trends in dengue.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue virus has the highest disease burden of all mosquito-borne viral diseases, infecting 390 million people annually in 128 countries. Forecasting is an important warning mechanism that can help with proactive planning and response for clinical and public health services. In this study, we compare two different machine learning approaches to dengue forecasting: random forest (RF) and neural networks (NN). National and local (departmental-level) models were compared and used to predict dengue cases in the future. The results showed that the counts of future dengue cases were more accurately estimated by RF than by NN. It was also shown that environmental and meteorological predictors were more important for forecast accuracy for shorter-term forecasts while socio-demographic predictors were more important for longer-term forecasts. Finally, the national model applied to local data was more accurate in dengue forecasting compared to the local model. This research contributes to the field of disease forecasting and highlights different considerations for future forecasting studies.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) is found overexpressed in several cancers, such as gastric, and breast cancer, and is, therefore, an important therapeutic target. ErbB2 plays a central role in cancer cell invasiveness, and is associated with cytoskeletal reorganization. In order to study the spatial correlation of single ErbB2 proteins and actin filaments, we applied correlative fluorescence microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to image specifically labeled SKBR3 breast cancer cells. The breast cancer cells were grown on microchips, transformed to express an actin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, and labeled with quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles attached to specific anti-ErbB2 Affibodies. Fluorescence microscopy was performed to identify cellular regions with spatially correlated actin and ErbB2 expression. For STEM of the intact plasma membrane of whole cells, the cells were fixed and covered with graphene. Spatial distribution patterns of ErbB2 in the actin rich ruffled membrane regions were examined, and compared to adjacent actin-low regions of the same cell, revealing an association of putative signaling active ErbB2 homodimers with actin-rich regions. ErbB2 homodimers were found absent from actin-low membrane regions, as well as after treatment of cells with Cytochalasin D, which breaks up larger actin filaments. In both latter data sets, a significant inter-label distance of 36 nm was identified, possibly indicating an indirect attachment to helical actin filaments via the formation of heterodimers of ErbB2 with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The possible attachment to actin filaments was further explored by identifying linear QD-chains in actin-rich regions, which also showed an inter-label distance of 36 nm.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of polarity in cells and tissues is one of the first steps in multicellular development. The  eternal embryo hydra can completely regenerate from a disorganized cell cluster or a small fragment of tissue of about 10, 000 cells. During regeneration, the cells first form a hollow cell spheroid, which then undergoes de-novo symmetry breaking to irreversibly polarize. Here, we address the symmetry-related shape changes. Prior to axis establishment, the spheroid of regenerating cells presents inflation oscillations on several timescales that are isotropic in space. There are transient periods of fluctuations in defined arbitrary directions, until these undergo a clearly identified, irreversible transition to directed fluctuations along the future main axis of the regenerating hydra. Stabilized cytosolic actin structures disappear during the de-novo polarization, while polymerized microtubules remain. In our observations applied drugs that depolymerize actin filaments accelerate the symmetry breaking process, while drug-stabilized actin filaments prevent it. Nocodazole-depolymerized microtubules prevent symmetry breaking, but regeneration can be rescued by the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel at concentrations where microtubular structures start to reappear. We discuss the possibility that mechanical fluctuations induce the orientation and position of microtubules, which contribute to {beta}-catenin nuclear translocation, to increase the organizer-forming-potential of the cells. Our data suggest that in regenerating hydra spheroids, microtubules play a pivotal role in the cooperative polarization process of the self-organizing hydra spheroid.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMuscle stem cells (MuSCs) are requisite for skeletal muscle regeneration and homeostasis. Proper functioning of MuSCs, including activation, proliferation, and fate decision, is determined by an orchestrated series of events and communication between MuSCs and their niche consisting of the host myofiber and neighbouring cells. A multitude of biochemical stimuli are known to regulate fate and function of MuSCs. However, in addition to biochemical factors, it is conceivable that MuSCs residing between basal lamina and sarcolemma of myofibers are subjected to mechanical forces during muscle stretch-shortening cycles due to myofascial connections between MuSCs and myofibers. MuSCs have been shown to respond to mechanical forces in vitro but it remains to be proven whether physical forces are also exerted on MuSCs in their native niche and whether they contribute to the functioning and fate of MuSCs.\n\nMethodsMuSCs deformation in their native niche resulting from mechanical loading of ex vivo myofiber bundles were visualized utilizing mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre-reporter mouse and multiphoton microscopy. MuSCs were subjected to 1 hour pulsating fluid shear stress with a peak shear stress rate of 8.8 Pa/s. After treatment, nitric oxide and mRNA expression levels of genes involved in regulation of MuSC proliferation and differentiation were determined.\n\nResultsEx vivo stretching of extensor digitorum longus and soleus myofiber bundles caused compression as well as tensile and shear deformation of MuSCs in their niche. MuSCs responded to pulsating fluid shear stress in vitro with increased nitric oxide production and an upward trend in iNOS mRNA levels, while nNOS expression was unaltered. Pulsating fluid shear stress enhanced gene expression of c-Fos, Cdk4, and IL-6, while expression of Wnt1, MyoD, Myog, Wnt5a, COX2, Rspo1, Vangl2, Wnt10b, and MGF remained unchanged.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that MuSCs in their native niche are subjected to force-induced deformations due to myofiber stretch-shortening. Moreover, MuSCs are mechanoresponsive as evident by pulsating fluid shear stress-mediated expression of factors by MuSCs known to promote proliferation.",

    "abstract": "With the identification of novel cAMP binding effecter molecules in Trypanosoma, role of cAMP in kinetopalstida parasites gained an intriguing break through. Despite earlier demonstrations of role of cAMP in survival of Leishmania during macrophage infection, there is essential need to specifically clarify involvement of cAMP in various cellular processes in the parasite. In this context, we sought to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effect of cAMPanalogs and cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on proliferation of log phase parasites. Administration of both hydrolysable (8-pCPT-cAMP) and non-hydrolysable analogs (Sp-8-pCPT-cAMPS) of cAMP resulted in significant decrease of Leishmania proliferation. Amongst the various PDE inhibitors, etazolate was found to be potently anti-proliferative. BrdU cell proliferation and K/N/F-enumeration microscopic study revealed that both cAMP analogues and selective PDE inhibitors resulted in significant cell cycle arrest at G1 phase with reduced S-phase population. Furthermore, careful examination of the flagellar motility patterns revealed significantly reduced coordinated forward flagellar movement of the promastigotes with a concomitant decrease in cellular ATP levels. Alongside, 8-pCPT-cAMP and PDE inhibitors etazolate and trequinsin showed marked reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. Treatment of etazolate at subcytotoxic concentration to infected macrophages significantly reduced parasite burden and administration of etazolate to Leishmania-infected BALB/c mice showed reduced liver and spleen parasite burden. Collectively, these results imply involvement of cAMP in various crucial processes paving the avenue for developing potent anti-leishmanial agent.\n\nAuthor SummaryLeishmania donovani is the causative agent of fatal Visceral Leishmaniasis. The current available medications are toxic, expensive and require long term daily administrations. With an aim to develop improved therapeutic, components of cAMP homeostasis, particularly cAMP-phosphodiesteares, has been targeted for Leishmania and other kinetoplastid pathogens. cAMP plays diverse roles in functional processes involved in cell division, transition into different stages of the life cycle of Leishmania and motility. In this study, the authors found administration of both hydrolysable and non-hydrolysable analogs of cAMP and certain PDE inhibitors resulted in remarkable decrease proliferation with considerable cytopathic impact on promastigotes. The mammalian phosphodiestearse inhibitor etazolate caused significant reduction in parasite load in L. donovani infected macrophages and demonstrated considerable reduction of liver and spleen parasite burden in in vivo mouse infection model. The study suggested that etazolate, with its slightest impact on mammalian host, can be repurposed for developing effective anti-leishmanials.",

    "abstract": "The condensin complex is essential for mitotic chromosome assembly and segregation during cell divisions, however, little is known about its function in post-mitotic, differentiated cells. Here we report a novel role for the condensin I subunit Cap-G in Drosophila neurons. We show that, despite not requiring condensin for mitotic chromosome compaction, post-mitotic neurons express Cap-G and that knockdown of Cap-G specifically in neurons (from their birth onwards) results in developmental arrest, behavioural defects, and dramatic gene expression changes. These include reduced expression of a subset of neuronal genes and aberrant expression of genes that are not normally expressed in the developing brain. Knockdown of Cap-G in more mature neurons also results in similar phenotypes but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we see dynamic binding of Cap-G to chromatin at distinct loci in neural stem cells and differentiated neurons. Therefore, Cap-G is essential for proper gene expression in neurons and plays an important role during the early stages of neuronal development.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/904409v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a48aborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9912b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19bd19dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@deb7f7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Scaffold proteins play pivotal role as modulators of cellular processes by operating as multipurpose conformation clamps. 14-3-3 proteins are gold-standard scaffold modules that recognize phosphoSer/Thr (pS/pT) containing conserved motifs of target proteins and confer conformational changes leading to modulation of their functional parameters. Modulation in functional activity of kinases has been attributed to their interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Herein, we have characterized Plasmodium falciparum 14-3-3 and its interaction with key kinase of the parasite, Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (CDPK1) by performing various analytical biochemistry and biophysical assays. Towards this, we annotated PF3D7_0818200 as 14-3-3 isoform I through extensive phylogenetic and comparative sequence analysis. Molecular dynamics simulation studies indicated that phosphoSer64 present in CDPK1 polypeptide sequence (61KLGpS64) behaves as canonical Mode I-type (RXXpS/pT) consensus 14-3-3 binding motif, mediating the interaction. The protein-protein interaction was validated in vitro with ELISA and SPR, which confirmed that CDPK1 interacts with 14-3-3I in a phosphorylation dependent manner, with binding affinity constant of 670 {+/-} 3.6 nM. The interaction of 14-3-3I with CDPK1 was validated with well characterized optimal 14-3-3 recognition motifs: ARSHpSYPA and RLYHpSLPA as CDPK1 mimetics, by simulation studies and ITC. Further, interaction antagonizing peptidomimetics showed growth inhibitory impact on the parasite indicating crucial physiological role of 14-3-3/CDPK1 interaction. Overall, this study characterizes 14-3-3I as a scaffold protein in the malaria parasite and unveils CDPK1 as its previously unidentified target. This sets a precedent for the rational design of 14-3-3 based PPI inhibitors by utilizing 14-3-3 recognition motif peptides, as a potential antimalarial strategy.",

    "abstract": "Two-component systems and phosphorelays play central roles in the ability of bacteria to rapidly respond to changing environments. In E. coli and related enterobacteria, the complex Rcs phosphorelay is a critical player in changing bacterial behavior in response to antimicrobial peptides, beta-lactam antibiotics, and other challenges to the cell surface. The Rcs system is unusual in that IgaA, an inner membrane protein, is essential due to its negative regulation of the RcsC/RcsD/RcsB phosphorelay. While it has previously been shown that IgaA transduces signals from the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF, how it interacts with the phosphorelay was unknown. Here we use in vivo interaction assays and genetic dissection of the critical proteins to demonstrate that IgaA interacts with the phosphorelay protein RcsD, and that this interaction is necessary for regulation. Interactions in periplasmic domains of these two proteins anchor repression of signaling. However, the signaling response depends on a weaker interaction between cytoplasmic loop 1 of IgaA and a truncated PAS domain in RcsD. A point mutation in the PAS domain increases interactions between the two proteins and is sufficient to abolish induction of this phosphorelay. RcsC, the histidine kinase that initiates phosphotransfer through the phosphorelay, appears to be indirectly regulated by IgaA via the contacts with RcsD. Unlike RcsD, and unlike many other histidine kinases, the periplasmic domain of RcsC is not necessary for the response to inducing signals. The multiple contacts between IgaA and RcsD form a poised sensing system, preventing over-activation of this apparently toxic phosphorelay but allowing it to be rapidly and quantitatively responsive to signals.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Rcs phosphorelay plays a central role in allowing enterobacteria to sense and respond to antibiotics, host-produced antimicrobials, and interactions with surfaces. A unique negative regulator, IgaA, keeps signaling from this pathway under control when it is not needed, but how it controls the phosphorelay has been unclear. We define a set of critical interactions between IgaA and the phosphotransfer protein RcsD. A periplasmic contact between IgaA and RcsD provides a necessary inhibition of Rcs signaling, modulated further by regulated interactions in the cytoplasmic domains of each protein. This multipartite interaction provides a sensitive regulatory switch.",
