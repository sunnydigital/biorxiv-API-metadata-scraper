    "abstract": "Troponin is an essential component of striated muscle and it regulates the sliding of actomyosin system in a calcium-dependent manner. Despite its importance, the structure of troponin has been elusive due to its high structural heterogeneity. In this study, we analyzed the 3D structures of murine cardiac thin filaments using a cryo-electron microscope equipped with a Volta phase plate (VPP). Contrast enhancement by a VPP enabled us to reconstruct the entire repeat of the thin filament. We determined the orientation of troponin relative to F-actin and tropomyosin, and characterized the interactions between troponin and tropomyosin. This study provides a structural basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of actomyosin system.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evolution is a powerful technique to understand how populations evolve from selective pressures imparted by the surrounding environment. With the advancement of whole-population genomic sequencing it is possible to identify and track multiple contending genotypes associated with adaptations to specific selective pressures. This approach has been used repeatedly with model species in vitro, but only rarely in vivo. Herein we report results of replicate experimentally evolved populations of Streptococcus pneumoniae propagated by repeated murine nasal colonization with the aim of identifying gene products under strong selection as well as the population-genetic dynamics of infection cycles. Frameshift mutations in one gene, dltB, responsible for incorporation of D-alanine into teichoic acids on the bacterial surface, evolved repeatedly and swept to high frequency. Targeted deletions of dltB produced a fitness advantage during initial nasal colonization coupled with a corresponding fitness disadvantage in the lungs during pulmonary infection. The underlying mechanism behind the fitness tradeoff between these two niches was found to be enhanced adherence to respiratory cells balanced by increased sensitivity to host-derived antimicrobial peptides, a finding recapitulated in the murine model. Additional mutations were also selected that are predicted to affect trace metal transport, central metabolism and regulation of biofilm production and competence. These data indicate that experimental evolution can be applied to murine models of pathogenesis to gain insight into organism-specific tissue tropisms.\n\nImportanceEvolution is a powerful force that can be experimentally harnessed to gain insight into how populations evolve in response to selective pressures. Herein we tested the applicability of experimental evolutionary approaches to gain insight into how the major human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae responds to repeated colonization events using a murine model. These studies revealed the population dynamics of repeated colonization events and demonstrated that in vivo experimental evolution resulted in highly reproducible trajectories that reflect the environmental niche encountered during nasal colonization. Mutations impacting the surface charge of the bacteria were repeatedly selected during colonization and provided a fitness benefit in this niche that was counterbalanced by a corresponding fitness defect during lung infection. These data indicate that experimental evolution can be applied to models of pathogenesis to gain insight into organism-specific tissue tropisms.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons currently affect [~]25 million people worldwide (EO_SCPLOWRKKINENC_SCPLOW et al. 2018). The global incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is estimated at [~]70 million/year (DO_SCPLOWEWANC_SCPLOW et al. 2018). Both neurodegenerative diseases and TBI remain without effective treatments. We are utilizing adult Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the mechanisms of brain regeneration with the long term goal of identifying targets for neural regenerative therapies. Like mammals, Drosophila have few proliferating cells in the adult brain. Nonetheless, within 24 hours of a Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury (PTBI) to the central brain, there is a significant increase in the number of proliferating cells. We subsequently detect both new glia and new neurons and the formation of new axon tracts that target appropriate brain regions. Glial cells divide rapidly upon injury to give rise to new glial cells. Other cells near the injury site upregulate neural progenitor genes including asense and deadpan and later give rise to the new neurons. Locomotor abnormalities observed after PTBI are reversed within two weeks of injury, supporting the idea that there is functional recovery. Together, these data indicate that adult Drosophila brains are capable of neuronal repair. We anticipate that this paradigm will facilitate the dissection of the mechanisms of neural regeneration and that these processes will be relevant to human brain repair.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) influences human brain development, but it is challenging to model PCE using animals and current cell culture techniques. Here, we developed a one-stop microfluidic platform to assemble and culture human cerebral organoids from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) to investigate the effect of PCE on early human brain development. By incorporating perfusable culture chambers, air-liquid interface, and one-stop protocol, this microfluidic platform can simplify the fabrication procedure, and produce a large number of organoids (169 organoids per 3.5 cm x 3.5 cm device area) without fusion, as compared with conventional fabrication methods. These one-stop microfluidic assembled cerebral organoids not only recapitulate early human brain structure, biology, and electrophysiology but also have minimal size variation and hypoxia. Under on-chip exposure to the psychoactive cannabinoid, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cerebral organoids exhibited reduced neuronal maturation, downregulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptors, and impaired neurite outgrowth. Moreover, transient on-chip THC treatment also decreased spontaneous firing in microfluidic assembled brain organoids. This one-stop microfluidic technique enables a simple, scalable, and repeatable organoid culture method that can be used not only for human brain organoids, but also for many other human organoids including liver, kidney, retina, and tumor organoids. This technology could be widely used in modeling brain and other organ development, developmental disorders, developmental pharmacology and toxicology, and drug screening.",

    "abstract": "In this work we develop a novel algorithm for reconstructing the genomes of ancestral individuals, given genotype or sequence data from contemporary individuals and an extended pedigree of family relationships. A pedigree with complete genomes for every individual enables the study of allele frequency dynamics and haplotype diversity across generations, including deviations from neutrality such as transmission distortion. When studying heritable diseases, ancestral haplotypes can be used to augment genome-wide association studies and track disease inheritance patterns. The building blocks of our reconstruction algorithm are segments of Identity-By-Descent (IBD) shared between two or more genotyped individuals. The method alternates between identifying a source for each IBD segment and assembling IBD segments placed within each ancestral individual. Unlike previous approaches, our method is able to accommodate complex pedigree structures with hundreds of individuals genotyped at millions of SNPs.\n\nWe apply our method to an Old Order Amish pedigree from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, whose founders came to the United States from Europe during the early 18th century. The pedigree includes 1338 individuals from the past 10 generations, 394 with genotype data. The motivation for reconstruction is to understand the genetic basis of diseases segregating in the family through tracking haplotype transmission over time. Using our algorithm thread, we are able to reconstruct an average of 224 ancestral individuals per chromosome. For these ancestral individuals, on average we reconstruct 79% of their haplotypes. We also identify a region on chromosome 16 that is difficult to reconstruct - we find that this region harbors a short Amish-specific copy number variation and the gene HYDIN. thread was developed for endogamous populations, but can be applied to any extensive pedigree with the recent generations genotyped. We anticipate that this type of practical ancestral reconstruction will become more common and necessary to understand rare and complex heritable diseases in extended families.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen analyzing complex heritable traits, it is often useful to have genomic data from many generations of an extended family, to increase the amount of information available for statistical inference. However, we typically only have genomic data from the recent generations of a pedigree, as ancestral individuals are deceased. In this work we present an algorithm, called thread, for reconstructing the genomes of ancestral individuals, given a complex pedigree and genomic data from the recent generations. Previous approaches have not been able to accommodate large datasets (both in terms of sites and individuals), made simplifying assumptions about pedigree structure, or did not tie reconstructed sequences back to specific individuals. We apply thread to a complex Old Order Amish pedigree of 1338 individuals, 394 with genotype data.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and inhibitor studies show expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) was required for the successful maternal-to-embryonic transition of mouse embryos. eIF4E was in both gametes and in the cytoplasm and pro-nuclei soon after fertilization, and at each stage of early development. Knockout (Eif4e-/-) by PiggyBac (PB) [Act-RFP] transposition caused peri-implantation embryonic lethality due to the failure of embryos to form a pluripotent epiblast. Maternal stores of eIF4E supported development up to the 2-4-cell stage after which new expression occurred from both alleles. Inhibition of the maternally acquired stores of eIF4E (4EGI-1 inhibitor) resulted in a developmental block at the 2-4-cell stage. 4E-BP1 is a hypophosphorylation-dependent negative regulator of eIF4E. mTOR activity was required for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and inhibiting 4EGI-1 retarded embryo development. eIF4E expression and activity is regulated at key embryonic transitions in the mammalian embryo and is essential for successful transition to embryonic control of development.\n\nSignificance StatementeIF4E is recognized as the rate-limiting factor for CAP-dependent translation. This work used a combination of a gene knockout model, selective pharmacological inhibition and expression analyses to investigate the expression and function of Eif4e in the early mouse embryo. It provides compelling evidence for the essential role of Eif4E in the normal processes of early mammalian embryo development, including the formation of the pluripotent epiblast and the maternal-embryonic transition. The unexpected evidence for a growth deficit in mice hypomorphic for Eif4e will be a key area of future investigation. It also provides for the first time a powerful demonstration of the utility of the PB [Act-RFP] transposon mouse model for analyzing the molecular regulation of early mammalian embryo development.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires are among the biggest factors of ecosystem change. Knowledge of fire regime (fire frequency, severity, intensity, seasonality, and distribution pattern) is an important factor in wildfire management. This paper aims to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of fires and burned areas in the Niassa Reserve between 2002-2015 using MODIS data, active fire product (MCD14ML) and burned area product (MCD64A1). For this, the annual and monthly frequencies, the trend of fires and the frequency by types of forest cover were statistically analyzed. For the analysis of the spatial dynamics of forest fires we used the Kernel density (Fixed Method). The results show a total of 20.449 forest fires and 171.067 km2 of burned areas in the period 2002-2015. Fire incidents were highest in 2015, while the largest burned areas were recorded in 2007. The relationship between increased fires and burned areas is not linear. There was a tendency for fires to increase, while for burnt areas there was stabilization. Forest fires start in May and end in December. August-October are the most frequent period, peaking in September. Fires occur predominantly in deciduous forests and mountain forests because of the type of vegetation and the amount of dry biomass. There is a monthly spatial dynamics of wildfires from east to west in the reserve. This behavior is dependent on vegetation cover type, fuel availability, and senescence.",

    "abstract": "Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are abundant antimicrobial T cells in humans, and recognize antigens derived from the microbial riboflavin biosynthetic pathway presented by the MHC-Ib-related protein (MR1). However, the mechanisms responsible for MAIT cell antimicrobial activity are not fully understood, and the efficacy of these mechanisms against antibiotic resistant bacteria has not been explored. Here, we show that MAIT cells mediate MR1-restricted antimicrobial activity against E. coli clinical strains in a manner dependent on the activity of cytolytic proteins, but independent of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or induction of apoptosis in infected cells. The combined action of the pore-forming antimicrobial protein granulysin and the serine protease granzyme B released in response to TCR-mediated recognition of MR1-presented antigen is essential to mediate control against both cell-associated and free-living E. coli. Furthermore, MAIT cell-mediated bacterial control extend to multidrug-resistant E. coli primary clinical isolates additionally resistant to carbapenems, a class of last resort antibiotics. Notably, high levels of granulysin and granzyme B in the MAIT cell secretomes directly damage bacterial cells by increasing their permeability, rendering initially resistant E. coli susceptible to the bactericidal activity of carbapenems. These findings define the role of cytolytic effector proteins in MAIT cell-mediated antimicrobial activity, and indicate that granulysin and granzyme B synergize to restore carbapenem bactericidal activity and overcome carbapenem resistance in E. coli.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPotent antimicrobial activity of human MAIT cells overcomes carbapenem-resistance in control of Escherichia coli",

    "abstract": "Objectives/HypothesisDiabetes mellitus (DM) causes ototoxicity by inducing oxidative stress, microangiopathy, and apoptosis in the cochlear sensory hair cells. The natural anti-oxidant pterostilbene (PTS) (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystylbene) has been reported to relieve oxidative stress and apoptosis in DM, but its role in diabetic-induced ototoxicity is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dose-dependent PTS on the cochlear cells of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\n\nMethodsThe study included 30 albino male Wistar rats that were randomized into five groups: non-diabetic control (Control), diabetic control (DM), and diabetic rats treated with intraperitoneal PTS at 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day during the four-week experimental period (DM+ PTS10, DM + PTS20, and DM + PTS40). Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests were performed at the beginning and end of the study. At the end of the experimental period, apoptosis in the rat cochlea was investigated using caspase-8, cytochrome-c, and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling (TUNEL). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of the following genes: CASP-3, BCL-associated X protein (BAX), and BCL-2. Body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the rat groups were evaluated.\n\nResultsThe mean DPOAE amplitude in the DM group was significantly lower than the means of the other groups (0.9-8 kHz; P < 0.001 for all). A dose-dependent increase of the mean DPOAE amplitudes was observed with PTS treatment (P < 0.05 for all). The caspase-8 and cytochrome-c protein expressions and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hair cells of the Corti organs of the DM rat group were significantly higher than those of the PTS treatment and control groups (DM > DM + PTS10 > DM + PTS20 > DM + PTS40 > Control; P < 0.05 for all). PTS treatment also reduced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the mRNA expression of the anti-apoptosis BCL2 gene and by decreasing the mRNA expressions of both the pro-apoptosis BAX gene and its effector CASP-3 in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 compared to DM for all). PTS treatment significantly improved the metabolic parameters of the diabetic rats, such as body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and MDA levels, consistent with our other findings (P < 0.05 compared to DM for all).\n\nConclusionPTS decreased the cochlear damage caused by diabetes, as confirmed by DPOAE, biochemical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings. This study reports the first in vivo findings to suggest that PTS may be a protective therapeutic agent against diabetes-induced ototoxicity.",

    "abstract": "There is a significant unmet need for appropriate wheelchairs worldwide. As a whole, studies suggest that appropriate wheelchairs have a positive impact on the quality of life and health of wheelchair users, which is consistent with the goals and outcomes in more resourced settings, and that when services are provided along with the wheelchair, the positive impact is increased. The gaps in previous research, along with the global focus on evidence-based decision making, were strong motivators for carrying out a study that contrasted the outcomes associated with different types of wheelchair service provision strategies. This study used a sample of participants randomly selected from a waitlist (N = 142) or people who used wheelchairs as their primary means of mobility. Two different groups were included, the 8-Steps group and the Standard of Care (SOC)group. The 8-Steps group (N= 118) received wheelchairs from service providers trained using the World Health Organization (WHO) 8-Step process and the SOC group (N=24) received hospital-style wheelchairs and standard care. Interviews were conducted at baseline and a follow up 3-6 months after distribution, to collect data using the following tools: International Society of Wheelchair Professionals (ISWP) Minimum Uniform Data Set (MUD), Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-Q), and Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSAT-11), and Breakdown and Adverse Consequences Questionnaire (BAC-Q).Across-group statistical comparisons were not attempted. The majority of participants from the 8-Steps group used their wheelchair every day for more than 8 hours a day. In contrast, the SOC group used their wheelchairs less than 6 hours a day. Both groups traveled less than 500 meters per day. Participants WST-Q scores were low, <65%, at both baseline and endline, with a significant decrease at endline. No significant differences were found when comparing device satisfaction across wheelchairs types. The majority (n=87; 72.7%) of 8-Steps group participants reported performing wheelchair maintenance. Less than half (n=9; 37.5%) of the SOC group reported performing maintenance activities. For both groups, the most reported maintenance activity was wiping or washing the wheelchair, and most wheelchair repairs were performed by the study participant or a family member. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of the WHO 8-steps training package for wheelchair provision. Further studies, training services, and wheelchair skills are needed in low and middle-income countries for both wheelchair users and service providers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundArgentina is located at the southern temperate range of arboviral transmission by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and has experienced a rapid increase in disease transmission in recent years. Here we present findings from an entomological surveillance study that began in Cordoba, Argentina, following the emergence of dengue in 2009.\n\nMethodsFrom 2009 to 2017, larval surveys were conducted monthly, from November to May, in 600 randomly selected households distributed across the city. From 2009 to 2013, ovitraps (n=177) were sampled weekly to monitor the oviposition activity of Ae. aegypti. We explored seasonal and interannual dynamics of entomological variables and dengue transmission. Cross correlation analysis was used to identify significant lag periods.\n\nResultsAedes aegypti were detected over the entire study period, and abundance peaked during the summer months (January to March). We identified a considerable increase in the proportion of homes with juvenile Ae. aegypti over the study period (from 5.7% of homes in 2009-10 to 15.4% of homes in 2016-17). Aedes aegypti eggs per ovitrap and larval abundance were positively associated with temperature in the same month. Autochthonous dengue transmission peaked in April, following a peak in imported dengue cases in March; autochthonous dengue was not positively associated with vector or climate variables.\n\nConclusionsThis longitudinal study provides insights into the complex dynamics of arbovirus transmission and vector populations in a temperate region of arbovirus emergence. Our findings suggest that Cordoba is well suited for arbovirus disease transmission, given the stable and abundant vector populations. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of regional human movement.\n\nAuthor summaryThere is an increasing risk of arbovirus transmission in temperate regions. Argentina is located at the southern range of dengue virus transmission by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In the last decade, epidemics of dengue fever have emerged for the first time in the city of Cordoba, Argentina. We present the study design and findings from an entomological surveillance study in Cordoba, which began following the emergence of dengue in 2009. We found that Ae. aegypti were most abundant from January to March, followed by a peak in local dengue transmission in April. Over the study period, we noted a considerable increase in the proportion of homes with Ae. aegypti. Vector indices were positively associated with warmer temperatures, which have been increasing in this region. However, the timing of local dengue transmission appears to be driven by the appearance of imported dengue cases associated with human movement. These results highlight the important role of long term surveillance studies in areas of disease emergence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn developing countries, infections caused by soil-transmitted helminthes (STH), such as Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm, pose major public health problems among the school-age children, resulting in impaired physical growth such as stunting and thinness, and cognitive development. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of STH infections, stunting and thinness, and risk factors among school-age-children in Ibadan. This becomes highly imperative in order to serve as a guide on the prevention and control.\n\nMethodA cross-sectional study was carried out in 8 primary schools at Ibadan, Oyo State Nigeria, between May and November 2018. All the school-age-children between the ages 5 and 18 years old (mean 10.4 {+/-} 1.7 years), from primary one to six took part in the study. Demographic data were obtained and STH infections was analysed in single-stool samples by Kato-Katz. Anthropometric parameters were taken to calculate Height for-age Z score (HAZ) and Body-Mass-Index (BMI) for-age Z score (BAZ), in order to determine among school-aged-children stunting and thinness respectively.\n\nResultsIn overall, 458 school-age-children partook in the study. The prevalence of STH was 9.0%, out of which 7.6%, 2.8% and 1.5% were recorded for Ascaris, Trichuris and multiparasitism respectively. The overall prevalence obtained revealed that the results of stunting and thinness (HAZ < -2SD, BAZ < -2SD) were 24.7% and 27.3% respectively based on the WHO Child Growth Standards (2007). Notably, ages of the children (P< 0.01), their classes (P=0.05), different schools (P=0.003), washing of hands after toileting (P = 0.05) were important risk factors determining STH infection, HAZ and BAZ.\n\nConclusionThe study showed that specific risk factors among school children in the studied area will make them vulnerable with high risk of STH infection, HAZ and BAZ. Effective prevention and control strategies can be well planned when risk factors and dynamics of transmission in vulnerable groups have been painstakingly identified.\n\nSummaryAscaris, Trichuris and hookworm are responsible for major public health problems among the school-age children (SAC); this has led to stunting and thinness, and impaired cognitive development. With the aim to determine prevalence of STH infections, stunting, thinness and associated risk factors, a cross-sectional study of STH infection in 8 primary schools at Ibadan, Oyo State Nigeria was conducted in 2018. School-aged children between the ages of 5 and 18 were enrolled, demographic data, stool samples and anthropometric parameters were obtained in order to determine STH infection and nutritional status. 9.0% was the prevalence of STH, the prevalence of 7.6%, 2.8% and 1.5% were recorded for Ascaris, Trichuris and multiparasitism respectively, while 24.7% and 27.3% were obtained for stunting and thinness respectively. The childrens age, hand washing after toileting and locations of the different schools were significantly correlated with STH infection, HAZ and BAZ. This study is highly imperative because its shows some risk factors associated with STH infection, HAZ and BAZ among SAC, this can serve as a guide on the prevention and control among SAC.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe mechanistic role of canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channel in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is poorly understood.\n\nObjectivesThe purpose of this study is to determine the role of TRPC6 channel in COPD and its underlying signaling mechanisms in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).\n\nMethods and Main ResultsThe present study examined the effects of TRPC6 channel on nicotine and cigarette induced HASMCs proliferation, migration and mouse airway remodeling models. mRNA and protein expression of TRPC6 were increased in cultured HASMCs incubated with nicotine using real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Nicotine treatment significantly increased TRPC6 transcriptional activity through NF-{kappa}B in HASMCs with Co-IP and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Nicotine treatment also increased ROS level in HASMCs, this increase was attenuated by Nox inhibitor apocynin. miR-135a/b-5p down-regulated mRNA and protein level of TRPC6 in HASMCs, while luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-135a/b-5p targeted at the 3-UTR of TRPC6 mRNA. microRNA-135a/b-5p (miR-135a/b-5p), with a negative correlation to TRPC6 expression, was low in airway smooth muscle of COPD patients. Cigarette-induced airway remodeling mice model also exhibited a large increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation and smooth muscle layer mass with immunohistochemistry assay, this well-characterized airway remodeling was eliminated by lentivirus of TRPC6 knockdown or miR-135a/b-5p overexpression.\n\nConclusionsNicotine exposure results in increased HASMCs proliferation and migration through NF-{kappa}B signaling. Inhalation of cigarette causes airway smooth muscle layer re-modeling due to altered TRPC6 elicited Ca2+ influx, miR-135a/b-5p abolishes this change both in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Caveolae are specialized domains of the vertebrate cell surface with a well-defined morphology and crucial roles in cell migration and mechanoprotection. Unique compositions of proteins and lipids determine membrane architectures. The precise caveolar lipid profile and the roles of the major caveolar structural proteins, caveolins and cavins, in selectively sorting lipids have not been defined. Here we used quantitative nanoscale lipid mapping together with molecular dynamic simulations to define the caveolar lipid profile. We show that caveolin1 (CAV1) and cavin1 individually sort distinct plasma membrane lipids. Intact caveolar structures composed of both CAV1 and cavin1 further generate a unique lipid nano-environment. The caveolar lipid sorting capability includes selectivities for lipid headgroups and acyl chains. Because lipid headgroup metabolism and acyl chain remodelling are tightly regulated, this selective lipid sorting may allow caveolae to act as transit hubs to direct communications among lipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking and signalling.",

This process was controlled by the tumor suppressor p53 (wild type) that upregulates Rnd3 expression in response to DNA damages associated with prolonged metaphase. Rnd3 compartmentalized RhoA activities accumulated during prolonged metaphase to drive cell-in-cell formation. Remarkably, this prolonged mitosis-induced entosis (mintosis) selectively targets non-diploid progenies for internalization, blockade of which increased aneuploidy. Thus, our work uncovered a heretofore unrecognized mechanism of mitotic surveillance for entosis, which eliminates newly-born abnormal daughter cells in a p53-depedent way to maintain genome integrity.",

Using atomic force microscopy, we detected an increase in the stiffness of epicardial cells and cortical myocardium lacking Cav1/caveolae.

    "abstract": "IntroductionTanzania has recently experienced outbreaks of dengue in two coastal regions of Dar es Salaam and Tanga. Chikungunya and Rift Valley Fever outbreaks have also been recorded in the past decade. Little is known on the burden of the arboviral disease causing viruses (Dengue, Rift Valley and Chikungunya) endemically in the inter-epidemic periods. We aimed at determining the prevalence of the dengue, rift valley and chikungunya among humans in two geo ecologically distinct sites.\n\nMethodologyThe community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Magugu in Manyara region and Mvomero in Morogoro region in Tanzania. Venous blood was collected from participants of all age groups, serum prepared from samples and subjected to ELISA tests for RVFV IgG/IgM, DENV IgG/IgM, and CHIKV IgM/IgG. Samples that were positive for IgM ELISA tests were subjected to a quantitative RT PCR for each virus. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic information. Data analysis was conducted using SPSSv22.\n\nResultsA total of 191 individuals from both sites participated in the study. Only one CHIKV was detected in Magugu site but none of the 69 participants from Magugu site was seropositive or positive for RVFV and DENV. Of the 122 individuals from Wami-Dakawa site, 16.39% (n=20) had recent exposure to RVFV while 9.83% (n=12) were recently infected by Chikungunya virus. All samples were negative by RVFV and CHIKV qPCR. Neither Infection nor exposure to DENV was observed in participants from Wami-Dakawa. Risk factors associated with RVFV and DCHIKV seropositivity were being more than 5 in a household, having no formal education and having recently travelled to an urban area.\n\nConclusionWe report an active circulation of RVFV and CHIKV in humans in Wami-Dakawa, in Mvomero district of Morogoro region during dry season, a higher rate of exposure to RVFV compared to CHIKV and an absence of circulating RVFV, DENV and CHIKV in humans in Magugu site in Manyara region.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue, Chikungunya, rift valley and other viruses constitute an important group of etiologies of fever in Tanzania. In the past decade, Tanzania has experienced DENV and RVFV at different times. While RVFV outbreaks have occurred cyclically in approximately ten-year periods in Tanzania, DENV outbreaks have been more frequent since 2010. CHIKV infection is an important but largely unrecognized illness in Tanzania. In this study, we aimed to generate baseline data on the exposure and infection status of DENV, RVFV and CHIKV by detecting antibodies to the viruses and detecting the viruses in human subjects in two geo-ecological distinct sites. Neither infection nor exposure to the viruses were in observed in Magugu site in Manyara region, northern Tanzania. There was a significant exposure to RVFV (16.39%) and CHIKV (9.83%) in Wami-Dakawa but not to DENV in either site. None of the viruses was detected by PCR in any of the sites. Potential risks for exposure to CHIKV and RVFV were Larger numbers of household members, having no formal education and having recently travelled to an urban destination. Since arbovirus outbreaks are usually unpredictable, it is crucial to undertake active surveillance for RVFV, DENV, CHIKV and other viral agents in Tanzania.",

Using SNARE and Sly1 mutants, and a new in vitro assay of fusion, we separate and assess proposed mechanisms through which Sly1 augments fusion: (i) opening the closed conformation of the Qa-SNARE Sed5; (ii) close-range tethering of vesicles to target organelles, mediated by the Sly1-specific regulatory loop; and (iii) preferential nucleation of productive trans-SNARE complexes. We show that all three mechanisms are important and operate in parallel, and we present evidence that close-range tethering is particularly important for trans-complex assembly when cis-SNARE assembly is a competing process. In addition, the autoinhibitory N-terminal Habc domain of Sed5 has at least two positive activities: the Habc domain is needed for correct Sed5 localization, and it directly promotes Sly1-dependent fusion. Remarkably, \"split Sed5,\" with the Habc domain present only as a soluble fragment, is functional both in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Plasma membranes fulfil many physiological functions. In polarized cells, different membrane compartments take on specialized roles, each being allocated correct amounts of membrane. The Drosophila tracheal system, an established tubulogenesis model, contains branched terminal cells with subcellular tubes formed by apical plasma membrane invagination. We show that apical endocytosis and late endosome-mediated trafficking determine the membrane allocation to the apical and basal membrane domains. Basal plasma membrane growth stops if endocytosis is blocked, whereas the apical membrane grows excessively. Plasma membrane is initially delivered apically, and then continuously endocytosed, together with apical and basal cargo. We describe an organelle carrying markers of late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that is abolished by inhibiting endocytosis, and which we suggest acts as transit station for membrane destined to be redistributed both apically and basally. This is based on the observation that disrupting MVB formation prevents growth of both compartments.",
