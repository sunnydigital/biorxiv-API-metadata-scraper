    "abstract": "Minimizing spatial uncertainty is essential for navigation, but the neural mechanisms remain elusive. Here we combine predictions of a simulated grid cell system with behavioural and fMRI measures in humans during virtual navigation. First, we showed that polarising cues produce anisotropy in motion parallax. Secondly, we simulated entorhinal grid cells in an environment with anisotropic information and found that self-location is decoded best when grid-patterns are aligned with the axis of greatest information. Thirdly, when exposing human participants to polarised virtual reality environments, we found that navigation performance is anisotropic, in line with the use of parallax. Eye movements showed that participants preferentially viewed polarising cues, which correlated with navigation performance. Finally, using fMRI we found that the orientation of grid-cell-like representations in entorhinal cortex anchored to the environmental axis of greatest parallax information, orthogonal to the polarisation axis. In sum, we demonstrate a crucial role of the entorhinal grid system in reducing uncertainty in representations of self-location and find evidence for adaptive spatial computations underlying entorhinal representations in service of optimal navigation.",

    "abstract": "In humans, the 813 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for transducing diverse chemical stimuli to alter cell state, and are the largest class of drug targets. Their myriad structural conformations and various modes of signaling make it challenging to understand their structure and function. Here we developed a platform to characterize large libraries of GPCR variants in human cell lines with a barcoded transcriptional reporter of G-protein signal transduction. We tested 7,800 of 7,828 possible single amino acid substitutions to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) at four concentrations of the agonist isoproterenol. We identified residues specifically important for {beta}2AR signaling, mutations in the human population that are potentially loss of function, and residues that modulate basal activity. Using unsupervised learning, we resolve residues critical for signaling, including all major structural motifs and molecular interfaces. We also find a previously uncharacterized structural latch spanning the first two extracellular loops that is highly conserved across Class A GPCRs and is conformationally rigid in both the inactive and active states of the receptor. More broadly, by linking deep mutational scanning with engineered transcriptional reporters, we establish a generalizable method for exploring pharmacogenomics, structure and function across broad classes of drug receptors.",

    "abstract": "We provide an atomic-level description of the structure and dynamics of the UUCG RNA stem-loop by combining molecular dynamics simulations with experimental data. The integration of simulations with exact nuclear Overhauser enhancements data allowed us to characterize two distinct states of this molecule. The most stable conformation corresponds to the consensus three-dimensional structure. The second state is characterized by the absence of the peculiar non-Watson-Crick interactions in the loop region. By using machine learning techniques we identify a set of experimental measurements that are most sensitive to the presence of non-native states. We find that although our MD ensemble, as well as the consensus UUCG tetraloop structures, are in good agreement with experiments, there are remaining discrepancies. Together, our results show that i) the structural interpretation of experimental data for dynamic RNAs is highly complex, even for a simple model system such as the UUCG tetraloop ii) the MD simulation overstabilize a non-native loop conformation, and iii) eNOE data support its presence with a population of {approx}10%.",

This not only intimates that mucus ensures protection against endogenous and ex-ogenous opportunists but provision for the human microbiota to reside and flourish. With the emergence of living therapeutics, engineered microbes can deliver and produce increasingly complex medicine, and controlling the mucoadhesive properties of different microbial chassis can dictate dose-response in a patient. Here we present a redesigned, in vitro, plate-based assay to measure the mucus adhesion of various probiotics. Cell-mucus interactions were isolated by immobilizing mucus to the plate surface. Binding parameters were derived for each probiotic strain by measuring cell adhesion over a wide range of cell concentrations, providing dose-dependent adhesion metrics. Surface proteins and cell components known to influence mucoadhesion were then heterologously expressed or altered in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and E. coli Nissle 1917 to control mucus-binding capacity, avidity, and cooperativity.",

    "abstract": "An inherent bottleneck of data independent acquisition (DIA) analysis by Orbitrap-based mass spectrometers is the relatively large window width due to the relatively slow scanning rate compared to TOF. Here we present a novel gas phase separation and MS acquisition method called PulseDIA-MS, which improves the specificity and sensitivity of Orbitrap-based DIA analysis. This is achieved by dividing the ordinary DIA-MS analysis covering the entire mass range into multiple injections for DIA-MS analyses with complementary windows. Using standard HeLa digests, the PulseDIA method identified 69,530 peptide precursors from 9,337 protein groups with ten MS injections of 30 min LC gradient. The PulseDIA scheme containing two complementary windows led to the highest gain of peptide and protein identifications per time unit compared to the conventional 30 min DIA method. We further applied the method to profile the proteome of 18 cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissue samples (benign and malignant) from nine patients. PulseDIA identified 7,796 protein groups in these CCA samples, with 14% increase of protein identifications, compared to the conventional DIA method. The missing value for protein matrix dropped by 7% with PulseDIA acquisition. 681 proteins were significantly dysregulated in tumorous CCA samples. Together, we presented and benchmarked an alternative DIA method with higher sensitivity and lower missing rate.",

The continually replicating adult tissue stem cells that control the integrity of many tissues of long-lived, multicellular, complex vertebrate organisms, including humans, constitute such a replicating system. Our suggestion is that somatic selection for mutations (or stable epigenetic changes) that cause an increased rate of adult tissue stem cell proliferation, and their long-term persistence, at the expense of normal differentiation, is a major key to the ageing process. Once an organism has passed the reproductive age, there is no longer any significant counterselection at the organismal level to this inevitable cellular level Darwinian process.\n\nAuthor ContributionsWFB conceived the project.

    "abstract": "The effective sample size (ESS) is a quantity estimated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with related individuals and/or linear mixed models used in analysis. ESS originally measured relative power in family-based GWAS and has recently become important for correcting GWAS summary statistics in post-GWAS analyses. However, existing ESS approaches have been overlooked and based on empirical estimation. This work presents an analytical form of ESS in mixed-model GWAS of quantitative traits, which is derived using the expectation of quadratic form and validated in extensive simulations. We illustrate the performance and relevance of our ESS estimator in common GWAS scenarios and analytically show that (i) family-based studies are consistently underpowered compared to studies of unrelated individuals of the same sample size; (ii) conditioning on polygenic genetic effect by linear mixed models boosts power; and (iii) power of detecting gene-environment interaction can be substantially gained or lost in family-based designs depending on exposure distribution. We further analyze UK Biobank dataset in two samples of 336,347 unrelated and 68,910 related individuals. Analysis in unrelated individuals reveals a high accuracy of our ESS estimator compared to the existing empirical approach; and analysis of related individuals suggests that the loss in effective sample size due to relatedness is at most 0.94x. Overall, we provide an analytical form of ESS for guiding GWAS designs and processing summary statistics in post-GWAS analyses.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study determined whether hypercholesterolemia would contribute to both the initiation and progression of angiotensin (Ang)II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in mice.\n\nMethods and ResultsTo determine whether hypercholesterolemia accelerates the initiation of AAAs, male low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor -/- mice were either fed one week of Western diet prior to starting AngII infusion or initiated Western diet one week after starting AngII infusion. During the first week of AngII infusion, mice fed normal diet had less luminal expansion of the suprarenal aorta compared to those initiated Western diet after the first week of AngII infusion. The two groups achieved comparable luminal dilation on week 2 through week 6 of AngII infusion as monitored by ultrasound. To determine whether hypercholesterolemia contributed to the progression of established AAAs, male LDL receptor -/- mice were fed Western diet and infused with AngII for 4 weeks. Mice with established AAAs were then stratified into two groups based on luminal diameters measured by ultrasound. While AngII infusion was continued for another 8 weeks in both groups, mice in one group were continuously fed Western diet, but diet in the other group was switched to normal laboratory diet. In the latter group, plasma cholesterol concentrations were reduced rapidly to approximately 500 mg/dl within one week after the diet was switched from Western diet to normal laboratory diet. Luminal expansion progressed constantly in mice continuously fed Western diet, whereas no continuous expansion was detected in mice that were switched to normal laboratory diet.\n\nConclusionsHypercholesterolemia accelerates both the initiation of AAAs and progression of established AAAs in AngII-infused male LDL receptor -/- mice.\n\nClinical RelevanceHypercholesterolemia is modestly associated with AAAs in observational or retrospective clinical studies. It is not feasible to study whether hypercholesterolemia contributes to the initiation of AAAs or progression of established AAAs in human. This study using AngII-induced AAA mouse model provides solid evidence that hypercholesterolemia contributes to both the initiation and progression of AAAs, supporting that statin therapy at any stage of AAA development may be beneficial to hypercholesterolemic patients with AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a major source of transcriptome and proteome diversity in higher organisms. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of AS through a range of molecular mechanisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the AS regulators NSRa and b, which affect auxin-driven lateral root formation, can interact with the ALTERNATIVE SPLICING COMPETITOR (ASCO) lncRNA. Here, we analyzed the effect of the knockdown and overexpression of ASCO at genome-wide level and found a high number of deregulated and differentially spliced genes, related to flagellin responses and biotic stress. In agreement, roots from ASCO-knocked down plants are more sensitive to flagellin. Surprisingly, only a minor subset of genes overlapped with the AS defects of the nsra/b double mutant. Using biotin-labelled oligonucleotides for RNA-mediated ribonucleoprotein purification, we found that ASCO binds to the highly conserved core spliceosome component PRP8a. ASCO deregulation impairs the recognition of specific flagellin-related transcripts by PRP8a and SmD1b, another spliceosome component, suggesting that ASCO function regulates AS through the interaction with multiple splicing factors. Hence, lncRNAs may interact in a dynamic network with many splicing factors to modulate transcriptome reprogramming in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle possesses an outstanding capacity to regenerate upon injury due to the adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs) activity. This ability requires the proper balance between MuSCs expansion and differentiation which is critical for muscle homeostasis and contributes, if deregulated, to muscle diseases. Here, we functionally characterize a novel chromatin-associated lncRNA, lnc-Rewind, which is expressed in murine MuSCs and conserved in human. We find that, in mouse, lnc-Rewind acts as an epigenetic regulator of MuSCs proliferation and expansion by influencing the expression of skeletal muscle genes and several components of the WNT (Wingless-INT) signalling pathway. Among them, we identified the nearby Wnt7b gene as a direct lnc-Rewind target. We show that lnc-Rewind interacts with the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase and mediates the in cis repression of Wnt7b by H3K9me2 deposition. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of adult muscle stem cells fate by lncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Histone chaperones mediate assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes and participate in essentially all DNA-dependent cellular processes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, loss-of-functions of FAS1 or FAS2 subunits of the H3-H4 histone chaperone complex CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR 1(CAF-1) has a dramatic effect on plant morphology, growth and overall fitness. Altered chromatin compaction, systematic loss of repetitive elements or increased DNA damage clearly demonstrate the severity of CAF-1 dysfunction. How histone chaperone molecular networks change without a functional CAF-1 remains elusive. Here we present an intriguing observation that disruption of the H2A-H2B histone chaperone NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN 1 (NAP1) supresses FAS1 loss-of function. The quadruple mutant fas1nap1;1-3 shows wild-type growth and decreased sensitivity to genotoxic stress. Chromatin of fas1nap1;1-3 plants is less accessible to micrococcal nuclease and progressive loss of telomeres and 45S rDNA is supressed. Interestingly, the strong genetic interaction between FAS1 and NAP1 does not occur via direct protein-protein interaction. We propose that NAP1;1-3 play an essential role in nucleosome assembly in fas1, thus their disruption abolishes fas1 defects. Our data altogether reveal a novel function of NAP1 proteins, unmasked by CAF-1 dysfunction. It emphasizes the importance of a balanced composition of chromatin and shed light on the histone chaperone molecular network.",

Here, R1441C and G2019S knock-in mice enabled thorough evaluation of dendritic spines and synapses on pathway-identified SPNs. Biochemical synaptic preparations and super-resolution imaging revealed increased levels and altered organization of glutamatergic AMPA receptors in LRRK2 mutants. Relatedly, decreased frequency of excitatory post-synaptic currents accompanied changes in dendritic spine nano-architecture, and single-synapse currents, evaluated using 2-photon glutamate uncaging.

In this study we rigorously quantified Zn2+, Ca2+ and pH dynamics in dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons stimulated with bath application of high KCl or glutamate. While both stimulation methods yielded Zn2+ signals, Ca2+ influx, and acidification, glutamate stimulation induced more sustained high intracellular Ca2+ and a larger increase in intracellular Zn2+. However, the stimulation-induced pH change was similar between conditions, indicating that a different cellular change is responsible for the stimulation-dependent difference in Zn2+ signal.

    "abstract": "Cell to cell communication facilitates tissue development and physiology. Under pathological conditions, brain tumors disrupt glia-neuron communication signals that in consequence, promote tumor expansion at the expense of surrounding healthy tissue. The glioblastoma is the most aggressive and frequent brain tumor. This type of glioma expands and infiltrates into the brain, causing neuronal degeneration and neurological decay, among other symptoms. Here we describe how the glioblastoma produce ImpL2, an antagonist of the insulin pathway, which is regulated by the microRNA miR-8. ImpL2 targets neighboring neurons and causes mitochondrial disruption as well as synapse loss, both early symptoms of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, glioblastoma progression requires insulin pathway attenuation in neurons. Restoration of neuronal insulin activity is sufficient to rescue the synapse loss and to delay the premature death caused by glioma. Therefore, signals from GB to neuron emerge as a potential field of study to prevent neurodegeneration and to develop anti-tumoral strategies.\n\nSignificance StatementGlioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive type of brain tumour and currently there is no cure or effective treatment. Patients course with neurological decay and previous data in animal models indicate that GB cause a neurodegenerative process. We describe here a molecule named ImpL2 that is produced by GB cells and impact on neighbouring neurons. ImpL2 is an antagonist of the insulin pathway and signaling reduction in neurons causes mitochondrial defects and synapse loss. These mechanisms underlying GB-induced neurodegeneration plays a central role in the premature death caused by this tumour. Restoration of insulin signaling in neurons prevents tumour progression and rescues the lethality caused by GB in Drosophila models.",
