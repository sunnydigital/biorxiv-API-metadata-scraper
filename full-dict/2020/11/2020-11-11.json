    "abstract": "The study of unconscious processing requires a measure of conscious awareness. Awareness measures can be either subjective (based on participants report) or objective (based on perceptual performance). The preferred awareness measure depends on the theoretical position about consciousness, and may influence conclusions about the extent of unconscious processing and about the neural correlates of consciousness. We obtained fMRI measurements from 43 subjects while they viewed masked faces and houses that were either subjectively or objectively invisible. We show that neural representations of objectively invisible faces and houses are limited to visual (shape-related) object properties, while subjectively invisible stimuli are processed up to more abstract, categorical levels of representation. These results demonstrate that the hypothesized extent of unconscious information processing is determined by the measurement approach. Furthermore, our data show that subjective and objective approaches are associated with different neural correlates of consciousness and thus have implications for neural theories of consciousness.",

    "abstract": "While feed-forward activity may suffice for recognizing objects in isolation, additional visual operations that aid object recognition might be needed for real-world scenes. One such additional operation is figure-ground segmentation; extracting the relevant features and locations of the target object while ignoring irrelevant features. In this study of 60 participants, we show objects on backgrounds of increasing complexity to investigate whether recurrent computations are increasingly important for segmenting objects from more complex backgrounds. Three lines of evidence show that recurrent processing is critical for recognition of objects embedded in complex scenes. First, behavioral results indicated a greater reduction in performance after masking objects presented on more complex backgrounds; with the degree of impairment increasing with increasing background complexity. Second, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements showed clear differences in the evoked response potentials (ERPs) between conditions around 200ms - a time point beyond feed-forward activity and object decoding based on the EEG signal indicated later decoding onsets for objects embedded in more complex backgrounds. Third, Deep Convolutional Neural Network performance confirmed this interpretation; feed-forward and less deep networks showed a higher degree of impairment in recognition for objects in complex backgrounds compared to recurrent and deeper networks. Together, these results support the notion that recurrent computations drive figure-ground segmentation of objects in complex scenes.",

    "abstract": "let-7 is a highly conserved microRNA with critical functions integral to cell fate specification and developmental progression in diverse animals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, let-7 is a component of the heterochronic (developmental timing) gene regulatory network, and loss-of-function mutations of let-7 result in lethality during the larval to adult transition due to misregulation of the conserved let-7 target, lin-41. To date, no bilaterian animal lacking let-7 has been characterized. In this study, we identify a cohort of nematode species within the genus Caenorhabditis, closely related to C. elegans, that lack the let-7 microRNA, owing to absence of the let-7 gene. Using C. sulstoni as a representative let-7-lacking species to characterize normal larval development in the absence of let-7, we demonstrate that, except for the lack of let-7, the heterochronic gene network is otherwise functionally conserved. We also report that species lacking let-7 contain a group of divergent let-7 orthologs -- also known as the let-7-family of microRNAs -- that have apparently assumed the role of targeting the lin-41 mRNA.\n\nSummary StatementWe have identified a group of Caenorhabditis species that lack let-7a, an otherwise highly conserved and nearly ubiquitous microRNA that was previously thought to be critical to bilaterian animal development.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLong read sequencing has increased the accuracy and completeness of assemblies of various organisms genomes in recent months. Similarly, spliced alignments of long read RNA sequencing hold the promise of delivering much longer transcripts of existing and novel isoforms in known genes without the need for error-prone transcript assemblies from short reads. However, low coverage and high-error rates potentially hamper the widespread adoption of long-read spliced alignments in annotation updates and isoform-level expression quantifications.\n\nResultsAddressing these issues, we first develop a simulation of error modes for both Oxford Nanopore and PacBio CCS spliced-alignments. Based on this we train a Random Forest classifier to assign new long-read alignments to one of two error categories, a novel category, or label them as non-error. We use this classifier to label reads from the spliced-alignments of the popular aligner minimap2, run on three long read sequencing datasets, including NA12878 from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio CCS, as well as a PacBio SKBR3 cancer cell line. Finally, we compare the intron chains of the three long read alignments against individual splice sites, short read assemblies, and the output from the FLAIR pipeline on the same samples.\n\nOur results demonstrate a substantial lack of precision in determining exact splice sites for long reads during alignment on both platforms while showing some benefit from postprocessing. This work motivates the need for both better aligners and additional post-alignment processing to adjust incorrectly called putative splice-sites and clarify novel transcripts support.\n\nAvailability and implementationSource code for the random forest implemented in python is available at https://github.com/schatzlab/LongTron under the MIT license.

    "abstract": "The predominant approach for antibody generation remains animal immunization, which can yield exceptionally selective and potent antibody clones owing to the powerful evolutionary process of somatic hypermutation. However, animal immunization is inherently slow, has poor compatibility with certain antigens (e.g., integral membrane proteins), and suffers from self-tolerance and immunodominance, which limit the functional spectrum of antibodies that can be obtained. Here, we describe Autonomous Hypermutation yEast surfAce Display (AHEAD), a synthetic recombinant antibody generation technology that imitates somatic hypermutation inside engineered yeast. In AHEAD, antibody fragments are encoded on an error-prone orthogonal DNA replication system, resulting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations that continuously mutate surface-displayed antibody repertoires. Simple cycles of yeast culturing and enrichment for antigen binding drive the evolution of high-affinity antibody clones in a readily parallelizable process that takes as little as 2 weeks. We applied AHEAD to generate nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, a GPCR, and other targets. The SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, concurrently evolved from an open-source naive nanobody library in 8 independent experiments, reached subnanomolar affinities through the sequential fixation of multiple mutations over 3-8 AHEAD cycles that saw [~]580-fold and [~]925-fold improvements in binding affinities and pseudovirus neutralization potencies, respectively. These experiments highlight the defining speed, parallelizability, and effectiveness of AHEAD and provide a template for streamlined antibody generation at large with salient utility in rapid response to current and future viral outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads to loss of mankind and global economic stability. The continuous spreading of the disease and its pathogenesis takes millions of lives of peoples and the unavailability of appropriate therapeutic strategy makes it much more severe. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity. The role of several TLRs in immunomodulation of host by SARS-CoV-2 is recently demonstrated. However, the functionality of human intracellular TLRs including TLR3,7,8 and 9 is still being untested for sensing of viral RNA. This study is hoped to rationalize the comparative binding and sensing of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA towards the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drive these reactions. Our in-silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs shown that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are potent enough to bind with TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7 and trigger downstream cascade reactions, and may be used as an option for validation of therapeutic option and immunomodulation against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by pulmonary edema, viral pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, coagulopathy and inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to infect and damage ciliated epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. In alveoli, gas exchange occurs across an epithelial-endothelial barrier that ties respiration to endothelial cell (EC) regulation of edema, coagulation and inflammation. How SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates vascular functions to cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients remains an enigma focused on dysregulated EC responses. Whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects functions of the endothelium remains to be resolved and critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that primary human ECs lack ACE2 receptors at protein and RNA levels, and that SARS-CoV-2 is incapable of directly infecting ECs derived from pulmonary, cardiac, brain, umbilical vein or kidney tissues. In contrast, pulmonary ECs transduced with recombinant ACE2 receptors are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and result in high viral titers ([~]1x107/ml), multinucleate syncytia and EC lysis. SARS-CoV-2 infection of ACE2-expressing ECs elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. The inability of SARS-CoV-2 to directly infect and lyse ECs without ACE2 expression explains the lack of vascular hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients and indicates that the endothelium is not a primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with SARS-CoV-2 indirectly activating EC programs that regulate thrombosis and endotheliitis in COVID-19 patients, and focus strategies on therapeutically targeting epithelial and inflammatory responses that activate the endothelium or initiate limited ACE2 independent EC infection.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 infects pulmonary epithelial cells through ACE2 receptors and causes ARDS. COVID-19 causes progressive respiratory failure resulting from diffuse alveolar damage and systemic coagulopathy, thrombosis and capillary inflammation that tie alveolar responses to EC dysfunction. This has prompted theories that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects ECs through ACE2 receptors, yet SARS-CoV-2 antigen has not been co-localized with ECs and prior studies indicate that ACE2 co-localizes with alveolar epithelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, not ECs. Here we demonstrate that primary human ECs derived from lung, kidney, heart, brain and umbilical veins require expression of recombinant ACE2 receptors in order to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 lytically infects ACE2-ECs and elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis resulting from indirect EC activation, or infection of a small subset of ECs by an ACE2 independent mechanism, that transform rationales and targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for a better understanding of the evolution of virus-host conflicts. ORF3a in both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are ion channels (viroporins) and involved in virion assembly and membrane budding. Using sensitive profile-based homology detection methods, we unify the SARS-CoV ORF3a family with several families of viral proteins, including ORF5 from MERS-CoVs, proteins from beta-CoVs (ORF3c), alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), most importantly, the Matrix (M) proteins from CoVs, and more distant homologs from other nidoviruses. By sequence analysis and structural modeling, we show that these viral families utilize specific conserved polar residues to constitute an ion-conducting pore in the membrane. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of these families, objectively establish the common origin of the M proteins of CoVs and Toroviruses. We show that the divergent ORF3a/ORF3b/ORF5 families represent a duplication stemming from the M protein in alpha- and beta-CoVs. By phyletic profiling of major structural components of primary nidoviruses, we present a model for their role in virion assembly of CoVs, ToroVs and Arteriviruses. The unification of diverse M/ORF3 ion channel families in a wide range of nidoviruses, especially the typical M protein in CoVs, reveal a conserved, previously under-appreciated role of ion channels in virion assembly, membrane fusion and budding. We show that the M and ORF3 are under differential evolutionary pressures; in contrast to the slow evolution of M as core structural component, the CoV-ORF3 clade is under selection for diversification, which indicates it is likely at the interface with host molecules and/or immune attack.\n\nIMPORTANCECoronaviruses (CoVs) have become a major threat to human welfare as the causative agents of several severe infectious diseases, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the recently emerging human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid spread, severity of these diseases, as well as the potential re-emergence of other CoV-associated diseases have imposed a strong need for a thorough understanding of function and evolution of these CoVs. By utilizing robust domain-centric computational strategies, we have established homologous relationships between many divergent families of CoV proteins, including SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, MERS-CoV ORF5, proteins from both beta-CoVs (ORF3c) and alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), the typical CoV Matrix proteins, and many distant homologs from other nidoviruses. We present evidence that they are active ion channel proteins, and the Cov-specific ORF3 clade proteins are under selection for rapid diversification, suggesting they might have been involved in interfering host molecules and/or immune attack.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought an urgent need for animal models to study the pathogenicity of the virus. Herein, we generated and characterized a novel mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, named MASCp36, that causes severe acute respiratory symptoms and mortality in standard laboratory mice. Particularly, this model exhibits age and gender related skewed distribution of mortality akin to severe COVID-19, and the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of MASCp36 was 58 PFU in 9-month-old, male BALB/c mice. Deep sequencing identified three amino acid substitutions, N501Y, Q493H, and K417N, subsequently emerged at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MASCp36, during in vivo passaging. All three mutations in RBD significantly enhanced the binding affinity to its endogenous receptor, mouse ACE2 (mACE2). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of human ACE2 (hACE2) or mACE2 in complex with the RBD of MASCp36 at 3.1 to 3.7 angstrom resolution elucidates molecular basis for the receptor-binding switch driven by specific amino acid substitutions. Interestingly, N501Y and Q493H enhanced the binding affinity to human ACE2 (hACE2); while triple mutations N501Y/Q493H/K417N decreased affinity to hACE2, thus led to the reduced infectivity of MASCp36 to human cells. Our study not only provides a robust platform for studying the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and rapid evaluation of coutermeasures against SARS-CoV-2, but also unveils the molecular mechanism for the rapid adaption and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in human and animals.\n\nOne sentence summaryA mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain that harbored specific amino acid substitutions in the RBD of S protein showed 100% mortality in aged, male BALB/c mice.",

    "abstract": "E1 and E2 (E1E2), the entry proteins of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), are unlike that of any other virus yet described, and the detailed molecular mechanisms of HCV entry/fusion remain unknown. Hypervariable region-1 (HVR-1) of E2 is a putative intrinsically disordered protein tail. Here, we demonstrate that HVR-1 has an autoinhibitory function that suppresses the activity of E1E2 on free virions; this is dependent on its conformational entropy. Crucially, to allow entry, this mechanism is turned off by host receptor interactions at the cell surface. Thus, HVR-1 is akin to a safety catch on E1E2 activity. Mutations that reduce conformational entropy in HVR-1, or genetic deletion of HVR-1, turn off the safety catch to generate hyper-reactive HCV that exhibits enhanced virus entry but is thermally unstable and acutely sensitive to neutralising antibodies. Therefore, the HVR-1 safety catch controls the efficiency of virus entry and maintains resistance to neutralising antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The male-specific lethal dosage compensation complex (MSL complex or DCC), which consists of five proteins and two non-coding roX RNAs, is necessary for the transcriptional enhancement of X-linked genes to compensate for the sex chromosome monosomy in Drosophila XY males, compared with XX females. MSL2 is a single protein component of the DCC that is expressed only in males and is essential for the specific recruitment of the DCC to the high-affinity \"entry\" sites (HASs) on the X chromosome. MSL2, together with MSL1, forms the heterotetrameric DCC core. Here, we demonstrated that the N-terminal unstructured region of MSL1 interacts with many different DNA-binding proteins that contain clusters of the C2H2 zinc-finger domains. Amino acid deletions in the N-terminal region of MSL1 strongly affect the binding of the DCC to the HASs on the male X chromosome. However, the binding of MSL2 to autosomal promoters was unaffected by amino acid deletions in MSL1. Males expressing mutant variants of MSL1 died during the larvae stage, demonstrating the critical role played by the N-terminal region in DCC activity. Our results suggest that MSL1 interacts with a variety of DNA-binding proteins to increase the specificity of DCC recruitment to the male X chromosome.\n\nBulletsO_LIThe N-terminal region of MSL1 interacts with 14 C2H2-type zinc-finger DNA-binding proteins\nC_LIO_LIThe N-terminus of MSL1 is critical for the specific recruitment of the MSL complex to the X chromosome\nC_LIO_LIThe N-terminus of MSL1 is important for the binding of MSL2 to a small fraction of autosomal promoters\nC_LI",

How Erk is inhibited in vivo to promote naive pluripotency remains largely unknown. By combining live cell imaging and quantitative proteomics we found that FGF2, a known Erk activator and pro-differentiation cue, induces instead long-term Erk inhibition in both ES cells and mouse embryos. We show that Erk inhibition results from a FGF2-induced incoherent feedforward loop. Importantly, we see that FGF2 induces up-regulation of naive pluripotency factors, down-regulation of DNA methylation by suppression of de novo DNA methylases thereby helping maintain naive pluripotency. We show that FGF2 is expressed maternally and propose that integration of signals from the embryos niche may contribute to the generation of embryonic lineages with the right cell proportions. We suggest that feedforward regulation may play a role driving transient, reversible developmental transitions.",

Here, we show that the human SPC exists in two functional paralogs with distinct proteolytic subunits. We determined the atomic structures of both paralogs using electron cryo-microscopy and structural proteomics. The active site is formed by a catalytic triad and abuts the ER membrane, where a transmembrane window collectively formed by all subunits locally thins the bilayer.

Although ELOVLs are implicated in common diseases including insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and Parkinsons, their underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we report the structure of the human ELOVL7 elongase, which includes an inverted transmembrane barrel structure surrounding a 35 [A] long tunnel containing a covalently-attached product analogue. The structure reveals the substrate binding sites in the tunnel and an active site deep in the membrane including the canonical ELOVL HxxHH sequence. This indicates a ping-pong mechanism for catalysis, involving unexpected covalent histidine adducts. The unusual substrate-binding arrangement and chemistry suggest mechanisms for selective ELOVL inhibition, relevant for diseases where VLCFAs accumulate such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that the large diversity of protein functions and structures is derived from the broad spectrum of physicochemical properties of the 20 canonical amino acids. According to the generally accepted hypothesis, protein evolution was continuously associated with enrichment of this alphabet, increasing stability, specificity and spectrum of catalytic functions. Aromatic amino acids are considered the latest addition to genetic code.\n\nThe main objective of this study was to test whether enzymatic catalysis can spare the aromatic amino acids (aromatics) by determining the effect of amino acid alphabet reduction on structure and function of dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK). We designed two mutant variants of a putative DPCK from Aquifex aeolicus by substituting (i) Tyr, Phe and Trp or (ii) all aromatics (including His), i.e. [~]10% of the total sequence. Their structural characterization indicates that removal of aromatic amino acids may support rich secondary structure content although inevitably impairs a firm globular arrangement. Both variants still possess ATPase activity, although with 150-300 times lower efficiency in comparison with the wild-type phosphotransferase activity. The transfer of the phosphate group to the dephospho-CoA substrate is however heavily uncoupled and only one of the variants is still able to perform the reaction.\n\nHere we provide support to the hypothesis that proteins in the early stages of life could support at least some enzymatic activities, despite lower efficiencies resulting from the lack of a firm hydrophobic core. Based on the presented data we hypothesize that further protein scaffolding role may be provided by ligands upon binding.\n\nSignificanceAll extant proteins rely on the standard coded amino acid alphabet. However, early proteins lacked some of these amino acids that were incorporated into the genetic code only after the evolution of their respective metabolic pathways, aromatic amino acids being among the last additions. This is intriguing because of their crucial role in hydrophobic core packing, indispensable for enzyme catalysis.\n\nWe designed two aromatics-less variants of a highly conserved enzyme from the CoA synthesis pathway, capable of enzyme catalysis and showing significant ordering upon substrate binding. To our knowledge, this is the first example of enzyme catalysis in complete absence of aromatic amino acids and presents a possible mechanism of how aromatics-less enzymes could potentially support an early biosphere.",

G4 unwinding occurs during S phase via an unknown mechanism. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we define a three-step G4 unwinding mechanism that is coupled to DNA replication. First, the replicative helicase (CMG) stalls at a leading strand G4 structure. Second, the DHX36 helicase mediates the bypass of the CMG past the intact G4 structure, which allows approach of the leading strand to the G4. Third, G4 structure unwinding by the FANCJ helicase enables the DNA polymerase to synthesize past the G4 motif. A G4 on the lagging strand template does not stall CMG, but still requires DNA replication for unwinding. DHX36 and FANCJ have partially redundant roles, conferring robustness to this pathway. Our data reveal a novel genome maintenance pathway that promotes faithful G4 replication thereby avoiding genome instability.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly become a global health crisis since the first report of infection in December of 2019. However, the infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and its comprehensive protein-level interactions with hosts remain unclear. There is a massive amount of under-utilized data and knowledge about RNA viruses highly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and their hosts proteins. More in-depth and more comprehensive analyses of that knowledge and data can shed new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal potential risks. In this work, we constructed a multi-layer virus-host interaction network to incorporate these data and knowledge. A machine learning-based method, termed Infection Mechanism and Spectrum Prediction (IMSP), was developed to predict virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2, which deserved public health attention, and eight highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins. Given a new virus, IMSP can utilize existing knowledge and data about other highly relevant viruses to predict multi-scale interactions between the new virus and potential hosts.",

    "abstract": "Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that preys upon gram-negative bacteria. As such, B. bacteriovorus has the potential to control antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biofilm populations. To survive and reproduce, B. bacteriovorus must locate and infect a host cell. However, in the temporary absence of prey, it is largely unknown how B. bacteriovorus modulate their motility patterns in response to physical or chemical environmental cues to optimize their energy expenditure. To investigate B. bacteriovorus predation strategy, we track and quantify their motion by measuring speed distributions and velocity autocorrelations as a function of starvation time. An initial unimodal speed distribution, relaxing to that expected for pure diffusion at long times, may be expected. Instead, we observe a complex, non-Brownian, search strategy as evidenced by distinctly bimodal speed distributions. That is, for an increasing amount of time over which B. bacteriovorus is starved, we observe a progressive re-weighting from a fast mode to a slow mode in the speed distribution obtained over consecutive frames. By contrast to its predator, B. bacteriovorus prey, Escherichia coli exhibits almost immediate decrease to a speed expected from passive diffusion following resuspension from rich to poor media. Distributions of trajectory-averaged speeds for B. bacteriovorus are largely unimodal, indicating nontrivial switching between fast and slow swimming modes within individual observed trajectories rather than there being distinct fast and slow populations. We also find that B. bacteriovorus slow speed mode is not merely caused by the diffusion of inviable bacteria as subsequent spiking experiments show that bacteria can be resuscitated and bimodality restored. Indeed, starved B. bacteriovorus may modulate the frequency and duration of active swimming as a means of balancing energy consumption and procurement. Our results are evidence of a nontrivial predation strategy, which contrasts with the comparatively simple search pattern of its prey, in response to environmental cues.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEBdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that is poised to help control gram-negative bacterial populations in environmental and clinical settings. In order to locate its prey in solution, B. bacteriovorus must expend energy in order to fight hydrodynamic drag. This raises the question as to how B. bacteriovorus should expend its energy reserves in the absence of chemical cues from its prey. Here, we show that B. bacteriovorus adapts its motility to minimize energy expenditure (due to fighting drag in swimming) upon prolonged starvation by exploiting two modes of motility. This is in sharp contrast to its prey, E. coli, which shows little active motility under starvation conditions.",

    "abstract": "The viral protease domain (NS3pro) of dengue virus is essential for virus replication and its cofactor NS2B is indispensable for the proteolytic function. Although several NS3pro-NS2B complex structures have been obtained, the dynamic property of the complex remains poorly understood. Using NMR relaxation techniques, here we found that NS3pro-NS2B exists in both closed and open conformations which are in dynamic equilibrium on a sub-millisecond timescale in aqueous solution. Our structural information indicates that the C-terminal region of NS2B is disordered in the open conformation but folded in the closed conformation. Using mutagenesis, we showed that the closed-open conformational equilibrium can be shifted by changing NS2B stability. Moreover, we revealed that the proteolytic activity of NS3pro-NS2B correlates well with the population of the closed conformation. Our results suggest that the closed-open conformational equilibrium can be used by both nature and man to control the replication of dengue virus.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe dengue virus protease is an attractive target for drug development against dengue fever as it is essential for virus replication. However, its structure-based drug development has been unsuccessful due to the shallow substrate-binding pocket. The study presented here demonstrates for the first time that the protease activity can be reduced dramatically by shifting the closed-open conformational equilibrium of the protease in complex with its cofactor from the majority of a closed conformation to the majority of an open conformation. Moreover, our work clarifies the structure of the open conformation which has been elusive for a long time. Our results also suggest an alternative method for designing protease inhibitors based on the closed-open conformational equilibrium.",

Genetic depletion of ASCL1 in MYC-driven SCLC dramatically inhibits tumor initiation and progression to the NEUROD1+ subtype of SCLC. Surprisingly, ASCL1 loss converts tumors to a SOX9+ mesenchymal/neural-crest-stem-like state that can differentiate into RUNX2+ bone tumors. ASCL1 represses SOX9 expression, as well as WNT and NOTCH developmental pathways, consistent with human gene expression data. Together, SCLC demonstrates remarkable cell fate plasticity with ASCL1 repressing the emergence of non-endodermal stem-like fates that have the capacity for bone differentiation.",

We evaluated eight lines derived from crossing Paragon and Baj (late and early flowering respectively), vernalisation insensitive, to study the detailed effects of two newly identified QTLs, Eps-7D and Eps-2B and their interactions under field conditions. The effect of both QTLs were minor but their effect was modulated by the allelic status of the other. While the magnitude of effect of these QTLs on anthesis was similar, they are associated with very different profiles of pre-anthesis development which also depends on their interaction. Eps-7D affected both duration before and after terminal spikelet while not affecting final leaf number (FLN) so Eps-7D-early had a faster rate of leaf appearance. Eps-2B acted more specifically in the early reproductive phase and slightly altered FLN without affecting the leaf appearance rate. Both Eps-7D and 2B affected the spike fertility by altering the rate of floret development and mortality. The effect of the latter was very small but consistent in that the -late allele tended to produced more fertile florets.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-{kappa}B) is one of the most important transcription factors involved in the regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways. Inappropriate activation of these pathways has been linked to autoimmunity and cancers. Emerging experimental evidences have been showing the existence of elaborate spatial organizations for various molecular components in the pathways. One example is the scaffold protein tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF). While most TRAF proteins form trimeric quaternary structure through their coiled-coil regions, the N-terminal region of some members in the family can further be dimerized. This dimerization of TRAF trimers can drive them into higher-order clusters as a response to receptor stimulation, which functions as a spatial platform to mediate the downstream poly-ubiquitination. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the TRAF protein clustering and its functional impacts are not well-understood. In this article, we developed a hybrid simulation method to tackle this problem. The assembly of TRAF-based signaling platform at the membrane-proximal region is modeled with spatial resolution, while the dynamics of downstream signaling network, including the negative feedbacks through various signaling inhibitors, is simulated as stochastic chemical reactions. These two algorithms are further synchronized under a multiscale simulation framework. Using this computational model, we illustrated that the formation of TRAF signaling platform can trigger an oscillatory NF-{kappa}B response. We further demonstrated that the temporal patterns of downstream signal oscillations are closely regulated by the spatial factors of TRAF clustering, such as the geometry and energy of dimerization between TRAF trimers. In general, our study sheds light on the basic mechanism of NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway and highlights the functional importance of spatial regulation within the pathway. The simulation framework also showcases its potential of application to other signaling pathways in cells.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a leading cause of pneumonia in children under five years old. Co-infection by pneumococci and respiratory viruses enhances disease severity. Little is known about pneumococcal co-infections with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Here, we developed a novel infant mouse model of co-infection using Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM), a murine analogue of RSV, to examine the dynamics of co-infection in the upper respiratory tract, an anatomical niche that is essential for host-to-host transmission and progression to disease. Coinfection increased damage to the nasal tissue and increased production of the chemokine CCL3. Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal density and shedding in nasal secretions were increased by co-infection. In contrast, co-infection reduced PVM loads in the nasopharynx, an effect that was independent of pneumococcal strain and the order of infection. We showed this  antagonistic effect was abrogated using a pneumococcal mutant deficient in capsule production and incapable of nasopharyngeal carriage. The pneumococcal-mediated reduction in PVM loads was caused by accelerated viral clearance from the nasopharynx. Although these synergistic and antagonistic effects occurred with both wild-type pneumococcal strains used in this study, the magnitude of the effects was strain dependent. Lastly, we showed that pneumococci can also antagonize influenza virus. Taken together, our study has uncovered multiple novel facets of bacterial-viral co-infection. Our findings have important public health implications, including for bacterial and viral vaccination strategies in young children.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThird-generation sequencing has penetrated little in metagenomics due to the high error rate and dependence for assembly on short-read designed bioinformatics. However, 2nd generation sequencing metagenomics (mostly Illumina) suffers from limitations, particularly in allowing assembly of microbes with high microdiversity or retrieving the flexible (adaptive) compartment of prokaryotic genomes.\n\nResultsHere we have used different 3rd generation techniques to study the metagenome of a well-known marine sample from the mixed epipelagic water column of the winter Mediterranean. We have compared Oxford Nanopore and PacBio last generation technologies with the classical approach using Illumina short reads followed by assembly. PacBio Sequel II CCS appears particularly suitable for cellular metagenomics due to its low error rate. Long reads allow efficient direct retrieval of complete genes (473M/Tb) and operons before assembly, facilitating annotation and compensates the limitations of short reads or short-read assemblies. MetaSPAdes was the most appropriate assembly program when used in combination with short reads. The assemblies of the long reads allow also the reconstruction of much more complete metagenome-assembled genomes, even from microbes with high microdiversity. The flexible genome of reconstructed MAGs is much more complete and allows rescuing more adaptive genes.\n\nConclusionsFor most applications of metagenomics, from community structure analysis to ecosystem functioning, long-reads should be applied whenever possible. Particularly for in-silico screening of biotechnologically useful genes, or population genomics, long-read metagenomics appears presently as a very fruitful approach and can be used from raw reads, before a computing-demanding (and potentially artefactual) assembly step.",

    "abstract": "The Nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 regulates the translation of host and viral mRNAs in cells. Nsp1 inhibits host translation initiation by occluding the entry channel of the 40S ribosome subunit. The structural study of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1-ribosomal complexes reported post-termination 80S complex containing Nsp1 and the eRF1 and ABCE1 proteins. Considering the presence of Nsp1 in the post-termination 80S ribosomal complex simultaneously with eRF1, we hypothesized that Nsp1 may be involved in translation termination. Using a cell-free translation system and reconstituted in vitro translation system, we show that Nsp1 stimulates translation termination in the stop codon recognition stage at all three stop codons. This stimulation targets the release factor 1 (eRF1) and does not affect the release factor 3 (eRF3). The activity of Nsp1 in translation termination is provided by its N-terminal domain and the minimal required part of eRF1 is NM domain. We assume that biological meaning of Nsp1 activity in translation termination is binding with the 80S ribosomes translating host mRNAs and removal them from the pool of the active ribosomes.",

The R2TP complex is an HSP90 cochaperone involved in the assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles. Here, we show that the R2TP component RPAP3 binds TRBP but not PACT. Specifically, the RPAP3-TPR1 domain interacts with the TRBP-dsRBD3 and the 1.5 [A] resolution crystal structure of this complex is presented. We identify key residues involved in the interaction and show that binding of TRBP to RPAP3 or Dicer is mutually exclusive. In contrast, RPAP3 can simultaneously bind TRBP and HSP90. Interestingly, AGOs and Dicer are sensitive to HSP90 inhibition and TRBP becomes sensitive in absence of RPAP3. These data indicate that the HSP90/R2TP chaperone is an important cofactor of proteins involved in dsRNA pathways.",

During endocytosis, forces provided by endocytic proteins and the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton reshape the plasma membrane into a vesicle. Assessing force requirements of endocytic membrane remodelling is essential for understanding endocytosis. Here, we determined forces applied during endocytosis using FRET-based tension sensors integrated into the major force-transmitting protein Sla2 in yeast. We measured force of approx. 10 pN transmitted over Sla2 molecule, hence a total force of 450-1300 pN required for endocytic vesicle formation. Importantly, decreasing cell turgor pressure and plasma membrane tension reduced force requirements of endocytosis. The measurements in hypotonic conditions and mutants lacking BAR-domain membrane scaffolds then showed the limits of the endocytic force-transmitting machinery. Our study provides force values and force profiles critical for understanding the mechanics of endocytosis and potentially other key cellular membrane-remodelling processes.",

    "abstract": "The mesothelium forms epithelial membranes that line the bodies cavities and surround the internal organs. Mesothelia widely contribute to organ homeostasis and regeneration, and their dysregulation can result in congenital anomalies of the viscera, ventral wall defects, and mesothelioma tumors. Nonetheless, the embryonic ontogeny and developmental regulation of mesothelium formation has remained uncharted. Here, we combine genetic lineage tracing, in toto live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish to track mesothelial progenitor origins from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Our single-cell analysis uncovers a post-gastrulation gene expression signature centered on hand2 that delineates distinct progenitor populations within the forming LPM. Combining gene expression analysis and imaging of transgenic reporter zebrafish embryos, we chart the origin of mesothelial progenitors to the lateral-most, hand2-expressing LPM and confirm evolutionary conservation in mouse. Our time-lapse imaging of transgenic hand2 reporter embryos captures zebrafish mesothelium formation, documenting the coordinated cell movements that form pericardium and visceral and parietal peritoneum. We establish that the primordial germ cells migrate associated with the forming mesothelium as ventral migration boundary. Functionally, hand2 mutants fail to close the ventral mesothelium due to perturbed migration of mesothelium progenitors. Analyzing mouse and human mesothelioma tumors hypothesized to emerge from transformed mesothelium, we find de novo expression of LPM-associated transcription factors, and in particular of Hand2, indicating the re-initiation of a developmental transcriptional program in mesothelioma. Taken together, our work outlines a genetic and developmental signature of mesothelial origins centered around Hand2, contributing to our understanding of mesothelial pathologies and mesothelioma.",

To better understand the role of temperature in determining the repeatability of adaptive trajectories, we evolved populations of different genotypes of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila at low and high temperatures and followed changes in growth rate over 4,000 generations. As expected, growth rate increased with a decelerating rate for all populations; however, there were differences in the patterns of evolution at the two temperatures. The growth rates of the different genotypes converged as evolution proceeded at both temperatures, but this convergence was quicker at the higher temperature. Likewise, we found greater repeatability of evolution, in terms of change in growth rate, among replicates of the same genotype at the higher temperature. Finally, we found no evidence of trade-offs in fitness between temperatures, but did observe asymmetry in the correlated responses, whereby evolution in a high temperature increases growth rate at the lower temperature significantly more than the reverse. These results demonstrate the importance of temperature in determining the repeatability of evolutionary trajectories.",

Reports on field-evolved resistance of lepidopteran pests to chitin synthesis inhibitors and the selection of laboratory resistant strains to these products require a detailed investigation on the resistance mechanisms and on the identification of molecular markers to support the implementation of efficient monitoring and resistance management programs. Teflubenzuron is a chitin synthesis inhibitor highly effective in controlling lepidopteran pests, including nowadays the world widely distributed fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). We report the selection of a laboratory strain of S. frugiperda resistant to teflubenzuron, and its use for the characterization of the inheritance of resistance, evaluation of cross-resistance to other chitin-synthesis inhibitors and the identification of a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for use as candidate molecular markers for monitoring the evolution of resistance of S. frugiperda to teflubenzuron. The resistance of the selected strain of S. frugiperda to teflubenzuron was characterized as polygenic, autosomal, and incompletely recessive. The resistance ratio observed was nearly 1,365-fold. Teflubenzuron-resistant strain showed some cross-resistance to lufenuron and novaluron but not to chlorfluazuron. We also detected a set of 72 SNPs that could support monitoring of the resistance frequency to teflubenzuron in field populations. Our data contribute to the understanding of the resistance mechanisms and the inheritance of polygenic resistance of S. frugiperda to benzoylureas. We also contribute with candidate markers as tools for monitoring the emergence and spread of teflubenzuron resistance in S. frugiperda.",

They are particularly relevant in geometrically confined spaces such as the interior of the chaperonin, at the interface between ligands and their binding partners, and in the ribosome tunnel. Inspired in part by the geometry of the ribosome tunnel, we consider confinement effects on the stability of peptides. We describe results from replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of a system containing a 23-alanine or 23-serine polypeptide confined to non-polar and polar nanotubes in the gas phase and when open to a water reservoir. We quantify the effect of water in determining the preferred conformational states of these polypeptides by calculating the difference in the solvation free energy for the helix and coil states in the open nanotube in the two phases. Our simulations reveal several possibilities. We find that nanoscopic confinement preferentially stabilizes the helical state of polypeptides with hydrophobic side chains, which is explained by the entropic stabilization mechanism proposed on the basis of polymer physics. Polypeptide chains with hydrophilic side chains can adopt helical structures within nanotubes, but helix formation is sensitive to the nature of the nanotube due to WMIs. We elaborate on the potential implications of our findings to the stability of peptides in the ribosome tunnel.",

    "abstract": "Targeted drug therapy in melanoma patients carrying the BRAF V600E mutation provides temporary remission, often followed by relapse due to acquired drug resistance. Here we propose a functional approach to circumvent drug resistance by applying a personalized prescreening platform that maps points of vulnerability in each tumor, prior to drug treatment. This platform applies siRNAs targeting 81 apoptosis, autophagy and programmed necrosis genes in patient tumor cell cultures, identifying genes whose targeting maximizes cell killing by short-term BRAF inhibition. Melanoma tumors displayed large heterogeneity in the number and identities of soft-spots, providing different tumor-specific functional death signatures. The soft-spots were targeted by replacing functional siRNAs with small compound inhibitors for long-term treatment in combination with vemurafenib. This strategy reduced the number of drug-tolerant persister cells surviving treatment, and most importantly, the number of drug-resistant foci. Thus, prescreening melanoma tumors for soft-spots within the cell death network may enhance targeted drug therapy before resistance emerges, thereby reducing the odds of developing drug-resistant mutations, and preventing tumor relapse.",

    "abstract": "The palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) ZDHHC14 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is the only PAT predicted to bind Type I PDZ domain-containing proteins. However, ZDHHC14s neuronal roles are unknown. Here, we identify the PDZ domain-containing Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (MaGUK) PSD93 as a direct ZDHHC14 interactor and substrate. PSD93, but not other MaGUKs, localizes to the Axon Initial Segment (AIS). Using lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown in rat hippocampal neurons, we find that ZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and AIS clustering of PSD93 and also of Kv1 potassium channels, which directly bind PSD93. Neurodevelopmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1 channels and, consistent with ZDHHC14s importance for Kv1 channel clustering, loss of ZDHHC14 decreases outward currents and increases action potential firing in hippocampal neurons. To our knowledge, these findings identify the first neuronal roles and substrates for ZDHHC14 and reveal a previously unappreciated role for palmitoylation in control of neuronal excitability.\n\nImpact StatementZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and axon initial segment targeting of PSD93 and Kv1-family potassium channels, events that are essential for normal neuronal excitability.",

    "abstract": "Depressurization and sample processing delays may impact the outcome of shipboard microbial incubations of samples collected from the deep sea. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an ROV-powered incubator instrument to carry out and compare results from in situ and shipboard RNA Stable Isotope Probing (RNA-SIP) experiments to identify the key chemolithoautotrophic microbes and metabolisms in diffuse, low-temperature venting fluids from Axial Seamount. All the incubations showed microbial uptake of labelled bicarbonate primarily by thermophilic autotrophic Epsilonbacteraeota that oxidized hydrogen coupled with nitrate reduction. However, the in situ seafloor incubations showed higher abundances of transcripts annotated for aerobic processes suggesting that oxygen was lost from the hydrothermal fluid samples prior to shipboard analysis. Furthermore, transcripts for thermal stress proteins such as heat shock chaperones and proteases were significantly more abundant in the shipboard incubations suggesting that hydrostatic pressure ameliorated thermal stress in the metabolically active microbes in the seafloor incubations. Together, results indicate that while the autotrophic microbial communities in the shipboard and seafloor experiments behaved similarly, there were distinct differences that provide new insight into the activities of natural microbial assemblages under near-native conditions in the ocean.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based metaproteomics technologies enable the direct observation of proteins within complex multi-organism environments. A major hurdle in mapping metaproteomic fragmentation spectra to their corresponding peptides is the need for large peptide databases encompassing all anticipated species contained within a biological sample. As we cannot predict the taxonomic composition of microbiomes a priori, we developed the ComPIL database which contains a comprehensive collection of 4.8 billion unique peptides from public sequencing repositories to enable our proteomics analyses. We analyzed fecal samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients using a tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) workflow coupled to ComPIL in search of aberrant UC-associated proteins. We found 176 host and microbial protein groups differentially enriched between the healthy (control) or UC volunteer groups. Notably, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that serine-type endopeptidases are overrepresented in UC compared to healthy volunteers. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of serine hydrolase chemical enrichment from fecal samples using a biotinylated fluorophosphate (FP) probe. Our findings illustrate that probe-susceptible hydrolases from hosts and microbes are likely active in the distal gut. Finally, we applied de novo peptide sequencing methods to our metaproteomics data to estimate the size of the \"dark peptidome,\" the complement of peptides unidentified using ComPIL. We posit that our metaproteomics methods are generally applicable to future microbiota analyses and that our list of FP probe-enriched hydrolases may represent an important functionality to understanding the etiology of UC.",

    "abstract": "Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are extreme and complex ecosystems based on a trophic chain. We are still unsure of the identities of the first colonizers of these environments and their metabolism, but they are thought to be (hyper)thermophilic autotrophs. Here we investigate whether the electric potential observed across hydrothermal chimneys could serve as an energy source for these first colonizers. Experiments were performed in a two-chamber microbial electrochemical system inoculated with deep-sea hydrothermal chimney samples, with a cathode as sole electron donor, CO2 as sole carbon source, and nitrate, sulfate, or oxygen as electron acceptors. After a few days of culture, all three experiments showed growth of electrotrophic biofilms consuming the electrons (directly or indirectly) and producing organic compounds including acetate, glycerol, and pyruvate. Within the biofilms, the only known autotroph species retrieved were members of Archaeoglobales. Various heterotrophic phyla also grew through trophic interactions, with Thermococcales growing in all three experiments as well as other bacterial groups specific to each electron acceptor. This electrotrophic metabolism as energy source driving initial microbial colonization of conductive hydrothermal chimneys is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the role of cell recruitment in tendon disorders is critical for improvements in regenerative therapy. We recently reported that targeted disruption of TGF{beta} type II receptor in the tendon cell lineage (Tgfbr2ScxCre) resulted in tenocyte dedifferentiation and tendon degradation in post-natal stages. Here we extend the analysis and identify direct recruitment of stem/progenitor cells into the degenerative mutant tendons. Cre-lineage tracing indicates that these cells are not derived from tendon ensheathing tissues or from a Scleraxis-lineage, and they turned on tendon markers only upon entering the mutant tendons. Through immunohistochemistry and inducible gene deletion, we further find that the recruited cells originated from a Sox9-expressing lineage and their recruitment was dependent on cell-autonomous TGF{beta} signaling. These results thus differ from previous reports of cell recruitment into injured tendons, and suggest a critical role for TGF{beta} signaling and cell recruitment in the etiology and treatment of tendon degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent tears after surgical tendon repair remain common. Repair failures can be partly attributed to the use of sutures not designed for the tendon cellular niche nor for the promotion of repair processes. Synthetic electrospun materials can mechanically support the tendon whilst providing topographical cues that regulate cell behaviour. Here, a novel electrospun suture made from twisted polydioxanone (PDO) polymer filaments is compared to PDS II, a clinically-used PDO suture currently utilised in tendon repair. We evaluated the ability of these sutures to support the attachment and proliferation of human tendon-derived stromal cells using PrestoBlue and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Suture surface chemistry was analysed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Bulk RNA-Seq interrogated the transcriptional response of primary tendon-derived stromal cells to sutures after 14 days. Electrospun suture showed increased initial cell attachment and a stronger transcriptional response compared to PDS II, with relative enrichment of pathways including mTorc1 signalling and depletion of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Neither suture induced transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory pathways compared to baseline. Twisted electrospun sutures therefore show promise in improving outcomes in surgical tendon repair by allowing increased cell attachment whilst maintaining an appropriate tissue response.",

Meta-analysis of ENCODE ChIP-Seq data identified an overall enrichment of YY1, CTCF as well as histone modification such as H3K4me3 and H3K27me marks in different cell lines. Almost 90% interactions were derived from either intronic or intergenic regions. among which large proportions of intronic interactors were either unique sequences or LINE/SINE derived. In case of intergenic interactions, majority of the interaction were associated with LINE/SINE repeats. We further found that genes proximal to the interactor sequences were co-expressed, they showed reduced expression.

Phage Commander generates properly formatted output files for direct export to NCBI GenBank. Users can select the threshold for determining which genes should be exported.

    "abstract": "Developing alternate strategies against pore forming toxin (PFT) mediated bacterial virulence factors require an understanding of the target cellular response to combat rising antimicrobial resistance. Membrane-bound protein complexes involving PFTs, released by virulent bacteria are known to form pores leading to host cell lysis. However, membrane disruption and related lipid mediated active repair processes during attack by PFTs remain largely unexplored. We report counter intuitive and non-monotonic variations in lipid diffusion, measured using confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, due to interplay of lipid ejection and crowding by membrane bound oligomers of a prototypical cholesterol dependent cytolysin, Listeriolysin O (LLO). The observed protein concentration dependent dynamical cross-over is correlated with transitions of LLO oligomeric state populations from rings to arc-like pore complexes, predicted using a proposed two-state free area based diffusion model. At low PFT concentrations, a hitherto unexplored regime of increased lipid diffusivity is attributed to lipid ejection events due to a preponderance of ring-like pore states. At higher protein concentrations where membrane inserted arc-like pores dominate, lipid ejection is less efficient and the ensuing crowding results in a lowering of lipid diffusion. These variations in lipid dynamics are corroborated by macroscopic rheological response measurements of PFT bound vesicles. Our study correlates PFT oligomeric state transitions, membrane remodelling and mechanical property variations, providing unique insights into developing strategies to combat virulent bacterial pathogens responsible for several infectious diseases.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDeveloping alternate strategies against pore forming toxin (PFT) mediated bacterial virulence factors requires understanding target cellular responses and cellular defence strategies to combat rising antimicrobial resistant strains. While it is well understood that PFTs exist in a wide variety of oligomeric states, the underlying membrane response to these states is unexplored. Using confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and a membrane free area based model we relate non-monotonic variations in the lipid diffusivity arising from an interplay of lipid ejection events and membrane crowding due to variations in concentration of membrane bound listeriolysin O. Our observations have a direct bearing on understanding cellular defense and repair mechanisms effective during initial stages of bacterial infection and intrinsically connected to the underlying membrane fluidity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, and the etiologic agent for the current global health emergency, causes acute infection of the respiratory tract leading to severe disease and significant mortality. Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have been revolving around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While air pollution has been shown to be strongly correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality, whether environmental pollutants such as ground level ozone affects the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established.\n\nObjectiveTo investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on the expression levels of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8ppm ozone for three weeks (4h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed the expression of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsSARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells requires proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The TMPRSS2 protein and Tmprss2 transcripts were significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways, parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice. A significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were upregulated in alveolar macrophages and parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice.\n\nConclusionsOur data indicate that the unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the severity of this pandemic, and the challenges associated with direct testing of host-environment interactions in clinical settings, we believe that this mice-ozone-exposure based study informs the scientific community of the potentially detrimental effects of the ambient ozone levels determining the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The cotton agroecosystem is one of the most intensely managed, economically, and culturally important fiber crops worldwide including in the United States of America (U.S.), China, India, Pakistan, and Brazil. The composition and configuration of crop species and semi-natural habitat can have significant effects on ecosystem services such as pollination. Here we investigate the effect of crop and semi-natural habitat configuration in a large-scale cotton agroecosystem on the diversity and abundance of native bees. Interfaces sampled include cotton grown next to cotton, sorghum or semi-natural habitat. Collections of native bees across interface types revealed 32 species in 13 genera across 3 families. Average species richness ranged between 20.5 and 30.5 with the highest (30.5) at the interface of cotton and semi-natural habitat. The most abundant species was Melissodes tepaneca Cresson (> 4,000 individuals, ~75% of bees collected) with a higher number of individuals found in all cotton-crop interfaces compared to the cotton interface with semi-natural habitat or natural habitat alone. It was also found that interface type had a significant effect on the native bee communities. Communities of native bees in the cotton-crop interfaces tended to be more consistent in the abundance of species and number of species at each sampling site. While cotton grown next to semi-natural habitat had higher species richness, the number of bees collected varied. These data suggest that native bee communities persist in large-scale cotton agroecosystems and some species may thrive even when cotton-crop interfaces are dominant compared with semi-natural habitat. These data have native bee conservation implications that may improve potential pollination benefits to cotton production.",

    "abstract": "Neotropic Cormorants (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) are common seabirds along the Peruvian coast. They frequently perch on trees, poles and port structures in urban areas, causing discomfort and esthetic problems due to the dropping of their feces on infrastructure and people. Hundreds of these birds rest on lighting poles and telephone cables along a 12.7 km highway in the coastal strip of the city of Lima, Peru. We hypothesized that the distribution of the cormorants along this highway is clustered and could be associated with physical features of both the coast and the adjacent marine area. Half-monthly or monthly surveys were performed from July 2018 to March 2020 in the Circuito de Playas de la Costa Verde highway. At each survey, cormorants were counted per lighting pole and adjacent telephone cables (pole-cable) at four count hours (0600 h, 1000 h, 1400 h and 1800 h). Our results revealed that daily bird numbers varied from 46 to 457 individuals and that only 17% of the total number of pole-cables (N = 651) was occupied once by at least one individual. The number of cormorants also varied between count hours within the same day (higher numbers at 1000 h and 1400 h). Birds were clustered into a maximum of five hotspots along the highway. According to the Akaikes information-theoretic approach applied to Poisson GLMM, higher numbers of cormorants on pole-cables were associated mainly to a closer distance from these structures to the shoreline and to the surf zone, suggesting that Neotropic Cormorants may select such pole-cables as optimal sites for sighting and receiving clues of prey availability. Based on the results, the use of nonlethal deterrents and the relocation of these birds to other perching structures on nearby groynes could be the most suitable and eco-friendly solution for the problems caused by their droppings.",

    "abstract": "Hearing ones own voice is critical for fluent speech production as it allows for the detection and correction of vocalization errors in real-time. This behavior known as the auditory feedback control of speech is impaired in various neurological disorders ranging from stuttering to aphasia, however the underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. Computational models of speech motor control suggest that, during speech production, the brain uses an efference copy of the motor command to generate an internal estimate of the speech output. When actual feedback differs from this internal estimate, an error signal is generated to correct the estimate and subsequent motor commands to produce intended speech. We were able to localize these neural markers using electrocorticographic recordings from neurosurgical subjects during a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) paradigm. In this task, subjects hear their voice with a time delay as they produced words and sentences (similar to an echo on a conference call), which is well known to disrupt fluency by causing slow and stutter-like speech in humans. We observed a significant response enhancement in auditory cortex that scaled with the duration of feedback delay indicating an auditory speech error signal. Immediately following auditory cortex, dorsal precentral gyrus (dPreCG), a region that has not been implicated in auditory feedback processing before, exhibited a markedly similar response enhancement suggesting a tight coupling between the two regions. Critically, response enhancement in dPreCG occurred only when subjects profoundly slowed down their speech during articulation of long utterances due to a continuous mismatch between produced speech and reafferent feedback. These results suggest that dPreCG plays an essential role in updating the internal speech estimates to maintain fluency as well as coordinating the efference copy and auditory error signals during speech production.",

    "abstract": "The visual cortex receives non-sensory inputs containing behavioral and brain state information. Here we propose a parallel between optogenetic and behavioral modulations of activity and characterize their impact on cell-type-specific V1 processing under a common theoretical framework. We infer cell-type-specific circuitry from large-scale V1 recordings and demonstrate that, given strong recurrent excitation, the cell-type-specific responses imply key aspects of the known connectivity. In the inferred models, parvalbumin-expressing (PV), but not other, interneurons have responses to perturbations that we show theoretically imply that their activity stabilizes the circuit. We infer inputs that explain locomotion-induced changes in firing rates and find that, contrary to hypotheses of simple disinhibition, locomotory drive to VIP cells and to SOM cells largely cancel, with enhancement of excitatory-cell visual responses likely due to direct locomotory drive to them. We show that this SOM/VIP cancellation is a property emerging from V1 connectivity structure.",

    "abstract": "In patients undergoing surgery for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, the relationship between the default mode network and patients neurocognitive outcome remains unclear. The objective of this study is to employ non-invasive network mapping to identify the relationship between subdivisions of the default mode network and neurocognitive function before and after epilepsy surgery in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nTwenty-seven medically patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy were prospectively enrolled and received resting state functional MRI and neuropsychological testing both pre- and post-operatively. Connectivity within the default mode network was modeled and average connectivity within the networks was calculated.\n\nHigher pre-operative connectivity in the ventral default mode network hub correlated with impaired baseline performance in a visual memory task. Post-operatively, a decrease in ventral but not dorsal default mode network connectivity was correlated with a deterioration of verbal and logical memory after surgery.\n\nOverall, higher connectivity in the ventral default mode network hub was associated with poor memory function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy both before and after temporal lobe surgery. Pre-operatively, higher ventral connectivity was associated with worse visual function. Post-operatively, decreased connectivity of the ventral and dorsal default mode network was correlated with a greater decrease in logical and verbal memory when compared with the pre-operation baseline. An imbalance in default mode network connectivity towards the ventral stream and more widespread epilepsy networks may be used to predict memory impairments following surgical intervention and may lead to more tailored surgical decision making based on this non-invasive network modeling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBasenjis are considered an ancient dog breed of central African origins that still live and hunt with tribesmen in the African Congo. Nicknamed the barkless dog, Basenjis possess unique phylogeny, geographical origins and traits, making their genome structure of great interest. The increasing number of available canid reference genomes allows us to examine the impact the choice of reference genome makes with regard to reference genome quality and breed relatedness.\n\nResultsHere, we report two high quality de novo Basenji genome assemblies: a female, China (CanFam_Bas), and a male, Wags. We conduct pairwise comparisons and report structural variations between assembled genomes of three dog breeds: Basenji (CanFam_Bas), Boxer (CanFam3.1) and German Shepherd Dog (GSD) (CanFam_GSD). CanFam_Bas is superior to CanFam3.1 in terms of genome contiguity and comparable overall to the high quality CanFam_GSD assembly. By aligning short read data from 58 representative dog breeds to three reference genomes, we demonstrate how the choice of reference genome significantly impacts both read mapping and variant detection.\n\nConclusionsThe growing number of high-quality canid reference genomes means the choice of reference genome is an increasingly critical decision in subsequent canid variant analyses. The basal position of the Basenji makes it suitable for variant analysis for targeted applications of specific dog breeds. However, we believe more comprehensive analyses across the entire family of canids is more suited to a pangenome approach. Collectively this work highlights the importance the choice of reference genome makes in all variation studies.",

    "abstract": "Non-symbolic number cognition based on an approximate sense of magnitude has been documented in zebrafish. Here we investigated for the first time its neural bases. Zebrafish were habituated to a set of three or nine small dots associated with food reward. During habituation trials, the dots changed in their individual size, position and density maintaining their numerousness and overall surface area. In the dishabituation test, zebrafish faced a change (i) in number (from three to nine or vice versa with the same overall surface), (ii) in shape (with the same overall surface and number), or (iii) in size (with the same shape and number); in a control group (iv) zebrafish faced the same familiar stimuli as during the habituation. Using qPCR to measure modulation of the expression of the immediate early genes c-fos and egr-1 and in-situ hybridization to count egr1-positive cells we found a specific and selective activation of the caudal part of the dorso-central (Dc) division of the zebrafish pallium upon change in numerosity. As pallial regions are implicated in number cognition in mammals and birds, these findings support the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for approximate magnitude and provide an avenue for exploring the underlying molecular correlates.",

    "abstract": "Fc-gamma receptor (Fc{gamma}R) activation by soluble IgG immune complexes (sICs) represents a major mechanism of inflammation in certain autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A robust and scalable test system allowing for the detection and quantification of sIC bioactivity is missing. Previously described Fc{gamma}R interaction assays are limited to certain Fc{gamma}Rs, lack scalability and flexibility, are not indicative of receptor activation or lack sensitivity towards sIC size. We developed a comprehensive reporter cell panel detecting individual activation of Fc{gamma}Rs from humans and the mouse. The reporter cell lines were integrated into an assay format that provides flexible read-outs enabling the quantification of sIC reactivity via ELISA or a fast detection using flow cytometry. This identified Fc{gamma}RIIA(H) and Fc{gamma}RIIIA as the most sIC-sensitive Fc{gamma}Rs in our test system. Applying the assay we demonstrate that sICs versus immobilized ICs are fundamentally different Fc{gamma}R-ligands with regard to Fc{gamma}R preference and signal strength. Reaching a detection limit in the very low nanomolar range, the assay proved also to be sensitive to sIC stoichiometry and size enabling for the first time a complete reproduction of the Heidelberger-Kendall precipitation curve in terms of immune receptor activation. Analyzing sera from SLE patients and mouse models of lupus and arthritis proved that sIC-dependent Fc{gamma}R activation has predictive capabilities regarding severity of SLE disease. The new methodology provides a sensitive, scalable and comprehensive tool to evaluate the size, amount and bioactivity of sICs in all settings.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn this study we established a comprehensive Fc{gamma}R reporter cell assay enabling the detection and quantification of soluble immune complexes generated in experimental and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial fission is a highly regulated process which, when disrupted, can alter metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis1-3. The downstream effects have implications for many diseases, from neurodegeneration4-6 to cardiovascular disease7,8 and cancer9,10. Key components of the fission machinery have been identified: constriction sites are initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)11 and actin12 before dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)13 is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane via adaptor proteins14-17, where it drives constriction and scission of the membrane18. In the life cycle of mitochondria, fission is important for the biogenesis of new mitochondria as well as the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy3,19. Global regulation of fission on the cellular level is insufficient to explain how fate decisions are made at the single organelle level, so it is unknown how those dual functions arise, blocking progress in developing therapies that target mitochondrial activity. However, systematically studying mitochondrial division to uncover fate determinants is challenging, since fission is unpredictable, and mitochondrial morphology is extremely heterogeneous. Furthermore, because their ultrastructure lies below the diffraction limit, the dynamic organization of mitochondria and their interaction partners are hard to study at the single organelle level. We used live-cell structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and instant SIM20 for fast multi-colour acquisition of mitochondrial dynamics in Cos-7 cells and mouse cardiomyocytes. We analysed hundreds of fission events, and discovered two functionally and mechanistically distinct types of fission. Mitochondria divide peripherally to shed damaged material into smaller daughter mitochondria that subsequently undergo mitophagy, whereas healthy mitochondria proliferate via midzone division. Both types are Drp1-mediated, but they rely on different membrane adaptors to recruit Drp1, and ER and actin mediated pre-constriction is only involved in midzone fission.",

    "abstract": "Drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) studies use DNA sequence variants in or near a gene encoding a drug target, that alter its expression or function, as a tool to anticipate the effect of drug action on the same target. Here, we applied MR to prioritize drug targets for their causal relevance for coronary heart disease (CHD). The targets were further prioritized using genetic co-localization, protein expression profiles from the Human Protein Atlas and, for targets with a licensed drug or an agent in clinical development, by sourcing data from the British National Formulary and clinicaltrials.gov. Out of the 341 drug targets identified through their association with circulating blood lipids (HDL-C, LDL-C and triglycerides), we were able to robustly prioritize 30 targets that might elicit beneficial treatment effects in the prevention or treatment of CHD. The prioritized list included NPC1L1 and PCSK9, the targets of licensed drugs whose efficacy has been already proven in clinical trials. To conclude, we discuss how this approach can be generalized to other targets, disease biomarkers and clinical end-points to help prioritize and validate targets during the drug development process.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe provide genetic support for lipid-modifying drug targets for coronary heart disease prevention using drug target Mendelian randomization and further prioritization based on clinical and biological evidence.",
