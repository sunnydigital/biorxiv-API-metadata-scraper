    "abstract": "Amino acid variation at \"rheostat\" positions provides opportunity to modulate various aspects of protein function - such as binding affinity or allosteric coupling - across a wide range. Previously a subclass of \"multiplex\" rheostat positions was identified at which substitutions simultaneously modulated more than one functional parameter. Using the Miller laboratorys dataset of [~]4000 variants of lactose repressor protein (LacI), we compared the structural properties of multiplex rheostat positions with (i) \"single\" rheostat positions that modulate only one functional parameter, (ii) \"toggle\" positions that follow textbook substitution rules, and (iii) \"neutral\" positions that tolerate any substitution without changing function. The combined rheostat classes comprised >40% of LacI positions, more than either toggle or neutral positions. Single rheostat positions were broadly distributed over the structure. Multiplex rheostat positions structurally overlapped with positions involved in allosteric regulation. When their phenotypic outcomes were interpreted within a thermodynamic framework, functional changes at multiplex positions were uncorrelated. This suggests that substitutions lead to complex changes in the underlying molecular biophysics. Bivariable and multivariable analyses of evolutionary signals within multiple sequence alignments could not differentiate single and multiplex rheostat positions. Phylogenetic analyses - such as ConSurf - could distinguish rheostats from toggle and neutral positions. Multivariable analyses could also identify a subset of neutral positions with high probability. Taken together, these results suggest that detailed understanding of the underlying molecular biophysics, likely including protein dynamics, will be required to discriminate single and multiplex rheostat positions from each other and to predict substitution outcomes at these sites.",

    "abstract": "In Cote dIvoire, banana (Musa sp.) ranks third among exportation products and represents 3% of the Gross Domestic Product with a national production up to 500000 tons in 2019. Banana is subject to numerous disease agents among which viruses cause significant losses. To figure out the impact of viruses in Ivorian industrial banana fields, surveys were conducted in the 7 main banana production departments. A total of 260 leaf fragments presenting viral symptoms were collected and analyzed. From the 65 leaf fragments used for biological indexing, 14 showed symptoms related to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). CMV presence was confirmed by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) using CMV polyclonal antibodies. CMV strains we isolated, appeared to be highly infectious and to produce various symptoms like mosaic, chlorosis, and necrotic spots on Cucumis sativus, Cucurbita pepo, and Nicotiana tabacum. Satellite RNAs (SatRNAs) associated with CMV isolates were also detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a degenerate primer pair. CMVs coat protein as well as satRNAs was sequenced. Novel Ivorian coat proteins and satRNAs were compared to publicly available sequences. We noticed a single amino acid substitution (Serine to Leucine) at position 73 of the novel coat protein that allowed us to divide Ivorian CMV strains into two groups. Molecular and phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ivorian strains might be classified into CMV Subgroup IA. We also discovered that satellite RNA associated with Ivorian CMVs form a separate clade.",

    "abstract": "To overcome well-known difficulties in establishing reliable models based on large data sets, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) method is applied to study economical breeding and milk production of dairy cows. As for the features of RFR, there are several positive experiences in various areas of applications supporting that with RFR one can achieve reliable model predictions for industrial production of any product providing a useful base for decisions. In this study, a data set of a period of ten years including about eighty thousand cows was analysed by means of RFR. Ranking of production control parameters is obtained, the most important explanatory variables are found by computing the variances of the target variable on the sets created during the training phases of the RFR. Predictions are made for the milk production and the conception of the calves with high accuracy on given data and simulations are used to investigate prediction accuracy. This paper is primarily concerned with the mathematical aspects of a forthcoming work focused on the agricultural viewpoints. As for future mathematical research plans, the results will be compared with models based on factor analysis and linear regression.",

    "abstract": "The human visual system can discriminate between animate beings vs. inanimate objects on the basis of some kinematic cues, such as starting from rest and speed changes by self-propulsion. The ontogenetic origin of such capability is still under debate. Here we investigate for the first time whether newborns manifest an attentional bias toward objects that abruptly change their speed along a trajectory as contrasted with objects that move at a constant speed. To this end, we systematically manipulated the motion speed of two objects. An object that moves with a constant speed was contrasted with an object that suddenly increases (Experiment 1) or with one that suddenly decreases its speed (Experiment 2). When presented with a single speed change, newborns did not show any visual preference. However, newborns preferred an object that abruptly increases and then decreases its speed (Experiment 3), but they did not show any visual preference for the reverse sequence pattern (Experiment 4). Overall, results are discussed in line with the hypothesis of the existence of attentional biases in newborns that trigger their attention towards some visual cues of motion that characterized animate perception in adults.",

    "abstract": "The transition from childhood to adolescence is marked by pronounced shifts in brain structure and function that coincide with the development of physical, cognitive, and social abilities. Prior work in adult populations has characterized the topographical organization of cortex, revealing macroscale functional gradients that extend from unimodal (somato/motor and visual) regions through the cortical association areas that underpin complex cognition in humans. However, the presence of these core functional gradients across development as well as their maturational course have yet to be established. Here, leveraging 378 resting-state fMRI scans from 190 healthy individuals aged 6-17 years, we demonstrate that the transition from childhood to adolescence is reflected in the gradual maturation of gradient patterns across the cortical sheet. In children, the overarching organizational gradient is anchored within unimodal cortex, between somato/motor and visual territories. Conversely, in adolescence the principal gradient of connectivity transitions into an adult-like spatial framework, with the default network at the opposite end of a spectrum from primary sensory and motor regions. The observed gradient transitions are gradually refined with age, reaching a sharp inflection point in 13- and 14-year-olds. Functional maturation was nonuniformly distributed across cortical networks. Unimodal networks reached their mature positions early in development, while association regions, in particular medial prefrontal cortex, reached a later peak during adolescence. These data reveal age-dependent changes in the macroscale organization of cortex and suggest the scheduled maturation of functional gradient patterns may be critically important for understanding how cognitive and behavioral capabilities are refined across development.\n\nSignificanceHuman abilities and behavior change dramatically across development, emerging from a cascade of hierarchical changes in brain circuitry. Here, we describe age-dependent shifts in the macroscale functional organization of cortex in childhood and adolescence. The characterization of functional connectivity patterns in children revealed an overarching organizational framework anchored within unimodal cortex, between somato/motor and visual regions. Conversely, in adolescents we observed a transition into an adult-like gradient that situates the default network at the opposite end of a spectrum from primary sensory and motor regions. This spatial framework emerged gradually with age, reaching a sharp inflection point at the transition from childhood to adolescence. These data reveal the presence of a developmental change from a functional motif first dominated by the distinction between sensory and motor systems, and then balanced through interactions with later-maturing aspects of association cortex that support more abstract cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "The identification of the apoE receptor, LRP1, as an endocytic receptor for tau raises several questions about LRP1s role in tauopathies. Is internalized tau, like other LRP1 ligands, delivered to lysosomes for degradation? Does LRP1 internalize pathological tau leading to cytosolic seeding? Do other, related receptors participate in these processes? We confirm that LRP1 rapidly internalizes tau, leading to efficient lysosomal degradation. Employing brain homogenates from human Alzheimer brain, we find that LRP1 also mediates cytosolic tau seeding. We additionally found that another apoE receptor, SORL1, a gene implicated in AD risk, also mediates tau endocytosis, degradation, and release into the cytoplasm of seed competent species. These data suggest a role for these apoE receptors in tau uptake, as well as the competing processes of degradation and release to the cytoplasm. The balance of these processes may be fundamental to spread of neuropathology across the brain in Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "The capture of exogenous attention by negative stimuli has been interpreted as adaptive for survival in a diverse and changing environment. In the present paper, we investigate the neural responses towards two discrete negative emotions with different biological meanings, disgust and fear, and its potential relationships with heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of emotional regulation. With that aim, 30 participants performed a digit categorization task while fear, disgust and neutral distractor pictures were presented. Resting HRV at baseline, behavioral responses, and event-related potentials were recorded. Whereas P1 amplitudes were highest to fear distractors, the disgust stimulation led to augmented P2 amplitudes compared to the rest of distractors. Interestingly, increased N2 amplitudes were also found to disgust distractors, but only in high HRV participants. Neural source estimation data point to the involvement of the insula in this exogenous attentional response to disgust. Additionally, disgust distractors provoked longer reaction times than fear and neutral distractors in the high HRV group. Present findings are interpreted in evolutionary terms suggesting that exogenous attention is captured by negative stimuli following a different time course for fear and disgust. Possible HRV influences on neural mechanisms underlying exogenous attention are discussed considering the potential important role of this variable in emotional regulation processes.",

    "abstract": "Computer game playing has been suggested to be an effective training to enhance perceptual and cognitive abilities. Focusing on potential improvements in auditory selective spatial attention induced by computer gaming, we compared a passive waiting-control group with two gaming groups, playing either a first-person audio-only action game requiring spatial attention and sound localization or a platform side-scroller video game without audiospatial components, which has been shown to improve cognitive performance in previous studies. Prior to and immediately after game training for 1 month for at least 30 min per day (total training time [&ge;]15 h), healthy young adults were tested in an audiospatial task simulating a \"cocktail-party\" situation with multiple speakers at different positions. The proportion of correct target localizations was significantly increased after audio and video gaming compared with the control group. However, there were no significant differences between gaming groups, with similarly strong effects of action audio game and non-action video game trainings on auditory selective spatial attention. Thus, it seems as if successful training of \"cocktail-party\" listening can be induced not only by modality-specific near-transfer learning within the audiospatial domain, but also by far transfer of trained cognitive skills across sensory modalities, which may enhance domain-general processes supporting selective attention.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus; GBS) remains a dominant cause of serious neonatal infections. One aspect of GBS that renders it particularly virulent during the perinatal period is its ability to invade the chorioamniotic membranes and persist in amniotic fluid, which is nutritionally deplete and rich in fetal immunologic factors such as antimicrobial peptides. We used next-generation sequencing of transposon-genome junctions (Tn-seq) to identify five GBS genes that promote survival in the presence of human amniotic fluid. We confirmed our Tn-seq findings using a novel CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) gene expression knockdown system. This analysis showed that one gene, which encodes a GntR-class transcription factor that we named MrvR, conferred a significant fitness benefit to GBS in amniotic fluid. We generated an isogenic targeted knockout of the mrvR gene, which we found to have a growth defect in amniotic fluid relative to the wild type parent strain. In addition to growing poorly in amniotic fluid, the knockout also showed a significant biofilm defect in vitro. Subsequent in vivo studies showed that, while the knockout was able to cause persistent murine vaginal colonization, pregnant mice colonized with the knockout strain did not develop preterm labor despite consistent GBS invasion of the uterus and the fetoplacental units. In contrast, pregnant mice colonized with wild type GBS consistently deliver prematurely. Similarly, in a sepsis model in which 87% of mice infected with wild type GBS died within three days, none of the mice infected with the knockout strain died. In order to better understand the mechanism by which this newly identified transcription factor controls GBS virulence, we performed electrophoresis mobility shift assays with recombinant MrvR and whole-genome transcriptomic analysis on the knockout and wild type strains. We show that MrvR binds to its own promoter region, suggesting likely self-regulation. RNA-seq revealed that the transcription factor affects expression of a wide range of genes across the GBS chromosome. Nucleotide biosynthesis and salvage pathways were highly represented among the set of differentially expressed genes, suggesting a linkage between purine or pyrimidine availability and activity of MrvR in multiple GBS virulence traits.",

    "abstract": "Poultry are the main source of human infection by Salmonella. As infected poultry are asymptomatic, the identification of infected poultry farms is difficult. Controlling animal infections is thus of primary importance. As cell tropism is known to govern disease, our aim was therefore to identify the infected host-cell types in chicks and the role of the three known invasion factors in this process (T3SS-1, Rck and PagN). Chicks were inoculated with wild-type or isogenic fluorescent Salmonella Typhimurium mutants via the intraperitoneal route. Our results show that liver, spleen, gall bladder and aortic vessels could be foci of infection and that phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, including immune, epithelial and endothelial cells, are invaded in vivo in each organ. Moreover, a mutant defective for the T3SS-1, Rck and PagN remained able to colonize organs as the wild-type strain and invaded non-phagocytic cells in each organ studied. As the infection of gall bladder was not really described in chicks, invasion of gall bladder cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and infection was shown to last several weeks after inoculation of chicks. All together, these findings provide new insights into the dynamics of Salmonella spread in vivo in chicks at the organ and cellular levels.",

    "abstract": "The classical Bordetella species, B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica, employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject a 69-kDa BteA effector into the host cells. Upon injection, BteA localizes to the cytosolic leaflet of lipid rafts via its N-terminal lipid raft targeting (LRT) domain and induces cell death. The plasma membrane targeting and cytotoxicity mechanisms of BteA are poorly understood. Using protein-lipid overlay assay and surface plasmon resonance, we showed here that the recombinant LRT domain, which adopts a four-helix bundle topology of membrane localization domains, specifically binds negatively charged membrane phospholipids. The binding affinity for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-containing liposomes with Kd ~450 nM was higher than for those enriched in phosphatidylserine (Kd ~1.2 M) while both phospholipids were required for plasma membrane targeting in yeast cells. The membrane association of LRT further depended on its electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and involved a loop L1-located leucine residue. Importantly, charge-reversal substitutions within the L1 region disrupted plasma membrane localization of BteA effector without hampering its cytotoxic activity during B. bronchiseptica infection of HeLa cells. The LRT-mediated targeting of BteA to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane of host cells is, hence, dispensable for the effector cytotoxicity.\n\nAuthor summaryThe respiratory pathogens of humans and other animals, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica, produce a type III secretion system effector protein BteA. This effector consists of two functional domains, an N-terminal lipid raft targeting (LRT) domain, and a cytotoxic C-terminal domain, which induces non-apoptotic and caspase-1-independent host cell death. We found here that the LRT domain of BteA associates with plasma membrane by binding to negatively charged phospholipids. We further discovered that the mechanism of membrane association by LRT is reminiscent of the one used by three other diverse families of toxins: clostridial glucosyltransferase toxins, multifunctional-autoprocessing RTX toxins (MARTX), and Pasteurella multocida-like toxins. Intriguingly, we also report that plasma membrane targeting by the LRT domain does not contribute to cytotoxic activity of BteA during B. bronchiseptica infection. Overall, our work elucidated the mechanism of plasma membrane association by LRT, and further provided the basis for future research on cellular activities of BteA and the mechanism of BteA-induced cell death.",

    "abstract": "During breast cancer metastasis, cancer cell invasion is driven by actin-rich protrusions called invadopodia, which mediate the extracellular matrix degradation required for the success of the invasive cascade. In this study, we demonstrated that TC10, a member of a Cdc42 subfamily of p21 small GTPases, regulates the membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)-driven extracellular matrix degradation at invadopodia. We show that TC10 is required for the plasma membrane surface exposure of MT1-MMP at invadopodia. By utilizing our new Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor, we demonstrated the p190RhoGAP-dependent regulation of spatiotemporal TC10 activity at invadopodia. We identified a pathway that regulates TC10 activity and function at invadopodia through the activation of p190RhoGAP and the downstream interacting effector Exo70 at the invadopodia sites. Our findings reveal the role of a previously unknown regulator of vesicular fusion at invadopodia, TC10, on the invasive potential of breast cancer cells during invasion and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Single cell assays revealed that growth factor signaling dynamics is actively sensed by a cell and ultimately controls cell fate. However, the effects of growth factor signaling dynamics at the tissue level have been unknown. We used mammary epithelial organoids, time-lapse imaging, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) variants of different stabilities, mathematical modeling, and perturbation analysis to study the role of FGF2 signaling dynamics in epithelial morphogenesis. We found that fluctuant and sustained FGF signaling dynamics induced distinct morphological and functional states of mammary epithelium through differential employment of intracellular effectors ERK and AKT. ERK activity domains determined epithelial branch size, while AKT activity drove epithelial stratification. Furthermore, FGF signaling dynamics affected epithelial tissue mechanoresponsiveness to extracellular matrix, thereby impinging upon branch elongation. Our study provides new insights into regulation of epithelial patterning and branching morphogenesis by FGF signaling dynamics and into downstream signaling effectors that regulate cellular outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal numerical and structural chromosome content is frequently found in human cancer. To test the role of aneuploidy in tumor initiation and progression, we compared tumor development in mice with chronic chromosome instability (CIN) induced by inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (produced by Mad2 deficiency) and mice with transient CIN through transiently increased expression of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a master regulator of centrosome number. Tumors forming under chronic CIN gradually trended toward chromosomal gains producing a specific karyotype profile that could only be partially maintained in end-stage tumors, as determined by single-cell whole genome DNA sequencing. Short term CIN from transient PLK4 induction generated significant centrosome amplification and aneuploidy resulting in formation of aggressive T cell lymphomas in mice with heterozygous inactivation of one p53 allele or accelerated tumor development in the absence of p53. Transient CIN increased the frequency of lymphomainitiating cells (as revealed by T cell receptor sequencing) with a specific karyotype profile containing triploid chromosomes 4, 5, 14, and 15 occurring early in tumorigenesis. Overall, our evidence demonstrates that distinct CIN mechanisms drive cancers presenting specific, complex chromosomal alterations with transient CIN rapidly enhancing tumor formation by accelerating the generation of such events.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulators have been implicated in tumorigenesis of many types of cancer; however, their roles in endothelial cell cancers such as canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA) have not been studied. In this study, we found that lysine-specific demethylase 2B (Kdm2b) was highly expressed in HSA cell lines compared to normal canine endothelial cells. Silencing of Kdm2b in HSA cells resulted to increased cell death in vitro compared to the scramble control by inducing apoptosis through the inactivation of the DNA repair pathways and accumulation of DNA damage. Similarly, doxycycline-induced Kdm2b silencing in tumor xenografts resulted to decreased tumor sizes compared to the scramble control. Furthermore, Kdm2b was also highly expressed in clinical cases of HSA, and its expression levels was higher than in hemangioma, a benign counterpart of HSA. Based on these results, we hypothesized that pharmacological Kdm2b inhibition can also induce HSA cell death and can be used as an alternative treatment for HSA. We treated HSA cells with GSK-J4, a histone demethylase inhibitor, and found that GSK-J4 treatment also induced apoptosis and cell death. On top of that, GSK-J4 treatment in HSA tumor-bearing mice decreased tumor sizes without any obvious side-effects. In this study, we demonstrated that Kdm2b acts as an oncogene in HSA by enhancing DNA damage response and can be used as a biomarker to differentiate HSA from hemangioma. Moreover, we indicated that histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 can be used as a therapeutic alternative to doxorubicin for HSA treatment.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy using checkpoint blockers (antibodies) has been a major advance in recent years in the management of various types of solid cancers including lung cancer. One target of checkpoint blockers is programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed by cancer cells, which engages programmed death 1 (PD-1) on T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells resulting in suppression of their activation and cancer-killing function, respectively. Apart from antibodies, other clinically relevant agents that can inhibit PD-L1 are limited. PD-L1 protein stability depends on its glycosylation. Here we show that L-glutamine:D-fructose amidotransferase 1 (GFAT1) a rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) which produces uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-{beta}-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a precursor for glycosylation, is required for the stability of PD-L1 protein. Inhibition of GFAT1 activity markedly reduced interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma})-induced PD-L1 levels in various lung cancer cell lines. GFAT1 inhibition suppressed glycosylation of PD-L1 and accelerated its proteasomal degradation. Importantly, inhibition of GFAT1 in IFN{gamma}-treated cancer cells enhanced the activation of T cells and the cancer-killing activity of NK cells. These findings support using GFAT1 inhibitors to manipulate PD-L1 protein level that could augment the efficacy of immunotherapy for lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Paediatric diffuse midline glioma (pDMG) also known as Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) is an incurable, aggressive childhood brain malignancy, that arises in a region- and age-specific nature. The underlying pathophysiology suggests dysregulation of postnatal neurodevelopmental processes causing aborted cell differentiation. The cell of origin is unclear, but data suggests an oligodendrocytic lineage (OPC), supported by the over-expression of transcription factors such as Olig1 and Olig2 in 80% of DIPG cases.\n\nIn-depth bioinformatics and principal component analyses (PCA) of genes involved in brain development and pDMG support reports of OPC gene dysregulation and led to the identification of the G-protein coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) and its association with pDMG. GPR17 mRNA and protein expression was confirmed in all pDMG cell lines tested. Using a well-characterised agonist (MDL 299,51) and antagonist (HAMI3379) to modulate GPR17 function in pDMG cell lines resulted in phenotypic and genomic changes as well as in cell growth and migration. HAMI3379, a GPR17 specific antagonist resulted in a significant reduction in GPR17 mRNA and protein expression (p<0.006) and a significant reduction in migration (p<0.0025). When pDMG cells were pre-treatment with HAMI3379 in combination with known cytotoxic agents (Bleomycin, a radiation mimic, Panobinostat or Vincristine), there was a decrease in cell viability compare to cytotoxic agent alone. There are no current effective therapies for pDMG patients and the ability of blocking GPR17 function to enhance sensitivity to standard therapies is appealing and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (EC) are heterogeneous across and within tissues, reflecting distinct, specialised functions. EC heterogeneity has been proposed to underpin EC plasticity independently from vessel microenvironments. However, heterogeneity driven by contact-dependent or short-range cell-cell crosstalk cannot be evaluated with single cell transcriptomic approaches as spatial and contextual information is lost. Nonetheless, quantification of EC heterogeneity and understanding of its molecular drivers is key to developing novel therapeutics for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and for revascularisation in regenerative medicine.\n\nHere, we developed an EC profiling tool (ECPT) to examine individual cells within intact monolayers. We used ECPT to characterise different phenotypes in arterial, venous and microvascular EC populations. In line with other studies, we measured heterogeneity in terms of cell cycle, proliferation, and junction organisation. ECPT uncovered a previously under-appreciated single-cell heterogeneity in NOTCH activation. We correlated cell proliferation with different NOTCH activation states at the single cell and population levels. The positional and relational information extracted with our novel approach is key to elucidating the molecular mechanisms underpinning EC heterogeneity.\n\nSummary statementEndothelial cells heterogeneity is key to complex collective functions and cell behaviour. We developed a novel image based endothelial cell profiling tool and quantified heterogeneity in NOTCH signalling in monolayers.",

    "abstract": "Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a considerable global health burden, with an incidence of over 600,000 cases per year. Treatment options are limited, and patient 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. The ubiquitin specific protease 28 (USP28) has been implicated in tumorigenesis through its stabilization of the oncoprotein c-MYC. Here, we show that genetic inactivation of Usp28 induced regression of established murine LSCC lung tumors. We developed a small molecule that inhibits USP28 activity in the low nanomole range. While displaying cross-reactivity against the closest homologue USP25, this inhibitor showed a high degree of selectivity over other deubiquitinases. USP28 inhibitor treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in c-Myc proteins levels and consequently induced substantial regression of autochthonous murine LSCC tumors and human LSCC xenografts, thereby phenocopying the effect observed by genetic deletion. Thus, USP28 may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of squamous cell lung carcinoma.",
