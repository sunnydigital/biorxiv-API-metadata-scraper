    "abstract": "Substantial behavioral evidence implies the existence of separable working memory (WM) components for maintaining phonological and semantic information. In contrast, only a few studies have addressed the neural basis of phonological vs. semantic WM using functional neuroimaging and none has used a lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) approach. Here we address this gap, reporting a multivariate LSM study of phonological and semantic WM for 94 individuals at the acute stage of left hemisphere stroke. Testing at the acute stage avoids issues of brain reorganization and the adoption of patient strategies for task performance. The LSM analyses for each WM component controlled for the other WM component and semantic and phonological knowledge at the single word level. For phonological WM, the regions uncovered included the supramarginal gyrus, argued to be the site of phonological storage, and several cortical and subcortical regions plausibly related to inner rehearsal. For semantic WM, inferior frontal regions and the angular gyrus were uncovered. The findings thus provide converging evidence for separable systems for phonological and semantic WM that are distinguished from the systems supporting long-term knowledge representations in those domains.",

    "abstract": "Loss of metabolic homeostasis is one of the hallmarks of the aging process that might contribute to pathogenesis by creating a permissive landscape over which neurodegenerative diseases can take hold. AMPK, a conserved energy sensor, extends lifespan and is protective in some neurodegenerative models. AMPK regulates mitochondrial homeostasis and morphology, however, whether mitochondrial regulation causally links AMPK to protection against loss of neuronal function with aging and diseases remains unclear. Here we use an associative learning protocol in C. elegans as a readout of neuronal function and show that AMPK activation enhances associative learning and prevents age-related loss of learning capacity. AMPK promotes neuronal mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial fragmentation via fzo-1 deletion blocks AMPKs effects on associative learning. Restoring mitochondrial fusion capacity specifically in the neurons rescued learning capacity downstream of AMPK. Finally, AMPK activation rescues neuronal A{beta}1-42 induced loss of associative learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeting neuronal metabolic flexibility may be a viable therapeutic option to restore neuronal function in the context of aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFear and anxiety are complex physiological states aimed at promoting adaptive behaviors. They are also core symptoms of many neuropsychiatric disorders; yet, our knowledge of the underlying biological correlates remains fragmented. Non-human primate models are critical for our understanding of mechanisms associated with complex higher-order behavioral phenotypes. Here we investigated individual variations in innate fear responses to a snake stimulus in free-ranging rhesus macaques and discovered an unusual bimodal distribution of fearful and fearless behavior, likely as a result of an environmental insult by a hurricane. In a translational approach, we discovered a DNA methylation profile associated with fear behavior in these monkeys. We also found evidence that this epigenetic signature is associated with innate fear responses in humans in the form of acoustic startle. Our data highlight the importance and translational utility of non-human primate models for neuropsychiatric research and provide a potential epigenetic signature of innate fear.",

    "abstract": "Precise quantification of molecular targets in a biological sample across a wide dynamic range is a key requirement in many diagnostic procedures, such as monitoring response to therapy or detection of measurable residual disease. State of the art digital PCR assays provide for a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. However digital assays are complex and require sophisticated microfluidic tools. Here we present an assay format that enables ultra-precise quantification of RNA targets in a single measurement across a dynamic range of more than seven orders of magnitude. The approach is based on hydrogel beads that provide for microfluidic free compartmentalization of the sample as they are used as digital nanoreactors for reverse transcription, PCR amplification and combined real time and digital detection of gene transcripts. We have applied these nanoreactors for establishing an assay for the detection and quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts. The assay has been characterized for its accuracy and linear dynamic range. A comparison of the new method against the current clinical standard procedure with clinical samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) revealed good agreement between the results obtained with the respective method.",
