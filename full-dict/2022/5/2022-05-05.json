    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) is an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma that arises in peripheral nerves. MPNST occurs either sporadically or in people with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants in NF1. Although MPNST is the most common cause of death and morbidity for individuals with NF1, the molecular underpinnings of MPNST pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we report the analysis of whole-genome sequencing, multi-regional exome sequencing, transcriptomic and methylation profiling data for 95 MPNSTs and precursor lesions (64 NF1-related; 31 sporadic) from 77 individuals. Early events in tumour evolution include biallelic inactivation of NF1 followed by inactivation of CDKN2A and in some cases also TP53 and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) genes. Subsequently, both sporadic and NF1-related MPNSTs acquire a high burden of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). Our analysis revealed distinct pathways of tumour evolution and immune infiltration associated with inactivation of PRC2 genes and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) status. Tumours with loss of H3K27me3 evolve through extensive chromosomal losses with retention of chromosome 8 heterozygosity followed by whole genome doubling and chromosome 8 amplification. These tumours show lower levels of immune cell infiltration with low cytotoxic activity and low expression of immune checkpoints. In contrast, tumours with retention of H3K27me3 evolve through extensive genomic instability in the absence of recurrent alterations and exhibit an immune cell-rich phenotype. Specific SCNAs detected in both tumour samples and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) act as a surrogate for loss of H3K27me3 and immune infiltration, and predict prognosis. Our results suggest that SCNA profiling of tumour or cfDNA could serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis and to stratify patients into prognostic and treatment-related subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a damaging amino acid residue formed in proteins as a result of spontaneous deamidation. IsoAsp disrupts the secondary and higher order structures of proteins, damaging their functions and making them prone to aggregation. An association has been suggested between isoAsp and Alzheimers Disease (AD). Here we strengthened the link between isoAsp and AD by novel approaches to isoAsp analysis in blood human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant blood protein, a major carrier of amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptide and phosphorylated tau (pTau) protein in blood and a key participant in their clearance pathway. We discovered a reduced amount of anti-isoAsp antibodies (P < .0001), an elevated isoAsp level in HSA (P < .001), more HSA aggregates (P < .0001) and increased levels of free A{beta} (P < .01) in AD blood compared to healthy controls. We also found that deamidation significantly reduces HSA capacity to bind with A{beta} and pTau (P < .05). These findings support the presence in AD of a bottleneck in clearance of A{beta} and pTau leading to their increased concentrations in brain and facilitating their aggregations there.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_LISystematic review: We reviewed the evidence that associates isoaspartate (isoAsp) residue in blood proteins with the etiology of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the link between isoAsp in blood and aggregation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptide and phosphorylated tau (pTau) protein in brain remained unclear.\nC_LIO_LIInterpretation: For the first time we demonstrate that isoAsp-containing human serum albumin (HSA) forms aggregates with reduced binding capacity toward A{beta} peptide and pTau protein. Using a novel ELISA, we discovered in AD blood elevated levels of isoAsp in HSA, together with reduced endogenous anti-isoAsp antibody levels, suggesting hampered A{beta} and pTau clearance in AD.\nC_LIO_LIFuture directions: As degradation of the innate anti-isoAsp defenses may take years to develop, investigation of the isoAsp role in early stages of AD is warranted. And enrollment of different neurodegenerative disease cohorts will illustrate if isoAsp is AD-specific or universal to diseases related to aging.\nC_LI\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

We sought to determine whether neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) dynamics predict pathologic response following chemotherapy in PDAC, and if manipulating NLR impacts chemosensitivity in preclinical models and uncovers potential mechanistic underpinnings underlying these effects.\n\nMethodsPathologic response in PDAC patients (n=94) undergoing NAC and pancreatectomy (7/2015-12/2019) was dichotomized as partial/complete or poor/absent (case-cohort design). Bootstrap-validated multivariable models assessed associations between pre-chemotherapy NLR (%neutrophils/%lymphocytes) or NLR dynamics during chemotherapy ({Delta}NLR=pre-surgery--pre-chemotherapy NLR) and pathologic response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). To preclinically model effects of NLR attenuation on chemosensitivity, C57BL/6 mice (n=8-10/arm) were orthotopically injected with KrasG12D/+;Trp53fl/+;PdxCre(KPC)cells and randomized to vehicle, NLR-attenuating anti-Ly6G, gemcitabine/paclitaxel, or gemcitabine/paclitaxel+anti-Ly6G treatments.\n\nResultsIn 94 PDAC patients undergoing NAC (median:4 months), pre-chemotherapy NLR (P<0.001) and {Delta}NLR attenuation during NAC (P=0.002) were independently associated with partial/complete pathologic response. An NLR score=pre-chemotherapy NLR+{Delta}NLR correlated with DFS (P=0.006) and OS (P=0.002). Upon preclinical modeling, combining NLR-attenuating anti-Ly6G treatment with gemcitabine/paclitaxel--compared with gemcitabine/paclitaxel or anti-Ly6G alone--not only significantly reduced tumor burden and metastatic outgrowth, but also augmented tumor-infiltrating CD107a+-degranulating CD8+ T-cells (P<0.01) while dampening inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) polarization (P=0.006) and chemoresistant IL-6/STAT-3 signaling in vivo. Neutrophil-derived IL-1{beta} emerged as a novel mediator of stromal inflammation, inducing inflammatory CAF polarization and CAF-tumor cell IL-6/STAT-3 signaling in ex vivo co-cultures.\n\nConclusionsTherapeutic strategies to mitigate neutrophil-CAF-tumor cell IL-1{beta}/IL-6/STAT-3 signaling during NAC may improve pathologic responses and/or survival in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "The first pandemic of the 21st century was caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) introduced from pigs into humans, highlighting the importance of swine as reservoirs for pandemic viruses. Two major lineages of swine H1 circulate in North America: the 1A classical swine lineage (including the 2009 pandemic H1N1) and 1B human seasonal-like lineage. Here, we investigated the evolution of these H1 IAV lineages in North American swine and their potential pandemic risk. We assessed the antigenic distance between the HA of representative swine H1 and human seasonal vaccine strains (1978-2015) in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays using a panel of monovalent anti-sera raised in pigs. Antigenic cross-reactivity varied by strain but was associated with genetic distance. Generally, swine 1A lineage viruses that seeded the 2009 H1 pandemic were antigenically most similar to H1 pandemic vaccine strains, with the exception of viruses in the genetic clade 1A.1.1.3 that had a two-amino acid deletion mutation near the receptor-binding site, dramatically reducing antibody recognition. The swine 1B lineage strains, which arose from previously circulating (pre-2009 pandemic) human seasonal viruses, were more antigenically similar to pre-2009 human seasonal H1 vaccine viruses than post-2009 strains. Human population immunity was measured by cross-reactivity in HI assays to representative swine H1 strains. There was a broad range of titers against each swine strain that was not associated with age, sex, or location. However, there was almost no cross-reactivity in human sera to the 1A.1.1.3 and 1B.2.1 genetic clades of swine viruses, and the 1A.1.1.3 and 1B.2.1 clades were also the most antigenically distant from all human vaccine strains. Our data demonstrate that antigenic distances of representative swine strains from human vaccine strains represent a rational assessment of swine IAV for zoonotic risk research and pandemic preparedness prioritization.\n\nImportanceHuman H1 influenza A viruses (IAV) spread to pigs in North America, resulting in sustained circulation of two major groups of H1 viruses in swine. We quantified the genetic diversity of H1 in swine and measured antigenic phenotypes. We demonstrated that swine H1 lineages were significantly different from human vaccine strains and this antigenic dissimilarity increased over time as the viruses evolved in swine. Pandemic preparedness vaccine strains for human vaccines also demonstrated a loss in similarity with contemporary swine strains. Human sera revealed a range of responses to swine IAV, including two groups of viruses with little to no immunity. Surveillance and risk assessment of IAV diversity in pig populations are essential to detect strains with reduced immunity in humans, providing critical information for pandemic preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic diversity of P. falciparum antigenic loci is high despite large bottlenecks in population size during the parasite life cycle. The extent of this diversity in human blood-stage infections, following expansion from a small number of liver-stage schizonts, has been well described. However, little is known about parasite genetic diversity in the vector, where a similar bottleneck and expansion occurs following parasite mating and where parasite genotypes from several different human infections may accumulate. We assessed parasite genetic diversity within human and mosquito P. falciparum infections collected from the same households during a 14-month longitudinal cohort study using amplicon deep sequencing of two antigenic gene fragments (ama1 and csp). To a prior set of infected humans (n=1175/2813; 86.2% sequencing success) and mosquito abdomens (n=199/1448; 95.5% sequencing success), we added sequences from infected mosquito heads (n=134/1448; 98.5% sequencing success). Across all sample types we observed 456 ama1 and 289 csp unique haplotypes. While both hosts contained many rare haplotypes, population genetic metrics indicated that the overall and sample-level parasite populations were more diverse in mosquitoes than in humans, and infections were more likely to harbor a dominant haplotype in humans than in mosquitoes (based on relative read abundance). Finally, within a given mosquito there was little overlap in genetic composition of abdomen and head infections, suggesting that infections may be cleared from the abdomen during a mosquitos lifespan. Taken together, our observations provide evidence for the role of the mosquito vector in maintaining sequence diversity of malaria parasite populations.\n\nSignificance statementConcurrent infections with multiple strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the leading causative agent of death due to malaria, are common in highly endemic regions. During transitions within and between the parasites mosquito and human hosts, population bottlenecks occur, and distinct parasite strains may have differential fitness in the various environments encountered. These bottlenecks and fitness differences may lead to differences in strain prevalence and diversity between hosts. We investigated differences in genetic diversity between P. falciparum parasites in human and mosquito hosts and found that, compared to human parasite populations and infections, mosquito populations and infections were more diverse. This suggests that the mosquito vector may play a role in in maintaining sequence diversity in malaria parasite populations.",

    "abstract": "SAR11 is a dominant bacterial clade in marine oligotrophic ecosystems. SAR11 can also be dominant in estuarine systems, where they are not well-studied. We examined the effects of season, nutrient concentrations, and salinity in shaping SAR11 subclade abundance, diversity, function, and growth in two Mid-Atlantic estuaries, the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Using metagenome-assembled genomes, we identified twelve distinct genomospecies within the Ia, II, IIIa, and V subclades, which made up to 60% of the total bacterial community. The functional potential of all SAR11 genomospecies varied, especially in carbohydrate metabolism, transporters, and one-carbon metabolic pathways. Predicted growth rates, estimated by the Peak to Trough method, varied by season and genomospecies. SAR11 growth rates negatively correlated in the spring but positively correlated in the summer with chlorophyll a concentrations and bacterial production, as well as phosphate and ammonium concentrations. Genomospecies in Ia.1, IIIa.2, and IIIa.4 subclades had low growth rates, while genomospecies in Ia.3, Ia.5, Ia.6, II, and V subclades had higher and more variable growth rates that were positively correlated with phosphate concentrations and temperature. Growth rate variation between subclades was associated with carbohydrate metabolic gene repertoires, especially glycolysis and number of transporters. While total transcript to genome ratios generally mirrored growth rates, transcription of genes involved in phosphate and nitrogen transport were negatively associated with growth rates. These data suggest that SAR11 genomospecies abundance varies in these estuaries because of differences in growth rates and metabolic capacities in response to changes in environmental conditions.\n\nImportanceThe SAR11 clade is one of the most abundant bacterial groups in marine systems, including many estuaries. From the Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay environmental metagenomes, we reconstructed nearly complete SAR11 metagenome-assembled genomes representing ten genomospecies in four subclades, of which at least one is novel. Growth rate estimates of genomospecies correlated with functional gene repertoires of carbohydrate transporter and metabolism. Different SAR11 genomospecies dominated among the seasons, depending on their growth rates, biological productivity, and nutrient concentrations. Our RNAseq approach facilitated an understanding of the environmental controls on the abundance of SAR11 genomospecies in their natural habitat. This study is the first to combine multiple measures of diversity, abundance, functional potential, growth rates and activity of this important group, demonstrating a direct link between SAR11 genomospecies abundance and growth in the context of its environment.",

In this study, the gut microbiota of 58 persons living in Zhejiang and Shanghai area will be analyzed. Then, the potential contribution of the human gut microbiota to obesity/high Body Mass Index (BMI) will be explored. The gut microbiota was studied by high throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments, and the gut microbiota samples with different BMI were compared. Meanwhile, some gut microorganisms from faeces of a healthy individual were cultivated and isolated, and the classification was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. The main microbes in human gut microbiota were assigned to the phyla of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Moreover, four strains were isolated from an individual fecal sample, of which one species was assigned to Escherichia fergusonii and the other three strains were assigned to Weissella cibaria. These four species belong to both abundant and low-abundant species revealed by high throughput sequencing. It was found that individuals with different BMI have different gut microbiota; while the differences are not significant. Also, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio increases with the decrease of BMI, which is corresponding to previous results. In the future, more cohort gut microbiota in Zhejiang and Shanghai area will be collected and recovered, and the gut microbiota database of Zhejiang and Shanghai area will be built up in order to provide the basis for future gut microbiota modulation in this area.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceuticals are relatively new to nature and often not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Consequently, these micropollutants end up in water bodies all around the world posing a great environmental risk. One exception to this recalcitrant conversion is paracetamol, whose full degradation has been linked to several microorganisms. However, the genes and corresponding proteins involved in microbial paracetamol degradation are still elusive. In order to improve our knowledge of the microbial paracetamol degradation pathway, we inoculated a bioreactor with sludge of a hospital WWTP (Pharmafilter, Delft, NL) and fed it with paracetamol as the sole carbon source. Paracetamol was fully degraded without any lag phase and the enriched microbial community was investigated by metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, which demonstrated that the microbial community was very diverse. Dilution and plating on paracetamol-amended agar plates yielded two Pseudomonas sp. isolates: a fast-growing Pseudomonas sp. that degraded 200 mg/L of paracetamol in approximately 10 hours while excreting a dark brown component to the medium, and a slow-growing Pseudomonas sp. that degraded paracetamol without obvious intermediates in more than 90 days. Each Pseudomonas sp. contained a different highly-expressed amidase (31% identity to each other). These amidase genes were not detected in the bioreactor metagenome suggesting that other as-yet uncharacterized amidases may be responsible for the first biodegradation step of paracetamol. Uncharacterized deaminase genes and genes encoding dioxygenase enzymes involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds and amino acids were the most likely candidates responsible for the degradation of paracetamol intermediates based on their high expression levels in the bioreactor metagenome and the Pseudomonas spp. genomes. Furthermore, cross-feeding between different community members might have occurred to efficiently degrade paracetamol and its intermediates in the bioreactor. This study increases our knowledge about the ongoing microbial evolution towards biodegradation of pharmaceuticals and points to a large diversity of (amidase) enzymes that are likely involved in paracetamol metabolism in WWTPs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIParacetamol was fully degraded by activated sludge from hospital wastewater.\nC_LIO_LILow paracetamol concentrations were removed by a diverse microbial community.\nC_LIO_LIPseudomonas sp. dominated cultures with high paracetamol concentration.\nC_LIO_LIUncharacterized amidases are probably involved in degrading paracetamol in WWTPs.\nC_LIO_LIDeaminases and dioxygenases might be degrading paracetamol transformation products.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteremia and endocarditis. Previous studies have shown that concurrent treatment with cephalosporin and vancomycin antibiotics exhibit synergy in vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis to render the bacterium susceptible to antibiotic treatment whereas treatment with each antibiotic separately was not successful. Proteins responsible for mediating vancomycin and cephalosporin resistance are classified as two-component systems (TCS). TCS consist of a histidine kinase that phosphorylates a response regulator after environmental activation. These signaling networks have been shown to exhibit cross-talk interactions, and through direct coupling analysis, we identify encoded specificity between vancomycin resistance TCS, which are horizontally acquired, and cephalosporin resistance TCS, which are endogenous to E. faecalis. To verify cross-talk between these pathways is responsible for vancomycin and cephalosporin synergy, we use RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes in VanA- and VanB-type vancomycin resistant enterococci after treatment with the cephalosporin antibiotic, ceftriaxone, and also with vancomycin. We find that cross-talk between VanSA and CroR in strain HIP11704 may be responsible for synergy, demonstrating that horizontally acquired TCS can have large impacts on pre-existing signaling networks. The presence of encoded specificity between exogenous TCS and endogenous TCS show that the systems co-evolve, and cross-talk between these systems may be exploited to engineer genetic elements that disrupt antibiotic resistance TCS pathways.\n\nAuthor SummaryBacteria may transmit genetic elements to other bacteria through the process known as horizontal gene transfer. In some enterococci, vancomycin resistance genes are acquired this way. Proteins encoded within the bacterial genome can interact with proteins acquired through horizontal gene transfer. The interaction that occurs between proteins VanSA and VanRA is known to mediate vancomycin antibiotic resistance in VanA-type vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), and the interaction between proteins CroS and CroR is an important pathway in cephalosporin antibiotic resistance. We show that the VanSA, which is obtained through horizontal gene transfer, inhibits CroR under treatment with antibiotics vancomycin and ceftriaxone. This interaction is responsible for the observed synergy between vancomycin and ceftriaxone in VanA-type VREs. These findings demonstrate how horizontally acquired genes may produce proteins that interrupt known protein interactions, including antibiotic resistance signaling pathways in bacteria. Furthermore, the specific mechanism found for VanA-type VREs provides a basis for engineering of horizontally acquired proteins that disrupt antibiotic resistance pathways.",

    "abstract": "Brown/beige adipocytes express uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) that enables them to dissipate energy as heat. Systematic activation of this process can alleviate obesity. Human brown adipose tissues are interspersed in distinct anatomical regions including deep neck. We found that UCP1 enriched adipocytes differentiated from precursors of this depot highly expressed ThTr2 transporter of thiamine and consumed thiamine during thermogenic activation of these adipocytes by cAMP which mimics adrenergic stimulation. Inhibition of ThTr2 led to lower thiamine consumption with decreased proton leak respiration reflecting reduced uncoupling. In the absence of thiamine, cAMP-induced uncoupling was diminished but restored by thiamine addition reaching the highest levels at thiamine concentrations larger than present in human blood plasma. Thiamine is converted to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in cells; the addition of TPP to permeabilized adipocytes increased uncoupling fueled by TPP-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase. ThTr2 inhibition also hampered cAMP-dependent induction of UCP1, PGC1a, and other browning marker genes, and thermogenic induction of these genes was potentiated by thiamine in a concentration dependent manner. Our study reveals the importance of amply supplied thiamine during thermogenic activation in human adipocytes which provides TPP for TPP-dependent enzymes not fully saturated with this cofactor and by potentiating the induction of thermogenic genes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/490662v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8b9a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1653d1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18f3266org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35f78d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAbundant thiamine is required for efficient activation of UCP1 dependent thermogenesis in human deep neck derived adipocytes\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of thiamine transporters leads to decreased thermogenic response\nC_LIO_LIIn stimulated adipocytes, thiamine supply provides extra thiamine pyrophosphate for increasing pyruvate dehydrogenase activity to generate sufficient fuel of UCP1 dependent respiration\nC_LIO_LIAdrenergic stimulation of thermogenic gene expression is potentiated by thiamine in a concentration dependent manner\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "There is a growing appreciation that a tight relationship exists between cholesterol homeostasis and immunity in leukocytes, however, this relationship has not been deeply explored in the vascular endothelium. Endothelial cells (ECs) rapidly respond to extrinsic signals, such as tissue damage or microbial infection, by upregulating factors to activate and recruit circulating leukocytes to the site of injury and aberrant activation of ECs leads to inflammatory based diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis. Here, we studied the role of cholesterol and its master regulator, SREBP2, in the EC responses to inflammatory stress. Treatment of ECs with pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulates SREBP2 cleavage and cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression within the late phase of the acute inflammatory response. Furthermore, SREBP2 activation was dependent on NF-{kappa}B DNA binding and canonical SCAP-SREBP2 processing. Mechanistically, inflammatory activation of SREBP was mediated by a reduction in accessible cholesterol, leading to heightened sterol sensing and downstream SREBP2 cleavage. Detailed analysis of NF-{kappa}B inducible genes that may impact sterol sensing resulted in the identification of a novel RELA-inducible target, STARD10, that mediates accessible cholesterol homeostasis in ECs. Thus, this study provides an in-depth characterization of the relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and the acute inflammatory response in EC.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMetabolic syndrome-associated osteoarthritis (MetS-OA) is a distinct osteoarthritis phenotype defined by the coexistence of MetS or its individual components. Despite the high prevalence of MetS-OA, its pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the role of cellular senescence in the development of MetS-OA.\n\nMethodsAnalysis of the human osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) dataset was conducted to investigate the MRI subchondral bone features of MetS-human OA participants. Joint phenotype and senescent cells were evaluated in two MetS-OA mouse models: high-fat diet (HFD)-challenged mice and STR/Ort mice. In addition, the molecular mechanisms by which preosteoclasts become senescent as well as how the senescent preosteoclasts impair subchondral bone microenvironment were characterized using in vitro preosteoclast culture system.\n\nResultsHumans and mice with MetS are more likely to develop osteoarthritis-related subchondral bone alterations than those without MetS. MetS-OA mice exhibited a rapid increase in joint subchondral bone plate and trabecular thickness before articular cartilage degeneration. Subchondral preosteoclasts undergo senescence at the pre- or early-osteoarthritis stage and acquire a unique secretome to stimulate osteoblast differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation. Antagonizing preosteoclast senescence markedly mitigates pathological subchondral alterations and osteoarthritis progression in MetS-OA mice. At the molecular level, preosteoclast secretome activates COX2-PGE2, resulting in stimulated differentiation of osteoblast progenitors for subchondral bone formation. Administration of a selective COX2 inhibitor attenuated subchondral bone alteration and osteoarthritis progression in MetS-OA mice. Longitudinal analyses of the human Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) cohort dataset also revealed that COX2 inhibitor use, relative to non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, is associated with less progression of osteoarthritis and subchondral bone marrow lesion worsening in participants with MetS-OA.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest a central role of a senescent preosteoclast secretome-COX2/PGE2 axis in the pathogenesis of MetS-OA, in which selective COX2 inhibitors may have disease-modifying potential.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant R01AG068226 and R01AG072090 to M.W., R01AR079620 to S.D., and P01AG066603 to X.C.",

    "abstract": "Endolysosome, usually regarded as the cellular recycling bin, digests materials from multiple origins. The materials from different origins are delivered to endolysosome through the vesicle fusion, kiss-and-run mechanisms, CMA or microautophagy. However, it remains unknown whether endolysosome can receive cargo via other ways. Here, we reported another endolysosomal process for receiving materials. In this, endolysosome receives materials by extending two arms which embraces autophagosomes and engulfs the autophagosomes ultimately, but not via the conventional fusion of autophagosomes with endolysosomes. We named this process as LEA (lysosome eats autophagosome) and the endolysosome arms as LF (endolysosome filopodia) provisionally. The endolysosomes with engulfed autophagosomes (LEA endolysosomes) get more autophagosomes via the fusion with other LEA endolysosomes. The engulfed autophagosomes are labelled by F-actin on their membranes and have ER protein Sec61{beta} and peroxisome protein Pex14 inside their lumens, but mitochondria are excluded outside endolysosome. Our discovery of LEA and LF reveal an unidentified endolysosome transformation process which is responsible for receiving cargoes.",

    "abstract": "The human-induced annihilation of modern biodiversity is dragging the planet into a mass extinction that has already altered patterns of life globally. Among vertebrates, over 500 species have become extinct or possibly extinct in the last five centuries - an extinction rate that would have taken several millennia without human intervention. Vertebrate extinctions have often been quantified as cumulative counts that reveal sharp increases in losses over time. Here, we quantify global tetrapod extinctions since the 1400s using numbers of species losses across successive and independent time periods until present. Our results reveal that extinctions were low and fundamentally restricted to islands in pre-industrial times, experiencing a significant increase and spread over continental mainland following the onset of the industrial revolution. Recent amphibian extinctions alarmingly exceed the extinctions of all tetrapods, while extinctions of island birds account for a third of all extinctions. Finally, we quantified the relationship between human population growth (HPG, as a proxy for aggregate human effects on the environment) and extinctions between 1800-2000, to then predict that an estimated 838 tetrapod species will go extinct between 2030-2100 based on United Nations HPG projections. These findings further warn humanity about the need to sustainably control HPG and the destructive impacts of rapid environmental change on ecosystems worldwide.",

Here, we used a large plant dataset with > 40.000 plots combined with airborne laser scanning (lidar) data to reveal the local characteristics of habitats having a high plant dark diversity - i.e., absence of suitable species - at national extent (> 43.000 km2). Such habitats have potential for reaching high realized diversity levels and hence are important in a conservation context. We calculated 10 different lidar based metrics (both terrain and vegetation structure) and combined these with 7 different field-based measures (soil chemistry and species indicators). We then used Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation for modelling plant dark diversity across 33 North European habitat types (open landscapes and forests) selected by the European communities to be important. In open habitat types high-dark-diversity habitats had relatively low pH, high nitrogen content, tall homogenous vegetation and overall relatively homogenous terrains (high terrain openness) although with a rather high degree of local microtopographical variations. High-dark-diversity habitats in forests had relatively tall vegetation, few natural-forest indicators, low potential solar radiation input and a low cover of small woody plants. Our results highlight important vegetation, terrain and soil related factors that managers and policymakers should be aware of in conservation and restoration projects to ensure a natural plant diversity, for example low nutrient loads, natural microtopography and open forests with old-growth elements such as dead wood and rot attacks.",

    "abstract": "Heterospecific communication is common for birds when mobbing a predator. However, joining the mob should depend on the number of callers already enrolled, as larger mobs imply lower individual risks for the newcomer. In addition, some  community informant species seem more reliable regarding the information transferred in mobbing calls. Birds should therefore rely on both the number of callers and the species identity of the caller(s) when mobbing. In the present study, we tested the potential interaction between two acoustic cues. In a playback experiment, we modified the number of callers (through an increased number of calling individuals correlated to an increased duty cycle) and the emitter species (crested tits versus coal tits). Overall, we found that soundtracks with three callers triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with one caller and that soundtracks with coal tits calls triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with crested tits calls. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that birds consider both the species and the number of callers when joining a mobbing chorus in winter. Finally, we replicated the experiment in spring and did not record the same responses from the bird community. Indeed, only soundtracks with three coal tits triggered a mobbing response, suggesting therefore that the seasonal context can affect the results of studies on heterospecific communication. The potential mechanisms implicated in the varying responses to different acoustic cues and different seasons are discussed and should deserve further investigations.",

We tested this prediction experimentally using the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, an insect with biparental care. For 20 generations, we allowed replicate experimental burying beetle populations to evolve either with post-hatching care ( Full Care populations) or without it ( No Care populations). We then established new lineages, seeded from these experimental populations, which we inbred to assess their mutation load. Outbred lineages served as controls. We also tested whether the deleterious effects of a greater mutation load could be concealed by parental care by allowing half the lineages to receive post-hatching care, while half did not. We found that inbred lineages from the Full Care populations went extinct more quickly than inbred lineages from the No Care populations - but only when offspring received no post-hatching care. We infer that Full Care lineages carried a greater mutation load, but that the associated deleterious effects on fitness could be overcome if larvae received parental care. We suggest that the increased mutation load caused by parental care increases a populations dependence upon care. This could explain why care is seldom lost once it has evolved.",

The resulting trait correlations can either help or hinder evolvability - the ability to bring forth new and adaptive phenotypes. The evolution of evolvability requires that trait correlations themselves must be able to evolve, but we know little about this ability. To learn more about it, we here study one of the simplest evolvable systems, a gene encoding a single protein, and two traits of this protein, namely the ability to emit yellow and green light. We show that correlations between these two traits can evolve rapidly through both mutation and selection on short evolutionary time scales. In addition, we show that these correlations are driven by a proteins ability to fold, because single mutations that alter foldability can dramatically change trait correlations. Since foldability is important for most proteins and their traits, mutations affecting protein folding may alter trait correlations mediated by many other proteins. Thus, mutations that affect protein foldability may also help shape the correlations of complex traits that are affected by hundreds of proteins.",

    "abstract": "There is compelling evidence that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an essential role in failure of conventional antitumor therapy. In breast cancer, CD24-/low/CD44+ phenotype as well as a high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH+) are widely associated with CSC subtypes. Furthermore, CD24-/low/CD44+ pattern is also characteristic of the mesenchymal cells generated by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CD24 is a surface marker expressed in many tumor types, however, its biological functions and role in cancer progression and treatment resistance remain poorly documented. We have previously shown that loss of CD24 expression in breast cancer cells is associated with radiation resistance, in relationship with the control of oxidative stress. Because ROS are known to mediate the effects of anticancer drugs as well as ionizing radiation, we investigated if CD24 could be defined as an actor of both radiation- and chemo-resistance of breast cancer cells. Using the HMLE breast cancer cell model, we observed that loss of CD24 expression induces stemness properties associated with the acquisition of a hybrid E/M phenotype. The CD24-/low cells were intrinsically more resistant than CD24+ cells. The resistance was linked to a lower level of ROS, and CD24 controlled ROS levels through the regulation of mitochondrial functions independently of antioxidant activity. Together, these results suggest a key role of CD24 in de-differentiation process of breast cancer cells, promoting acquisition of therapeutic resistance properties.",

    "abstract": "Self-sustained quiescence (SSQ) has been characterized as a stable but reversible non-proliferative cellular state that limits the cloning of cultured cancer cells. By developing refined clonogenic assays, we showed here that cancer cells in SSQ can be selected with anticancer agents and that culture at low cell density induced SSQ in pancreas and prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Pre-culture of cells in 3D or their pretreatment with pharmacological inhibitors of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) synergize with low cell density for induction of SSQ in a Beclin-1-dependent manner. Dissociated pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) cells rendered defective for SSQ by down-regulating Beclin-1 expression exhibit higher tumor growth rate when injected subcutaneously into mice. Conversely, dissociated PAAD cells in SSQ promote the formation of small indolent tumors that eventually transitioned to a rapid growth phase. Ex vivo clonogenic assays showed that up to 40% of clonogenic cancer cells enzymatically dissociated from resected fast-growing tumors could enter SSQ, suggesting that SSQ could significantly impact the proliferation of cancer cells that are naturally dispersed from tumors. Remarkably, the kinetics of clinical metastatic recurrence in 124 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma included in the TGCA-PAAD project could be predicted from Beclin-1 and Cyclin-A2 mRNA levels in their primary tumor, Cyclin A2 mRNA being a marker of both cell proliferation and mTOR complex 1 activity. Overall, our data show that SSQ is likely to promote the late development of clinical metastases and suggest that identifying new agents targeting cancer cells in SSQ could help improve patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) often undergoes at least partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to facilitate metastasis. Identifying EMT-associated characteristics can reveal novel dependencies that may serve as therapeutic vulnerabilities in this aggressive breast cancer subtype. We find that NPC1, which encodes the lysosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick Type C1 is highly expressed in TNBC as compared to estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and is significantly elevated in high grade disease. We demonstrate that NPC1 is directly targeted by microRNA-200c (miR-200c) a potent suppressor of EMT, providing a mechanism for its differential expression in breast cancer subtypes. Silencing of NPC1 in TNBC causes an accumulation of cholesterol-filled lysosomes and drives decreased growth on soft agar and invasive capacity. Conversely, overexpression of NPC1 in an ER+ cell line increases invasion and growth on soft agar. We further identify TNBC cell lines as cholesterol auxotrophs, however, they do not solely depend on NPC1 for adequate cholesterol supply. Genetic inhibition of NPC1 in TNBC cell lines led to altered mitochondrial function and morphology, suppression of mTOR signaling, and accumulation of autophagosomes. A small-molecule inhibitor of NPC1, U18666A, decreased TNBC proliferation and synergized with the chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel. This work suggests that NPC1 promotes aggressive characteristics in TNBC and identifies NPC1 as a potential therapeutic target.",

We focused on PCPG tumors with germline SDHB and RET mutations, representing distinct prognostic groups with worse or better prognoses, respectively. We applied single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on tissue samples from 11 patients and found high patient-to-patient transcriptome heterogeneity of the neuroendocrine tumor cells. The tumor microenvironment also showed heterogeneous profiles mainly contributed by macrophages of the immune cell clusters and Schwann cells of the stroma. Performing non-negative matrix factorization we identified common transcriptional programs active in RET and SDHB as well as distinct modules? including neuronal development, hormone synthesis and secretion, and DNA replication. Comparison of the SDHB and RET transcriptomes with that of developmental stages of adrenal gland formation suggests different developmental stages at which PC and PG tumors appear to be arrested.",

Species-level clustering identified 70 (>10% of total) novel gut species out of 685, improved reference genomes for 363 species (53% of total), and discovered 3,413 strains that are unique to these populations. Among the top 10 most abundant gut bacteria in our study, one of the species and >80% of all strains were not represented in existing databases. Annotation of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) uncovered more than 27,000 BGCs with a large fraction (36-88%) not represented in current databases, and with several unique clusters predicted to produce bacteriocins that could significantly alter microbiome community structure.

Macromolecular drugs display low stability and poor absorption across the intestinal epithelium. While permeation-enhancing drug delivery methods can increase the bioavailability of low molecular weight drugs, the effective delivery of high molecular weight drugs across the tight epithelial cell junctions remains a formidable challenge. Here, we describe autonomous microinjectors that can efficiently penetrate the GI mucosa and deliver insulin systemically. In addition, we performed in vitro studies to characterize insulin release and the penetration capacity of microinjectors and measure in vivo release of insulin in live rats. We found that the microinjectors administered within the luminal GI tract could deliver insulin trans-mucosally to the systemic circulation at similar levels to intravenously administered insulin. Due to their small size, tunability in sizing and dosing, wafer-scale fabrication, and parallel, autonomous operation, we anticipate that these novel microinjectors could significantly advance drug delivery across the GI tract mucosa to the systemic circulation.",

    "abstract": "Brain lesions can arise from traumatic brain injury, infection, and craniotomy. Although injectable hydrogels show promise for promoting healing of lesions and health of surrounding tissue, enabling cellular ingrowth and restoring neural tissue continue to be challenging. We hypothesized that these challenges arise in part from viscoelastic mismatch between the hydrogel and the brain parenchyma, and tested this hypothesis by developing and evaluating a self-healing hydrogel that mimicked both the composition and viscoelasticity of native brain parenchyma. The hydrogel was crosslinked by dynamic boronate ester bonds between phenylboronic acid grafted hyaluronic acid (HA-PBA) and dopamine grafted gelatin (Gel-Dopa). This HA-PBA/Gel-Dopa hydrogel could be injected into a lesion cavity in a shear-thinning manner with rapid hemostasis, high tissue adhesion and efficient self-healing. We tested this in an in vivo mouse model of brain lesions and found the hydrogel to support neural cell infiltration, decrease astrogliosis and glial scars, and close the lesions. The results suggest a role for viscoelasticity in brain lesion healing, and motivate additional experimentation in larger animals as the technology progresses towards potential application in humans.",

We observed three distinct CAF subtypes in mouse TNBC: two that are intermingled and adjacent to tumor cells, and one that is more distal. We present evidence that progression of CAFs from normal resident fibroblasts/pericytes involves upregulation of their Pdgf and Tgfb receptors along with reciprocal ligand upregulation in other cells within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, extracellular matrix, glycolytic, and mitochondrial respiratory genes are strongly upregulated in all CAFs. Activation of extracellular matrix genes specifically in CAFs and not in normal fibroblasts provides numerous targets for CAF-based therapeutics, many of which are conserved in CAFs from human TNBC. In contrast, the subtype structure of CAFs was less conserved, which along with their transcriptional heterogeneity suggests that molecular targeting of CAFs is more practical than targeting CAF subtypes.",

Pharmacological tools to study the activation of these receptors with high temporal resolution are lacking. Here, we synthesized a family of light-activatable caged melatonin compounds by covalently attaching o-nitrobenzyl (o-NB) or coumarin photocleavable groups to the N-position of melatonin. All caged compounds showed the expected decrease in binding affinity for MT1 and MT2. Among them, the o-NB derivative MCS-0382 showed the best uncaging and biological properties upon light activation with a significant increase (2.5 log left-shift) in affinity and potency in melatonin receptor binding and signaling, respectively.

In human infants, leg movements involve a small number of basic coordination patterns called locomotor primitives, but whether and when motor variability could emerge from these primitives remains unknown. Here we longitudinally followed 10 neonates ([~]4 days old) until walking onset ([~]14 months old) and recorded the activity of their leg muscles during locomotor or rhythmic movements. Using unsupervised machine learning, we show that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development. In the neonatal period, infants own a minimal number of motor primitives but generate a maximal motor variability across trials thanks to variable activations of these primitives. A few months later, toddlers generate significantly less variability despite the existence of more primitives, due to more regularity within their activation. These results suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration as soon as birth by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives that later fraction and become more consistently activated by the motor system.",

    "abstract": "The preBotzinger Complex (preBotC) of the lower brainstem generates two breathing-related rhythms: one for inspiration on a timescale of seconds and another that produces larger amplitude sighs on the order of minutes. Their underlying mechanisms and cellular origins remain incompletely understood. We resolve these problems via a joint experiment and modeling approach. Blocking purinergic gliotransmission does not perturb either rhythm and imaging experiments show that both rhythms emanate from the same glutamatergic neuron population. We hypothesized that these two disparate rhythms emerge in tandem wherein recurrent excitation gives rise to inspiratory rhythm while a calcium oscillator generates sighs; there is no obligatory role for gliotransmission, hyperpolarization activated mixed cationic current (Ih) in neurons, or synaptic inhibition-mediated coupling of separate populations. We developed a mathematical model that instantiates our working hypothesis. Tests of model predictions validate the single-population rhythmogenic framework, reproducing disparate breathing-related frequencies and the ability for inspiratory and sigh rhythms to be separately regulated in support of respiration under a wide array of conditions. Here we show how a single neuron population exploits two cellular tool-kits: one involving voltage-dependent membrane properties and synaptic excitation for inspiratory breathing (eupnea) and an intracellular biochemical oscillator for sighs, which ventilate and maintain optimal function in the compliant mammalian lung.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBreathing consists of two vital rhythms: one for eupnea that serves periodic physiological gas exchange and the other for sighs, which are larger breaths that occur minutes apart and serve to optimize pulmonary function. These rhythms with disparate frequencies emerge via a mechanism that is simpler than previously envisaged: it results from one neuron population (not two as previously thought) without need for gliotransmission or synaptic inhibition-mediated coupling of neuronal populations. We show that a low-frequency intracellular calcium oscillation underlies sighs and functions in parallel with the higher-frequency voltage-dependent network oscillation that drives eupnea. Exploiting two separate cellular tool kits enables quasi-independent breathing rhythms, which are unique features of breathing in mammals with compliant lungs.",

    "abstract": "Addiction is characterized by intermittent drug seeking despite rising costs. This behavior is heavily influenced by environmental stimuli that signal drug availability and reinforce seeking. We aimed to establish the relationship between three key aspects of human drug use in rats: the intermittent, binge nature of drug intake, the motivational conflict of drug seeking in the face of escalating negative costs, and the ability of different drug cues to interact to modulate relapse. Rats were trained to self administer cocaine on an intermittent access schedule, where brief drug availability states were signaled by a shift in the ambient lighting of the environment and cocaine delivery was signaled by a separate proximal cue. Rats then went through a conflict procedure, where foot shock intensity associated with cocaine seeking was escalated until intake was suppressed. We completed relapse tests where the drug delivery cue was non contingently presented alone, or in the context of dynamic drug availability state transitions. Intermittent access spurred psychomotor sensitization and binge-like cocaine intake. The intensity of binge-like drug taking during training was predictive of later drug seeking despite escalating costs. In relapse tests, the ability of a proximal drug cue to trigger relapse was gated by the presence of a global cue signaling drug-availability state transitions. Our results suggest that the pattern of drug intake plays a role in many features of addiction, including modifying an individuals willingness to endure high costs associated with drug seeking. Further, our results indicate that drug-related sensory information can be hierarchically organized to exert a dynamic modulating influence on drug-seeking motivation.",

    "abstract": "Obesity-related pathologies and anorexia nervosa are increasingly considered as opposite ends of eating disorders (ED) spectrum. Accordingly, accumulating evidence points to opposite dysregulations of common brain systems in these pathologies, the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) in particular. However, to which extent alterations in NAc activity are sufficient to elicit ED-like behavioral dimensions remains to be established. Using acute, bidirectional, chemogenetic modulation of each NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) subpopulation, we found that D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs oppositely regulate the balance between food intake and exercise-induced energy expenditure. As opposed to the limited effect of repeated chemogenetic manipulations of each MSN subpopulation, the concomitant manipulation of both MSN subpopulation had sustained effects. Repeated activation of D1-MSNs combined with repeated inhibition of D2-MSNs biased behavior toward activity-related energy expenditure leading to weight/fat loss, whilst the opposite manipulations favored energy intake and hence weight/fat gain. These results suggest that dysregulations of NAc dopaminoceptive MSN network might be at the core of EDs.",

This study took an integrative, developmental approach to investigate multidimensional factors associated with the emergence of sex differences in internalizing symptoms, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Indices of sex hormone levels (dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, and estradiol), physical pubertal development, task-based functional brain activity, family conflict, and internalizing symptoms were drawn from the ABCD studys baseline sample (9-to 10-year-old; N = 11,844). Principal component analysis served as a data-driven dimensionality reduction technique on the internalizing subscales to yield a single robust measure of internalizing symptoms. Moderated mediation analyses assessed whether associations between known risk factors and internalizing symptoms vary by sex. Results revealed direct and indirect effects of physical pubertal development on internalizing symptoms through family conflict across sexes. No effects were found of sex hormone levels or amygdala response to fearful faces on internalizing symptoms. Females did not report overall greater internalizing symptoms relative to males, suggesting that internalizing symptoms have not yet begun to increase in females at this age. Findings provide an essential baseline for future longitudinal research on the endocrine, neurocognitive, and psychosocial factors associated with sex differences in internalizing symptoms.",

    "abstract": "While T cell receptor (TCR)-modified T cell therapies have shown promise against solid tumors, overall therapeutic benefits in clinical practice have been modest due in part to suboptimal T cell persistence and activation in vivo, alongside the possibility of tumor antigen escape. In this study, we demonstrate an approach to enhance the in vivo persistence and activation of TCR-T cells through combination with Amphiphile (AMP)-vaccination including cognate TCR-T peptides. AMP-modification improves lymph node targeting of conjugated tumor immunogens and adjuvants, thereby coordinating a robust T cell-priming endogenous immune response. Vaccine combination with TCR-T cell therapy provided simultaneous in vivo invigoration of adoptively transferred TCR-T cells and in situ priming of the endogenous anti-tumor T cell repertoire. The resulting induction of an adoptive and endogenous anti-tumor effect led to durable responses in established murine solid tumors refractory to TCR-T cell monotherapy. Protection against recurrence was associated with antigen spreading to additional tumor-associated antigens not targeted by vaccination. Enhanced anti-tumor efficacy was further correlated with pro-inflammatory lymph node transcriptional reprogramming and increased antigen presenting cell maturation, resulting in TCR-T cell expansion and functional enhancement in lymph nodes and solid tumor parenchyma without lymphodepletion. In vitro evaluation of AMP-peptides with matched human TCR-T cells targeting NY-ESO-1, mutant KRAS, and HPV16 E7 illustrated the clinical potential of AMP-vaccination to enhance human TCR-T cell proliferation, activation, and anti-tumor activity. Taken together, these studies provide rationale and evidence to support clinical evaluation of the combination of AMP-vaccination with TCR-T cell therapies to augment anti-tumor activity.\n\nSummaryAMP-vaccination targets the lymph nodes to enhance TCR-T cell therapy resulting in solid tumor eradication and durable protection against recurrence.",

It is now appreciated that T cells generate mechanical forces during this process but how force impacts the TCR/pMHC off-rate remains unclear. Here, we measured the effect of mechanical force on the off-rate of multiple TCR/pMHC interactions. Unexpectedly, we found that lower-affinity pMHCs with faster solution off-rates were more resistant to mechanical force (weak slip or catch bonds) than higher-affinity interactions (strong slip bonds), and this was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulations. Consistent with these findings, we show that the best characterized catch-bond, involving the OT-I TCR, has a low affinity and an exceptionally fast solution off-rate. Our findings imply that reducing forces on the TCR/pMHC interaction improves antigen discrimination and we suggest this new force-shielding role for the adhesion receptors CD2 and LFA-1.\n\nOne sentence summaryMechanical forces disproportionately accelerate the off-rates of higher-affinity antigens reducing T cell antigen discrimination",

    "abstract": "Some of the most dangerous bacterial pathogens (Gram-negative and mycobacterial) deploy a formidable secondary membrane barrier to reduce the influx of exogenous molecules. For Gram-negative bacteria, this second exterior membrane is known as the outer membrane, while for the Gram-indeterminate Mycobacteria, it is known as the  myco membrane. Although different in composition, both the outer membrane and mycomembrane are key structures that restrict the passive permeation of small molecules into bacterial cells. While it is well-appreciated that such structures are principal determinants of small molecule permeation, it has proven to be challenging to assess this feature in a robust and quantitative way or in complex, infection-relevant settings. Herein, we describe the development of the Bacterial Chloro-Alkane Penetration Assay (BaCAPA), which employs the use of a genetically encoded protein called HaloTag, to measure the uptake and accumulation of molecules into model Gram-negative and mycobacterial species, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis, respectively, and into the human pathogen M. tuberculosis. Directing the localization of the HaloTag protein to either the cytoplasm or periplasm of bacteria enabled a compartmental analysis of permeation across individual cell membranes. Significantly, we also showed that BaCAPA can be used to analyze the permeation of molecules into host cell-internalized E. coli and M. tuberculosis, a critical capability for analyzing intracellular pathogens. Together, our results show that BaCAPA affords facile, compartment-specific measurement of permeability across four barriers: the host plasma and phagosomal membranes and the diderm bacterial cell envelope.",

Ndc80 has been shown to recruit the Ska1 complex to kinetochores, where Ska1 is thought to aid in k-MT coupling by Ndc80. Our previous work has shown that Cdt1, a DNA replication licensing factor, is a novel mitotic spindle-associated protein that is also recruited to kinetochores via Ndc80 and is required for stabilizing k-MT attachments. In this study, we developed auxin-induced degron (AID)-tagging to validate the previously demonstrated mitotic role of Cdt1. We demonstrate a direct interaction between Cdt1 and Ska1 that is essential for proper recruitment of Cdt1 to kinetochores and spindle microtubules. We find that Cdk1dependent phosphorylation of Cdt1 during mitosis is critical for Ska1-binding, consequently regulating the stabilization of metaphase k-MT attachments and normal mitotic progression. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) experiments reveal that Cdt1 synergizes with the Ndc80 and the Ska1 complexes for microtubule-binding. Further, we show that single Cdt1 molecules form diffusive tripartite complexes with Ndc80 and Ska1 that can processively track the ends of dynamic microtubules in vitro.

The functional significance of their sustained expression remains unclear. In C. elegans motor neurons (MNs), we find that LIN-39 (Scr/Dfd/Hox4-5) is continuously required during post-embryonic life to maintain neurotransmitter identity, a core element of neuronal function. LIN-39 acts directly to co-regulate genes that define cholinergic identity (e.g., unc-17/VAChT, cho-1/ChT). We further show that LIN-39, MAB-5 (Antp/Hox6-8) and the transcription factor UNC-3 (Collier/Ebf) operate in a positive feedforward loop to ensure continuous and robust expression of cholinergic identity genes. Finally, we identify a two-component, design principle (Hox transcriptional autoregulation counterbalanced by negative UNC-3 feedback) for homeostatic control of Hox gene expression in adult MNs. These findings uncover a noncanonical role for Hox proteins during post-embryonic life, critically broadening their functional repertoire from early patterning to the control of neurotransmitter identity.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration is essential for embryonic development, tissue regeneration and repair, and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis. It is, in part, directed by external cues that promote front-to-rear polarity in individual cells. However, our understanding of the pathways that underpin the directional movement of cells in response to external cues remains incomplete. To examine this issue we made use of neural crest cells (NC), which migrate as a collective during development to generate vital structures including bones and cartilage. Using a candidate approach, we found an essential role for Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), a key effector of the nucleocytoplasmic transport pathway, in enabling directed migration of these cells. Our results indicate that RanBP1 is required for establishing front-to-rear polarity, so that NCs are able to chemotax. Moreover, our work suggests that RanBP1 function in chemotaxis involves the polarity kinase LKB1/PAR4. We envisage that regulated nuclear export of LKB1 through Ran/RanBP1 is a key regulatory step required for establishing front-to-rear polarity and thus chemotaxis, during NC collective migration.",

The differentiation status of these new IHCs is much more advanced than those previously reported. Thus, Tbx2 is essential for IHC development, and its co-upregulation with Atoh1 in supporting cells represents a new approach for treating IHC degeneration-related deafness.",

Effects of reciprocal rapid evolution on ecological interactions between herbivores and plants have been repeatedly demonstrated, but it is unknown if (and how) the soil microbiome could mediate these eco-evolutionary processes.\nC_LIO_LIWe tested the role of a plant-beneficial soil bacterium (Acidovorax radicis) in altering eco-evolutionary interactions between sap-feeding aphid herbivores (Sitobion avenae) feeding on barley (Hordeum vulgare). We reared two aphid genotypes separately or together on three barley varieties that were inoculated with or without A. radicis bacteria. In the first experiment we counted the aphid number and plant biomass after 7, 14 and 21 days of aphid growth, while in a second experiment we counted and removed offspring every 1-2 days to assess aphid longevity and fecundity.\nC_LIO_LIResults showed that A. radicis increased plant growth and suppressed aphids of both genotypes. The strength of effect was dependent on aphid genotype and barley variety, while the direction of effect was altered by aphid population mixture. Fescue aphids experienced increased growth when they were sharing the plant with Sickte aphids on inoculated plants; this increase was not seen in the control plants without A. radicis and was only apparent after 14 days of aphid population growth.\nC_LIO_LIPlant inoculation with A. radicis reduced aphid survival (reduced number of reproductive days) and fecundity (reduced daily reproductive output for surviving aphids). In the second experiment, when density was controlled, Fescue aphids did not experience increased reproduction in mixed populations, suggesting this is a density-dependent effect. Using Lotka-Volterra modelling, we demonstrated that A. radicis inoculation decreased aphid population stability as it increased inter-genotype competition but decreased the intra-genotype competition (likely through reduced population density).\nC_LIO_LIOur work demonstrates the important role that plant-associated microbiomes can have in mediating eco-evolutionary interactions between herbivores and host plants.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic pressures and climatic change on fish populations dynamics. When monitored in lakes, the spawning of fish is generally assessed using traditional, mostly destructive or damaging, methods as gillnetting and collection of fertilized eggs.\n\nOver the last decade, environmental DNA (eDNA) based methods have been widely developed for the detection of aquatic species, offering a non-invasive alternative method to conventional biomonitoring tools. In particular, the emergence of new methods as the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) offer the possibility to quantify an absolute eDNA signal in a very sensitive way and at a low cost.\n\nHere, we developed and implemented a quantitative eDNA method to monitor the spawning activity of two fish species, European perch and whitefish. ddPCR protocols were formalized based on existing and newly designed COI primers, and were applied during four spawning periods in lake Geneva.\n\nThe results demonstrate the efficiency of eDNA coupled with ddPCR to identify the timing and duration of the spawning periods, as well as the peak of the spawning activity for the targeted species. In addition, the use of a control species (i.e., quantification of the eDNA signal of a fish that does not reproduce during the monitoring period) was shown to be relevant to clearly discriminate fluctuations of the eDNA signal associated to the spawning activity from the baseline eDNA signal. For future implementation, we recommend using an integrative sampling strategy (e.g., pooled samples for a give station) to smooth the local variability of the eDNA signal. These results show that we reached an operational level to use these non-invasive eDNA methods to monitor the spawning periods of these two fish species in large lakes.",

    "abstract": "Morphology often reflects ecology, enabling the prediction of ecological roles for taxa that lack direct observations such as fossils. In comparative analyses, ecological traits, like diet, are often treated as categorical, which may aid prediction and simplify analyses but ignores the multivariate nature of ecological niches. Futhermore, methods for quantifying and predicting multivariate ecology remain rare. Here, we ranked the relative importance of 13 food items for a sample of 88 extant carnivoran mammals, and then used Bayesian multilevel modeling to assess whether those rankings could be predicted from dental morphology and body size. Traditional diet categories fail to capture the true multivariate nature of carnivoran diets, but Bayesian regression models derived from living taxa have good predictive accuracy for importance ranks. Using our models to predict the importance of individual food items, the multivariate dietary niche, and the nearest extant analogs for a set of data-deficient extant and extinct carnivoran species confirms long-standing ideas for some taxa, but yields new insights about the fundamental dietary niches of others. Our approach provides a promising alternative to traditional dietary classifications. Importantly, this approach need not be limited to diet, but serves as a general framework for predicting multivariate ecology from phenotypic traits.",

    "abstract": "By providing additional opportunities for coalescence within families, the presence of consanguineous unions in a population reduces coalescence times relative to non-consanguineous populations. First-cousin consanguinity can take one of six forms differing in the configuration of sexes in the pedigree of the male and female cousins who join in a consanguineous union: patrilateral parallel, patrilateral cross, matrilateral parallel, matrilateral cross, bilateral parallel, and bilateral cross. Considering populations with each of the six types of first-cousin consanguinity individually and a population with a mixture of the four unilateral types, we examine coalescent models of consanguinity. We previously computed, for first-cousin consanguinity models, the mean coalescence time for X-chromosomal loci and the limiting distribution of coalescence times for autosomal loci. Here, we use the separation-of-time-scales approach to obtain the limiting distribution of coalescence times for X-chromosomal loci. This limiting distribution has an instantaneous coalescence probability that depends on the probability that a union is consanguineous; lineages that do not coalesce instantaneously coalesce according to an exponential distribution. We study the effects on the coalescence time distribution of the type of first-cousin consanguinity, showing that patrilateral-parallel and patrilateral-cross consanguinity have no effect on X-chromosomal coalescence time distributions and that matrilateral-parallel consanguinity decreases coalescence times to a greater extent than does matrilateral-cross consanguinity.",

Factors related to chromatin organization and activation of transcription have been shown to play a role in the faster response of those cells previously exposed to a stimulus (primed). However, the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation is not yet explored. Here, combining flow cytometry and high throughput sequencing, we perform a genome-wide screen to identify novel factors modulating transcriptional memory in S. cerevisiae in response to galactose nutrition sources. In addition to the well-known chromatin factors modulating transcriptional memory, we find that depletion of the nuclear RNA exosome increases GAL1 expression in primed cells. We perform a genome-wide characterisation of this process and show that changes in nuclear surveillance factor association can enhance both gene induction and repression in primed cells. Finally, we show that in addition to nuclear mRNA degradation, differences in cytoplasmic mRNA decay also modulate transcriptional memory and contribute to faster gene expression remodelling in primed cells. Our results demonstrate that mRNA post-transcriptional regulation, and not only transcription regulation, should be considered when investigating gene expression memory.",

    "abstract": "Song learning is a prime example for a culturally transmitted mating signal. Local or individual song variants are socially learned early in life and adults sing and prefer these songs. An unresolved issue in this context is the question of how learned preferences for specific variants generalise to songs sufficiently similar to the original model. Here we asked whether female zebra finches would generalise early learned song preferences along a similarity gradient based on syllables sharing between test and tutor songs. For each female, this gradient consisted of their tutors (fathers) song (F), two variants of unfamiliar songs edited to share 2/3 (F2/3) and 1/3 (F1/3) of syllables with fathers song and an unfamiliar song (UF). Females preferences were measured in a 4-way operant choice arena where the birds could perch on different operant perches to trigger playbacks of the four different songs. Number and duration of perch visits were positively associated with the number of syllables that the assigned stimuli shared with fathers songs. These results suggest that female zebra finches generalise early learned song preferences to songs sharing syllables (and/or voice characteristics) with songs learned early in life.",

    "abstract": "DNA polymerase {varepsilon} (Pol{varepsilon}) is a key enzyme for DNA replication in eukaryotes. It is attached to a helicase and performs DNA synthesis on the leading strand. Recently it was shown that the catalytic domain of yeast Pol{varepsilon} (Pol{varepsilon}CD) contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster located at the base of the processivity domain (P-domain) and coordinated by four conserved cysteines. In this work, we have shown that human Pol{varepsilon}CD (hPol{varepsilon}CD) expressed in bacterial cells also contains an iron-sulfur cluster. In comparison, recombinant hPol{varepsilon}CD produced in insect cells contains an eight-fold-lower level of iron. Interestingly, the iron content correlates with the level of DNA-binding molecules, which suggests an important role of the iron-sulfur cluster in hPol{varepsilon} interaction with DNA. Indeed, mutation of two conserved cysteines that coordinate the cluster abolished template:primer binding and, therefore, DNA polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities. We propose that the cluster regulates the conformation of the P-domain, which, like a gatekeeper, controls access to a DNA-binding cleft for a template:primer. In addition, we performed kinetic and binding studies of hPol{varepsilon}CD. The binding studies demonstrated low affinity of hPol{varepsilon}CD to DNA and a strong effect of salt concentration on stability of the hPol{varepsilon}CD/DNA complex. Pre-steady-state kinetic studies have shown a maximal polymerization rate constant of 51.5 s-1 and a relatively low affinity to incoming dNTP with an apparent KD of 105 M. This work provides notable insight into the role of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in Pol{varepsilon} function.",

Second, maximum parsimony principle continues to be employed, even though maximum likelihood or Bayesian models are usually more consistent.

This impedes study of persistent infections in vulnerable groups, where such information has a limited use. Finally, most methods implicitly assume that transmission events are independent, while common source outbreaks violate this assumption.\n\nWe propose a maximum likelihood framework SOPHIE (SOcial and PHilogenetic Investigation of Epidemics) based on integration of phylogenetic and random graph models. It infers transmission networks from viral phylogenies and expected properties of inter-host social networks modelled as random graphs with given expected degree distributions.

We find that the attractive interactions that concentrate reactants within the dense phase inhibit reactions by lowering the chemical potential and mobility of the reactants. Therefore, condensed phases are only beneficial if mobility in the condensed phase can be maintained. This can be achieved in multi-step reactions, where the proximity between enzymatic steps results in higher efficiency with less unreacted substrate, but does not increase the reaction rate. Alternatively, mobility can be maintained if recruitment to the condensed phase is driven by multiple attractive moieties that can bind and release independently. However, the spacers necessary to ensure independence between stickers are prone to entangle with the dense phase scaffold. We find an optimal sticker affinity that balances the need for rapid binding/unbinding kinetics and minimal entanglement. Reaction rates can be accelerated by shrinking the size of the dense phase with a corresponding increase in the number of stickers to enhance recruitment.",

    "abstract": "The Australian wine industry is currently under pressure to sustain its profitability due to climate change. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore grapevine genetic diversity and identify superior clones with improved drought resistance. We previously characterised more than 15,000 dry-farmed (for over 65 years) Cabernet Sauvignon clones in a vineyard and identified three drought-tolerant (DT) clones, which can maintain significantly higher intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) under limited soil moisture than drought-sensitive (DS) clones. To understand whether DT clones grown under multi-decadal cyclical drought can prime their vegetatively-propagated clonal progenies for future drought events, in this study, all DT and DS vegetative progenies were propagated with commercial clones in the glasshouse. Their physiological and molecular responses were investigated under well-watered and two recurrent drought (D1 and D2) conditions. We observed that concentration of a natural priming agent, {gamma}-amino butyric acid (GABA), were significantly higher in all DT progenies relative to other progenies under drought. Both commercial and DT progenies exhibited improved gas exchange, photosynthetic performance and WUEi under recurrent drought events relative to DS progenies. Our results suggest that DT progenies have adapted to be in a \"primed state\" to withstand future drought events.",

    "abstract": "Triglycerides (TG) in adipocytes provide the major stores of metabolic energy in the body. Optimal amounts of TG stores are desirable as insufficient capacity to store TG, as in lipodystrophy, or exceeding the capacity for storage, as in obesity, results in metabolic disease. We hypothesized that mice lacking TG storage in adipocytes would result in excess TG storage in cell types other than adipocytes and severe lipotoxicity accompanied by metabolic disease. To test this hypothesis, we selectively deleted both TG-synthesis enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2, in adipocytes (ADGAT DKO mice). As expected with depleted energy stores, ADGAT DKO mice did not tolerate fasting well and, with prolonged fasting, entered torpor. However, ADGAT DKO mice were unexpectedly otherwise metabolically healthy and did not accumulate TGs ectopically or develop associated metabolic perturbations, even when fed a high-fat diet. The favorable metabolic phenotype resulted from activation of energy expenditure, in part via BAT activation and beiging of white adipose tissue. Thus, the ADGAT DKO mice provide a fascinating new model to study the coupling of metabolic energy storage to energy expenditure.",

    "abstract": "Volume electron microscopy, a powerful approach to generate large three-dimensional cell and tissue volumes at electron microscopy resolutions, is rapidly becoming a routine tool for understanding fundamental and applied biological questions. One of the enabling factors for its adoption has been the development of conventional fixation protocols with improved heavy metal staining. However, freeze-substitution with organic solvent-based fixation and staining has not realized the same level of benefit. Here, we report a straightforward approach including 2% osmium tetroxide, acetone and up to 3% water substitution fluid (compatible with traditional or fast freeze-substitution protocols), warm-up and transition from organic solvent to aqueous 2% OsO4. Once fully hydrated, samples were processed in aqueous based potassium ferrocyanide, thiocarbohydrazide, osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate and lead acetate before resin infiltration and polymerization. We observed a consistent and substantial increase in heavy metal staining across diverse and difficult-to-fix test organisms and tissue types, including plant tissues, nematodes, yeast, and bacteria. Our approach opens new possibilities to combine the benefits of cryo-preservation with enhanced contrast for volume electron microscopy in diverse organisms.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of moment-to-moment neural variability may permit effective responses to changing cognitive demands. However, the mechanisms that support variability regulation are unknown. In the context of working memory, we leverage the largest available PET and fMRI dataset to jointly consider three lenses through which neural variability regulation could be understood: dopamine capacity, network-level functional integration, and flexible decision processes. We show that with greater working memory load, upregulation of variability was associated with elevated dopamine capacity and heightened functional integration, effects dominantly expressed in the striato-thalamic system rather than cortex. Strikingly, behavioral modeling revealed that working memory load evoked substantial decision biases during evidence accumulation, and those who jointly expressed a more optimal decision bias and higher dopamine capacity were most likely to upregulate striato-thalamic variability under load. We argue that the ability to align striato-thalamic variability to level of demand may be a hallmark of a well-functioning brain.",

It is unknown, however, whether such periodicity exists for behaviorally relevant time scales in the human brain. Here we investigated neuronal firing during a temporally continuous uninterrupted experience by presenting fourteen neurosurgical patients with an audiovisual video while recording single neuron activity from multiple brain regions. We report on a set of units that modulate their activity in a strikingly periodic manner across different timescales--from seconds to many minutes. These cells were most prevalent in the entorhinal cortex. Time within the video could be decoded from their population activity. Furthermore, these cells remapped their dominant periodicity to shorter timescales during a subsequent recognition memory task. When the audiovisual sequence was presented at two different speeds (regular and faster), a significant percentage of these temporally periodic cells (TPCs) maintained their timescales, suggesting a degree of invariance with respect to the narrative content. The temporal periodicity of TPCs may complement the spatial periodicity of grid cells Whether these cells provide scalable spatiotemporal metrics for encoding and retrieval of human experience warrants future investigations.",

The number, shape, and plasticity of synapses are altered during development. However, the dynamics of synaptic protein composition across development have not been fully understood. Here we show alterations of PSD protein composition in mouse and primate brains during development. Proteins involved in synapse regulation are enriched in the differentially expressed (288 decreased and 267 increased) proteins on mouse PSD after a 2-week-old. We find that the changes in PSD protein abundance in mouse brains correlate with gene expression levels in postnatal mice and perinatal primates. This alteration of PSD composition is likely to be defective in the brains of mouse models or patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Finally, we demonstrate that the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) changes PSD composition after the juvenile period. The alteration of PSD composition after 2-month-old is distinct from that observed in mice. Our results provide a comprehensive architecture of the remodeling of PSD composition across development, which may explain the molecular basics of synapse maturation and the pathology of psychiatric disorders, such as ASD.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by progressive loss of motor neurons and there is currently no effective therapy. Cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) within the CNS is a pathological hallmark in sporadic ALS and prion-like propagation of pathogenic TDP-43 is thought to be implicated in disease progression. However, cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic TDP-43 in the human CNS has not been confirmed experimentally.\n\nHere we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cerebral organoids as recipient CNS tissue model that are anatomically relevant human brain. We injected postmortem spinal cord protein extracts individually from three non-ALS or five sporadic ALS patients containing pathogenic TDP-43 into the cerebral organoids to validate the templated propagation and spreading of TDP-43 pathology in human CNS tissue.\n\nWe first demonstrated that the administration of spinal cord extracts from an ALS patient induced the formation of TDP-43 pathology that progressively spread in a time-dependent manner in cerebral organoids, suggesting that pathogenic TDP-43 from ALS functioned as seeds and propagated cell-to-cell to form de novo TDP-43 pathology. We also reported that the administration of ALS patient-derived protein extracts caused astrocyte proliferation to form astrogliosis in cerebral organoids, reproducing the pathological feature seen in ALS. Moreover, we showed pathogenic TDP-43 induced cellular apoptosis and that TDP-43 pathology correlated with genomic damage due to DNA double-strand breaks.\n\nThus, our results provide evidence that patient-derived pathogenic TDP-43 can mimic the prion-like propagation of TDP-43 pathology in human CNS tissue. Our findings indicate that our assays with human cerebral organoids that replicate ALS pathophysiology have a promising strategy for creating readouts that could be used in future drug discovery efforts against ALS.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive acts take place over a large range of temporal scales. Numerous corresponding gradients in neurodynamic timescales and long-range cortical interactions are believed to provide organizational constraints to the brain and influence neural populations roles in cognition. However, it is unclear if gradients in various types of neural timescales and functional connectivity arise from related or distinct neurophysiological processes and if they influence behavior. Here, intracranial recordings from 4,090 electrode contacts in 35 individuals were used to systematically map gradients of multiple aspects of neurodynamics, neural timescales, and functional connectivity, and assess their interactions along category-selective ventral temporal cortex. Opposing functional connectivity gradients, with decreasing connectivity to visually responsive regions and increasing connectivity to regions that were not visually responsive, were observed along the ventral visual hierarchy. Endogenous neural timescales were correlated with functional connectivity to visually responsive regions after removing the effects of shared anatomical gradients, suggesting that these properties influence one another. Different stimulus evoked and endogenous timescales exhibited gradients with longer dynamics along the ventral visual hierarchy, but none of these timescales were significantly correlated with one another. This suggests that local neural timescales depend on neural and cognitive context and different timescales may arise through distinct neurophysiological processes. Furthermore, activity from neural populations with faster endogenous timescales and stronger functional connectivity to visually responsive regions was more predictive of perceptual behavior during a visual repeat detection task. These results reveal interrelationships and key distinctions among neural timescale and functional connectivity gradients that together can influence behavior.",

In the current study we investigated the influence of acute stress on the balance between habitual response and the goal-directed system.\n\nMethodsA sample of N = 116 pathological gamblers (PG) and healthy controls (HC) performed an acute stress task - the Socially Evaluated Cold pressure task (SECPT) - or a control task.

    "abstract": "During inflammatory, demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) axonal damage is prevalent early in the disease course. Axonal damage includes swellings, defects in transport, and failure to clear damaged intracellular proteins, all of which affect recovery and compromise the integrity of neurons and remyelination. Autophagy and the clearance of damaged cell components by the proteasome are important for the maintenance of normal cellular turnover; and the restoration of cellular homeostasis. The gradual accumulation of insoluble proteins in the brain is known to impair recovery from several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify insoluble proteins within high-speed, mercaptoethanol/sarcosyl-insoluble pellets from purified white matter plaques isolated from the brains of individuals with MS. We determined that insoluble transmembrane protein106B (TMEM106B), expressed in neurons and glia and normally lysosomal-associated, is increased in MS plaques relative to normal-appearing white matter from individuals with Alzheimers disease and non-neurologic controls. We found that decreased TMEM106B protein in mice results in significant axonal damage and lipid droplet accumulation in the spinal cord following chronic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. When TMEM106Bt/t mice were treated with cuprizone to experimentally induce demyelination, a significant increase in lipid deposition was observed in the corpus callosum of TMEM106Bt/t mice post-cuprizone withdrawal. Our study shows that the brain and spinal cord from challenged TMEM106Bt/t mice accumulate OilRedO+/Perilipin2+ lipid droplets. We postulate that increased insolubility of TMEM106B in MS plaques limits debris clearance by the lysosome which over time contributes to failed remyelination and axonal defects.\n\nAbbreviated AbstractTransmembrane protein106B (TMEM106B), a lysosome-associated protein, is significantly less soluble in multiple sclerosis plaques than in white matter controls. Decreased TMEM106B produces significant axonal damage and lipid accumulation in mouse models of demyelinating diseases. TMEM106B insolubility and likely loss of function may limit lysosome transport and contribute to CNS pathology.",

Physiologically, these mice bore the hallmark features of dystonia: spontaneous contractions at rest, excessive sustained contractions during voluntary movements including co-contractions of motor antagonists, and altered sensory-motor reflexes. Furthermore, spinal locomotor circuits were impaired.

    "abstract": "Memory consolidation processes have traditionally been investigated from the perspective of hours or days. However, the latest developments in memory research showed that memory consolidation processes could occur even within seconds, possibly due to the neural replay of just-practiced memory traces during short breaks. Here, we investigate this rapid form of consolidation during statistical learning. We aim to answer (a) whether this rapid consolidation occurs in implicit statistical learning and general skill learning and (b) whether the duration of rest periods affects these two learning types differently. Participants performed a widely used statistical learning task - the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task - that enables us to measure implicit statistical and general skill learning separately. The ASRT task consisted of 25 learning blocks with a rest period between the blocks. In a between-subjects design, the length of the rest periods was fixed at 15 or 30 seconds, or the participants could control the length themselves. We found that the duration of rest periods does not affect the amount of statistical knowledge acquired but does change the dynamics of learning. Shorter rest periods led to better learning during the learning blocks, whereas longer rest periods promoted learning also in the between block rest periods, possibly due to the higher amount of replay. Moreover, we found weaker general skill learning in the self-paced group than in the fixed rest period groups. These results suggest that distinct learning processes are differently affected by the duration of short rest periods.",

    "abstract": "Background/PurposeMulticenter study designs involving a variety of MRI scanners have become increasingly common. However, these present the issue of biases in image-based measures due to scanner or site differences. To assess these biases, we imaged 11 volunteers with multiple sclerosis (MS) with scan and rescan data at 4 sites.\n\nMaterials and MethodsImages were acquired on Siemens or Philips scanners at 3-tesla. Automated white matter lesion detection and whole brain, gray and white matter, and thalamic volumetry were performed, as well as expert manual delineations of T1 and T2 (FLAIR) lesions. Random effect and permutation-based nonparametric modeling was performed to assess differences in estimated volumes within and across sites.\n\nResultsRandom effect modeling demonstrated model assumption violations for most comparisons of interest. Non-parametric modeling indicated that site explained > 50% of the variation for most estimated volumes. This expanded to > 75% when data from both Siemens and Philips scanners were included. Permutation tests revealed significant differences between average inter- and intra-scanner differences in most estimated brain volumes (P < .05). The automatic activation of spine coil elements during some acquisitions resulted in a shading artifact in these images. Permutation tests revealed significant differences between thalamic volume measurements from acquisitions with and without this artifact.\n\nConclusionDifferences in brain volumetry persisted across MR scanners despite protocol harmonization. These differences were not well explained by variance component modeling; however, statistical innovations for mitigating inter-scanner differences show promise in reducing biases in multi-center studies of MS.",

    "abstract": "Encoding models provide a powerful framework to identify the information represented in brain recordings. In this framework, a stimulus representation is expressed within a feature space and is used in a regularized linear regression to predict brain activity. To account for a potential complementarity of different feature spaces, a joint model is fit on multiple feature spaces simultaneously. To adapt regularization strength to each feature space, ridge regression is extended to banded ridge regression, which optimizes a different regularization hyperparameter per feature space. The present paper proposes a method to decompose over feature spaces the variance explained by a banded ridge regression model. It also describes how banded ridge regression performs a feature-space selection, effectively ignoring non-predictive and redundant feature spaces. This feature-space selection leads to better prediction accuracy and to better interpretability. Banded ridge regression is then mathematically linked to a number of other regression methods with similar feature-space selection mechanisms. Finally, several methods are proposed to address the computational challenge of fitting banded ridge regressions on large numbers of voxels and feature spaces. All implementations are released in an open-source Python package called Himalaya.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pneumonia in hospitalized patients. Its increasing antibiotic resistance and widespread occurrence present a pressing need for vaccines. We previously showed that a P. aeruginosa type III secretion system protein, PopB elicits a strong Th17 response in mice after intranasal (IN) immunization and confers antibody-independent protection against pneumonia in mice. In the current study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice of the combination of PopB (purified with its chaperone protein PcrH) and OprF/I, an outer membrane hybrid fusion protein, compared to immunization with the proteins individually either by the intranasal (IN) or subcutaneous (SC) routes. Our results show that after vaccination, a Th17 recall response from splenocytes was detected only in mice vaccinated with PopB/PcrH, either alone or in combination with OprF/I. Mice that were immunized with the combination of PopB/PcrH and OprF/I had enhanced protection in an acute lethal P. aeruginosa pneumonia model, regardless of vaccine route, compared to the mice vaccinated the with either alone or adjuvant control. Immunization generated IgG titers against the vaccine proteins and whole P. aeruginosa cells. Interestingly, none of these antisera had opsonophagocytic killing activity, but antisera from mice immunized with vaccines containing OprF/I had the ability to block IFN-{gamma} binding to OprF/I, a known virulence mechanism. Hence, vaccines combining PopB/PcrH with OprF/I that elicit functional antibodies lead to a broadly and potently protective vaccine against P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, gut commensal microbiota interact extensively with the host and the same interactions can be dysregulated in diseased states. The development of methods to monitor gut microbiota in vivo can lead to improved foundational understanding of the biological events underpinning these interactions. The current standard for non-invasive monitoring of gut bacteria entails classification by 16S rRNA sequencing from fecal samples. This method has many advantages but also has serious limitations, especially for monitoring dynamic changes in the gut of live animals. In recent years, several imaging techniques have been widely adopted that afford non-invasive assessment of animal subjects - most notably in cancer biology; however, these technical gains have not translated to the imaging of gut bacterial communities. Herein, we describe a method to non-invasively image commensal bacteria based on the specific metabolic labeling of bacterial cell walls to illuminate the gut bacteria of live mice. This tagging strategy may additionally provide unprecedented insight into cell wall turnover of gut commensals, which has implications for bacterial cellular growth and division, in a live animal.",

    "abstract": "Glucose stimulation induces the remodeling of microtubules in Islet {beta}-cells to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. CAMSAP2 is a microtubule minus-end binding protein and is reported to stabilize and position microtubules in several non-{beta}-cells, such as human retinal pigment epithelium cells. In immortalized insulinoma MIN6 cells, CAMSAP2 binds to and forms short stretches at microtubule minus ends in the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the reported subcellular localization and functions of CAMSAP2 in non-{beta}-cells. Surprisingly, we found that CAMSAP2 expressed in primary islet {beta}-cells does not form short stretches in the cytoplasm, but instead is localized to the Golgi apparatus. This novel localization is specific to {beta}-but not -cells in islets and it is independent of MT-binding. Knockdown of CAMSAP2 by shRNA impairs Golgi-ER trafficking, reduces total insulin content, and attenuates GSIS without affecting the MT dynamics or releasability of insulin granules in islet {beta}-cells. Corresponding to these results, we found that primary islets and MIN6 cells express different CAMSAP2 isoforms. We propose that primary islet {beta} cells use a novel CAMSAP2 isoform for a MT-independent non-canonical function, which is to promote Golgi-ER trafficking that supports efficient production of insulin secretory granules.",

    "abstract": "While macrophages are most commonly known for their roles in innate immunity, a growing body of evidence supports the idea that fetal-derived tissue-resident macrophages play developmental roles during organogenesis. In the testis, it has long been proposed that macrophages are important players in steroidogenesis and other testicular functions, but which macrophage populations are involved is unclear. We previously showed that macrophages play critical roles in fetal testis morphogenesis and reported the presence of 2 unique adult testicular macrophage populations, interstitial and peritubular. There has been some debate regarding the hematopoietic origins of testicular macrophages and whether distinct macrophage populations promote specific testicular functions. Here we have undertaken an extensive lineage-tracing study of mouse hematopoietic cells. We found that, while yolk-sac-derived macrophages comprise the earliest testicular macrophages, fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to monocytes that colonize the gonad during a narrow time window in mid-gestation, after which time HSCs no longer contribute to testicular macrophages. These long-lived monocytes, over the course of fetal and postnatal life, differentiate into testicular macrophages. Our data indicate that Sertoli cells, and not germ cells, are required for recruitment of immune cells and peritubular macrophage differentiation. Finally, we show that yolk-sac-derived macrophages and HSC-derived macrophages play distinct roles in testis cord morphogenesis, whereas interstitial macrophages promote adult Leydig cell proliferation and steroid production. Overall, our findings offer clarity regarding the origins of testicular macrophages and provide insight into the diversity of their tissue-specific developmental roles.",

    "abstract": "Breeding birds in agricultural landscapes have declined considerably since the 1950s and the beginning of agricultural intensification in Europe. Given the increasing pressure on agricultural land, it is necessary to identify conservation measures that consume little productive land. We tested the compensation hypothesis which states that field margins may represent substitute habitats for bird species in agricultural wetlands. We monitored bird species in 86 crop fields in rice paddy landscapes of Camargue (southern France), a wetland of international importance for birds. We investigated whether the area of three types of field margins (reed strips, grass strips and hedgerows) within a 500 meter buffer around the centroid of each crop fields had an effect on the abundance of bird species from three groups defined based on their primary habitat (reedbeds, grasslands, and forest edge species). We controlled for the area of each type of semi-natural habitat (wetlands, grasslands, and woodlands), crop diversity (rice, wheat, alfalfa, rape, and market gardening) and mean crop field size. Results show partial support of the compensation hypothesis with species-dependent responses to primary and substitute habitat area. Some species within the reedbed and grassland bird guilds are favored by the area of their primary habitat as well as by the area of field margins, in line with the compensation hypothesis. Eurasian reed warbler is favored by the area of both wetlands and reed strips. Corn bunting is favored by grassland and grass strip areas. We could not confirm the compensation hypothesis for other species. However, this may be due to the fact that most of these species did not respond to their primary habitat. These results therefore suggest that field margins may represent substitute habitats for some species but further studies, in contexts where species are strongly associated with their primary habitat, would be needed to confirm the generality of this hypothesis. Our results also suggest that species response to increasing the area of a field margin type may vary among guilds and even within guilds. Therefore, it may be difficult to favor all species within a given landscape and management actions may need to be tailored to whichever species are locally associated with the highest conservation priority. To tackle this challenge, it may be necessary to design landscape management actions at different spatial scales.",

The identification of this type of polymorphisms in athletes represents a resource that contributes significantly to the processes of training, selection and sports orientation.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to describe type and frequencies of allelic and genotypic variants in ACTN3, ACE, AGT, BDRKB2 and IL6 genes in sub elite rugby athletes in Colombia. Additionally, the polymorphisms found were compared with a control population, as well as contrasted according to playing position backs and forwards.\n\nIn this research, 47 individuals from the Vallecaucana rugby league and 67 from a control group (non-athletes) were sampled. All were analyzed for polymorphisms in the ACE, AGT, ACTN3, IL6 and BDKRB2 genes, using the PCR RFLPs technique. The significance of the differences between the experimental and control groups was tested by the X2 test (p <0.05).\n\nIn rugby athletes we found a higher frequency of allele D (0.883) ACE gene, allele R (0.63) ACTN3 gene, allele G (0.819) IL6 gene, all associated with strength and power sports. There are significant genotypic differences between athletes and the control population in all the genes analyzed and significant allelic differences in the ACE, ACTN3, BDRKB2 and IL6 genes. When comparing the playing positions (backs vs. forwards), significant genotypic differences were observed in the ACTN3, BDRKB2, AGT and IL6 genes. At the allelic level, the R and X alleles of the ACTN3 gene and the I allele of the ACE gene show significant differences.\n\nIn conclusion, in the polymorphisms analyzed, an association with strength sports, explosive strength and rugby is observed. Significant genotypic and allelic differences were also recorded between the backs and forwards positions, as well as significant differences in the allelic and genotypic structure between the group of athletes and the control population.",

Optical mapping is an alternative approach for mapping SVs that has been shown to have higher sensitivity than DNA sequencing approaches. The aim of this project was to use optical mapping to develop a high-quality database of structural variation across cattle breeds from different geographical regions, to enable further study of SVs in cattle.\n\nTo do this we generated 100X Bionano optical mapping data for 18 cattle of nine different ancestries, three continents and both cattle sub-species. In total we identified 13,457 SVs, of which 1,200 putatively overlap coding regions. This resource provides a high-quality set of optical mapping-based SV calls that can be used across studies, from validating DNA sequencing-based SV calls to prioritising candidate functional variants in genetic association studies and expanding our understanding of the role of SVs in cattle evolution.",

    "abstract": "Varroa destructor is a cosmopolitan pest and leading cause of colony loss of the European honey bee. Historically described as a competent vector of honey bee viruses, this arthropod vector is cause for the global pandemic of Deformed wing virus, now endemic in honeybee populations. Our work shows viral spread is driven by Varroa actively switching from one adult bee to another as they feed. Assays using fluorescent microspheres were used to show the movement of fluids in both directions between host and vector when Varroa feed. Therefore, Varroa could be in either an infectious or naive state dependent upon the disease status of their host. We tested this and confirm that the relative risk of a Varroa feeding was dependent on the infectiousness of their previous host. Varroa exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in their host switching behavior, with some Varroa switching infrequently while others switch at least daily. As a result, relatively few of the most active Varroa parasitize the majority of bees. This multiple feeding behavior has analogs in vectorial capacity models of other systems, where promiscuous feeding by individual vectors is a leading driver of vectorial capacity. We propose that the honeybee-Varroa relationship offers a unique opportunity to apply principles of vectorial capacity to a social organism, as virus transmission is both vectored and occurs through multiple host-to-host routes common to a crowded society.",

Here, we conducted the first global proteome profiling of rat CMV-infected cells and uncovered a pronounced loss of the transcription factor STAT2, which is crucial for interferon signalling. Deletion mutagenesis documented that STAT2 is targeted by the viral protein E27. Cellular and in vitro analyses showed that E27 exploits host-derived Cullin4-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL4) to induce poly-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of STAT2. A cryo-electron microscopic structure determination revealed how E27 mimics molecular surface properties of cellular CRL4 substrate receptors called DDB1- and Cullin4-associated factors (DCAFs) to displace them from the catalytic core of CRL4. Moreover, structural analyses elucidated the mechanism of STAT2 recruitment and indicate that E27-binding additionally disturbs STAT2-dependent interferon signalling by occupying its IRF9 binding interface. For the first time, these data provide structural insights into cytomegalovirus-encoded interferon antagonism and establish an atomic model for STAT2 counteraction by CRL4 misappropriation with important implications for viral immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Forestry utilizes volume predictor functions utilizing as input the diameter at breast height. Some of those functions take the power form Y = a * Xb. In fact this function is fundamental for the biology field of allometric scaling theories founded round about a century ago. The theory describes the relationships between organs/body parts and the complete body of organisms.\n\nWith digital methods we can generate 3d forest point clouds non destructively in short time frames. SimpleForest is one free available tool which generates fully automated ground and tree models from high resoluted forest plots. Generated topological ordered cylinder models are called commonly QSMs.\n\nWe use SimpleForest QSMs an build a function which estimates the total supported wood volume at any given point of the tree. As input we use the supported soft wood volume for those query points. Instead of measuring directly the soft wood volume we use as a proxy the number of supported twigs. We argue with the pipe model theory for the correctness of the proxy.\n\nWe can use the named relationship to also filter our QSMs made of an open data set of tree clouds. The filter corrects overestimated radii. And we compare the corrected QSM volume against the harvested reference data for 66 felled trees. We also found QSM data of TreeQSM, a competitive and broadly accepted QSM modeling tool. Our RMSE was less than 40% of the tree QSM RMSE. And for other error measures, the r2adj. and the CCC, the relative improvement looked even better with 27% and 21% respectively.\n\nWe consider this manuscript as highly impactful because of the magnitude of quality improvement we do. The relation between soft volume and total volume distributions seems to be really strong and tree data can easily also be used as example data for the generic field of allometric scaling.",

    "abstract": "Auxin is well known to stimulate coleoptile elongation and rapid seedling growth in the air. However, its role in regulating rice germination and seedling establishment under submergence is largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that excessive levels of IAA frequently cause the inhibition of plant growth and development. In the present study, the high-level accumulation of endogenous IAA is observed under submergence in the dark, stimulating rice coleoptile elongation but limiting the root and primary leaf growth during anaerobic germination (AG). We found that oxygen and light can reduce IAA levels, promote the seedling establishment and enhance rice AG tolerance. miRNA microarray profiling and RNA gel blot analysis results show that the expression of miR167 is negatively regulated by submergence; it subsequently modulates the accumulation of free IAA through the miR167-ARF-GH3 pathway. The OsGH3-8 encodes an IAA-amido synthetase that functions to prevent free IAA accumulation. Reduced miR167 levels or overexpressing OsGH3-8 increase auxin metabolism, reduce endogenous levels of free IAA and enhance rice AG tolerance. The present study reveals that poor seed germination and seedling growth inhibition resulting from excessive IAA accumulation would cause intolerance to submergence in rice, suggesting that a certain threshold level of auxin is essential for rice AG tolerance.",

    "abstract": "The specific functions of cellular organelles and sub-compartments depend on their protein content, which can be characterized by spatial proteomics approaches. However, many spatial proteomics methods are limited in their ability to resolve organellar sub-compartments, profile multiple sub-compartments in parallel, and/or characterize membrane-associated proteomes. Here, we develop a cross-link assisted spatial proteomics (CLASP) strategy that addresses these shortcomings. Using human mitochondria as a model system, we show that CLASP can elucidate spatial proteomes of all mitochondrial sub-compartments and provide topological insight into the mitochondrial membrane proteome in a single experiment. Biochemical and imaging-based follow-up studies demonstrate that CLASP allows discovering mitochondria-associated proteins and revising previous protein sub-compartment localization and membrane topology data. This study extends the scope of cross-linking mass spectrometry beyond protein structure and interaction analysis towards spatial proteomics, establishes a method for concomitant profiling of sub-organelle and membrane proteomes, and provides a resource for mitochondrial spatial biology.",

    "abstract": "In the mouse, more than 1,100 odorant receptors (ORs) are expressed in a monogenic and monoallelic fashion, referred to as singular gene expression. Using a 21bp singular-choice enhancer (x21), we radically increase representation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) choosing a 5x21 enhanced OR transgene, but not overexpression of its mRNA on a per cell basis. RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis identified 425 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). ORs make up 86% of all DEGs, of which 325 have decreased representation and 40 have increased representation. Underrepresented ORs include Class I, Class II and TAAR genes and within each of their respective olfactory bulb domains: DI, DII, and DIII (TAAR) we committedly observe multiple homogeneous glomeruli with an OR1A1-identity. The underrepresentation of endogenous, class-specific ORs across evolutionarily distinct cell types in favor of the expression of the 5x21-OR1A1 transgene argues that a common mechanism of singular gene choice is present for all OR-expressing OSNs.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen isotope ({delta}15N) analysis of animal tissue is widely used in archaeology and palaeoecology to investigate diet and ecological niche. Data interpretations require an understanding of nitrogen isotope compositions at the base of the food web (baseline {delta}15N). Significant variation in animal {delta}15N has been recognised at various spatiotemporal scales and linked to changes both in baseline {delta}15N and animal ecology. Isoscapes (models of isotope spatial variation) have proved a useful tool for investigating spatial variability in biogeochemical cycles in present-day marine and terrestrial ecosystems, but so far, their application to palaeo-data has been limited. Here, we present time-sliced nitrogen isoscapes for late Pleistocene and early Holocene Europe (c. 50,000 to 10,000 years BP) using herbivore collagen {delta}15N data. This period covers the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition, during which significant variation in the terrestrial nitrogen cycle occurred. Our results show clear changes in spatial gradients of {delta}15N through time. Prediction of the lowest faunal {delta}15N values in northern latitudes after, rather than during, the Last Glacial Maximum is consistent with the Late Glacial Nitrogen Excursion (LGNE). We consider the potential of incorporating climatic covariate data into isoscape models but find their inclusion does not improve model performance. These findings have implications for investigating the drivers of the LGNE, which has been linked to increased landscape moisture and permafrost thaw, and for understanding changing isotopic baselines, which are fundamental for studies investigating diets, niche partitioning, and migration of higher trophic level animals.",

    "abstract": "The HEAT domains are a family of helical hairpin repeat domains, composed of four or more hairpins. HEAT is derived from the names of four family members: huntingtin, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 3 (eEF3), protein phosphatase 2 regulatory A subunit (PP2A), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). HEAT domain-containing proteins play roles in a wide range of cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, nuclear transport and metabolism, and cell signaling. The PCI domains are a related group of helical hairpin domains, with a \"winged-helix\" (WH) subdomain at their C-terminus, which is responsible for multi-subunit complex formation with other PCI domains. The name is derived from the complexes, where these domains are found: the Proteasome \"lid\" regulatory subcomplex, the COP9 signalosome (CSN), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3). We noted that in structure homology searches using HEAT domains, sometimes PCI domains appeared in the search results ahead of other HEAT domains, which indicated that the PCI domains could be members of the HEAT domain family, and not a related but separate group. Here, we report extensive structure homology analysis of HEAT and PCI domains, both within and between the two groups of proteins. We present evidence that the PCI domains as a group have greater structural homology with individual groups of HEAT domains than some of the HEAT domain groups have among each other. Therefore, our results indicate that the PCI domains have evolved from a HEAT domain that acquired a WH subdomain. The WH subdomain in turn mediated selfassociation into a multi-subunit complex, which eventually evolved into the common ancestor of the Proteasome lid/CSN/eIF3.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease which increases in frequency with age eventually impacting most people over the age of 65. OA is the leading cause of disability and impaired mobility, yet the pathogenesis of OA remains unclear. Treatments have focused mainly on pain relief and reducing joint swelling. Currently there are no effective treatments to slow the progression of the disease and to prevent irreversible loss of cartilage. Here we demonstrate that stable expression of ROR{beta} in cultured cells results in alteration of a gene program that is supportive of chondrogenesis and is protective against development of OA. Specifically, we determined that ROR{beta} regulates the balance of FGFRs signaling on FGFR1/FGFR3 that ERK1/2-MAPK signaling was suppressed by FGFR1(cartilage destruction) and AKT signaling was enhanced by FGFR3 (cartilage protection). These results suggest a critical role for ROR{beta} in chondrogenesis and suggest that identification of mechanisms that control the expression of ROR{beta} in chondrocytes could lead to the development of disease modifying therapies for the treatment of OA.",
