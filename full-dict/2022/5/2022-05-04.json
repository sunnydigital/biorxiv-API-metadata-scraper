    "abstract": "Comparing single-stranded nucleic acids (ssNAs) secondary structures is fundamental when investigating their function and evolution and predicting the effect of mutations on the ssNAs structures. Many comparison metrics exist, although they are either too elaborate or not enough sensitive to distinguish close ssNAs structures.\n\nIn this context, we developed AptaMat, a simple and sensitive algorithm for ssNAs secondary structures comparison based on matrices representing the ssNAs secondary structures and a metric built upon the Manhattan distance in the plane. We applied AptaMat to several examples and compared the results to those obtained by the most frequently used metrics, namely the Hamming distance and the RNAdistance, and by a recently developed image-based approach. We showed that AptaMat is able to discriminate between similar sequences, outperforming all the other here considered metrics.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has a relatively poor long-term survival and limited treatment options. Promising targets for immunotherapy are short peptide neoantigens containing tumor mutations, presented to cytotoxic T-cells by human leukocyte antigen molecules (HLA). Despite an association between putative neoantigen abundance and therapeutic response across cancers, immunogenic neoantigens are challenging to identify. Here we characterized the mutational and immunopeptidomic landscapes of tumors from a cohort of seven patients with EAC. We directly identified one HLA-I presented neoantigen from one patient, and report functional T-cell responses from a predicted HLA-II neoantigen in a second patient. The predicted class II neoantigen contains both HLA I and II binding motifs. Our exploratory observations are consistent with previous neoantigen studies in finding that neoantigens are rarely directly observed, and an identification success rate following prediction in the order of 10%. However, our identified putative neoantigen is capable of eliciting strong T-cell responses, emphasizing the need for improved strategies for neoantigen identification.",

    "abstract": "Dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that induce toxicity by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand activated transcription factor. The zebrafish model has been used to define the developmental toxicity observed following exposure to exogenous AHR ligands such as the potent agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin, TCDD). While the model has successfully identified cellular targets of TCDD and molecular mechanisms mediating TCDD-induced phenotypes, fundamental information such as the body burden produced by standard exposure paradigms is still unknown. We performed targeted gas chromatography (GC) high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) in tandem with non-targeted liquid chromatography (LC) HRMS to quantify TCDD uptake, model the elimination dynamics of TCDD, and determine how TCDD exposure affects the zebrafish metabolome. We found that 10 ppb, 1 ppb, and 50 ppt waterborne exposures during early embryogenesis produced environmentally relevant body burden of TCDD: 38 {+/-} 4.34, 26.6 {+/-} 1.2, and 8.53 {+/-} 0.341 pg/embryo, respectively, at 24 hours post fertilization. In addition, we discovered that TCDD exposure was associated with the dysregulation of several metabolic pathways that are critical for brain development and function including glutamate metabolism, chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis, and tyrosine metabolism pathways.

This study aimed to develop a biosensor system that can evaluate direct cell-cell contact and interactions between immune effector and target cells induced by therapeutic antibodies in physiologically relevant environments.\n\nExperimental ApproachThe system uses two structural complementary luciferase units (SmBit and LgBit) expressed on the respective membranes of immune effector and target cells. Upon cell-cell contact, the two subunits form active NanoLuc, generating a luminescent signal, allowing for real-time monitoring of cell-cell interactions and quantitatively assessing the pharmacological effects of therapeutic antibodies.\n\nKey ResultsWe optimized the system to ensure selectivity by adjusting the spacer lengths between two luciferase units to minimize interference from nonspecific intercellular contact. The system was able to quantitatively and longitudinally monitor cell-cell interactions between NK and target cells induced by rituximab and between T and target cells induced by blinatumomab in a three-dimensional cell culture system. The observation that NK cells exhibited faster interactions with target cells compared to T cells is intriguing and suggests potential differences in the mechanisms or kinetics of cell-cell interactions between different types of effector cells and tumor cells.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsThe biosensor system has the potential for broad applications to optimize antibody pharmacology and efficacy in various therapeutic areas through a deeper understanding of antibody-mediated cell-cell interactions.\n\nWhat is already knownO_LITherapeutic antibodies can activate the immune system to elicit cytotoxicity through inducing cell-cell interactions between immune and tumor cells.\nC_LIO_LIApproaches for longitudinally evaluating cell-cell interaction induced by therapeutic antibodies remain limited.\nC_LI\n\nWhat does this study addO_LIThis study develops a biosensor system for detecting cell-cell interactions induced by therapeutic antibodies in a longitudinal manner.\nC_LIO_LIThe system is able to monitor cell-cell interactions between NK and target cells, as well as between T and target cells, in a three-dimensional cell culture system.\nC_LI\n\nWhat is the clinical significanceO_LIThe biosensor system has the potential for broad applications in the field of antibody pharmacology by providing a deeper understanding of antibody-mediated cell-cell interactions and their dynamics.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a popular eukaryal model organism for cell division and cell cycle studies. With this extensive knowledge of its cell and molecular biology, S. pombe also holds promise for use in metabolism research and industrial applications. However, unlike the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a major workhorse in these areas, cell physiology and metabolism of S. pombe remain less explored. One way to advance understanding of organism-specific metabolism is construction of computational models and their use for hypothesis testing. To this end, we leverage existing knowledge of S. cerevisiae to generate a manually-curated high-quality reconstruction of S. pombes metabolic network, including a proteome-constrained version of the model. Using these models, we gain insights into the energy demands for growth, as well as ribosome kinetics in S. pombe. Furthermore, we predict proteome composition and identify growth-limiting constraints that determine optimal metabolic strategies under different glucose availability regimes, and reproduce experimentally determined metabolic profiles. Notably, we find similarities in metabolic and proteome predictions of S. pombe with S. cerevisiae, which indicate that similar cellular resource constraints operate to dictate metabolic organization. With these use cases, we show, on the one hand, how these models provide an efficient means to transfer metabolic knowledge from a well-studied to a lesser-studied organism, and on the other, how they can successfully be used to explore the metabolic behaviour and the role of resource allocation in driving different strategies in fission yeast.",

Although teleosts live in a diverse set of environments, the skeletal pattern of pectoral fins in teleosts is considered to show little morphological variability. Here, in order to elucidate variations in pectoral fin skeletons and to identify their evolutionary processes, we compared the pectoral fin skeletons from 27 species of teleosts. We identified several variations and a diversity of pectoral fin skeletal patterns within some teleost groups. Taken together with previous reports on teleost skeletons, our findings reveal that in the course of teleost evolution, there are a mixture of conserved and non- conserved components in the pectoral fin skeletons of teleosts, and that teleosts may have experienced the variation and conservation of the number and shape of the proximal radials, the loss of the mesocoracoid, and the change in the distal radial-fin ray relationship.",

    "abstract": "Most neuroscientific studies investigating mental effort apply unspecific effort allocation paradigms. In contrast, the present EEG study targets specific effort allocation during task prioritization.\n\nTwenty-eight participants performed a cued number classification task during the retention interval of a working memory task including retrospective cues. One of two possible number classifications was done per trial. Each trial started with a cue indicating which of the two tasks would be more important in the upcoming trial. Subjects were told to engage in both tasks, but to concentrate on the important one. Feedback given at the end of each trial was calculated based on task performance, with scores obtained from the relevant task being tripled.\n\nParticipants performed significantly better in either task when it was important compared to when not.Task prioritization modulates theta, alpha and beta oscillations, predominantly during task preparation. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that the exact type of the two possible number classifications was decodable, however, decoding accuracy did not depend on task importance. Hemispheric alpha power asymmetries indicating attentional orienting between working memory representations also did not depend on task importance. The findings suggest that task prioritization primarily affects proactive cognitive control on a superordinate level.",

In contrast, little is known regarding the expression of GDNF receptors in the formation of the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and its innervation of the larynx during embryogenesis. Differences may suggest therapeutic targets after nerve injury.\n\nStudy DesignLaboratory experiment.\n\nMethodsRat brainstems at E14, E16, E18, E20, adult (4 animals/timepoint) were sectioned and stained for GDNF receptors: GFR-1, GFR-2, GFR-3, and Ret. Islet1 and ChAT were used as markers for motoneuron cell bodies. Sections were observed using Zeiss Axio Imager M2 Microscope and quantified using Image J.\n\nResultsExpression of all four GDNF receptors was identified within the nucleus ambiguus, as well as hypoglossal and facial nuclei of the adult rat brainstem. During rat development, GFR-3 and Ret exhibited upregulation within the nucleus ambiguus at E14 whereas GFR-1 began showing upregulation at E20. GFR-2 exhibited no upregulation at embryonic timepoints. Conclusion: Upregulation of the GDNF receptors within the nucleus ambiguus occur after laryngeal muscles innervation during development and may associated with maturation and maintenance of the neuromuscular synapses of the larynx before and after birth.

After establishing the induced microglia model (iMGs) derived from peripheral blood monocytes, comparative studies to find factors related to phagocytic differences between iMGs of patients with rapidly progressive ALS [ALS(R)-iMGs, n = 15] and those of patients with slowly progressive ALS [ALS(S)-iMGs, n = 14] were conducted in the discovery cohort. To validate discovered candidate and whether it could be used as a reliable biomarker predicting the progression speed of ALS, we recruited 132 patients with ALS and 30 age-matched healthy controls as the validation cohort. ALS(R)-iMGs showed impaired phagocytic function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the perturbed phagocytosis in ALS(R)-iMGs was related to the decreased expression of NCKAP1 (NCK-associated protein 1) and NCKAP1 overexpression rescued the impaired phagocytic function. miRNA-214-3p targeting NCKAP1 in ALS-iMGs was correlated with progression speed in the discovery cohort. The validation cohort revealed that plasma miRNA-214-3p levels were significantly increased in ALS patients (p < 0.0001, AUC = 0.839), correlated with disease progression speed (p = 0.0005), and distinguished the rapidly progressive subgroup (Q1) from the slowly progressive (Q4, p = 0.029), respectively. Plasma miRNA-214-3p can predict the progression speed in ALS. Plasma miRNA-214-3p could be used as a simple and easily accessible biomarker for predicting the future progression speed related to phagocytic dysfunction in ALS patients.",

    "abstract": "Several hundred billion to a trillion cells die in the body every day, and cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) that are released from them enter into the extracellular compartments of the body, including into the circulation. We have earlier reported that cfChPs can readily enter into healthy cells to damage their DNA, activate apoptotic pathways and induce inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that repeated lifelong assault on healthy cells by cfChPs is the underlying cause of ageing, and that the ageing process could be retarded by deactivating cfChPs. The latter can be effected by oxygen radicals that are generated upon admixing the nutraceuticals resveratrol (R) and copper (Cu). Using confocal microscopy and antibodies against DNA and histone we detected copious presence of extra-cellular cfChPs in brain of ageing mice, and observed that these were deactivated / eradicated following prolong oral administration of small quantities of R-Cu. Deactivation / eradication of cfChPs was associated with down-regulation of several biological hallmarks of ageing in brain cells which included reduction in: 1) telomere attrition, 2) amyloid deposition, 3) DNA damage, 4) apoptosis, 5) inflammation, 6) senescence, 7) aneuploidy and 8) mitochondrial dysfunction. At a systemic level, R- Cu treatment led to significant reduction in blood levels of glucose, cholesterol and C-reactive protein. These results suggest that cfChPs may be global instigators of ageing and neurodegeneration, and that therapeutic use of R-Cu may help to retard the process of ageing.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a non-Hebbian synaptic mechanism that adjusts synaptic strength to maintain network stability while achieving optimal information processing. Among the molecular mediators shown to regulate this form of plasticity, synaptic signaling through retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor, RAR, has been shown to be critically involved in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic transmission in both hippocampus and sensory cortices. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism through which postsynaptic RA and RAR regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release during prolonged synaptic inactivity at excitatory synapses. We show that RAR binds to a subset of dendritically sorted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA splice isoforms and represses their translation. The RA-mediated translational de-repression of postsynaptic BDNF results in the retrograde activation of presynaptic Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors, facilitating presynaptic homeostatic compensation through enhanced presynaptic release. Together, our study illustrates a RA-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling pathway through which postsynaptic protein synthesis during synaptic inactivity drives compensatory changes at presynaptic site.",

    "abstract": "PurposeIn positron emission tomography (PET) quantification, multiple pharmacokinetic parameters are typically estimated from each time activity curve. Conventionally, all but the parameter of interest are discarded before performing subsequent statistical analysis. However, we assert that these discarded parameters also contain relevant information which can be exploited to improve the precision and power of statistical analyses on the parameter of interest. Properly taking this into account can thereby draw more informative conclusions without collecting more data.\n\nMethodsBy applying a hierarchical multifactor multivariate Bayesian approach, all estimated parameters from all regions can be analysed at once. We refer to this method as PuMBA (Parameters undergoing Multivariate Bayesian Analysis). We simulated patientcontrol studies with different radioligands, varying sample sizes and measurement error to explore its performance, comparing the precision, statistical power, false positive rate and bias of estimated group differences relative to univariate analysis methods.\n\nResultsWe show that PuMBA improves the statistical power for all examined applications relative to univariate methods without increasing the false positive rate. PuMBA improves the precision of effect size estimation, and reduces the variation of these estimates between simulated samples. Furthermore, we show that PuMBA yields performance improvements even in the presence of substantial measurement error. Remarkably, owing to its ability to leverage information shared between pharmacokinetic parameters, PuMBA even shows greater power than conventional univariate analysis of the true binding values from which the parameters were simulated. Across all applications, PuMBA exhibited a small degree of bias in the estimated outcomes, however this was small relative to the variation in estimated outcomes between simulated datasets.\n\nConclusionPuMBA improves the precision and power of statistical analysis of PET data without requiring the collection of additional measurements. This makes it possible to study new research questions in both new and previously collected data. PuMBA therefore holds great promise for the field of PET imaging.",

We observed that under conditions of chronic activity KIF21B regulates actin dynamics in spines, triggers spine removal of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, and mediates homeostatic synaptic downscaling of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC amplitudes. Our data highlight a myosin-kinesin interaction that enables the entry of the microtubule-dependent motor KIF21B into actin-rich spine compartments. A slow actin turnover rate might be beneficial for efficient protein removal from excitatory synapses, suggesting a functional role of KIF21B in a GKAP- and AMPA receptor-dependent mechanism, underlying homeostatic downscaling of neuronal firing.",

Two major subsets share a typical CLL phenotype but differ in signaling, metabolism and cell cycle control, indicating that the circulating CLL pool is shaped by two states of activity. The third CLL subset shows the phenotype, proliferation capacity and extensive IgV-mutation diversity of normal CD5+ memory B cells. This previously unrecognized CLL tumor subset, which intermingles with NRB cells, was confirmed in 33 IgV-mutated (M-CLL) and IgV-unmutated (U-CLL) cases. Longitudinal IgV-mutation phylogenetics suggest that these NRB-associated CLL cells are generated pathogenetically early, mostly in germinal center reactions, and archive the individual IgV-diversification program, which is conserved throughout CLL course. Our study suggests that diversity is established early in CLL, that each tumor is composed of multiple subclonal expansions, and subclonal evolution can be depicted by IgV-mutation phylogenetics.",

    "abstract": "Accidental and medical radiation exposure may cause radiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII), a catastrophic disease requiring efficient therapies. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major constituent of green tea, has been shown to have potent biological activity as well as strong anti-inflammation effects. Here, we demonstrate that EGCG treatment not only protects mice against total body irradiation (TBI)-induced toxicity and weight loss but also alleviates whole abdominal irradiation (WAI)-induced intestinal injury. EGCG promotes proliferation and survival of intestinal stem cells, inhibits radiation-induced apoptosis and inflammation. At the same time, EGCG preserves the composition of the gut microbiota in WAI mice. In vitro, we demonstrate that EGCG regulates the release of radiation-induced inflammatory factors by inhibiting inflammatory pathways such as toll-like receptor signaling pathway in peritoneal macrophages. Mechanistically, the radioprotective effect of EGCG was likely attributable to its preservation on macrophages and the colonized gut microbiota composition, thus relieving the intestinal inflammation. EGCG provides a novel strategy to mitigate RIII and improve the prognosis of patients after radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSkeletal muscle atrophy can occur in response to numerous factors, such as aging and certain medications, and produces a major socioeconomic burden. At present, there are no approved drugs for treating skeletal muscle atrophy. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Aox5) is a drug target for a number of diseases. However, pharmacological targeting of Alox5, and its role in skeletal muscle atrophy, is unclear.\n\nMethodsThe potential effects of gene knockdown and pharmacological targeting of Alox5 on skeletal muscle atrophy was investigated using cell-based models, animal models, and human skeletal muscle tissue cultures. Malotilate, a clinically safe drug developed for enhancing liver regeneration and Alox5 inhibitor, was investigated as a repurposing candidate. Mechanism(s) of action in skeletal muscle atrophy were assessed by measuring the expression level or activation status of key regulatory pathways, and validated using gene knockdown and RNA sequencing.\n\nResultsMyotubes treated with the atrophy-inducing glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, were protected from catabolic responses by treatment with malotilate (+41.29%, P < 0.01). Similar anti-atrophy effects were achieved by gene knockdown of Alox5 (+30.4%, P < 0.05). Malotilate produced anti-atrophy effects without affecting the myogenic differentiation program. In an in vivo model of skeletal muscle atrophy, malotilate treatment enhanced muscle performance (Grip strength: +35.72%, Latency to fall: +553.1%, P < 0.05), increased mass and fiber cross sectional area (Quadriceps: +23.72%, Soleus: +33.3%, P < 0.01), and down-regulated atrogene expression (Atrogin-1: -61.58%, Murf-1: -66.06%, P < 0.01). Similar, beneficial effects of malotilate treatment were observed in an aging muscle, which also showed the preservation of fast twitch fibers (Type 2a: +56.48%, Type 2b: +37.32%, P < 0.01). Leukotrine B4, a product of Alox5 activity with inflammatory and catabolic functions, was found to be elevated in skeletal muscle undergoing atrophy (Quadriceps: +224.4%, P < 0.001). Cellular transcriptome analysis showed that targeting Alox5 upregulated biological processes regulating organogenesis and increased the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, a key anti-atrophy hormone (+226.5%, P < 0.05). Interestingly, these effects were restricted to the atrophy condition and not observed in normal skeletal muscle cultures with Alox5 inhibition. Human skeletal muscle tissue was also protected from atrophy by pharmacological targeting of Alox5 (+23.68%, P < 0.05).\n\nConclusionThese results shed new light on novel drug targets and mechanisms underpinning skeletal muscle atrophy. Alox5 is a regulator and drug target for muscle atrophy, and malotilate is an attractive compound for repurposing studies to treat this disease.",

    "abstract": "A mathematical model for the mammalian cell cycle is developed as a system of 13 coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The variables and interactions included in the model are based on detailed consideration of available experimental data. Key features are that the model is autonomous, except for dependence on external growth factors; variables are continuous in time, without instantaneous resets at phase boundaries; cell cycle controllers and completion of tasks associated with cell cycle progression are represented; mechanisms to prevent rereplication are included; and cycle progression is independent of cell size. Eight variables represent cell cycle controllers: Cyclin D1 in complex with Cdk4/6, APCCdh1, SCF{beta}Trcp, Cdc25A, MPF, NUMA, securin-separase complex, and separase. Five variables represent task completion, with four for the status of origins and one for kinetochore attachment. The model predicts distinct behaviors consistent with each main phase of the cell cycle. The response to growth factors shows restriction-point behavior. These results imply that the main features of the mammalian cell cycle can be accounted for in a quantitative mechanistic way based on known interactions among cycle control factors and their coupling to tasks involved in replication of DNA. The model is robust to parameter changes, in that cycling is maintained over at least a five-fold range of each parameter when varied individually. The most sensitive parameters are those associated with the initiation and completion of mitosis. The model is suitable for exploring how extracellular factors affect cell cycle progression, including responses to metabolic conditions and to anti-cancer therapies.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe created a model, that is, a set of mathematical equations, to represent the entire cell cycle in mammals. All terms in our equations correspond to actual biological mechanisms. We solved the equations and verified that they show similar behavior to real-life cell cycles. We designed our model to cycle only when enough external growth factors stimulate it, as real cells do. Our model helps us better understand how the cell cycle is controlled. One very important aspect of control is how the cell ensures that its DNA is copied only once per cell cycle. If \"rereplication\" (copying a section of DNA twice in the same cycle) occurs, it can cause harmful DNA damage. We considered several mechanisms that some biologists believe play a role, and found that most could not explain how rare rereplication is. Two mechanisms did work well, and we used them to make two variants of the model, which show similar behavior. The model has many potential applications. The cell cycle is altered in most cancer cells, so understanding how these changes affect control is useful. Many widely-used drugs affect the cell cycle, and our model can be used to study these effects.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for novel drugs highlights the need for bioprospecting unexplored taxa for their biosynthetic potential. Lichen-forming fungi (LFF) are a rich source of natural products but their implementation in pharmaceutical industry is limited, mostly because the genes corresponding to a majority of their natural products is unknown. Furthermore, it is not known to what extent these genes encode structurally novel molecules. Advance in next-generation sequencing technologies has expanded the range of organisms that could be exploited for their biosynthetic potential. In this study, we mine the genomes of nine lichen-forming fungal species of the genus Umbilicaria for biosynthetic genes, and categorize the BGCs as \"associated product structurally known\", and \"associated product putatively novel\". We found that about 25-30% of the biosynthetic genes are divergent when compared to the global database of BGCs comprising of 1,200,000 characterized biosynthetic genes from planta, bacteria and fungi. Out of 217 total BGCs, 43 were only distantly related to known BGCs, suggesting they encode structurally and functionally unknown natural products. Clusters encoding the putatively novel metabolic diversity comprise PKSs (30), NRPSs (12) and terpenes (1). Our study emphasizes the utility of genomic data in bioprospecting microorganisms for their biosynthetic potential and in advancing the industrial application of unexplored taxa. We highlight the untapped structural metabolic diversity encoded in the lichenized fungal genomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation identifying genes coding for NPs with potentially novel therapeutic properties in LFF.",

    "abstract": "We shift our gaze even when we orient attention internally to visual representations in working memory. Here, we show the bodily orienting response associated with internal selective attention is widespread as it also includes the head. In three virtual reality (VR) experiments, participants remembered two visual items. After a working memory delay, a central colour cue indicated which item needed to be reproduced from memory. After the cue, head movements became biased in the direction of the memorised location of the cued memory item - despite there being no items to orient towards in the external environment. The heading-direction bias had a distinct temporal profile from the gaze bias. Our findings reveal that directing attention within the spatial layout of visual working memory bears a strong relation to the overt head orienting response we engage when directing attention to sensory information in the external environment. The heading-direction bias further demonstrates common neural circuitry is engaged during external and internal orienting of attention.",

    "abstract": "Developmental plasticity enables organisms to cope with new environmental challenges. If deploying such plasticity is costly in terms of time or energy, the same adaptive behavior could subsequently evolve through piecemeal genomic reorganisation that replaces the requirement to acquire that adaptation by individual plasticity. Here we report a new dimension to the way in which plasticity can drive evolutionary change leading to ever greater complexity in biological organization. Our model deploys the concept of partially overlapping functional systems. We found that plasticity accelerated dramatically the evolutionary accumulation of adaptive systems in model organisms with relatively low rates of mutation. The effect of plasticity on the evolutionary growth of complexity was even greater when the number of elements needed to construct a functional system was increased. These results suggest that as the difficulty of challenges from the environment become greater, so plasticity exerts an ever more powerful role in meeting those challenges and in opening up new avenues for the subsequent evolution of complex adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Solving the chemical master equation is an indispensable tool in understanding the behavior of biological and chemical systems. In particular, it is increasingly recognized that commonly used ODE models are not able to capture the stochastic nature of many cellular processes. Solving the chemical master equation directly, however, suffers from the curse of dimensionality. That is, both memory and computational effort scale exponentially in the number of species. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank approach that enables the simulation of large biological networks. The approach is guided by partitioning the network into biological relevant subsets and thus avoids the use of single species basis functions that are known to give inaccurate results for biological systems. We use the proposed method to gain insight into the nature of asynchronous vs. synchronous updating in Boolean models and successfully simulate a 41 species apoptosis model on a standard desktop workstation.",
