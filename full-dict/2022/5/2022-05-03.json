    "abstract": "SignificanceCurrent techniques for data analysis in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), such as artifact correction, do not allow to integrate the information originating from both wavelengths, considering only temporal and spatial dimensions of the signals structure. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) has previously been validated as a multidimensional decomposition technique in other neuroimaging fields.\n\nAimWe aimed to introduce and validate the use of PARAFAC for the analysis of fNIRS data, which is inherently multidimensional (time, space, wavelength).\n\nApproachWe used data acquired in 17 healthy adults during a verbal fluency task to compare the efficacy of PARAFAC for motion artifact correction to traditional 2D decomposition techniques, i.e. target principal (tPCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). Correction performance was further evaluated under controlled conditions with simulated artifacts and hemodynamic response functions.\n\nResultsPARAFAC achieved significantly higher improvement in data quality as compared to tPCA and ICA. Correction in several simulated signals further validated its use and promoted it as a robust method independent of the artifacts characteristics.\n\nConclusionsThis study describes the first implementation of PARAFAC in fNIRS and provides validation for its use to correct artifacts. PARAFAC is a promising data-driven alternative for multidimensional data analyses in fNIRS and this study paves the way for further applications.",

    "abstract": "We present a Python-based software package to automatically obtain phenomenological models of input-controlled synthetic biological circuits from descriptive models. From the parts and mechanism description of a synthetic biological circuit, it is easy to obtain a chemical reaction model of the circuit under the assumptions of mass-action kinetics using various existing tools. However, using these models to guide design decisions during an experiment is difficult due to a large number of reaction rate parameters and species in the model. Hence, phenomenological models are often developed that describe the effective relationships among the circuit inputs, outputs, and only the key states and parameters. In this paper, we present an algorithm to obtain these phenomenological models in an automated manner using a Python package for circuits with inputs that control the desired outputs. This model reduction approach combines the common assumptions of time-scale separation, conservation laws, and species abundance to obtain the reduced models that can be used for design of synthetic biological circuits. We consider an example of a simple gene expression circuit and another example of a layered genetic feedback control circuit to demonstrate the use of the model reduction procedure.",

    "abstract": "The forms of many species vocal signals are shaped by their functions1-15. In humans, a salient context of vocal signaling is infant care, as human infants are altricial16, 17. Humans often alter their vocalizations to produce \"parentese\", speech and song produced for infants that differ acoustically from ordinary speech and song18-35 in fashions that have been proposed to support parent-infant communication and infant language learning36-39; modulate infant affect33, 40-45; and/or coordinate communicative interactions with infants46-48. These theories predict a form-function link in infant-directed vocalizations, with consistent acoustic differences between infant-directed and adult-directed vocalizations across cultures. Some evidence supports this prediction23, 27, 28, 32, 49-52, but the limited generalizability of individual ethnographic reports and laboratory experiments53 and small stimulus sets54, along with intriguing reports of counterexamples55-62, leave the question open. Here, we show that people alter the acoustic forms of their vocalizations in a consistent fashion across cultures when speaking or singing to infants. We collected 1,615 recordings of infant- and adult-directed singing and speech produced by 410 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies, and analyzed their acoustic forms. We found cross-culturally robust regularities in the acoustics of infant-directed vocalizations, such that infant-directed speech and song were reliably classified from acoustic features found across the 21 societies studied. The acoustic profiles of infant-directedness differed across language and music, but in a consistent fashion worldwide. In a secondary analysis, we studied whether listeners are sensitive to these acoustic features, playing the recordings to 51,065 people recruited online, from many countries, who guessed whether each vocalization was infant-directed. Their intuitions were largely accurate, predictable in part by acoustic features of the recordings, and robust to the effects of linguistic relatedness between vocalizer and listener. By uniting rich cross-cultural data with computational methods, we show links between the production of vocalizations and cross-species principles of bioacoustics, informing hypotheses of the psychological functions and evolution of human communication.",

    "abstract": "The identification of amino acid substitutions that both enhance the stability and function of a protein is a key challenge in protein engineering. Technological advances have enabled assaying thousands of protein variants in a single high-throughput experiment, and more recent studies use such data in protein engineering. We present a Global Multi-Mutant Analysis (GMMA) that exploits the presence of multiply-substituted variants to identify individual amino acid substitutions that are beneficial for the stability and function across a large library of protein variants. We have applied GMMA to >54,000 variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP), each with known fluorescence output, and each carrying 1-15 amino acid substitutions. The GMMA method achieves a good fit to the data while being analytically transparent. The six top-ranking substitutions are demonstrated to progressively enhance GFP and in general, our analysis recovers nearly all the substitutions previously reported to be beneficial for GFP folding and function, only using a single experiment as input.\n\nSignificance StatementProtein engineering is carried out to improve proteins for practical applications by changing one or more amino acid residues in a protein. We present a method termed global multi-mutant analysis (GMMA) that helps solve two problems in protein engineering. First, because many proteins are already highly optimized, it can be difficult to identify individual variants that further improve function. Second, while it is possible to combine variants with small individual effects, such approaches may be hampered by non-additivity. GMMA identifies combinable effects of single substitutions from a large set of variants each carrying multiple substitutions. We demonstrate the approach on a set of 54,000 variants of green fluorescent protein and identify many enhancing single-substitutions from a single experiment.",

In general, trajectory and pseudotime inference methods have so far suffered from the ambiguity of static single-cell transcriptome snapshots lacking a concept of directionality and rate of transcriptional activity.\n\nWe report Cytopath, a method for trajectory inference that takes advantage of transcriptional activity information from RNA velocity of single-cells to perform trajectory inference. Cytopath performs this task by defining a Markov chain model, simulating an ensemble of possible differentiation trajectories and constructs a consensus trajectory. We show that Cytopath can recapitulate the topological and molecular characteristics of the differentiation process under study. In our analysis we include differentiation trajectories with varying bifurcated, circular, convergent and mixed topology studied in single-snapshot as well as time-series single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. We demonstrate superior and enabling capability to reconstruct differentiation trajectories in comparison to state-of-the art trajectory inference approaches.",

    "abstract": "Disordered scaffold proteins provide multivalent landing pads that, via a series of embedded Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs), bring together the components of a complex to orchestrate precise spatial and temporal regulation of cellular processes. One such protein is AKAP5, which contains SLiMs that anchor PKA and Calcineurin, and recruit substrate (the TRPV1 receptor). Calcineurin is anchored to AKAP5 by a well-characterised PxIxIT SLiM. Here we show, using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, that the Calcineurin PxIxIT-binding groove also recognises several hitherto unknown lower-affinity SLiMs in addition to the PxIxIT motif. We demonstrate that the assembly is in reality a complex system with conserved SLiMs spanning a wide affinity range. The capture is analogous to that seen for many DNA-binding proteins that have a weak non-specific affinity for DNA outside the canonical binding site, but different in that it involves (i) two proteins, and (ii) hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions. It is also compatible with the requirement for both stable anchoring of the enzyme and responsive downstream signalling. We conclude that the AKAP5 C-terminus is enriched in lower-affinity/mini-SLiMs that, together with the canonical SLiM, maintain a structurally disordered but tightly regulated signalosome.",

    "abstract": "Memory consolidation, the process by which newly encoded and fragile memories become more robust, is thought to be supported by the reactivation of brain regions - including the hippocampus - during post-learning rest. While hippocampal reactivations have been demonstrated in humans in the declarative memory domain, it remains unknown whether such a process takes place after motor learning. Using multivariate analyses of task-related and resting state fMRI data, here we show that patterns of brain activity within both the hippocampus and striatum elicited during motor learning persist into post-learning rest, indicative of reactivation of learning-related neural activity patterns. Moreover, results indicate that hippocampal reactivation reflects the spatial representation of the learned motor sequence. These results thus provide insights into the functional significance of neural reactivation after motor sequence learning.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of human intelligence, but challenging for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, is the ability to compositionally generalise, that is, to recompose familiar knowledge components in novel ways to solve new problems. For instance, when navigating in a city, one needs to know the location of the destination and how to operate a vehicle to get there, whether it be pedalling a bike or operating a car. In RL, these correspond to the reward function and transition function, respectively. To compositionally generalize, these two components need to be transferable independently of each other: multiple modes of transport can reach the same goal, and any given mode can be used to reach multiple destinations. Yet there are also instances where it can be helpful to learn and transfer entire structures, jointly representing goals and transitions, particularly whenever these recur in natural tasks (e.g., given a suggestion to get ice cream, one might prefer to bike, even in new towns). Prior theoretical work has explored how, in model-based RL, agents can learn and generalize task components (transition and reward functions). But a satisfactory account for how a single agent can simultaneously satisfy the two competing demands is still lacking. Here, we propose a hierarchical RL agent that learns and transfers individual task components as well as entire structures (particular compositions of components) by inferring both through a non-parametric Bayesian model of the task. It maintains a factorised representation of task components through a hierarchical Dirichlet process, but it also represents different possible covariances between these components through a standard Dirichlet process. We validate our approach on a variety of navigation tasks covering a wide range of statistical correlations between task components and show that it can also improve generalisation and transfer in more complex, hierarchical tasks with goal/subgoal structures. Finally, we end with a discussion of our work including how this clustering algorithm could conceivably be implemented by cortico-striatal gating circuits in the brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeart failure (HF) therapeutic toolkit would strongly benefit from the availability of ino-lusitropic agents with a favorable pharmacodynamics and safety profile. Istaroxime is a promising agent, which combines Na+/K+ pump inhibition with SERCA2a stimulation; however, it has a very short half-life and extensive metabolism to a molecule, named PST3093. The present work aims to investigate whether PST3093, still retains the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of its parent compound.\n\nMethodsWe studied PST3093 for its effects on SERCA2a and Na+/K+ ATPase activities, Ca2+ dynamics in isolated myocytes and hemodynamic effects in an in-vivo rat model of diabetic (streptozotocin (STZ)-induced) cardiomyopathy.\n\nResultsIstaroxime infusion in HF patients led to accumulation of PST3093 in the plasma; clearance was substantially slower for PST3093 than for istaroxime. In cardiac rat preparations PST3093 did not inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase activity, but retained SERCA2a stimulatory activity. In in-vivo echocardiographic assessment, PST3093 improved overall cardiac performance and reversed most STZ-induced abnormalities. PST3093 i.v. toxicity was considerably lower than that of istaroxime and it failed to significantly interact with 50 off-targets.\n\nConclusionsOverall, PST3093 is a \"selective\" SERCA2a activator, the prototype of a novel pharmacodynamic category with a potential in the ino-lusitropic approach to HF with prevailing diastolic dysfunction. Its pharmacodynamics are peculiar and its pharmacokinetics are suitable to prolong the cardiac beneficial effect of istaroxime infusion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/455204v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc9220org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7a6eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1510c71org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f037_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We calculated point-by-point multiplication between two regional time series to estimate the time-resolved dynamic connectivity, and estimated the inter-individual consistency of the dynamic connectivity time series. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip, which also showed differences between the clips. For example, a cartoon movie clip, Wall-E, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip, A Few Good Men, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which might suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents. In contrast, the stationary connectivity as measured by the correlations between regional time series was highly similar among the movie clips, and showed fewer statistically significant differences. The patterns of consistent dynamic connectivity could be used to classify different movie clips with higher accuracy than the stationary connectivity and regional activity. These results support the functional significance of dynamic connectivity in reflecting functional brain changes, which could provide more functionally relevant information than stationary connectivity.",

    "abstract": "The insect gut is frequently exposed to pathogenic threats and must not only clear these potential infections, but also tolerate relatively high microbe loads. In contrast to the mechanisms that eliminate pathogens, we currently know less about the mechanisms of disease tolerance. We investigated how well-described mechanisms that either prevent, signal, control, or repair damage during infection contribute to the phenotype of disease tolerance. We established enteric infections with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila in transgenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies affecting dcy (a major component of the peritrophic matrix), upd3 (a cytokine-like molecule), irc (a negative regulator of reactive oxygen species) and egfr1 (epithelial growth factor receptor). Flies lacking dcy experienced the highest susceptibility, while loss of function of either irc or upd3 reduced tolerance in both sexes. The disruption of egfr1 resulted in a severe loss in tolerance in male flies but had no substantial effect on the ability of female flies to tolerate P. entomophila infection, despite carrying greater microbe loads than males. Together, our findings provide evidence for the role of damage limitation mechanisms in disease tolerance and highlight how sex differences in these mechanisms could generate sexual dimorphism in disease tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial persistence is a phenomenon in which a small fraction of isogenic bacterial cells survives a lethal dose of antibiotics. It is generally assumed that persistence is caused by cells with inactive growth generated prior to drug exposure. However, evidence from direct observation is scarce due to the extremely low frequencies of persisters. Here, we visualize the responses of more than 106 individual cells of wildtype Escherichia coli to lethal doses of antibiotics, sampling cells from different growth phases and culture media. We show that preexisting growth-arrested dormant persisters constitute only minor fractions of persistent cell lineages in populations sampled from exponential phase. Non-dormant persisters survive with radical morphological changes in response to drug exposure, including L-form-like morphologies or filamentation. Incubating cells under stationary phase conditions increases both the frequency and the probability of survival of dormant cells. While dormant cells in late stationary phase express a general stress response regulator, RpoS, at high levels, persistent cell lineages show lower levels of RpoS among the dormant cells. These results demonstrate that diverse survival pathways coexist within bacterial populations to achieve persistence and that persistence does not necessarily require dormant cells.",

    "abstract": "Root hair initiation is a highly regulated aspect of root development. The plant hormone, ethylene, and its precursor, 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), induce formation and elongation of root hairs. Using confocal microscopy paired with redox biosensors and dyes, we demonstrated that treatments that elevate ethylene levels led to increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation in hair cells prior to root hair formation. In two ethylene-insensitive mutants, etr1-3 and ein3/eil1, there was no increase in root hair number or ROS accumulation. Conversely, etr1-7, a constitutive ethylene signaling receptor mutant, has increased root hair formation and ROS accumulation like ethylene-treated Col-0 seedlings. The caprice and werewolf transcription factor mutants have decreased and elevated ROS levels, which are correlated with levels of root hair initiation. The rhd2-6 mutant, with a defect in the gene encoding a ROS synthesizing Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog C (RBOHC) and the prx44-2 mutant defective in a class III peroxidase, showed impaired ethylene-dependent ROS synthesis and root hair formation and EIN3/EIL1 dependent transcriptional regulation. Together, these results indicate that ethylene increases ROS accumulation through RBOHC and PRX44 to drive root hair formation.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe gaseous hormone ethylene increases root hair initiation by elevating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in trichoblast cells. Genetic and biochemical approaches identified ethylene-regulated ROS producing enzymes that drive root hair initiation.",

    "abstract": "Every decision we make is accompanied by an estimate of the probability that our decision is accurate or appropriate. This probability estimate is termed our degree of decision confidence. Recent work has uncovered event-related potential (ERP) correlates of confidence both during decision formation and after a decision has been made. However, the interpretation of these findings is complicated by methodological issues related to ERP amplitude measurement that are prevalent across existing studies. To more accurately characterise the neural correlates of confidence, we presented participants with a difficult perceptual decision task that elicited a broad range of confidence ratings. We identified a frontal ERP component within an onset prior to the behavioural response, which exhibited more positive-going amplitudes in trials with higher confidence ratings. This frontal effect also biased measures of the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) component at parietal electrodes via volume conduction. Amplitudes of the error positivity (Pe) component that followed each decision were negatively associated with confidence for trials with decision errors, but not for trials with correct decisions, with Bayes factors providing moderate evidence for the null in the latter case. We provide evidence for both pre- and post-decisional neural correlates of decision confidence that are observed in trials with correct and erroneous decisions, respectively. Our findings suggest that certainty in having made a correct response is associated with frontal activity during decision formation, whereas certainty in having committed an error is instead associated with the post-decisional Pe component. These findings also highlight the possibility that some previously reported associations between decision confidence and CPP/Pe component amplitudes may have been a consequence of ERP amplitude measurement-related confounds. Re-analysis of existing datasets may be useful to test this hypothesis more directly.\n\nHighlights- We mapped the event-related potential correlates of decision confidence\n- A frontal component was associated with confidence during decision formation\n- The error positivity component was associated with confidence in error trials\n- The error positivity was not associated with confidence in correct response trials",

    "abstract": "The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway utilizes the proton-motive force (pmf) to transport folded proteins across cytoplasmic membranes in bacteria and archaea, as well as across the thylakoid membrane in plants and the inner membrane in mitochondria. In most species, the minimal components required for Tat activity consist of three subunits, TatA, TatB, and TatC. Previous studies have shown that a polar amino acid is present at the N-terminus of the TatA transmembrane helix (TMH) across many different species. In order to systematically assess the functional importance of this polar amino acid in the TatA TMH in Escherichia coli, a complete set of 19-amino-acid substitutions was examined. Unexpectedly, although being preferred overall, our experiments suggest that the polar amino acid is not necessary for a functional TatA. Hydrophobicity and helix stabilizing properties of this polar amino acid were found to be highly correlated with the Tat activity. Specifically, change in charge status of the amino acid side chain due to pH resulted in a shift in hydrophobicity, which was demonstrated to impact the Tat transport activity. Furthermore, a four-residue motif at the N-terminus of the TatA TMH was identified by sequence alignment. Using a biochemical approach, the N-terminal motif was found to be functionally significant, with evidence indicating a potential role in the preference for utilizing different pmf components. Taken together, these findings yield new insights into the functionality of TatA and its potential role in the Tat transport mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Despite its recognized importance for understanding the evolution of animal sociality as well as for conservation, long term analysis of social networks of animal populations is still relatively uncommon. We investigated social network dynamics in males of a gregarious mountain ungulate (Alpine ibex, Capra ibex) over ten years focusing on groups, sub-groups and individuals, exploring the dynamics of sociality over different scales. Despite the social structure changing between seasons, the Alpine ibex population was highly cohesive: fission-fusion dynamics lead almost every male in the population to associate with each other male at least once. Nevertheless, we found that male Alpine ibex showed preferential associations that were maintained across seasons and years. Age seemed to be the most important factor driving preferential associations while other characteristics, such as social status, appeared less crucial. We also found that centrality measures were influenced by age and were also related to individual physical condition. The multi-scale and long-term frame of our study helped us show that ecological constrains, such as resource availability, may play a role in shaping associations in a gregarious species, but they cannot solely explain sociality and preferential association that are likely also to be driven by life-history linked physiological and social needs. Our results highlight the importance of long-term studies based on individually recognizable subjects to help us build on our understanding of the evolution of animal sociality.",

Despite the importance of recognizing and understanding the key risk-associated features of these communities, their heterogeneous structure and properties remain ill-defined. Clustering approaches are commonly used to characterize vaginal communities, but they lack sensitivity and robustness in resolving substructures and revealing transitions between potential sub-communities. Here, we address this need with an approach based on mixed membership topic models, using longitudinal data from cohorts of pregnant and non-pregnant study participants. We identify several non-Lactobacillus-dominated sub-communities common to both cohorts and independent of reproductive status. In non-pregnant individuals, we find that the menstrual cycle modulates transitions between and within sub-communities. In addition, a specific non-Lactobacillus-dominated sub-community, which was associated with preterm delivery in pregnant participants, was also more common during menses, a time of elevated vaginal inflammation in non-pregnant participants. Overall, our analyses based on mixed membership models reveal substructures of vaginal ecosystems which may have important clinical and biological associations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how antimicrobial resistance spreads is critical for optimal application of new treatments. In the naturally competent human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics is mediated by recombination events in genes encoding the target proteins, resulting in reduced drug binding affinity. However, for the front-line antibiotic amoxicillin, the exact mechanism of resistance still needs to be elucidated. Through successive rounds of transformation with genomic DNA from a clinically resistant isolate, we followed amoxicillin resistance development. Using whole genome sequencing, we showed that multiple recombination events occurred at different loci during one round of transformation. We found examples of non-contiguous recombination, and demonstrated that this could occur either through multiple D-loop formation from one donor DNA molecule, or by the integration of multiple DNA fragments. We also show that the final minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) differs depending on recipient genome, explained by differences in the extent of recombination at key loci. Finally, through back transformations of mutant alleles and fluorescently labelled penicillin (bocillin-FL) binding assays, we confirm that pbp1a, pbp2b, pbp2x, and murM are the main resistance determinants for amoxicillin resistance, and that the order of allele uptake is important for successful resistance evolution. We conclude that recombination events are complex, and that this complexity contributes to the highly diverse genotypes of amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates.",

To evaluate performance, we formulated an SDTP score whose calculation formula includes several parameters: speed (article exposure time(ET)), detection rate (percentage of articles whose retraction is initiated by the editor/publisher/institution without the authors participation), transparency (percentage of retracted articles available online and clarity of retraction notes), precision (mention of authors responsibility and percentage of retractions for reasons other than editorial errors).\n\nResultsThe 4844 withdrawn articles were published in 1767 journals by 366 publishers, the average number of withdrawn articles/journal being 2.74. Forty-five publishers have more than ten withdrawn articles, holding 88% of all papers and 79% of journals. Combining our data with data from another study shows that less than 7% of PubMed journals withdrew at least one article. Only 10.5% of the withdrawal notes included the individual responsibility of the authors. Nine of the top 11 publishers had the largest number of articles withdrawn in 2020, in the first 11 places finding, as expected, some big publishers. Retraction reasons analysis shows considerable differences between publishers concerning the articles ET: median values between 9 and 43 months (mistakes), 9 and 73 months (images), 10 and 42 months (plagiarism & overlap).\n\nThe SDTP score shows, between 2018 and 2020, an improvement in QC of four publishers in the top 11 and a decrease in the gap between 1st and 11th place. The group of the other 355 publishers also has a positive evolution of the SDTP score.\n\nConclusionsPublishers have to get involved actively and measurably in the post-publication evaluation of scientific products. The introduction of reporting standards for retraction notes and replicable indicators for quantifying publishing QC can help increase the overall quality of scientific literature.",

    "abstract": "Strokes cause lesions that damage brain tissue, disrupt normal brain activity patterns and can lead to impairments in motor function. Although modulation of cortical activity is central to stimulation-based rehabilitative therapies, aberrant and adaptive patterns of brain activity after stroke have not yet been fully characterized. Here, we apply a brain dynamics analysis approach to study longitudinal brain activity patterns in individuals with ischemic pontine stroke. We first found 4 commonly occurring brain states largely characterized by high amplitude activations in the visual, frontoparietal, default mode, and motor networks. Stroke subjects spent less time in the frontoparietal state compared to controls. For individuals with dominant-hand CST damage, more time spent in the frontoparietal state from 1 week to 3-6 months post-stroke was associated with better motor recovery over the same time period, an association which was independent of baseline impairment. Furthermore, the amount of time spent in brain states was linked empirically to functional connectivity. This work suggests that when the dominant-hand CST is compromised in stroke, resting state configurations may include increased activation of the frontoparietal network, which may facilitate compensatory neural pathways that support recovery of motor function when traditional motor circuits of the dominant-hemisphere are compromised.",

    "abstract": "The sense of taste permits the recognition of valuable nutrients and the avoidance of potential toxins. Models of gustatory coding propose that within modalities (e.g. sweet, bitter, etc.), taste ligands are not distinct stimuli. However, these models are based on data from mice or flies that have omnivorous, non-specialist diets. A specialist feeder might, however, be expected to have acuity within modality if stimulus resolution was critical to survival. Previously, we found that bumblebees have a specialized mechanism for sensing sugars whereby two gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) within the galeal sensilla of the bees mouthparts exhibit burst of spikes. Here, we show that the temporal firing patterns of these GRNs separate sugars into four distinct groups that correlate with sugar nutritional value and palatability. We also identified a third GRN that responded to stimulation with relatively high concentrations of fructose, sucrose, and maltose. Sugars that were non-metabolizable or toxic suppressed the responses of bursting GRNs to sucrose. These abilities to encode information about sugar value are a refinement to the bumblebees sense of sweet taste that could be an adaptation that enables precise calculations of the nature and nutritional value of floral nectar.",

    "abstract": "Most epigenetic epidemiology to date has utilized microarrays to identify positions in the genome where variation in DNA methylation is associated with environmental exposures or disease. However, these profile less than 3% of DNA methylation sites in the human genome, potentially missing affected loci and preventing the discovery of disrupted biological pathways. Third generation sequencing technologies, including Nanopore sequencing, have the potential to revolutionise the generation of epigenetic data, not only by providing genuine genome-wide coverage but profiling epigenetic modifications direct from native DNA. Here we assess the viability of using Nanopore sequencing for epidemiology by performing a comparison with DNA methylation quantified using the most comprehensive microarray available, the Illumina EPIC array. We implemented a CRISPR-Cas9 targeted sequencing approach in concert with Nanopore sequencing to profile DNA methylation in three genomic regions to attempt to rediscover genomic positions that existing technologies have shown are differentially methylated in tobacco smokers. Using Nanopore sequencing reads, DNA methylation was quantified at 1,779 CpGs across three regions, providing a finer resolution of DNA methylation patterns compared to the EPIC array. The correlation of estimated levels of DNA methylation between platforms was high. Furthermore, we identified 12 CpGs where hypomethylation was significantly associated with smoking status, including 10 within the AHRR gene. In summary, Nanopore sequencing is a valid option for identifying genomic loci where large differences in DNAm are associated with a phenotype and has the potential to advance our understanding of the role differential methylation plays in the aetiology of complex disease.",

Lamin A/C is known to hinder cell migration by limiting nuclear deformation and passage through confining channels, but its role in nuclear deformation and passage through fibrous environments is less clear. We studied cell and nuclear migration through discrete, closely spaced, slender obstacles which mimic the mechanical properties of collagen fibers. Nuclei bypassed slender obstacles while preserving their overall morphology by deforming around them with deep local invaginations of little resisting force. The obstacles did not impede the nuclear trajectory or cause a rupture of the nuclear envelope. Nuclei likewise deformed around single collagen fibers in cells migrating in 3D collagen gels. In contrast to its limiting role in nuclear passage through confining channels, lamin A/C facilitated nuclear deformation and passage through fibrous environments; nuclei in lamin-null (Lmna-/-) cells lost their overall morphology and became entangled on the obstacles. Analogous to surface tension-mediated deformation of a liquid drop, lamin A/C imparts a surface tension on the nucleus that allows nuclear invaginations with little mechanical resistance, preventing nuclear entanglement and allowing nuclear passage through fibrous environments.",

    "abstract": "A challenge in both modern and historic neuroscience has been achieving an understanding of neuron circuits, and determining the computational and organizational principles that underlie these circuits. Deeper understanding of the organization of brain circuits and cell types, including in the hippocampus, is required for advances in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, as well as for understanding principles governing brain development and evolution. In this manuscript, we pioneer a new method to analyze the spatial clustering of active neurons in the hippocampus. We use calcium imaging and a rewarded navigation task to record from 100s of place cells in the CA1 of freely moving rats. We then use statistical techniques developed for and in widespread use in geographic mapping studies, global Morans I and local Morans I to demonstrate that cells that code for similar spatial locations tend to form small spatial clusters. We present evidence that this clustering is not the result of artifacts from calcium imaging, and show that these clusters are primarily formed by cells that have place field around previously rewarded locations. We go on to show that, although cells with similar place fields tend to form clusters, there is no obvious topographic mapping of environmental location onto the hippocampus, such as seen in the visual cortex. Insights into hippocampal organization, as in this study, can elucidate mechanisms underlying motivational behaviors, spatial navigation, and memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important post-transcriptional mechanism that has major implications in biological processes and diseases. Although specialized sequencing methods for polyadenylation exist, their presence in public repositories is extremely limited when compared to traditional RNA-sequencing. To overcome this, we developed REPAC, a framework for the analysis of APA from RNA-sequencing data. REPAC implements a new method for detection of APA and is designed to take advantage of recount3 which enables a streamlined way to analyze over 750,000 publicly available samples. Using REPAC, we investigated the landscape of APA caused by activation of B cells. Our analysis revealed that during this process, hundreds of genes are regulated by APA, most notably genes involved in the secretion pathway which is central for the transition to antibody-secreting B-cells. Moreover, we also showed that many genes associated with interferon response are also shortened, suggesting that APA might also play a significant role in the immune response. We also show that REPAC is faster than alternative methods by at least 7-fold and that it scales well to analysis involving hundreds of samples. Overall, the REPAC method offers an accurate, easy, and convenient solution for the exploration of APA across many phenotypes.",

While disciplinary differences could substantially influence students learning processes, little is known about the neural mechanism underlying successful disciplinary learning. In the present study, wearable EEG devices were used to record a group of high school students during their classes of a soft (Chinese) and a hard (Math) discipline throughout one semester. The students with higher learning outcomes in Chinese were found to have better inter-brain neural couplings with their excellent peers, whereas the students with higher Math outcomes were found to have better couplings with the class average. Moreover, the inter-brain couplings showed distinct dominant frequencies for the two disciplines. Our results illustrate disciplinary differences in successful learning from an inter-brain perspective and suggest the neural activities of excellent peers and class average as exemplars for soft and hard disciplines.\n\nTeaserSuccessful classroom learning is associated with distinct inter-brain coupling patterns for soft and hard disciplines",

The native structure of the Pyk2-PRR2:cortactin-SH3 complex was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), revealing an extended class II interaction surface spanning the canonical binding groove and a second hydrophobic surface which significantly contributes to ligand affinity. Using structure-guided design, we created a mutant peptide lacking critical residues involved in binding that failed to inhibit invadopodia maturation and function and consequent metastatic dissemination in mice.

    "abstract": "In the midst of an outbreak, identification of groups of individuals that represent risk for transmission of the pathogen under investigation is critical to public health efforts. Several approaches exist that utilize the evolutionary information from pathogen genomic data derived from infected individuals to distinguish these groups from the background population, comprised of primarily randomly sampled individuals with undetermined epidemiological linkage. These methods are, however, limited in their ability to characterize the dynamics of these groups, or clusters of transmission. Dynamic transmission patterns within these clusters, whether it be the result of changes at the level of the virus (e.g., infectivity) or host (e.g., vaccination implementation), are critical in strategizing public health interventions, particularly when resources are limited. Phylogenetic trees are widely used not only in the detection of transmission clusters, but the topological shape of the branches within can be useful sources of information regarding the dynamics of the represented population. We evaluate the limitation of existing tree shape statistics when dealing with smaller sub-trees containing transmission clusters and offer instead a phylogeny-based deep learning system -DeepDynaTree- for classification of transmission cluster. Comprehensive experiments carried out on a variety of simulated epidemic growth models indicate that this graph deep learning approach is effective in predicting cluster dynamics (balanced accuracy of 0.826 vs. 0.533 and Brier score of 0.234 vs. 0.466 in independent test set).

    "abstract": "Prevailing accounts of visuospatial attention differentiate exogenous (involuntary shifts) from endogenous (voluntary control) orienting of attention. While these two forms of attentional processes are functionally separable, their interactions have been at the center of ongoing debates for more than two decades. One hypothesis is that exogenous and endogenous attention interfere because they share processing resources. Here, we confirm that endogenous attention alters exogenous attention processing, and examine the role of alpha-band neurophysiological activity in such interference events. We contrast the effects of exogenous attention across two experimental conditions: a single-cueing condition where exogenous attention is engaged alone, and a double-cueing condition where exogenous attention is concurrently engaged with endogenous attention. Our results show that the engagement of endogenous attention alters the emergence of exogenous attention across cue-related and target-related brain processes. Importantly, we also report that classifiers trained to decode exogenous attention from the power and phase of alpha-band brain activity in the single-cueing condition fail to do so in the doublecueing condition, where endogenous attention is also engaged. Taken together, our observations challenge the idea that exogenous attention operates independently from top-down processes and demonstrate that both forms of attention orienting engage shared brain processes, which constrain their interactions.\n\nSignificance StatementVisuospatial attention is often dichotomized into top-down and bottom-up components: Top-down attention reflects slow voluntary shifts of attention orienting, while bottom-up attention is recruited by emerging demands from the environment. A large body of previous findings support the view that these two forms of attention orienting are functionally separable, with some interactions. The current study examines such interactions between top-down and bottom-up attention. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and multivariate pattern classification techniques, the researchers show that top-down attention interferes with the brain activity patterns of bottom-up attention. Moreover, machine learning classifiers trained to detect bottom-up attention based on brain activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), a marker of visuospatial attention, fail systematically when top-down attention is also engaged. The authors therefore conclude that both forms of visuospatial orienting are supported by overlapping processes that share brain resources.",

    "abstract": "Most tumors have abnormal karyotypes, which arise from mistakes during mitotic division of healthy euploid cells and evolve through numerous complex mechanisms. In a recent mouse model with high levels of chromosome missegregation, chromosome gains dominate over losses both in pretumor and tumor tissues, whereas tumors are characterized by gains of chromosomes 14 and 15. However, the mechanisms driving clonal selection leading to tumor karyotype evolution remain unclear. Here we show, by introducing a mathematical model based on a concept of a macro-karyotype, that tumor karyotypes can be explained by proliferation-driven evolution of aneuploid cells. In pretumor cells, increased apoptosis and slower proliferation of cells with monosomies lead to predominant chromosome gains over losses. Tumor karyotypes with gain of one chromosome can be explained by karyotype-dependent proliferation, while for those with two chromosomes an interplay with karyotype-dependent apoptosis is an additional possible pathway. Thus, evolution of tumor-specific karyotypes requires proliferative advantage of specific aneuploid karyotypes.\n\nSignificanceMost tumors have an erroneous number of chromosomes, which arise from mistakes during division of healthy cells and evolve through numerous complex mechanisms, including chromosome missegregation, cell proliferation and cell death. However, understanding the mechanisms leading to tumor evolution from healthy cells is a hot topic. Here we show, by introducing a \"macro-karyotype model\", that perturbed number of chromosomes in tumor cells arises predominantly from faster division of cells characterized by a specific combination of chromosomes, or together with irregular cell death. This finding, strengthened by comparison of our theory with experimentally observed combination of chromosomes in different stages of tumor development, gives a direction for future experiments in identifying the key processes underlying tumor development.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer is a powerful source of innovations in prokaryotes that can affect almost any cellular system, including microbial organelles. However, typically rapid loss of non-functional gene acquisitions obscures the mechanisms determining the fate of horizontally transferable genes. Here, we report the first discovery of a horizontally inherited gene cluster encoding biosynthesis of magnetosomes, the organelles used by magnetotactic bacteria for navigation, in a non-magnetotactic phototrophic bacterium Rhodovastum atsumiense. We show that these clusters were inactivated through transcriptional silencing and antisense RNA regulation, but retain functionality, as several genes were able to complement the orthologous deletions in a remotely related magnetotactic bacterium. The laboratory transfer of foreign magnetosome genes to R. atsumiense was found to endow the strain with magnetosome biosynthesis, but strong negative selection led to rapid loss of this trait upon subcultivation. Our results provide insight into the horizontal dissemination of gene clusters encoding complex prokaryotic organelles and illuminate the potential mechanisms of their genomic preservation in a dormant state.",

We show that this form extends the validity of the Ginzburg-Landau expansion away from the critical point to cover the whole phase space. Furthermore, this analytical solution reveals an exponential scaling law of the dilute phase binodal concentration as a function of interaction strength and chain length. We demonstrate explicitly the power of this approach by fitting experimental protein liquid-liquid phase separation boundaries to determine the effective chain length and the solute-solvent interaction energy. Moreover, we demonstrate that this strategy allows us to resolve the differences in the interaction energy contributions of individual amino acids.

    "abstract": "p38 kinases are key elements of the cellular stress response in animals. They mediate the cell response to a multitude of stress stimuli, from osmotic shock to inflammation and oncogenes. However, it is unknown how such diversity of function in stress evolved in this kinase subfamily. Here, we show that the p38 kinase was already present in a common ancestor of animals and fungi. Later, in animals, it diversified into three JNK kinases and four p38 kinases. Moreover, we identified a fifth p38 paralog in fishes and amphibians. Our analysis shows that each p38 paralog has specific amino acid substitutions around the hinge point, a region between the N-terminal and C-terminal protein domains. We showed that this region can be used to distinguish between individual paralogs and predict their specific. Finally, we showed that the response to hyperosmotic stress in Capsaspora owczarzaki, a close unicellular relative of animals, follows a typical for the p38 kinases pattern of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. At the same time, Capsasporas cells upregulate the expression of GPD1 protein resembling an osmotic stress response in yeasts. Overall, our results show that the ancestral p38 stress pathway originated in the root of opisthokonts, most likely as a cells reaction to salinity change in the environment. In animals, the pathway became more complex and incorporated more stimuli and downstream targets due to the p38 sequence evolution in the docking and substrate binding sites around the hinge region. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the p38 evolution and opens new perspectives for the p38 research.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in gene therapy have brought novel treatment options for cancer. However, the full potential of this approach has yet to be unlocked due to the safety concerns and limited payload capacity of commonly utilized viral vectors. Virus-free DNA transposons, including piggyBac, have potential to obviate these shortcomings. In this study, we improved a previously developed modified piggyBac system with superior transposition efficiency. We demonstrated that the internal domain sequences (IDS) within the 3 terminal repeat domain of hyperactive piggyBac (hyPB) donor vector contain dominant enhancer elements. Plasmid-free donor vector devoid of IDS was used in conjunction with a helper plasmid expressing Quantum PBase v2 to generate an optimal piggyBac system, Quantum pBac (qPB), for use in T cells. Cells transfected with qPB expressing CD20/CD19 CAR outperformed those transfected with the same donor vector and plasmid expressing hyPB transposase in terms of CAR-T cell production. Importantly, qPB yielded mainly CD8+ CAR-TSCM cells, and the qPB- induced CAR-T cells effectively eliminated CD20/CD19-expressing tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings confirm qPB as a promising virus-free vector system with a payload capacity to incorporate multiple genes. This system is highly efficient and potentially safe for mediating transgene integration.",

    "abstract": "Embryo implantation requires temporospatial maternal-embryo dialog to regulate the interactions between an activated blastocyst and a receptive endometrium; however, the details of the related cell-specific coordination is largely unknown because of the cellular complexity and dynamic developmental processes of both the embryo and endometrium during peri-implantation. By comparing single-cell RNA (scRNA) data obtained from entire uteri of pregnant and pseudo-pregnant mice with embryos that were in the oviduct (dpc2.5 days post-coitum [dpc]) or had entered the uterus (after 3.5 dpc), we found a maternal estrogen and progesterone signaling-dependent functional differentiation process in which progesterone induced estrogen-responsive luminal epithelial cells to differentiate into two new types of epithelial cells: adhesion epithelial cells (AECs) and supporting epithelial cells (SECs) on 2.5 dpc. In addition to maternal signaling data, the uterine scRNA and corresponding embryo bulk sequencing data were obtained, and analyses revealed that embryonic Pdgfa and Efna3/4 signaling activated AECs and SECs, enhancing the attachment of embryos to the endometrium after implantation. Specifically, embryonic signaling induced additional transformation of AECs by preventing adjacent AECs, but not AECs away from the embryo in the implantation chamber, from undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that epithelial cell differentiation and related regulatory signaling were largely conserved in humans and mice. In the human endometrium, developmental defects of SOX9-positive epithelial cells similar to luminal epithelial cells were related to thin endometrium. Our work provides comprehensive and systematic information on endometrial luminal epithelial cell development directed by maternal and embryonic signaling, which is important for endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation.",

    "abstract": "The brain is a system that performs numerous functions by controlling its states. Quantifying the cost of this control is essential as it reveals how the brain can be controlled based on the minimization of the control cost, and which brain regions are most important to the optimal control of transitions. Despite its great potential, the current control paradigm in neuroscience uses a deterministic framework and is therefore unable to consider stochasticity, severely limiting its application to neural data. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a novel framework for the evaluation of control costs based on a linear stochastic model. Following our previous work, we quantified the optimal control cost as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence between the uncontrolled and controlled processes. In the linear model, we established an analytical expression for minimal cost and showed that we can decompose it into the cost for controlling the mean and covariance of brain activity. To evaluate the utility of our novel framework, we examined the significant brain regions in the optimal control of transitions from the resting state to seven cognitive task states in human whole-brain imaging data. We found that, in realizing the different transitions, the lower visual areas commonly played a significant role in controlling the means, while the posterior cingulate cortex commonly played a significant role in controlling the covariances.\n\nSignificance StatementThe brain performs many cognitive functions by controlling its states. Quantifying the cost of this control is essential as it reveals how the brain can be optimally controlled in terms of the cost, and which brain regions are most important to the optimal control of transitions. Here, we built a novel framework to quantify control cost that takes account of stochasticity of neural activity, which is ignored in previous studies. We established the analytical expression of the stochastic control cost, which enables us to compute the cost in high-dimensional neural data. We identified the significant brain regions for the optimal control in cognitive tasks in human whole-brain imaging data.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the phylogeny of 31 Onobrychis species with the help of seed and fruit macro & micro-morphological traits and ISSR molecular markers. The species were found to be highly variable in their seed and fruit morphological traits. Also, a new type of fruit (O. crista galli type), in addition to the three predefined types of fruit, was introduced. From molecular perspective, a set of 22 ISSR primers were shown to have a good efficiency for genetic discrimination among the species. Bayesian model based STRUCTURE analysis grouped the genotypes into 4 genetic clusters, and the high value of Fst calculated for these clusters indicated a high level of genetic differentiation among them. On the other hand, based on the Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree, our results are in agreement with the subgenus classification (Onobrychis and Sisyrosema), while contrary to Sisyrosema, the Onobrychis subgenus (the Lophobrychis and Onobrychis sections) appears not to be monophyletic. Furthermore, in contrast to the traditional taxonomic classification, species belonging to the Lophobrychis section do not form a coherent group, indicating that this section could be considered as a heterogeneous unit and perhaps could be merge into the Onobrychis section.\n\nHighlightThis paper discusses a worldwide phylogenic analysis and population structures of Onobrychis genus.

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that inner hair cell (IHC) synaptopathy, i.e., loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and IHCs, leads to hidden hearing loss (HHL), i.e., poor performance on challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse density and suprathreshold ABR amplitude, without changing cochlear thresholds. Here, we show that IHC synapse density does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, was enhanced or reduced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that cochlear synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits, which may be a key contributor to the hearing impairments that define HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.",

    "abstract": "The Australian black swan (Cygnus atratus) is an iconic species with contrasting plumage to that of the closely related Northern Hemisphere white swans. The relative geographic isolation of the black swan may have resulted in a limited immune repertoire and increased susceptibility to infectious disease, notably infectious diseases from which Australia has been largely shielded. Indeed, unlike Mallard ducks and the mute swan (Cygnus olor), the black swan is extremely sensitive to severe highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Understanding this susceptibility has been impaired by the absence of any available swan genome and transcriptome information. Here, we generate the first chromosome-length annotated black and mute swan genomes annotated with transcriptome data, all using long-read based pipelines generated for vertebrate species. We used these genomes and transcriptomes, to show that unlike other wild waterfowl, black swans lack an expanded immune gene repertoire, lack a key viral pattern-recognition receptor in endothelial cells and mount a poorly controlled inflammatory response to HPAI. We also implicate genetic differences in SLC45A2 in the iconic plumage of the Australian black swan. Together, these data suggest that the immune system of the black swan is such that should any avian viral infection become established in its native habitat the survival of the black swan would be in significant peril.",

    "abstract": "The formation of cation-permeable pores due to amyloid beta (A{beta}) in the plasma membrane (PM) and membranes of intracellular organelles has been shown to cause disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis in Alzheimers disease, leading to neuronal malfunction and degeneration. However, detailed information about the formation, function, and time-evolution of A{beta} pores are still lacking. Here we present a comprehensive analysis to show that the Ca2+ toxicity of PM pores formed by A{beta}42 progressively increases over the duration of the experiments that last for more than an hour. This mainly results from a progressively increasing number of pores and activity of individual pores having higher open probability (Po) and Ca2+ conductance. To gain deeper insight into the function and evolution of A{beta}42 pores and establish their role in Ca2+ toxicity beyond experimental times scales, we developed a data-driven computational model that not only mimics the kinetics of these pores at a given time but also tracks their time-evolution over many hours. Our model suggests that the rising toxicity of A{beta}42 pores over time is a combined result of the large number of short-lived pores with low Ca2+ conductance and long-lived higher-conductance pores but fewer in number. Analysis and modeling of the voltage-dependent data show that A{beta}42 pores are most active when the cells membrane potential is near resting values, making the cell at rest especially more prone to Ca2+ disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Ergothioneine (ET) is the 2-thiourea derivative of trimethylhistidine that is biosynthesized only by select fungi and bacteria, notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and functions as a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species. Although ET is obtained in the diet and accumulates in vertebrate cells via an ET-specific transporter, the extent to which ET broadly functions in bacterial cells unable to synthesize it is unknown. Here we show that spd_1642-1643 in Streptococcus pneumoniae D39, a Gram-positive respiratory pathogen, encodes a novel ergothioneine uptake ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, which we designate EgtUV. EgtU is a permease-solute binding domain (SBD) fusion protein, and the SBD binds ET with high affinity and exquisite specificity in the cleft between the two subdomains, with cation-{pi} interactions engaging the betaine moiety and a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network surrounding the C2-sulfur-containing imidazole ring. Bioinformatics studies reveal that EgtUV is uniquely strongly conserved among known quaternary amine-specific transporters and widely distributed in firmicutes, including the human pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, as BilEB, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. This discovery significantly diversifies the LMW thiol pool in Gram-positive human pathogens that may contribute to antioxidant defenses in the infected host.",

    "abstract": "Multi-omic data spanning from genotype, gene expression to protein expression have been increasingly explored to interpret findings from genome wide association studies of Alzheimers disease (AD) and to gain more insight of the disease mechanism. However, each -omics data type is usually examined individually and the functional interactions between genetic variations, genes and proteins are only used after discovery to interpret the findings, but not beforehand. In this case, multi-omic findings are likely not functionally related and therefore give rise to challenges in interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a new interpretable deep neural network model MoFNet to jointly model the prior knowledge of functional interactions and multi-omic data set. It aims to identify a subnetwork of functional interactions predictive of AD evidenced by multi-omic measures. Particularly, prior functional interaction network was embedded into the architecture of MoFNet in a way that it resembles the information flow from DNA to gene and protein. The proposed model MoFNet significantly outperformed all other state-of-art classifiers when evaluated using multi-omic data from the ROS/MAP cohort. Instead of individual markers, MoFNet yielded multi-omic sub-networks related to innate immune system, clearance of misfolded proteins, and neurotransmitter release respectively. Around 50% of these findings were replicated in another independent cohort. Our identified gene/proteins are highly related to synaptic vesicle function. Altered regulation or expression of these genes/proteins could cause disruption in neuron-neuron or neuron-glia cross talk and further lead to neuronal and synapse loss in AD. Further investigation of these identified genes/proteins could possibly help decipher the mechanisms underlying synaptic dysfunction in AD, and ultimately inform therapeutic strategies to modify AD progression in the early stage.",

    "abstract": "The small GTPase Arl3 is important for the enrichment of lipidated proteins to primary cilia, including the outer segment of photoreceptors. Human mutations in the small GTPase Arl3 cause both autosomal recessive and dominant inherited retinal dystrophies. We discovered that dominant mutations result in increased active G-protein--Arl3-D67V has constitutive activity and Arl3-Y90C is fast cycling--and their expression in mouse rods resulted in a displaced nuclear phenotype due to an aberrant Arl3-GTP gradient. Using multiple strategies, we go on to show that removing or restoring the Arl3-GTP gradient within the cilium is sufficient to rescue the nuclear migration defect. Together, our results reveal that a Arl3 ciliary gradient is involved in proper positioning of photoreceptor nuclei during retinal development.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is defined by puberty and represents a period characterized by neural circuitry maturation (e.g., fronto-striatal systems) facilitating cognitive improvements. Though studies have characterized age-related changes, the extent to which puberty influences maturation of fronto-striatal networks is less known. Here, we combine two longitudinal datasets to characterize the role of puberty in the development of fronto-striatal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and its relationship to inhibitory control in 106 10-18-year-olds. Beyond age effects, we found that puberty was related to decreases in rsFC between the caudate and the anterior vmPFC, rostral and ventral ACC, and v/dlPFC, as well as with rsFC increases between the dlPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) across males and females. Stronger caudate rsFC with the dlPFC and vlPFC during early puberty was associated with worse inhibitory control and slower correct responses, respectively, whereas by late puberty, stronger vlPFC rsFC with the dorsal striatum was associated with faster correct responses. Taken together, our findings suggest that certain fronto-striatal connections are associated with pubertal maturation beyond age effects, which, in turn are related to inhibitory control. We discuss implications of puberty-related fronto-striatal maturation to further our understanding of pubertal effects related to adolescent cognitive and affective neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "Activation of voltage-gated calcium channels at synapses leads to local increases in calcium and the fusion of synaptic vesicles. However, presynaptic output will be determined by the density of calcium channels, the dynamic properties of the channel, the distance to docked vesicles, and the release probability at the docking site. We demonstrate that at C. elegans neuromuscular junctions two different classes of voltage-gated calcium channels, CaV2 and CaV1, mediate the release of distinct pools of synaptic vesicles. CaV2 channels are concentrated in densely packed clusters [~]300 nm in diameter with the active zone proteins Neurexin, -Liprin, SYDE, ELKS/CAST, RIM-BP, -Catulin, and MAGI1. CaV2 channels mediate the fusion of vesicles docked adjacent to the dense projection and are colocalized with the synaptic vesicle priming protein UNC-13L. By contrast, CaV1 channels are dispersed in the synaptic varicosity and are coupled to internal calcium stores via the ryanodine receptor. CaV1 and ryanodine receptor mediate the fusion of vesicles docked broadly in the synaptic varicosity and are colocalized with the vesicle priming protein UNC-13S. Distinct synaptic vesicle pools, released by different calcium channels, could be used to tune the speed, voltage-dependence, and quantal content of neurotransmitter release.",

However, the function of Axl in the invasion and metastasis of melanoma, the most lethal skin cancer, remains largely unknown. In the present study, we found that melanoma cell lines present variable protein levels of Axl and Tyro3; interestingly, MerTK is not noted at detectable levels in any of tested MGP (metastatic growth phase) cell lines. Treatment with recombinant human Gas6 significantly activates Akt in the Axl-expressing WM852 and IgR3 lines but just slightly in WM1158. IgR3, WM852 and WM1158 demonstrate different autocrine signaling. Knockdown of Axl by siRNA or the treatment with Axl-specific inhibitor R428 dramatically inhibits the migration and invasion of both IgR3 and WM852 in vitro. These findings suggest that Axl enhances the invasion of melanoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Despite pluripotent stem cells sharing key transcription factors, their maintenance involves distinct genetic inputs. Emerging evidence suggests that super-enhancers (SEs) can function as master regulatory hubs to control cell identity and pluripotency in humans and mice. However, whether pluripotency-associated SEs share a deep evolutionary origin in mammals remains elusive. Here, we performed comprehensive comparative epigenomic and transcription factor binding analyses among pigs, humans, and mice to identify pluripotency-associated SEs. Like typical enhancers, SEs displayed rapid evolution in mammals. We showed that BRD4 is an essential and conserved activator for mammalian pluripotency-associated SEs. Comparative motif enrichment analysis revealed 30 shared transcription factor binding motifs among the three species. The majority of the transcriptional factors that bind to identified motifs are known regulators associated with pluripotency. Further, we discovered three pluripotency-associated SEs (SE-SOX2, SE-PIM1, and SE-FGFR1) which displayed deep conservation in placental mammals and are sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in a pluripotency-dependent manner. Disruption of these conserved SEs through the CRISPR/Cas9 approach severely impaired the proliferative potential and the ability to form undifferentiated colonies. Our study provides insights into the understanding of conserved regulatory mechanisms underlying the maintenance of pluripotency as well as species-specific modulation of the pluripotency-associated regulatory networks in mammals.\n\nSignificance statementSuper-enhancers (SEs) hold stronger power than regular enhancers to direct gene expression in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency. To dissect how pluripotency-associated SEs have evolved in mammals, we performed a systematic comparison of SEs among pigs, humans, and mice. Our analysis allowed the identification of three pluripotency-associated SEs (SE-SOX2, SE-PIM1, and SE-FGFR1) that are highly conserved in Placentalia (accounting for 94% of mammals) as well as many species-specific SEs. All three SEs were sufficient to direct pluripotency-dependent gene expression and disruption of each conserved SE caused the loss of stem cell pluripotency. Our work highlights a small number of highly conserved SEs essential for the maintenance of pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "The Pallidin protein is a component of a multimeric complex named the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex 1 (BLOC1) that regulates specific endosomal function and transmembrane protein trafficking in many different cell types. In the brain, defective BLOC1 function has been linked to schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder with highly prevalent sleep disruptions, and to impaired cognitive abilities in healthy subjects. In animal models, defective BLOC1 function also impairs behavior, memory, neurotransmission systems and metabolism. This growing body of experimental evidence suggest an involvement of BLOC1 in sleep/wake regulation. Here, we used Drosophila molecular genetics and conditional, cell-type specific knockdown strategy to address this question. We show that down-regulation of a central subunit of BLOC1, Pallidin, in the surface glia, the Drosophila equivalent of the blood brain barrier, is sufficient to reduce, fragment and delay nighttime sleep at the adult stage and in a circadian clock dependent manner. Other members of the BLOC1 complex appear to be involved in this surface glia-dependent sleep regulation. In agreement with a BLOC1 involvement in amino acid transport, down-regulation of the Large neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (LAT1)-like transporters JhI-21 and minidiscs, phenocopy the down-regulation of pallidin. Similar results were obtained by inhibiting the TOR amino acid signaling pathway. Supplementing food with essential amino acids normalizes the sleep/wake phenotypes of pallidin and JhI-21 down-regulation. Furthermore, we identify a role for pallidin in the subcellular trafficking of JhI-21 in surface glial cells. Finally, we provide evidence that Pallidin function in surface glia is required for GABAergic neurons activation involved in promoting sleep. Taken together, these data identify a novel role for BLOC1 that, through LAT1-like transporters subcellular trafficking modulates essential amino acid availability and GABAergic sleep/wake regulation.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory interneurons represent less than 5% of neurons within the nucleus accumbens, but are critical for proper microcircuit function within this brain region. In the dorsal striatum, neuropeptide Y is expressed by two interneuron subtypes (low-threshold spiking interneurons and neurogliaform interneurons) that exhibit mu opioid receptor sensitivity in other brain regions. However, few studies have assessed the molecular and physiological properties of neuropeptide Y interneurons within the nucleus accumbens. We used a transgenic reporter mouse to identify and characterize neuropeptide Y interneurons in acute nucleus accumbens brain slices. Nearly all cells exhibited electrophysiological properties of low-threshold spiking interneurons, with almost no neurogliaform interneurons observed among neuropeptide Y interneurons. We corroborated this pattern using fluorescent in situ hybridization, and also identified a high level of mu opioid receptor expression by low-threshold spiking interneurons, which led us to examine the functional consequences of mu opioid receptor activation in these cells using electrophysiology. Mu opioid receptor activation caused a reduction in the rate of spontaneous action potentials in low-threshold spiking interneurons, as well as a decrease in optogenetically-evoked GABA release onto medium spiny neurons. The latter effect was more robust in female versus male mice, and when the postsynaptic medium spiny neuron expressed the Drd1 dopamine receptor. This work is the first to examine the physiological properties of neuropeptide Y interneurons in the nucleus accumbens, and show they may be an important target for mu opioid receptor modulation by endogenous and exogenous opioids.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions are often thought to facilitate local adaptation and population divergence because they can link multiple adaptive alleles into non-recombining genomic blocks. Selection should thus be more efficient in driving inversion-linked adaptive alleles to high frequency in a population, particularly in the face of maladaptive gene flow. But, what if ecological conditions and hence selection on inversion-linked alleles change? Reduced recombination within inversions could then constrain the formation of optimal combinations of pre-existing alleles under these new ecological conditions. Here, we outline this idea of inversions limiting adaptation and divergence when ecological conditions change across time or space. We reason that the benefit of inversions for local adaptation and divergence under one set of ecological conditions can come with a concomitant constraint for adaptation to novel sets of ecological conditions. This limitation of inversions to adaptation may also provide one possible explanation for why inversions are often maintained as polymorphisms within species.",

Morus notabilis, a dioecious mulberry species, has the fewest chromosomes among Morus spp., but the genetic basis of sex determination and karyotype evolution in this species have not been identified. Three high-quality genome assemblies generated of Morus spp. (including those of dioecious M. notabilis and Morus yunnanensis) were within the range 301-329 Mb in size which were grouped into six pseudochromosomes. Using a combination of genomic approaches, we showed that the putative ancestral karyotype of Morus was close to 14 protochromosomes, and that several chromosome fusion events resulted in descending dysploidy (2n = 2x = 12). We also characterized a [~]6.2-Mb sex-determining region on chromosome 3. The four potential male-specific genes, including a partially duplicated DNA helicase gene orthologue (named MSDH) and three Ty3_Gypsy long terminal repeat retrotransposons (named MSTG), were solely identified in the Y-linked area and considered to be strong candidate genes for sex determination or differentiation. Population genomic analysis showed that Guangdong accessions in China were genetically similar to Japanese accessions of mulberry. In addition, genomic areas containing selective sweeps that distinguish domesticated mulberry trees from wild populations in terms of flowering and disease resistance were identified.

    "abstract": "The accessory olfactory system (AOS) is critical for the development and expression of social behavior. The first dedicated circuit in the AOS, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), exhibits cellular and network plasticity in male and female mice after social experience. In the AOB, interneurons called internal granule cells (IGCs) express the plasticity-associated immediate-early gene Arc following intermale aggression or mating. Here, we sought to better understand how Arc-expressing IGCs shape AOB information processing and social behavior in the context of territorial aggression. We used \"ArcTRAP\" (Arc-CreERT2) transgenic mice to selectively and permanently label Arc-expressing IGCs following male-male resident-intruder interactions. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that Arc-expressing IGCs display increased intrinsic excitability for several days after a single resident-intruder interaction. Further, we found that Arc-expressing IGCs maintain this increased excitability across repeated resident-intruder interactions, during which resident mice increase or \"ramp\" their aggression. We tested the hypothesis that Arc-expressing IGCs participate in ramping aggression. Using a combination of ArcTRAP mice and chemogenetics (Cre-dependent hM4D(Gi)-mCherry AAV injections), we found that disruption of Arc-expressing IGC activity during repeated resident-intruder interactions abolishes the ramping aggression exhibited by resident male mice. This work shows that Arc-expressing AOB IGC ensembles are activated by specific chemosensory environments, and play an integral role in the establishment and expression of sex-typical social behavior. These studies identify a population of plastic interneurons in an early chemosensory circuit that display physiological features consistent with simple memory formation, increasing our understanding of central chemosensory processing and mammalian social behavior.\n\nSignificance statementThe accessory olfactory system (AOS) plays a vital role in rodent chemosensory social behavior.

We developed and applied a spatial transcriptomic sequencing technique with subcellular resolution and tissue-scale extensibility, i.e., Stereo-seq3, together with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), to the entire lung lobes of 45 hamsters and obtained an elaborate map of the pulmonary spatiotemporal changes from acute infection, severe pneumonia to the late viral clearance and inflammation resolution. While SARS-CoV-2 infection caused massive damages to the hamster lungs, including naive T cell infection and deaths related to lymphopenia, we identified a group of monocyte-derived proliferating Slamf9+Spp1+ macrophages, which were SARS-CoV-2 infection-inducible and cell death-resistant, recruiting neutrophils to clear viruses together. After viral clearance, the Slamf9+Spp1+ macrophages differentiated into Trem2+ and Fbp1+ macrophages, both responsible for inflammation resolution and replenishment of alveolar macrophages. The existence of this specific macrophage subpopulation and its descendants were validated by RNAscope in hamsters, immunofluorescence in hACE2 mice, and public human autopsy scRNA-seq data of COVID-19 patients. The spatiotemporal landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamster lungs and the identification of Slamf9+Spp1+ macrophages that is pivotal to viral clearance and inflammation resolution are important to better understand the critical molecular and cellular players of COVID-19 host defense and also develop potential interventions of COVID-19 immunopathology.",

Thereafter, Omicron subvariants have emerged and some of them began outcompeting BA.2 in multiple countries. For instance, Omicron BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 subvariants are becoming dominant in France, the USA and South Africa, respectively. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of these new Omicron subvariants (BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5) to eight therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab, bebtelovimab, casirivimab, cilgavimab, etesevimab, imdevimab, sotrovimab and tixagevimab). Notably, we showed that although cilgavimab is antiviral against BA.2, BA.4/5 exhibits higher resistance to this antibody compared to BA.2. Since mutations are accumulated in the spike proteins of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, we suggest the importance of rapid evaluation of the efficiency of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel SAM methyl transferase in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that is upregulated by thiol reducing agents and hydrogen sulfide with expression controlled by the hypoxia inducible factor pathway. This methyl transferase, RIPS-1, is expressed in the gut and hypodermis of this nematode with homologues found in a small subset of eukaryotes and bacteria, many of which can adapt to fluctuations in environmental oxygen levels. We identified RIPS-1 through forward genetic screens as the only gene that when mutated allowed worms to survive normally lethal concentrations of thiol reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and {beta}-mercaptoethanol. The RIPS-1 methyl transferase is an important player in the methionine cycle and its activation consumes methionine in a methionine synthetase and vitamin B12-dependant manner. This requirement limits the availability of vitamin B12 in the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial involvement was also established through a targeted enhancer screen that identified methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase as a strong genetic enhancer of RIPS-1 mutant resistance to DTT. Toxicity associated with thiol reducing agent exposure can be overcome in C. elegans by adding methionine, loss of RIPS-1, or by addition of excess vitamin B12. This work highlights the central importance of dietary vitamin B12 in normal metabolic processes in C. elegans and defines a new role in countering reductive stress",

During HIV-1 maturation, CA can self-assemble into a wide range of capsid morphologies made of ~175-250 hexamers and 12 pentamers. Most recently, the cellular polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) has been demonstrated to facilitate conical capsid formation by coordinating a ring of arginine residues within the central cavity of capsid hexamers and pentamers. However, the precise kinetic interplay of events during IP6 and CA co-assembly is unclear. In this work, we use Coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) simulations to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of capsid formation, including the crucial role played by IP6. We show that IP6, in relatively small quantities at first, promotes curvature generation by trapping pentameric defects in the growing lattice and shifts assembly behavior towards kinetically favored outcomes. Our analysis also suggests that IP6 can stabilize metastable capsid intermediates and can induce structural pleomorphism in mature capsids.\n\nTeaserComputer simulations reveal that IP6 promotes fullerene-like capsid formation by stabilizing high curvature regions of the capsid.",

An example showcasing this capability is the tubular deformation of liposomes by DNA nanostructures with purposely designed shapes, surface modifications, and self-assembling properties. However, stimulus-responsive membrane tubulation mediated by DNA structure reconfiguration remains challenging. Here we present the triggered formation of membrane tubes in response to specific DNA signals that actuate membrane-bound DNA clamps from an open state to various predefined closed states, releasing pre-stored energy to activate membrane deformation. Using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model system, we show that the timing and efficiency of tubulation, as well as the width of membrane tubes, are modulated by the conformational change of DNA clamps, marking a solid step toward spatiotemporal control of membrane dynamics in an artificial system.",

Reduced RyR2 shuts down basal Ca2+ oscillation in Tregs, which reduces m-Calpain activities that is needed for T cells to disengage from DCs, suggesting a persistent blockage of DC antigen presentation. RyR2 deficiency renders the CD4+ T cell pool to become immune suppressive, and behave in the same manner as FoxP3+ Tregs in viral infection, asthma, hypersensitivity, colitis and tumor development. In the absence of FoxP3, RyR2-deficient CD4+ T cells rescue the systemic autoimmunity associated with Scurfy mice.

We analyzed the oral microbiota of the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population where part of its members is adopting an agricultural diet. We show that age is the strongest factor modulating the microbiome, likely through immunosenescence as there is an increase of pathogenicity with age. Biological and cultural processes generate sexual dimorphism in the oral microbiome. A small subset of oral bacteria is influenced by the host genome, linking host collagen genes to bacterial biofilm formation. Our data also suggests that shifting from a fish/meat to a rice-rich diet transforms their microbiome, mirroring the Neolithic transition. All these factors have implications in the epidemiology of oral diseases. Thus, the human oral microbiome is multifactorial, and shaped by various ecological and social factors that modify the oral environment.",

We also defined the Agta social microbiome as a set of 137 oral bacteria (only 7% of 1980 amplicon sequence variants) significantly influenced by social contact (quantified through wireless sensors of short-range interactions). We show that interaction networks covering large areas, and their strong links between close kin, spouses, and even unrelated friends, can significantly predict bacterial transmission networks across Agta camps. Finally, more central individuals to social networks are also bacterial supersharers.

    "abstract": "Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKp) have disseminated globally and represent a major threat in hospitals with few therapeutic options and high mortality rates. Isolates producing the carbapenemase KPC (KPC-Kp) might be classified as susceptible according to clinical breakpoints by antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), allowing the use of imipenem or meropenem for treatment of infections. However, some KPC-Kp show heteroresistance (HR) to carbapenems, with colonies growing in the inhibition halo of agar-based AST. HR KPC-Kp have been associated with a higher risk of treatment failure. Here, we characterized the diversity of mechanisms behind HR to imipenem of these isolates. By analyzing a diverse collection of CPKp, we showed that HR is frequent among KPC-Kp. By monitoring single HR colony appearance using the ScanLag setup, we discriminated surviving cells in two subpopulations leading to a Gaussian-like distribution of early-appearing colonies, with a delayed emergence compared to colonies arising in the absence of antibiotics, and a long tail of late-appearing colonies. A subset of colonies showed a reduced growth rate. Characterization of surviving populations by AST and whole-genome sequencing of 333 colonies revealed a majority of parental genotypes and a broad landscape of genetic alterations in 28% of the colonies, including gene loss, DNA amplification and point mutations. This unveils the complexity of imipenem HR among KPC-Kp isolates, which involves tolerant and persistent cells, but also resistant bacteria. These observations contribute to a better understanding of reasons behind carbapenem treatment failure of KPC-Kp isolates.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe ability of a bacterium to defeat antibiotics not only depends upon resistance, but also on tolerance and persistence, which allow a bacterial population to temporarily survive high drug doses. Carbapenems are antibiotics of last resort and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing the carbapenemase KPC are a threat to hospitals, although they might remain susceptible to carbapenems. However, seemingly homogeneous populations of KPC-K. pneumoniae isolates frequently show varying degrees of susceptibility to carbapenem, i.e., a phenomenon called heteroresistance. We characterized bacteria surviving a high dose of imipenem, progressively degraded by the released carbapenemase, by monitoring the growth of the resulting colonies using the ScanLag system, their genome sequence and carbapenem susceptibility. We show that the observed phenotypic diversity combines tolerance, persistence and resistance making the treatment with high doses of carbapenems frequently inefficient.",

    "abstract": "The propagation of the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is tightly regulated by calcium signaling. However, the mechanisms by which calcium homeostasis and fluxes are regulated in this human pathogen are not fully understood. To identify Toxoplasmas calcium homeostasis network, we have characterized a novel EF-hand domain-containing protein, which we have named TgEFP1. We have determined that TgEFP1 localizes to a previously described compartment known as the plant-like vacuole or the endo-lysosomal compartment (PLV/ELC), which harbors several proteins related to ionic regulation. Interestingly, partial permeabilization techniques showed that TgEFP1 is also secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), within which the parasite divides. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy confirmed the unusual dual localization of TgEFP1 at the PLV/ELC and the PV. Furthermore, we determined that the localization of TgEFP1 to the PV, but not to the PLV/ELC, is affected by disruption of Golgi-dependent transport with Brefeldin A. Knockout of TgEFP1 results in faster propagation in tissue culture, hypersensitivity to calcium ionophore-induced egress, and premature natural egress. Thus, our work has revealed an interplay between the PV and the PLV/ELC and a role for TgEFP1 in the regulation of calcium-dependent events.",

    "abstract": "The rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a major health concern and the determinants of this emergence are actively studied. By contrast, although biofilms are an important cause of infections due to their high tolerance to a broad range of antimicrobials, much less is known on the development of antibiotic resistance within the biofilm environment, an issue potentially aggravating the current antibiotic crisis. Here, we compared the occurrence of resistance mutations in pathogenic Escherichia coli planktonic and biofilm populations exposed to clinically relevant cycles of lethal treatments with the aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin. This experimental evolution approach revealed that mutations in sbmA and fusA are rapidly selected in biofilm but not in planktonic populations. The apparition of these bona fide resistance --and not tolerance-- mutations is favored by the biofilm preexisting tolerance and high mutation rate. Moreover, we showed that while fusA mutations displayed a high fitness cost in planktonic conditions, these mutations were maintained in biofilms, a phenomenon further possibly amplified by the selection of fimH mutations favoring biofilm formation itself. Our study therefore provides new insights into the dynamic evolution of antibiotic resistance in biofilms, which could lead to clinically practical antibiotic regimen limiting biofilm-associated infections, while mitigating the emergence of worrisome antibiotic resistance mutations.",

Our results suggest that antibiotic-mediated accumulation of lipid II at the septum facilitates membrane invasion by antimicrobial UFAs.

    "abstract": "The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain is a key component of immune receptors that identify pathogen invasion in bacteria, plants, and animals. In the bacterial antiphage system Thoeris, as well as in plants, recognition of infection stimulates TIR domains to produce an immune signaling molecule whose molecular structure remained elusive. This molecule binds and activates the Thoeris immune effector, which then executes the immune function. We identified a large family of phage-encoded proteins, denoted here Thoeris anti-defense 1 (Tad1), that inhibit Thoeris immunity. We found that Tad1 proteins are \"sponges\" that bind and sequester the immune signaling molecule produced by TIR-domain proteins, thus decoupling phage sensing from immune effector activation and rendering Thoeris inactive. A high-resolution crystal structure of Tad1 bound to the signaling molecule revealed that its chemical structure is 1'-2' glycocyclic ADPR (gcADPR), a unique molecule not previously described in other biological systems. Our results define the chemical structure of a central immune signaling molecule, and reveal a new mode of action by which pathogens can suppress host immunity.",

Our approach should facilitate experiments necessitating KI of large DNA fragments to tag endogenous loci for visualization and/or conditional protein degradation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpace spraying of insecticides is still an important mean of controlling Aedes and Culex mosquitoes and arboviral diseases. This study evaluated the space spray efficacy of Fludora Co-Max EW (a combination of flupyradifurone and transfluthrin, with Film Forming Aqueous Spray Technology (FFAST)) against wild, insecticide-resistant Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus populations from Abidjan, Cote dIvoire, against K-Othrine EC (deltamethrin-only product), through small-scale field trials.\n\nMethodologyWild Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito larvae were collected in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire from August to December 2020. Mosquito larvae were reared until adult stage. Emerged adult females were tested against Fludora Co-Max EW and K-Othrine EC using ultra-low volume cold fogging (ULV) and thermal fogging (TF) both outdoors and indoors in Agboville, Cote dIvoire. Cages containing 20 mosquitoes each were placed at 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 m from the spraying line for outdoor spraying, and at ceiling, mid-height and floor levels for indoor house spraying. Knockdown and mortality were recorded at each checkpoint and compared by treatments.\n\nPrincipal findingsOverall, Fludora Co-Max EW induced significantly higher knockdown and mortality effects in the wild insecticide-resistant Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus compared with K-Othrine EC. With both species, Fludora Co-Max EW mortality rates were above 80% (up to 100%) for outdoor ULV spray at each distance checkpoint (i.e. 10 to 100 m), and 100% for indoor ULV and TF sprays at all level checkpoints (i.e. ceiling, mid-height and floor). K-Othrine EC induced high mortality indoors (97.9-100%), whereas outdoor mortality rapidly declined in Ae. aegypti from 96.7% to 36.7% with ULV, and 85.0% to 38.3% with TF, from 10 to 100 m. For outdoor Fludora Co-Max EW spray, ULV showed both higher knockdown and killing performance Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus compared with TF. Fludora Co-Max EW performed better against Cx. quinquefasciatus compared with Ae. aegypti.\n\nConclusion/significanceFludora Co-Max EW induced high mortality and knockdown effects against wild insecticide-resistant Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus Abidjan strains and performed better than K-Othrine EC. The presence of flupyradifurone and transfluthrin (with new and independent modes of action) and FFAST technology in the current Fludora Co-Max EW formulation appears to have broadened its killing capacity. Fludora Co-Max EW is thus an effective adulticide and may be a useful tool for Aedes and Culex mosquito and arbovirus control in endemic areas.\n\nAuthor SummarySpace spraying of insecticides is an important tool to control Aedes and Culex mosquitoes and prevent the viral diseases (i.e. dengue, yellow fever, etc.) that they transmit. We studied the efficacy of the product Fludora Co-Max EW (a new space spray insecticide) against adult wild insecticide-resistant populations of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes from Abidjan, Cote dIvoire. We compared Fludora Co-Max EW knockdown and mortality effects in these mosquitoes with the local insecticide K-Othrine EC using ultra-low volume (ULV) and thermal fogging (TF) spraying outdoors and indoors. The product Fludora Co-Max EW induced high rates of knockdown and mortality (i.e. 80-100%) in these wild insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and performed better than the product K-Othrine EC. Additionally, ULV sprays of Fludora Co-Max EW demonstrated higher knockdown and killing efficacy at larger distances (i.e. up to 100 m) compared with TF. The higher efficacy of Fludora Co-Max EW may be due to the interaction of two unrelated insecticides, flupyradifurone and transfluthrin, in combination with Film Forming Aqueous Spray Technology (FFAST). Fludora Co-Max EW therefore appears to be an effective and useful tool to control adult populations of wild insecticide-resistant Aedes and Culex mosquitoes and may be recommended for preventing related mosquito-transmitted viral diseases.",

    "abstract": "Whereas techniques to map chromatin-bound proteins are well-developed, mapping chromatin-associated RNAs remains a challenge. Here we describe Reverse Transcribe & Tagment (RT&Tag), in which RNAs associated with a chromatin epitope are targeted by an antibody followed by a protein A-Tn5 transposome. Localized reverse transcription generates RNA/cDNA hybrids that are subsequently tag-mented for sequencing by Tn5. We demonstrate the utility of RT&Tag in Drosophila cells for capturing the noncoding RNA roX2 with the dosage compensation complex and maturing transcripts associated with silencing histone modifications. We also show that RT&Tag can detect N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified mRNAs, and show that genes producing methylated transcripts are characterized by extensive promoter pausing of RNA polymerase II. The high efficiency of in situ antibody tethering and tagmentation makes RT&Tag especially suitable for rapid low-cost profiling of chromatin-associated RNAs from small samples.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of most proteins begins at AUG codons, yet a small number of non-AUG initiated proteoforms are also known. Here we used publicly available ribo-seq data with phylogenetic approaches to identify novel, previously uncharacterised non-AUG proteoforms. Unexpectedly we found that the number of non-AUG proteoforms identified with ribosome profiling data greatly exceeds those with strong phylogenetic support. We identified an association between proteoforms with alternative N-termini and multiple compartmentalisation of corresponding gene products. In dozens of genes N-terminal extensions encode localisation signals, including mitochondrial presequence and signal peptides. While the majority of non-AUG initiated proteoforms occur in addition to AUG initiated proteoforms, in few cases non-AUG appears to be the only start. This suggests that alternative compartmentalisation is not the only function of non-AUG initiation. Taking a conservative approach, we updated annotation of several genes in the latest GENCODE version in human and mouse where non-AUG initiated proteofoms are supported by both, ribosome profiling and phylogenetic evidence. Yet, the number of such extensions is likely much higher. Thousands of non-AUG proteoforms supported only by ribosome profiling suggest that they may evolve neutrally. Indeed, expression of some may not be consequential, i.e. when N-termini is processed or they have identical biochemical properties. Nonetheless they may contribute to immune response as antigen sources. It is also possible that some proteoforms accrued useful functions only recently and evolved under purifying selection in a narrow phylogenetic group. Thus, further characterisation is important for understanding their phenotypical and clinical significance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe peptide hormone leptin exerts its function in the brain to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure to prevent obesity. However, most obese subjects reflect the resistance to leptin even with elevated serum leptin. Considering that leptin must cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in several regions to enter the brain parenchyma, altered leptin transport through the BBB might play an important role in leptin resistance and other biological conditions. Here, we report the use of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB model to explore mechanisms that influence leptin transport.\n\nMethodsiPSCs were differentiated into brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC)-like cells using standard methods. BMEC-like cells were cultured in Transwell filters, treated with ligands from a nuclear receptor agonist library, and assayed for leptin transport using an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. RNA sequencing was further used to identify differentially regulated genes and pathways. The role of a select hit in leptin transport was tested with the competitive substrate assay and after gene knockdown using CRISPR techniques.\n\nResultsFollowing a screen of 73 compounds, 17{beta}-estradiol was identified as a compound that could significantly increase leptin transport. RNA sequencing revealed many differentially expressed transmembrane transporters after 17{beta}-estradiol treatment. Of these, cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1, encoded by SLC7A1) was selected for follow-up analyses due to its high and selective expression in BMECs in vivo. Treatment of BMEC-like cells with CAT-1 substrates, as well as knockdown of CAT-1 expression via CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing, yielded significant increases in leptin transport.\n\nConclusionsA major female sex hormone, as well as an amino acid transporter, were revealed as regulators of leptin BBB transport in the iPSC-derived BBB model. Outcomes from this work provide insights into regulation of peptide hormone transport across the BBB.",

    "abstract": "In addition to scavenging exogenous cholesterol, the parasitic kinetoplastid Trypanosoma cruzi can endogenously synthesize sterols. Similar to fungal species, T. cruzi synthesizes ergostane type sterols and is sensitive to a class of azole inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis that target the enzyme lanosterol 14-demethylase (CYP51). In the related kinetoplastid parasite Leishmania donovani, CYP51 is essential, yet in Leishmania major, the cognate enzyme is dispensable for growth; but not heat resistance. The essentiality of CYP51 and the specific role of ergostane-type sterol products in T. cruzi has not been established. To better understand the importance of this pathway, we have disrupted the CYP51 gene in T. cruzi epimastigotes ({Delta}CYP51). Disruption of CYP51 leads to accumulation of 14-methylated sterols and a concurrent absence of the final sterol product ergosterol. While{Delta} CYP51 epimastigotes have slowed proliferation compared to wild type parasites, the enzyme is not required for growth; however,{Delta} CYP51 epimastigotes exhibit sensitivity to elevated temperature, an elevated mitochondrial membrane potential and fail to establish growth as intracellular amastigotes in vitro. Further genetic disruption of squalene epoxidase ({Delta}SQLE) results in the absence of all endogenous sterols and sterol auxotrophy, yet failed to rescue tolerance to stress in{Delta} CYP51 parasites, suggesting the loss of ergosterol and not accumulation of 14-methylated sterols modulates stress tolerance.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the resistance have remained unknown.

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of endothelial and B cell malignancies. During KSHV lytic infection, lytic-related proteins are synthesized, viral genomes are replicated as a tandemly repeated form, and subsequently, capsids are assembled. The herpesvirus terminase complex is proposed to package an appropriate genome unit into an immature capsid, by cleavage of terminal repeats (TRs) flanking tandemly linked viral genomes. Although the mechanism of capsid formation in - and {beta}-herpesviruses are well-studied, in KSHV, it remains largely unknown. It has been proposed that KSHV ORF7 is a terminase subunit, and ORF7 harbors a zinc-finger motif, which is conserved among other herpesviral terminases. However, the biological significance of ORF7 is unknown. We previously reported that KSHV ORF17 is essential for the cleavage of inner scaffold proteins in capsid maturation, and ORF17 knockout (KO) induced capsid formation arrest between the procapsid and B-capsid stages. However, it remains unknown if ORF7-mediated viral DNA cleavage occurs before or after ORF17-mediated scaffold collapse. We analyzed the role of ORF7 during capsid formation using ORF7-KO-, ORF7&17-double-KO (DKO)-, and ORF7-zinc-finger motif mutant-KSHVs. We found that ORF7 acted after ORF17 in the capsid formation process, and ORF7-KO-KSHV produced incomplete capsids harboring non-spherical internal structures, which resembled soccer balls. This soccer ball-like capsid was formed after ORF17-mediated B-capsid formation. Moreover, ORF7-KO- and zinc-finger motif KO-KSHV failed to appropriately cleave the TR on replicated genome and had a defect in virion production. Thus, our data revealed that ORF7 contributes to terminase-mediated viral genome cleavage and capsid formation.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn herpesviral capsid formation, the viral terminase complex cleaves the TR sites on newly synthesized tandemly repeating genomes and inserts an appropriate genomic unit into an immature capsid. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) UL28 is a subunit of the terminase complex that cleaves the replicated viral genome. However, the physiological importance of the UL28 homolog, KSHV ORF7, remains poorly understood. Here, using several ORF7-deficent KSHVs, we found that ORF7 acted after ORF17-mediated scaffold collapse in the capsid maturation process. Moreover, ORF7 and its zinc-finger motif were essential for both cleavage of TR sites on the KSHV genome and virus production. ORF7-deficient KSHVs produced incomplete capsids that resembled a soccer ball. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing ORF7-KO-induced soccer ball-like capsids production and ORF7 function in the KSHV capsid assembly process. Our findings provide insights into the role of ORF7 in KSHV capsid formation.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the entire progression of atherosclerosis. In this study, we identified an uncharacterized lncRNA, Liver Expressions by PSRC1 Induce Specifically (LEPIS). The expression of LEPIS and its potential target tropomodulin 4 (TMOD4) in the liver of ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet was increased. An ApoE-/- mouse model with the overexpression of LEPIS or TMOD4 in liver was established, and we found that both LEPIS and TMOD4 increased the burden of atherosclerosis and reduced hepatic cholesterol levels. Further study revealed that LEPIS and TMOD4 affect the expression of genes related to hepatic cholesterol homeostasis, including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type9 (PCSK9) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which are closely related to hypercholesterolemia. Mechanistically, human antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein, was shown to be critical for the regulation of TMOD4 by LEPIS. Further, we found that overexpression of LEPIS promoted the shuttling of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, enhanced the stability of TMOD4 mRNA, and in turn promoted the expression of TMOD4.

    "abstract": "DNA dumbbells have many applications. For example, they can be templates for rolling-circle amplification to produce highly accurate long-read sequences of single molecules. We have developed a highly efficient and simple method for  tunneling short-read Illumina sequencing libraries into long-read dumbbells. A 5-exonuclease used in Gibson Assembly converted fixed Illumina P5/P7 sequences into sticky ends. Self-looping oligonucleotides with complementary 3-overhangs were ligated to form dumbbells. The reaction proceeded in one pot and modified only end nucleotides of input libraries. Resulting dumbbells were ready for Phi29-dependent rolling circle amplification. Demonstrative readouts of full-length 16S rDNA from a standard microbial community, obtained on a Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform, confirmed successful tunneling of initially P5/P7-ended sequencing libraries. Twelve fecal samples additionally showed significant correlations between standard and tunneled 16S sequence variants on a PacBio platform.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation is a main driver of biological complexity at all levels. In the viral world, gene sharing among viral genomes, complementation between genomes or interactions within quasispecies are frequently observed. In this contribution, we explore the advantages that flexible associations between fully fledged viruses and subviral entities, such as virus satellites, might yield. We devise a mathematical model to compare different situations of competition between two viruses and to quantify how the association with a satellite qualitatively modifies dynamical equilibria. The relevant parameter is the invasion fitness of each virus or of the virus-satellite tandem, which in the model depends on the transmission rate of viruses and on their effect on host survival. While in a virus-virus competition one of the viruses becomes eventually extinct, an association with a satellite might change the outcome of the competition to favor the less competitive virus (regardless of whether it is the helper virus or not) or to allow for the stable coexistence of the two viruses and the satellite. We hypothesize that the latter scenario, in particular, constitutes a parsimonious evolutionary pathway towards more stable cooperative associations, such as bipartite viral forms.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian NF-{kappa}B p52:p52 homodimer together with its cofactor Bcl3 activates transcription of {kappa}B sites with a central G/C base pair (bp), while it is inactive toward {kappa}B sites with a central A/T bp. To understand the molecular basis for this unique property of p52, we have determined its structure in complex with a P-selectin(PSel)-{kappa}B DNA (5-GGGGTGACCCC-3) (central bp is underlined) and variants changing the central bp to A/T or swapping the flanking bp. The structures reveal a nearly two-fold widened minor groove in the central region of the DNA as compared to all other currently available NF-{kappa}B-DNA complex structures, which have a central A/T bp. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show free DNAs exist in distinct preferred conformations, and p52:p52 homodimer induces the least amount of conformational changes on the more transcriptionally active natural PSel-{kappa}B DNA in the bound form. Our binding assays further demonstrate that the fast kinetics driven by entropy is correlated with higher transcriptional activity. Overall, our studies have revealed a novel conformation for {kappa}B DNA in complex with NF-{kappa}B and suggest the importance of binding kinetics, dictated by free DNA conformational and dynamic states, in controlling transcriptional activation for NF-{kappa}B.",

    "abstract": "Hsp60 chaperonins and their Hsp10 cofactors assist protein folding in all living cells, constituting the paradigmatic example of molecular chaperones. Despite extensive investigations of their structure and mechanism, crucial questions regarding how these chaperonins promote folding remain unsolved. Here, we report that the bacterial Hsp60 chaperonin GroEL forms a stable, functionally relevant complex with the chaperedoxin CnoX, a protein combining a chaperone and a redox function. Binding of GroES (Hsp10) to GroEL induces CnoX release. Cryo-electron microscopy provided crucial structural information on the GroEL-CnoX complex, showing that CnoX binds GroEL outside the substrate-binding site via a highly conserved C-terminal -helix. Furthermore, the identification of complexes in which CnoX, bound to GroEL, forms mixed-disulfides with GroEL substrates indicates that CnoX likely functions as a redox quality-control plugin for GroEL. Proteins sharing structural features with CnoX exist in eukaryotes, which suggests that Hsp60 molecular plugins have been conserved through evolution.",

    "abstract": "The human L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1; SLC7A5) is a membrane transporter of amino acids, thyroid hormones, and drugs such as the Parkinsons disease drug L-Dopa. LAT1 is found in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), testis, bone marrow, and placenta, and its dysregulation has been associated with various neurological diseases such as autism and epilepsy as well as cancer. In this study, we combine metainference molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular docking, and experimental testing, to characterize LAT1-inhibitor interactions. We first conducted a series of molecular docking experiments to identify the most relevant interactions between LAT1s substrate binding site and ligan ds, including both inhibitors and substrates. We then performed metainference MD simulations using cryo-EM structures in different conformations of LAT1 with the electron density map as a spatial restraint, to explore the inherent heterogeneity in the structures. We analyzed the LAT1 substrate binding site to map important LAT1-ligand interactions as well as newly described druggable pockets. Finally, this analysis guided the discovery of previously unknown LAT1 ligands using virtual screening and cellular uptake experiments. Our results improve our understanding of LAT1-inhibitor recognition, providing a framework for rational design of future lead compounds targeting this key drug target.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLAT1 is a membrane transporter of amino acids, thyroid hormones, and therapeutic drugs, that is primarily found in the BBB and placenta, as well as in tumor cells of several cancer types.

Our computational analysis predicts S66, G67, F252, G255, Y259, W405 are critical residues for inhibitor binding and druggable sub-pockets in the outward-occluded conformation that are ideal for LAT1 inhibitor discovery.

    "abstract": "Activation of gene expression in response to environmental cues results in substantial phenotypic heterogeneity between cells that can impact a wide range of outcomes including differentiation, viral activation, and drug resistance. An important source of gene expression noise is transcriptional bursting, or the observation that transcripts are produced during infrequent bursts of promoter activity. Chromatin accessibility, which regulates assembly of polymerase complexes on promoters, impacts transcriptional bursting, suggesting that how an activating signal affects transcriptional noise will depend on the initial chromatin state at the promoter. To explore this possibility, we simulated transcriptional activation using a transcriptional cycling model with three promoter states that represent chromatin remodeling, polymerase binding and pause release. We initiated this model over a large parameter range representing target genes with different chromatin environments, and found that, upon increasing the polymerase pause release rate to activate transcription, changes in gene expression noise varied significantly across initial promoter states. This model captured phenotypic differences in activation of latent HIV viruses integrated at different chromatin locations and mediated by the transcription factor NF-{kappa}B. Activating transcription in the model via increasing one or more of the transcript production rates, as occurs following NF-{kappa}B activation, reproduced experimentally measured transcript distributions for four different latent HIV viruses, as well as the bimodal pattern of HIV protein expression that leads to a subset of reactivated virus. Importantly, the parameter  activation path differentially affected gene expression noise, and ultimately viral activation, in line with experimental observations. This work demonstrates how upstream signaling pathways can be connected to biological processes that underlie transcriptional bursting, resulting in target gene-specific noise profiles following stimulation of a single upstream pathway.\n\nAuthor SummaryMany genes are transcribed in infrequent bursts of mRNA production through a process called transcriptional bursting, which contributes to variability in responses between cells. Heterogeneity in cell responses can have important biological impacts, such as whether a cell supports viral replication or responds to a drug, and thus there is an effort to describe this process with mathematical models to predict biological outcomes. Previous models described bursting as a transition between an \"OFF\" state or an \"ON\" state, an elegant and simple mathematical representation of complex molecular mechanisms, but one which failed to capture how upstream activation signals affected bursting. To address this, we added an additional promoter state to better reflect biological mechanisms underlying bursting. By fitting this model to variable activation of quiescent HIV infections in T cells, we showed that our model more accurately described viral expression variability across cells in response to an upstream stimulus. Our work highlights how mathematical models can be further developed to understand complex biological mechanisms and suggests ways to connect transcriptional bursting to upstream activation pathways.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on 24 hours preserved diluted rooster semen at 4{degrees}C with a low motility percentage during 2 hours at room temperature incubation. Ten indigenous same-aged roosters were used in this study, adapted by Dorso-abdominal massage for semen collection for one month before starting main work. Semen was collected weekly twice by the Dorso-abdominal massage technique, collected semen transferred to the laboratory in less than 10 minutes, and took a previous qualifying examination. Qualify semen from each rooster polled together and diluted by the Lake extender and preserved for 24 hours at 4{degrees}C in the refrigerator. Different ACh concentrations (10mM-100mM) were added to Low motile semen and stored for 24 h at 4{degrees}C, and the quality parameters such as motility, viability, acrosome, and plasma membrane integrity were measured evaluated. Adding ACh in 10mM for the low motile semen significantly increased semen motility from 50% to 78.5% (P<0.05) at time zero, but other ACh concentrations did not have any significant differences compared to control. During two hours incubation of recovered semen at room temperature, 10mM ACh prevented declining semen motility compared to control and other ACh concentrations significantly (P<0.05), which motility in 10mM ACh concentration 59%. In contrast, control, 1mM ACh, and 100M ACh group was 2.5%, 4%, and 1%, respectively. Semen viability after two hours of recovery at room temperature significantly 3.5% was less than the control group (P<0.05), but acrosome and plasma membrane integrity has not had any differences between all experimental groups (P>0.05). We can conclude that 10mM ACh can recover semen motility and not have toxicity and side effects on semen quality.",

    "abstract": "Serratia ureilytica DW2 is a highly efficient phosphate-solubilizing bacterium isolated from Codonopsis pilosula rhizosphere soil that can promote the growth of C. pilosula. However, no validated reference genes from the genus Serratia for use in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) normalization have been reported. To screen stable reference genes in S. ureilytica DW2, the expression of eight candidate reference genes (16S rRNA, ftsZ, ftsA, mreB, recA, slyD, thiC, and zipA) under different treatment conditions (pH, temperature, culture time, and salt content) was assayed by RT-qPCR. The expression stability of these genes was analyzed with different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). To verify the reliability of the data, the most stably expressed reference gene was used to quantify expression of the glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) gene under different soluble phosphate levels. The results showed that the zipA and 16S rRNA genes were the most stable reference genes, and the least stable were thiC and recA. The expression of gdh was consistent with the phosphate solubilization ability on plates containing National Botanical Research Institute phosphate (NBRIP) growth medium. Therefore, this study provides a stable and reliable reference gene for Serratia, which is vital for the accurate quantification of functional gene expression in future studies.",
