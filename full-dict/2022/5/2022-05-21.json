    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo investigate the role of BMP signaling in osteoarthritis' pathogenesis and propose a disease-modifying therapy for OA.\n\nMethodsC57BL6/J mouse line was used to perform ACLT surgery at P120 to study the expression pattern of the BMP signaling readout pSMAD1/5/9. To investigate whether activation of BMP signaling is sufficient and necessary to induce osteoarthritis, we have used conditional GOF and LOF mouse lines in which BMP signaling can be activated or depleted, respectively, upon intra-peritoneal injection of tamoxifen. Finally, we locally inhibited BMP signaling through intra-articular injection of LDN-193189 pre- and post-onset surgically induced OA. Most of the analysis has been done through immunohistochemistry, histopathological staining, and micro-CT to evaluate the status of the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nResultsWe observed concomitant activation of BMP signaling, as judged by pSMAD1/5/9 immunoreactivity in the articular cartilage, upon induction of osteoarthritis with simultaneous depletion of SMURF1, an intra-cellular BMP signaling inhibitor in articular cartilage. Even without surgical induction of osteoarthritis, only BMP gain-of-function mutation induces OA in mouse articular cartilage. Also, genetic, or pharmacological inhibition of BMP signaling offered significant protection against OA pathogenesis. Interestingly, post-onset of the disease, inhibition of BMP signaling by intra-articular injection of LDN-193189 retarded OA progression with a significant reduction in inflammatory markers.\n\nConclusionOur study demonstrated that BMP signaling plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of OA and that local BMP inhibition can be an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Mutation rate plays an important role in adaptive evolution due to its effect on the rate of appearance of both beneficial and deleterious mutations and is therefore subject to second-order selection. The mutation rate varies between and within species and populations, increases under some stresses, and can be modified by mutator and anti-mutator alleles. It may also vary among genetically identical individuals: empirical evidence from bacteria suggests that the mutation rate can be affected by translation errors and expression noise in various proteins. Importantly, this non-genetic variation may be heritable via a transgenerational epigenetic mode of inheritance, giving rise to mutator phenotype switching that is independent from mutator alleles. Here we investigate mathematically how the rate of adaptive evolution on rugged, complex fitness landscapes is affected by the rate of mutation rate phenotype switching. Motivated by recent experimental results of mutation rate variation, we model an asexual population with two mutation rate phenotypes, non-mutator and mutator. An offspring may switch from its parental phenotype to the other phenotype. Thus, the mutation rate can be interpreted as a genetically inherited trait when the switching rate is low, as an epigenetically inherited trait when the switching rate is intermediate, or as a randomly determined trait when the switching rate is high. We find that intermediate switching rates maximize the rate of adaptation on rugged fitness landscapes. This is because an intermediate switching rate can maintain within the same individuals both a mutator phenotype and pre-existing mutations, a combination that facilitates the crossing of fitness valleys. Further, intermediate switching rates allow the population to quickly revert to a low mutation rate after adaptation is achieved, avoiding the accumulation of deleterious mutations linked to mutator alleles. Our results rationalize recently observed noise in the expression of proteins that affect the mutation rate and suggest that non-genetic inheritance of this phenotype may facilitate evolutionary adaptive processes.",

    "abstract": "Reward motivation enhances memory through interactions between mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical systems -- both during and after encoding. Developmental changes in these distributed neural circuits may lead to age-related differences in reward-motivated memory and the underlying neural mechanisms. Converging evidence from cross-species studies suggests that subcortical dopamine signaling is increased during adolescence, which may lead to stronger memory representations of rewarding, relative to mundane, events and changes in the contributions of underlying subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms across age. Here, we used fMRI to examine how reward motivation influences the \"online\" encoding and \"offline\" post-encoding brain mechanisms that support long-term associative memory from childhood to adulthood in human participants of both sexes. We found that reward motivation led to both age-invariant enhancements and nonlinear age-related differences in associative memory after 24 hours. Furthermore, reward-related memory benefits were linked to age-varying neural mechanisms. During encoding, interactions between the prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were associated with better high-reward memory to a greater degree with increasing age. Pre- to post-encoding changes in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and VTA were also associated with better high-reward memory, but more so at younger ages. Our findings suggest that there may be developmental differences in the contributions of offline subcortical and online cortical brain mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memory.\n\nSignificance StatementA substantial body of research has examined the neural mechanisms through which reward influences memory formation in adults. However, despite extensive evidence that both reward processing and associative memory undergo dynamic change across development, few studies have examined age-related changes in these processes. We found both age-invariant and nonlinear age-related differences in reward-motivated memory. Moreover, our findings point to developmental differences in the processes through which reward modulates the prioritization of information in long-term memory - with greater early reliance on offline subcortical consolidation mechanisms and increased contribution of systems-level online encoding circuitry with increasing age. These results highlight dynamic developmental changes in the cognitive and neural mechanisms through which motivationally salient information is prioritized in memory from childhood to adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Psychostimulant exposure alters the activity of ventral pallidum (VP) projection-neurons. However, the molecular underpinnings of these circuit dysfunctions are unclear. We used RNA- sequencing to reveal alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the VP that are induced by cocaine self-administration in mice. We then probed gene expression in select VP neuronal subpopulations to isolate a circuit associated with cocaine intake. Finally, we used both overexpression and CRISPR-mediated knockdown to test the role of a gene target on cocaine- mediated behaviors as well as dendritic spine density. Our results showed that a large proportion (55%) of genes associated with structural plasticity were changed 24 hours following cocaine intake. Among them, the transcription factor Nr4a1 (Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1, or Nur77) showed high expression levels. We found that the VP to mediodorsal thalamus (VP[-&gt;]MDT) projection neurons specifically were recapitulating this increase in Nr4a1 expression. Overexpressing Nr4a1 in VP[-&gt;]MDT neurons enhanced drug-seeking and drug- induced reinstatement, while Nr4a1 knock down prevented self-administration acquisition and subsequent cocaine-mediated behaviors. Moreover, we showed that Nr4a1 negatively regulated spine dynamics in this specific cell subpopulation. Together, our study identifies for the first time the transcriptional mechanisms occurring in VP in drug exposure. Our study provides further understanding on the role of Nr4a1 in cocaine-related behaviors and identifies the crucial role of the VP[-&gt;]MDT circuit in drug intake and relapse-like behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death of epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of of death in patients with epilepsy. Due to the complicated pathogenesis of SUDEP, however, the exact mechanism of SUDEP remains elusive. Currently, although it is recognized that the seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) may be a main cause for SUDEP, other factors resulting in SUDEP can not be excluded e.g arrhythmias. Our previous findings indicated that the incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP evoked by acoustic stimulation or pentetrazol (PTZ) injection was significantly reduced by atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), suggesting that noradrenergic neurotransmission modulates S-IRA and SUDEP. Given that norepinephrine acts on the target to modulate respiratory and circulation function by targeting adrenergic receptor  and beta (a-AR and {beta}-AR) and the arrhythmias can be contributed to SUDEP. Meanwhile, to further test whether cardiac factors are implicated in S-IRA and SUDEP, we choose esmolol hydrochloride, a selective antagonist of {beta}1-AR to test it in our models. Our findings demonstrated that the lower incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP evoked by acoustic stimulation or PTZ injection in DBA/1 mice by administration with atomoxetine was significantly reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) of esmolol hydrochloride. Importantly, the data of electrocardiogram (ECG) showed that the cardiac arrhythmia including the ventricular tachycardia, ventricular premature beat and atrioventricular block can be evoked by acoustic stimulation or PTZ injection in our model. Administration of atomoxetine significantly reduced these arrhythmias and the incidence of S-IRA and SUDEP in our models. However, administration of esmolol hydrochloride with the dose without affecting ECG and mortality changing of DBA/1 significantly blocking the protective effects of atomoxetine on S-IRA and SUDEP in our models. Thus, the dysfunction of respiratory and circulation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of S-IRA and SUDEP. Enhancing the central norepinephrinergic neurotransmission in the brain contributes to inhibition of seizure-induced respiratory arrest by targeting {beta}1-AR locating in the cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the suppression effects of S-IRA by atomoxetine was significantly reversed by the norepinephrine neuronal degradation in the LC in our models. Furthermore, PTZ-induced Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of norepinephrine, activity but not TH content from the serum of left ventricle and the whole heart tissue was reduced following the S-IRA. Our findings will show a new light on decoding the pathogenesis of SUDEP concerning the pathway between the LC and heart.",

    "abstract": "In multi-echo fMRI (ME-fMRI), two metrics have been widely used to measure the performance of various acquisition and analysis approaches. These are temporal SNR (tSNR) and differential contrast-to-noise ratio (dCNR). A key step in ME-fMRI is the weighted combination of the data from multiple echoes, and prior work has examined the dependence of tSNR and dCNR on the choice of weights. However, most studies have focused on only one of these two metrics, and the relationship between the two metrics has not been examined. In this work, we present a geometric view that offers greater insight into the relation between the two metrics and their weight dependence. We identify three major regimes: (1) a tSNR robust regime in which tSNR is robust to the weight selection with most weight variants achieving close to optimal performance, whereas dCNR shows a pronounced dependence on the weights with most variants achieving suboptimal performance; (2) a dCNR robust regime in which dCNR is robust to the weight selection with most weight variants achieving close to optimal performance, while tSNR exhibits a strong dependence on the weights with most variants achieving significantly lower than optimal performance; and (3) a within-type robust regime in which both tSNR and dCNR achieve nearly optimal performance when the form of the weights are variants of their respective optimal weights and exhibit a moderate decrease in performance for other weight variants. Insight into the behavior observed in the different regimes is gained by considering spherical representations of the weight dependence of the components used to form each metric. For multi-echo acquisitions, dCNR is shown to be more directly related than tSNR to measures of CNR and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both task-based and resting-state fMRI scans, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Structural plasticity in the brain often necessitates dramatic remodeling of neuronal processes and attendant reorganization of the cytoskeleton and membranes. While cytoskeletal restructuring has been studied extensively, how lipids might orchestrate structural plasticity remains unclear. We show that specific glial cells in Drosophila produce Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) to locally catabolize sphingolipids. Sphingolipid accumulation drives lysosomal dysfunction, causing gba1b mutants to harbor protein aggregates that cycle across circadian time and are regulated by neural activity, the circadian clock, and sleep. While the vast majority of membrane lipids are stable across the day, a specific subset, highly enriched in sphingolipids, cycles daily in a gba1b-dependant fashion. In parallel, circadian clock neurons remodel their neurites, growing and shrinking across the day to shape circadian behavior. Remarkably, this neuronal remodeling relies on a cycle of temporally offset sphingolipid biosynthesis and catabolism. Thus, dynamic sphingolipid regulation by glia enables diurnal circuit remodeling and proper circadian behavior.",

These methods are increasingly being applied to understand how cancer cells and immune response change during tumor development, progression, and metastasis, as well as following treatment. Yet, existing analysis approaches focus on investigating small tissue samples on a per-cell basis, not taking into account the spatial proximity of cells, which indicates cell-cell interaction and specific biological processes in the larger cancer microenvironment. We present Visinity, a scalable visual analytics system to analyze cell interaction patterns across cohorts of whole-slide multiplexed tissue images. Our approach is based on a fast regional neighborhood computation, leveraging unsupervised learning to quantify, compare, and group cells by their surrounding cellular neighborhood. These neighborhoods can be visually analyzed in an exploratory and confirmatory workflow. Users can explore spatial patterns present across tissues through a scalable image viewer and coordinated views highlighting the neighborhood composition and spatial arrangements of cells. To verify or refine existing hypotheses, users can query for specific patterns to determine their presence and statistical significance. Findings can be interactively annotated, ranked, and compared in the form of small multiples. In two case studies with biomedical experts, we demonstrate that Visinity can identify common biological processes within a human tonsil and uncover novel white-blood cell networks and immune-tumor interactions.",

Our Africa-led South-North plant genome collaboration produced a high-quality chromosomescale assembly of the lablab genome - the first chromosome-scale plant genome assembly locally sequenced in Africa. We also re-sequenced cultivated and wild accessions of lablab from Africa confirming two domestication events and examined the genetic diversity in lablab germplasm conserved in Africa. Our approach provides a valuable resource for lablab improvement and also presents a model that could be explored by other researchers sequencing indigenous crops particularly from Low and middle income countries (LMIC).",

They play an important role in the global methane cycle and have great potential as industrial platforms for the bioconversion of methane from industrial waste streams into valuable products, such as biofuels and bioplastics. However, many aspects of methanotroph biology have yet to be elucidated, including the prevalence and impact of lysogenized bacteriophages (phages), which can greatly affect both the ecology and the industrial performance of these bacteria.\n\nThe present study investigates the presence of putative prophages in three gammaproteobacterial (Methylobacter marinus A45, Methylomicrobium album BG8, Methylomonas denitrificans FJG1) and two alphaproteobacterial (Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Methylocystis sp.

Mitomycin C was used to trigger induction of prophages, which was monitored through infection dynamics. Successfully induced phages from M. marinus A45 (MirA1, MirA2), M. album BG8 (MirB1), and M. trichosporium OB3b (MirO1) were isolated and characterized using transmission electron microscopy. Subsequently, bioinformatic analyses (BLAST and phylogenetics) were performed on three induced phages to obtain a profile of their respective genetic makeup. Their broad diversity and differences from previously known phages, based on whole genome and structural gene sequences, suggest they each represent a new phage family, genus and species: \"Britesideviridae Inducovirus miraone\", \"Patronusviridae Enigmavirus miratwo\", and \"Kainiviridae Tripudiumvirus miroone\" represented by isolates MirA1, MirA2, and MirO1, respectively.",

Here, we determine the limits of prediction using metabarcoding data of both fungal and bacterial assemblages that occur within (endophytes) and without (epiphytes) leaves from 59 plant taxa. We built random forest models for prevalent taxa and quantified the combined predictive power of 24 plant traits, 12 abiotic conditions and 7 additional features. As response variables, we considered microbial relative and absolute abundances, and occurrences. Most microbial taxa were too rare to effectively model, but model performance was generally poor even for the most prevalent and abundant taxa (model R2 was typically <0.1). Fungi were more tractable for modeling than bacteria. Models of Shannons diversity were moderately successful but those for richness were not. Taxa responded idiosyncratically and non-linearly to variation in the foliar habitat. When prevalent microbes were included as features in models, performance improved. Our results suggest that easily measurable aspects of the phyllosphere habitat are poor predictors of microbiome composition.

Here, we show that the increased pulsatile flow resulting from the structural abnormalities and increased stiffness of conduit arteries in Fbln4E57K/E57K mice leads to increased shear stress, a highly oxidative environment, and endothelial dysfunction related to reduced nitric oxide bioavailability in resistance mesenteric arteries. These data have significant implications, not only for the basic biology of ECM assembly along the arterial tree, but also for the clinical consequences of large artery stiffness on the microcirculation.",

The sequential concentrations of metals analyzed were Zn> Se> Cu> As> Pb; while Cd and Hg concentrations were below the limits of detection (0.01 {micro}g g-1). No significant differences were observed between the concentrations of metals (p> 0.05) by year, except Se levels, possibly resulting from recorded seasonal differences in turtle size. No relationships among turtle size vs metal concentration were observed. In conclusion, heavy metals concentrations in the blood of nesting Kemps ridley turtles may be a reflex of the ecosystem in which the turtles develop, that is, with low bioavailability of metals observed in the trophic webs in the Gulf of Mexico.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellar cortex plays a key role in generating predictive sensorimotor associations. To do so, the granule cell layer is thought to establish unique sensorimotor representations for learning. However, how this is achieved and how granule cell population responses contribute to behavior have remained unclear. To address these questions, we have used in vivo calcium imaging and granule cell-specific pharmacological manipulation of synaptic inhibition in awake, behaving mice. We find that inhibition sparsens and thresholds sensory responses, limiting overlap between sensory ensembles and preventing spiking in many granule cells that receive excitatory input. Moreover, we find that inhibition can be recruited in a stimulus-specific manner to powerfully decorrelate multisensory ensembles. Consistent with these results, we find that granule cell inhibition is required for sensory discrimination in a cerebellum-dependent behavior. These data thus reveal new mechanisms for granule cell layer pattern separation beyond those envisioned by classical models.",

    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small brainstem nucleus that is the primary source of noradrenaline (NA) throughout the vertebrate brain. Understanding the anatomical organization of the LC is important because NA plays a central role in regulating arousal, attention, and performance. In the mammalian brain, individual LC neurons make highly divergent axonal projections to different brain regions, which are distinguished in part by which NA receptor subtypes they express. Here we sought to determine whether similar organizational features - divergent LC projections acting regionally through different receptor subtypes - characterize cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry important to birdsong learning and performance. Single and dual retrograde tracer injections reveal that single LC-NA neurons make divergent projections to both cortical and basal ganglia components of this circuit, as well as to dopaminergic nuclei that innervate this circuit. Moreover, in situ hybridization revealed that differential expression of the 2A and 2C adrenoreceptor distinguish LC-recipient song nuclei. Therefore, LC - NA signaling in the songbird CBG circuit could employ a similar strategy as in mammals, which allows a relatively small number of LC neurons to exert widespread yet distinct effects across multiple brain regions.\n\nKey PointsO_LIThe locus coeruleus projects to most of the song system (HVC, RA, LMAN, Area X, DLM).\nC_LIO_LINoradrenergic receptors are regionally specialized in BG despite divergent connectivity of LC neurons.\nC_LIO_LINoradrenergic projections to dopaminergic nuclei could influence vocal variability and learning.\nC_LI",

Diencephalon and brainstem neural circuits have been shown to control the production of USVs, however, the role of cortical circuits in this process is debatable. We show that male mice produced USVs following intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in a specific location of their anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, ACC Ca2+-imaging showed an increase in Ca2+ dynamics preceding USV initiation. Optogenetically suppressing ACC activity caused mice to emit fewer USVs during courtship. Neuropixel electrophysiological recordings in head-restrained male mice indicated a differential increase in neural activity in response to female social exposure (SE). The firing rate in SE trials where USVs were emitted was significantly higher when compared to SE leading to silence. Taken together, these results indicate that the ACC is a key node in the neuronal circuits controlling USV production.",

Using a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we show that hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) constitute a transplantable, long-term reservoir for macrophages that exhibit features of TI, including increased Mycobacterium avium killing, inflammatory cytokine production, and augmented capacity to co-stimulate naive T cells. Strikingly, hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from these HSC exhibit unique molecular features characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility and transcription of metabolic genes, accompanied by reduced glycolysis and central carbon metabolism. Altogether, our data identify HSC as a functional unit of TI in chronic AD, establish increased T-cell costimulatory activity as a potentially pathogenic feature of TI in this setting, and show that macrophages inherit reduced metabolic activity from AD-exposed HSC, suggesting metabolic activation and TI can be decoupled. Our findings thus implicate HSC as a long-term reservoir for TI that could contribute to AD.",

    "abstract": "A change to a populations social network is a change to the substrate of cultural transmission, affecting behavioral diversity and adaptive cultural evolution. While features of network structure such as population size and density have been well studied, less is understood about the influence of social processes such as population turnover-- or the repeated replacement of individuals. Experimental data has led to the hypothesis that naive learners can drive cultural evolution by being better samplers, although this hypothesis has only been expressed verbally. We conduct a formal exploration of this hypothesis using a generative model that concurrently simulates its two key ingredients: social transmission and reinforcement learning. We explore how variation in turnover influences changes in the distributions of cultural behaviors over long and short time-scales. We simulate competition between a high and low reward behavior, while varying turnover magnitude and tempo. We find optimal turnover regimes that amplify the production of higher reward behaviors. We also find that these optimal regimes result in a new population composition, where fewer agents which know both behaviors, and more agents know only the high reward behavior. These two effects depend on network size, density, behavioral transmissibility, and characteristics of the learners. Our model provides formal theoretical support for, and predictions about, the hypothesis that naive learners can shape cultural change through their enhanced sampling ability, identified by previous experimental studies. By moving from experimental data to theory, we illuminate an under-discussed generative process arising from an interaction between social dynamics and learning that can lead to changes in cultural behavior.",

While anatomical studies have suggested the presence of cerebellar projections to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the nature and function of these connections (Cb-SNc) is unknown. Here we show that the Cb-SNc form monosynaptic glutamatergic synapses with both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. Optogenetic activation Cb-SNc axons in the SNc rapidly increases SNc activity, elevates striatal dopamine levels, and increases the probability of locomotion. During ongoing behavior, Cb-SNc axons are bilaterally activated prior to ambulation and unilateral lever manipulation. The Cb-SNc axons show prominent activation to water reward, and higher activation for sweet water, suggesting that the pathway also encodes reward value. Thus, the cerebellum directly, rapidly, and effectively modulates basal ganglia dopamine levels and conveys information related to movement initiation, vigor, and possibly reward processing.",

    "abstract": "Although similar developmental regulatory networks can produce diverse phenotypes, different networks can also produce the same phenotype. In theory, as long as development can produce an acceptable end phenotype, the details of the process could be shielded from selection, leading to the possibility of developmental system drift, where the developmental mechanisms underlying a stable phenotype continue to evolve. Many examples exist of divergent developmental genetics underlying conserved traits. However, studies that elucidate how these differences arose and how other features of development accommodated them are rarer. In Caenorhabditis elegans, six GATA-type transcription factors (GATA factors) comprise the zygotic part of the endoderm specification network. Here we show that the core of this network - five of the genes - originated within the genus during a brief but explosive radiation of this gene family and that at least three of them evolved from a single ancestral gene with at least two different spatio-temporal expression patterns. Based on analyses of their evolutionary history, gene structure, expression, and sequence, we explain how these GATA factors were integrated into this network. Our results show how gene duplication fueled the developmental system drift of the endoderm network in a phylogenetically brief period in developmentally canalized worms.",

    "abstract": "Patients with epilepsy develop reproductive endocrine comorbidities at a rate higher than that of the general population. Clinical studies have identified disrupted luteinizing hormone (LH) release patterns in patients of both sexes, suggesting potential epilepsy-associated changes in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron function. In previous work, we found that GnRH neuron firing is increased in diestrous females and males in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Notably, GABAA receptor activation is depolarizing in adult GnRH neurons. Therefore, here we tested the hypothesis that increased GnRH neuron firing in IHKA mice is associated with increased GABAergic drive to GnRH neurons. When ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) were blocked to isolate GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs), no differences in PSC frequency were seen between GnRH neurons from control and IHKA diestrous females. In the absence of iGluR blockade, however, GABA PSC frequency was increased in GnRH neurons from IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles, but not saline-injected controls nor IHKA females without estrous cycle disruption. GABA PSC amplitude was also increased in IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles. These findings suggest the presence of an iGluR-dependent increase in feed-forward GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons specific to IHKA females with comorbid cycle disruption. In males, GABA PSC frequency and amplitude were unchanged but PSC duration was reduced. Together, these findings suggest that increased GABA transmission helps drive elevated firing in IHKA females on diestrus and indicate the presence of a sex-specific hypothalamic mechanism underlying reproductive endocrine dysfunction in IHKA mice.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIncreased GABA transmission to GnRH neurons in IHKA mouse model of epilepsy\nC_LIO_LIIncreased GABA transmission is dependent on upstream glutamate signaling\nC_LIO_LIIncreased GABA transmission only seen in females with disrupted estrous cycles\nC_LIO_LIPotential sex-specific mechanism for reproductive endocrine dysfunction in epilepsy\nC_LI",

Diet, in particular the microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fiber, is one of the most powerful ways to affect the composition and metabolic output of the gut microbiome. As such, diet is a powerful tool for understanding the biology of C. difficile and for developing alternative approaches for coping with this pathogen. One prominent class of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome are short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic end products of MAC metabolism. SCFAs are known decrease the fitness of C. difficile in vitro and that high intestinal SCFA concentrations are associated with reduced fitness of C. difficile in animal models of C. difficile infection (CDI). Here, we use controlled dietary conditions (8 diets that differ only by MAC composition) to show that C. difficile fitness is most consistently impacted by butyrate, rather than the other two prominent SCFAs (acetate and propionate), during murine model CDI. We similarly show that butyrate concentrations are lower in fecal samples from humans with CDI relative to healthy controls. Finally, we demonstrate that butyrate impacts growth in diverse C. difficile isolates. These findings provide a foundation for future work which will dissect how butyrate directly impacts C. difficile fitness and will lead to the development of diverse approaches distinct from antibiotics or fecal transplant, such as dietary interventions, for mitigating CDI in at-risk human populations.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea in humans and it imposes a tremendous burden on the healthcare system. Current treatments for C. difficile infection (CDI) include antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, which contribute to recurrent CDIs and face major regulatory hurdles, respectively. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to develop new ways to cope with CDI. Notably, a disrupted \"dysbiotic\" gut microbiota is the primary risk factor for CDI but we incompletely understand how a healthy microbiota resists CDI. Here, we show that a specific molecule produced by the gut microbiota, butyrate, is negatively associated with C. difficile burdens in humans and in a mouse model of CDI and that butyrate impedes the growth of diverse C. difficile strains in pure culture. These findings help to build a foundation for designing alternative, possibly diet-based, strategies for mitigating CDI in humans.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that oxidative stress causes the hydroxylation of guanine (G) to generate 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro guanosine (8OH-G) in microRNAs (miRs), which induces the guanine-to-uracil (G-to-U) transversion and thus changes the miR targetomes. However, whether and how the 8OH-G-modified miRs are involved in vascular endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis were unexplored. Using 8OH-G crosslinking immunoprecipitation miR sequencing (8OH-G CLIP-miR-seq), we found that 8OH-G miR-483 were among the most enriched 8OH-G miR species in ECs induced by ox-LDL. Transcriptomic profiling by RNA-seq indicated that the G-to-U transversion of miR-483 altered the original mRNA targeting efficacy and allows 8OH-G miR-483 to recognize new mRNA target sites. A reduced ratio of 8OH-G miR-483 to miR-483 in lung ECs was found in the endothelial-specific miR-483 transgenic (EC-miR-483 Tg) mice. Moreover, reduction of atherosclerosis was significant in EC-miR-483 Tg mice administrated AAV8-PCSK9 and fed an atherogenic diet. In situ miR hybridization revealed an increased 8OH-G miR-483 level in the intima of human atherosclerotic arteries. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the redox burden incurred by cardiovascular risk factors is a culprit of the miR-483 to 8OH-G miR-483 transversion. Such epitranscriptomic modification of miR-483 causes endothelial dysfunction and increases atherosclerosis susceptibility via its targetomes shift.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres are known to cluster around nucleoli in drosophila and mammalian cells. However, the functional significance of nucleoli-centromere interaction remains underexplored. We hypothesize that if this conserved interaction is functionally important, it should be dynamic under different physiological and pathological conditions. We examined the nucleolar structure and centromeres at various differentiation stages using cell culture models. The results show dynamic changes of nucleolar number, area, and nucleoli-centromere interactions at differentiation stages and in cancer cells. Embryonic stem cells usually have a single large nucleolus, which associates with a high percentage of centromeres. As cells differentiate into intermediate states, the nucleolar number increases and the association with centromeres decreases. In terminally differentiated cells, including myotubes, neurons and keratinocytes, the number of nucleoli and their association with centromeres are at the lowest. Cancer cells demonstrate the pattern of nucleoli number and nucleoli-centromere association that is akin to proliferative less differentiated cell types, suggesting that nucleolar reorganization and changes in nucleoli-centromere interactions may help facilitate malignant transformation. This idea is supported in a case of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, in which induced differentiation inhibits cell proliferation and reduces nucleolar number and centromere association. These findings suggest active roles of nucleolar structure in centromere function and genome organization critical for cellular function in both normal development and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity monitoring in conservation projects is essential to understand environmental status and recovery. However, traditional field surveys can be expensive, time-consuming, biased towards visual detection, and focused on measuring a limited set of taxa. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods provide a new approach to biodiversity monitoring that has the potential to sample a taxonomically broader set of organisms with similar effort, but many of these approaches are still in the early stages of development and testing. Here, we use multilocus eDNA metabarcoding to understand how the removal of invasive red swamp crayfish impacts local biodiversity of a desert oasis ecosystem, as well as to detect crayfish both directly and indirectly. We tracked crayfish DNA signatures, microbial DNA associated with crayfish, and biodiversity of plant, fungal, animal, and bacterial communities through time. We were unsuccessful in detecting crayfish directly in either control tanks or oases using targeted metabarcoding primers for invertebrates and eukaryotes, similar to previous studies which have shown variable levels of success in detecting crayfish from environmental samples. However, we were successful in discerning a suite of 90 crayfish-associated taxa to serve as candidate bioindicators of invasive presence using 16S and Fungal ITS2 metabarcoding. Ranking these 90 taxa by their geographic distribution in eDNA surveys and by evidence of crayfish-associations in the literature, we support 9 taxa to be high-ranking, and suggest they be prioritized in future biomonitoring. Biodiversity analyses from five metabarcode loci including plants, animals, and both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes showed that communities differed but that species richness remained relatively similar between oases through time. Our results reveal that, while there are limitations of eDNA approaches to detect crayfish and other invasive species, microbial bioindicators offer a largely untapped biomonitoring opportunity for invasive species management, adding a valuable resource to a conservation managers toolkit.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors are defined by their DNA-binding domains (DBDs). The binding affinities and specificities of a transcription factor to its DNA binding sites can be used by an organism to fine-tune gene regulation and so are targets for evolution. Here we investigate the evolution of GATA-type transcription factors (GATA factors) in the Caenorhabditis genus. Based upon comparisons of their DBDs, these proteins form 13 distinct groups. This protein family experienced a burst of gene duplication in several of these groups along two short branches in the species tree, giving rise to subclades with very distinct complements of GATA factors. By comparing extant gene structures, DBD sequences, genome locations, and selection pressures we reconstructed how these duplications occurred. Although the paralogs have diverged in various ways, the literature shows that at least eight of the DBD groups bind to similar G-A-T-A DNA sequences. Thus, despite gene duplications and divergence among DBD sequences, most Caenorhabditis GATA factors appear to have maintained similar binding preferences, which could create the opportunity for developmental system drift. We hypothesize that this limited divergence in binding specificities contributes to the apparent disconnect between the extensive genomic evolution that has occurred in this genus and the absence of significant anatomical changes.",

    "abstract": "Social motivation is critical to the development of healthy social functioning. Autism spectrum condition (ASC) is characterized in part by challenges with social communication and social interaction. The root of these challenges is hypothesized to be a deficit in social motivation, specifically in one or more subcomponents (e.g. social reward reward seeking or social orienting). Current social behavior assays lack the ability to quantitatively measure both social reward seeking and social orienting simultaneously. We have developed an automated socially-rewarded operant conditioning task coupled with video tracking, to quantify effort to achieve access to a social partner and concurrent social orienting behavior in mice. We established that adult wildtype mice will work for access to a social partner, that male mice exhibit greater social motivation compared to females, and there is high test-retest reliability in the task across multiple days. We then benchmarked the method with two test-case manipulations. We first tested a mouse model of Phelan-McDermid syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with ASC. These Shank3B mutants failed to show social reward seeking and exhibited reduced social orienting. Next, we demonstrated that oxytocin receptor antagonism decreased social motivation in wildtype mice, consistent with its role in social reward circuitry. Intriguingly, only male mice were vulnerable to Shank3B mutation, while females were more vulnerable to oxytocin blockade, a double dissociation suggesting separate circuits for social motivation in male and female brain. Overall, we believe this method provides a valuable addition to the assessment of social phenotypes in rodent models of ASC and the mapping of potentially sex-specific social motivation circuits in the brain.",

However, expanding their application hinges on the discovery of next generation LNPs with high potency, cyto-specific targeting, and low side effects. Overcoming the difficulty of releasing cargo from endocytosed LNPs remains a significant hurdle. The endosomal escape of viral and non-viral nanoparticles relies on the topological transformation of membrane fusion pore formation followed by RNA translocation into the cytosol. In this study we show that LNP-RNA nanostructure modulates the energetic cost of LNP fusion with a target membrane. The inclusion of a new class of structurally-active lipids leads to superior LNP endosomal fusion, fast evasion of endosomal entrapment, and efficacious RNA delivery. Specifically, bicontinuous cubic RNA-LNPs, cuboplexes, have significantly higher endosomal escape rates and deliver more RNA compared to regular lamellar LNPs.",

Accordingly, the mechanical properties of membranes should play an important role in modulating force transmission to embedded channels, yet this relationship remains unknown for a wide class of mechanosensitive channels across prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Here, we use a synthetic amphiphile to modulate the membrane mechanical properties of cell-derived vesicles. Using precise membrane mechanical characterization techniques that have rarely been used in conjunction with electrophysiology techniques, we uncover two key membrane properties that affect the activation of E. coli mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). Our study reveals that decreases in the membrane area expansion modulus, KA, and bending rigidity, kc, lead to increases in the pressure required to activate MscL and that this effect is reproducible with the mammalian channel, TREK-1. Together, our results bolster the force-from-lipids mechanism by demonstrating that changes in membrane mechanical properties, induced through distinct membrane amphiphiles, similarly impact the gating force of MscL and TREK-1. In addition, our results reveal the capacity of membrane amphiphiles to alter the activity and sensitivity of mechanosensitive channels through changes in long-range force transmission.",

They regulate cell signaling events upon binding to active G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and trigger endocytosis of active GPCRs. While many of the functional sites on arrestins have been characterized, the question of how these sites interact is unanswered. We used anisotropic network modelling (ANM) together with our covariance compliment techniques to survey all of the available structures of the non-visual arrestins to map how structural changes and protein-binding affect their structural dynamics. We found that activation and clathrin binding have a marked effect on arrestin dynamics, and that these dynamics changes are localized to a small number of distant functional sites. These sites include -helix 1, the lariat loop, nuclear localization domain, and the C-domain {beta}-sheets on the C-loop side. Our techniques suggest that clathrin binding and/or GPCR activation of arrestin perturb the dynamics of these sites independent of structural changes.",

A quantitative understanding of morphogenetic noise control, and how it changes under different growth conditions, would provide better insights into cell-to-cell variability and intergenerational fluctuations in cell physiology. Using multigenerational growth and width data of single Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus cells, we deduce the equations governing growth and size dynamics of rod-like bacterial cells. Interestingly, we find that both E. coli and C. crescentus cells deviate from exponential growth within the cell cycle. In particular, the exponential growth rate increases during the cell cycle, irrespective of nutrient or temperature conditions. We propose a mechanistic model that explains the emergence of super-exponential growth from autocatalytic production of ribosomes, coupled to the rate of cell elongation and surface area synthesis. Using this new model and statistical inference on large datasets, we construct the Langevin equations governing cell size and size dynamics of E. coli cells in different growth conditions. The single-cell level model predicts how noise in intragenerational and intergenerational processes regulate variability in cell morphology and generation times, revealing quantitative strategies for cellular resource allocation and morphogenetic noise control in different growth conditions.",

To understand the mechanism of TFR in patients with CML, we consider the competition between leukemia stem cell and bone marrow microenvironment, and develop a mathematical model to investigate the CML progression dynamics. Model simulations are consistent with clinical observation of CML progression, and reveal a mechanism of dimorphic response after TKI discontinuation. Our model predicts that neoplasitic microenvironment is significant for CML occurrence and progression. We furthermore discuss the prediction of TFR based on the change rates of microenvironment index and leukemia stem cells ratio prior TKI discontinuation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionE-cigarette vaping has become a major portion of nicotine consumption, especially for children and young adults. Although it is branded as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking, murine and rat models of sub-acute and chronic e-cigarette vaping exposure have shown many pro-inflammatory changes in the respiratory tract. An acute vaping exposure paradigm has not been demonstrated in the golden Syrian hamster, and the hamster is a readily available small animal model that has the unique benefit of becoming infected with and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 without genetic alteration to the animal or virus.\n\nMethodsUsing a two-day, whole-body vaping exposure protocol in male golden Syrian hamsters, we evaluated serum cotinine, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, lung and nasal histopathology, and gene expression in the nasopharynx and lung through RT-qPCR. Depending on the presence of nonnormality or outliers, statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests. For tests that were statistically significant (p-value <0.05), post-hoc Tukey-Kramer and Dunns tests, respectively, were performed to make pairwise comparisons between groups.\n\nResultsIn nasal tissue, RT-qPCR analysis revealed nicotine-dependent increases in genes associated with type 1 inflammation (CCL-5 and CXCL-10), fibrosis (TGF-{beta}), and a nicotine-independent decrease in the vasculogenesis/angiogenesis gene VEGF-A. In the lung, nicotine-dependent increases in the expression of genes involved in the renin-angiotensin pathway (ACE, ACE2), coagulation (tissue factor, Serpine-1), extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP-2, MMP-9), type 1 inflammation (IL-1{beta}, TNF-, and CXCL-10), fibrosis (TGF-{beta} and Serpine-1), oxidative stress response (SOD-2), neutrophil extracellular traps release (ELANE), and vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (VEGF-A) were identified.\n\nConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the Syrian hamster is a viable model of e-cig induced inhalational injury. In addition, this is the first report that e-cig vaping with nicotine can increase tissue factor gene expression in the lung. Our results show that even an acute exposure to e-cigarette vaping causes significant upregulation in the respiratory tract of pathways involving the renin-angiotensin system, coagulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, type 1 inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress response, NETosis, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Engineering synthetic heterotrophy (i.e., growth on non-native substrates) is key to the efficient bio-based valorization of renewable and waste substrates. Among these, engineering hemicellulosic pentose utilization has been well-explored in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) over several decades - yet the answer to what makes their utilization inherently recalcitrant remains elusive. Through implementation of a semi-synthetic regulon, we find that harmonizing cellular and engineering objectives are key to obtaining highest growth rates and yields with minimal metabolic engineering effort. Concurrently, results indicate that \"extrinsic\" factors - specifically, upstream genes that direct flux of pentoses into central carbon metabolism - are rate-limiting. We also reveal that yeast metabolism is innately highly adaptable to rapid growth on non-native substrates and that systems metabolic engineering (i.e., flux balancing, directed evolution, functional genomics, and network modeling) is largely unnecessary. We posit that the need for extensive engineering espoused by prior works is a consequence of unfortunate (albeit avoidable) antagonism between engineering and cellular objectives. We also found that deletion of endogenous genes to promote growth demonstrate inconsistent outcomes that are genetic-context- and condition-dependent. For the most part, these knockouts also lead to deleterious pleiotropic effects that decrease the robustness of strains against inhibitors and stressors associated with bioprocessing. Thus, at best, perturbation of \"intrinsic\" factors (e.g., native metabolic, regulatory genes) results in incremental and inconsistent benefits. At worst, they are detrimental. Overall, this work provides insight into the limitations and pitfalls to realizing efficient synthetic heterotrophy using traditional/systems metabolic engineering approaches, demonstrates the innate adaptability of yeast for metabolism of non-native substrates, and provides an alternate, novel, holistic (and yet minimalistic) approach based on integrating non-native metabolic genes with a native regulon system.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus thuringiensis or Bt is a Gram-positive soil bacterium, widely and safely applied in the environment as an insecticide for combatting insect pests that damage crops and vector diseases. Dominant active ingredients made by Bt are insect-killing crystal (Cry) proteins released as crystalline inclusions upon bacterial sporulation. Some Bt Cry proteins, e.g., Cry5B, target nematodes (roundworms) and show exceptional promise as anthelmintics (cures for parasitic nematode diseases). We have recently described IBaCC (for Inactivated Bacteria with Cytosolic Crystal(s)) in which bioactive Bt Cry crystals (containing Cry5B) are fully contained within the cytosol of dead bacterial ghosts. Here we demonstrate that these IBaCC-trapped Cry5B crystals can be liberated and purified away from cellular constituents yielding Purified Cytosolic Crystals (PCC). Cry5B PCC contains [~]95% Cry5B protein out of the total protein content. Cry5B PCC is highly bioactive against parasitic nematode larvae and adults in vitro. Cry5B PCC is also highly active in vivo against experimental human hookworm and Ascaris infections in rodents. The process was scaled up to the 100 liter scale to produce PCC for a pilot study to treat two foals infected with the Ascarid, Parascaris spp. Single dose Cry5B PCC brought the fecal egg counts of both foals to zero. These studies describe the process for the scalable production of purified Bt crystals and define a new active pharmaceutical ingredient form of Bt Cry proteins.\n\nNON-TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE PARAGRAPHBacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins are widely and safely used as insecticides. Recent studies show they also can cure gastrointestinal parasitic worm (nematode) infections when ingested. However, reproducible, scalable, and practical techniques for purifying these proteins have been lacking. Here, we address this severe limitation and present scalable and practical methods for large-scale purification of potently bioactive B. thuringiensis crystals and crystal proteins. The resultant product, called Purified Cytosolic Crystals (PCC), is highly compatible with ingestible drug delivery and formulation. Furthermore, there are growing applications in agriculture and insect control where access to large quantities of purified crystal proteins are desirable and where these methods will find great utility.",

    "abstract": "The phylum \"Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeota\" is a representative halophilic lineage within DPANN superphylum. They are characterized by their nanosized cells and symbiotic lifestyle with Halobacteria. However, the development of the symbiosis remains unclear for the lack of genomes located at the transition stage. Here, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of \"Ca. Nanohaloarchaeota\". We propose a novel family \"Candidatus Nanoanaerosalinaceae\" represented by five de-replicated metagenome-assembled genomes obtained from hypersaline sediments and the enrichment cultures of soda-saline lakes. Phylogeny analysis reveals that the novel family are placed at the root of the family \"Candidatus Nanosalinaceae\" including the well-researched taxa. Most members of \"Ca. Nanoanaerosalinaceae\" contain lower proportion of putative horizontal gene transfers from Halobacteria than \"Ca. Nanosalinaceae\", while they maintain moderately acidic proteomes for hypersaline adaptation of \"salt-in\" strategy, suggesting that \"Ca. Nanoanaerosalinaceae\" have not established an intimate association with Halobacteria, and may descend from an intermediate stage. Functional prediction discloses that they exhibit divergent potentials in carbohydrate and organic acids metabolism, and environmental responses. Historical events reconstruction illustrates that the involved genes acquired at the putative ancestors possibly drive the evolutionary and symbiotic divergences. Globally, this research on the new family \"Ca. Nanoanaerosalinaceae\" enriches the taxonomic and functional diversity of \"Ca. Nanohaloarchaeota\", and provides insights into the evolutionary process of \"Ca. Nanohaloarchaeota\" and their Halobacteria-associated symbiosis.\n\nImportanceDPANN superphylum is a group of archaea widely distributing in various habitats. They generally have small cells, and perform a symbiotic lifestyle with other archaea. The archaeal symbiotic interaction is important to understand microbial community. However, the formation and evolution of the symbiosis between the DPANN lineages and other diverse archaea remain unclear. Based on phylogeny, hypersaline adaptation, functional potentials, and historical events of \"Ca. Nanohaloarchaeota\", a representative phylum within the DPANN superphylum, we report a novel family descending from an intermediate stage, and we illustrate the evolutionary process of \"Ca. Nanohaloarchaeota\" and their Halobacteria-associated symbiosis. Furthermore, we find the acquired genes involved in carbohydrate and organic acids metabolism and environmental responses possibly drive the evolutionary and symbiotic divergences. Altogether, this research helps in understanding the evolution of the archaeal symbiosis, and provides a model for the evolution of the other DPANN lineages.",

    "abstract": "The U2AF Homology Motif Kinase 1 (UHMK1) is the only kinase that contains the U2AF homology motif (UHM), a common protein interaction domain among splicing factors. Through this motif, UHMK1 interacts with the splicing factors SF1 and SF3B1, known to participate in the 3 splice site recognition during the early steps of spliceosome assembly. Although UHMK1 phosphorylates these splicing factors in vitro, the involvement of UHMK1 in RNA processing has not previously been demonstrated. Here, we identify novel putative substrates of this kinase and evaluate UHMK1 contribution to overall gene expression and splicing, by integrating global phosphoproteomics, RNA-seq, and bioinformatics approaches. Upon UHMK1 modulation, 163 unique phosphosites were differentially phosphorylated in 117 proteins, of which 106 are novel potential substrates of this kinase. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed enrichment of terms previously associated with UHMK1 function, such as mRNA splicing, cell cycle, cell division and microtubule organization. The majority of the annotated RNA-related proteins are components of the spliceosome, but are also involved in several steps of gene expression. Comprehensive analysis of splicing showed that UHMK1 affected over 200 alternative splicing events. Moreover, splicing reporter assay further supported UHMK1 function on splicing. Overall, RNA-seq data demonstrated that UHMK1 knockdown had a minor impact on gene expression and pointed to UHMK1 function in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Finally, the functional assays demonstrated that UHMK1 modulation affects proliferation, colony formation, and migration of the cells. Taken together, our data implicate UHMK1 as a splicing regulatory kinase, connecting protein regulation through phosphorylation and gene expression in key cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "During DNA replication, the newly created sister chromatids are held together until their separation at anaphase. The cohesin complex is in charge of creating and maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion (SCC) in all eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae cells, cohesin is composed of two elongated proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, bridged by the kleisin Mcd1/Scc1. The latter also acts as a scaffold for three additional proteins, Scc3/Irr1, Wpl1/Rad61, and Pds5. Although the HEAT-repeat protein Pds5 is essential for cohesion, its precise function is still debated. Deletion of the ELG1 gene, encoding a PCNA unloader, can partially suppress the temperature-sensitive pds5-1 allele, but not a complete deletion of PDS5. We carried out a genetic screen for high copy number suppressors and another for spontaneously arising mutants, allowing the survival of a pds5{Delta} elg1{Delta} strain. Our results show that cells remain viable in the absence of Pds5 provided that there is both an elevation in the level of Mcd1 (which can be due to mutations in the CLN2 gene, encoding a G1 cyclin), and an increase in the level of SUMO-modified PCNA on chromatin (caused by lack of PCNA unloading in elg1{Delta} mutants). The elevated SUMO-PCNA levels increase the recruitment of the Srs2 helicase, which evicts Rad51 molecules from the moving fork, creating ssDNA regions that serve as sites for increased cohesin loading and SCC establishment. Thus, our results delineate a double role for Pds5 in protecting the cohesin ring and interacting with the DNA replication machinery.\n\nIMPORTANCESister chromatid cohesion is vital for faithful chromosome segregation, chromosome folding into loops, and gene expression. A multisubunit protein complex known as cohesin holds the sister chromatids from S-phase until the anaphase stage. In this study, we explore the function of the essential cohesin subunit Pds5 in the regulation of sister chromatid cohesion. We performed two independent genetic screens to bypass the function of the Pds5 protein. We observe that Pds5 protein is a cohesin stabilizer, and elevating the levels of Mcd1 protein along with SUMO-PCNA accumulation on chromatin can compensate for the loss of the PDS5 gene. In addition, Pds5 plays a role in coordinating the DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion establishment. This work elucidates the function of cohesin subunit Pds5, the G1 cyclin Cln2, and replication factors PCNA, Elg1 and Srs2 in the proper regulation of sister chromatid cohesion.",

Concurrently, scRNA-seq datasets become increasingly sparser as more zero counts are measured for many genes. We discuss that with increasing sparsity the binarized representation of gene expression becomes as informative as count-based expression. We show that downstream analyses based on binarized gene expressions give similar results to analyses based on count-based expressions. Moreover, a binarized representation scales to 17-fold more cells that can be analyzed using the same amount of computational resources. Based on these observations, we recommend the development of specialized tools for bit-aware implementations for downstream analyses tasks, creating opportunities to get a more fine-grained resolution of biological heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is escalating in the United States, with a limited mechanistic understanding. Triclosan (TCS) is a high-volume antimicrobial additive that has been detected in human breastmilk and shown in adult mice to cause hepatosteatosis. To examine the effect of TCS presented to neonatal mice through lactation, we exposed pregnant females to TCS in their diet and evaluated its impact on nursing neonates. TCS is efficiently transferred by lactation to newborn mice, causing significant fatty liver (FL) during the suckling period. Lactational delivery stimulated hepatosteatosis, triglyceride accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and liver fibrosis. These events were mirrored by inhibition of key metabolic regulators, FGF21 and AMPK. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) induced by lactational TCS exposure was blocked in mice deficient in hepatic ATF4 . In primary hepatocytes, siRNA specific inhibition of PERK, an ATF4 upstream activator and initiator of ER stress, blocked TCS induced DNL. Also, in the absence of PPAR, which targets regulation of ATF4, TCS induced triglyceride accumulation and the induction of DNL was blocked. The administration of obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent FXR agonist, as well as activation of intestinal mucosal-regenerative gp130 signaling, led to reduced liver ATF4 expression, PPAR signaling, and DNL when neonates were exposed to TCS. In summary, TCS exposure via lactation leads to early indicators of NAFLD development accompanied by hepatosteatosis that were mediated in a PERK-eIF2-ATF4-PPAR cascade. These studies indicate that mother to child transmission of environmental toxicants such as TCS may underlie the recent increases in pediatric NAFLD.",

Risk factors have been identified, but the mechanism(s) by which death occurs is not fully understood. Evidence supports ventilatory dysfunction in the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Understanding specific respiratory patterns present at baseline and after seizures at different ages, as well as the health of lung tissue, will allow us to better understand how sudden death occurs in this population.\n\nMethodsWhole body plethysmography (WBP) was used to monitor respiration before and after electrically induced seizure in the Scn1aA1783V/WT mouse model of DS weekly for a period of four weeks. Following the four-week WBP study, lungs from surviving animals were collected and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Weigerts elastin and the density of tissue and elastin were analyzed.\n\nResultsBreathing was diminished in the DS mouse at baseline and following evoked seizures in younger aged mice (P18-P24), consistent with prolonged post-ictal inspiratory time and low respiratory drive compared to the response seen in older animals. In older DS mice, consisting of those that have survived a critical period for mortality, the response to seizure was more robust and included higher respiratory drive, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates, tidal and expiratory volumes, and breathing frequency compared to wild-type and relative to baseline. Alveolar damage was also observed in P46-P52 DS mice.\n\nSignificanceDifferences in specific respiratory parameters in younger DS animals, during the time when mortality is greatest, compared to older DS animals (i.e. those that have survived the critical period) may allow us to better understand respiratory differences contributing to SUDEP.

All three approaches normalized RNA abnormalities and TDP-43 pathology, but only repeat excision and mutant allele excision completely eliminated pathologic dipeptide repeats.

Solving the MST problem will not only help us understand how microbial communities were formed, but also have far-reaching applications in pollution control, public health, and forensics. Numerous computational methods, referred to as MST solvers hereafter, have been developed in the past and applied to various real datasets to demonstrate their utility across different contexts. Yet, those MST solvers do not consider microbial interactions and priority effects in microbial communities. Here, we revisit the performance of several representative MST solvers. We show compelling evidence that solving the MST problem using existing MST solvers is impractical when ecological dynamics plays a role in community assembly. In particular, we clearly demonstrate that the presence of either microbial interactions or priority effects will render the MST problem mathematically unsolvable for any MST solver. We further analyze data from fecal microbiota transplantation studies, finding that the state-of-the-art MST solvers fail to identify donors for most of the recipients. Finally, we perform community coalescence experiments to demonstrate that the state-of-the-art MST solvers fail to identify the sources for most of the sinks.

    "abstract": "To achieve smooth motor performance in a changing sensory environment, motor outputs must be constantly updated in response to sensory feedback. Inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord play an essential role in shaping motor activity by gating the transmission of sensory information and setting the pattern and rhythm of motor neurons. Here, we identify the medial deep dorsal horn of the spinal cord as a \"hot zone\" of convergent proprioceptive and cutaneous information from the hindlimb, where inhibitory neurons show increased responsiveness to sensory input and are preferentially recruited during locomotion in comparison to excitatory neurons. We identify a novel population of glycinergic inhibitory neurons within the deep dorsal horn that express parvalbumin (dPV) and receive convergent proprioceptive and cutaneous input from the paw. We show that dPVs possess intrinsic properties that support spontaneous discharge, even in the absence of synaptic input. However, a drug cocktail mimicking descending input (5-HT, dopamine, NMDA) amplifies dPV output, while cutaneous and proprioceptive inputs shape the temporal dynamics of dPV activity. These findings suggest dPV-mediated inhibition is modulated by behavioral state and can be fine-tuned by sensory input. Using intersectional genetic strategies, we selectively target spinal cord dPVs and demonstrate their capacity to provide divergent ipsilateral inhibition to both pre-motor and motor networks of the ventral horn, thereby controlling the timing and magnitude of cutaneous-evoked muscle activity. Manipulating the activity of dPVs during treadmill locomotion results in altered limb kinematics at the transition of stance to swing and altered step cycle timing at increased speeds. To investigate the effects of manipulating dPV activity on broader sets of motor behaviors, we used depth vision and machine learning to quantify and scale naturalistic behavior. We find that although sub-movements remain stable, the transitions between sub-movements are reduced, suggesting a role in movement switching. In sum, our study reveals a new model by which sensory convergence and inhibitory divergence produce a surprisingly flexible influence on motor networks to increase the diversity of mechanisms by which sensory input facilitates smooth movement and context-appropriate transitions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInhibitory deep dorsal horn interneurons integrate convergent proprioceptive and cutaneous sensory inputs from the paw and are preferentially recruited during locomotion.\nC_LIO_LIDeep dorsal horn parvalbumin+ interneurons (dPVs) represent a population of glycinergic interneurons that can provide sustained inhibitory control.\nC_LIO_LISensory input engages dPVs to facilitate inhibition with high temporal precision and reduced variability.\nC_LIO_LIdPVs contribute to the ipsilateral inhibitory control of motor and premotor networks of the ventral horn, thereby gating the magnitude and timing of cutaneous-evoked flexor and extensor muscle activity.\nC_LIO_LIIn vivo, dPVs modulate gait dynamics in a state- and phase-dependent manner, to ensure smooth movement transitions between step-cycle phases and naturalistic sub-movements.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic tolerance not only enables bacteria to survive under acute antibiotic exposures but also provides bacteria with a window of time to develop antibiotic resistance. Campylobacter jejuni is increasingly resistant to clinically important antibiotics, particularly fluoroquinolones (FQs). Currently, little is known about antibiotic tolerance and its effects on resistance development in C. jejuni. Here, we show that exposure to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline at concentrations 10 and 100 times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) induce antibiotic tolerance in C. jejuni, whereas gentamicin and erythromycin treatment cause cell death. Interestingly, FQ resistance is rapidly developed in C. jejuni after tolerance induction by ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. Furthermore, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase plays a critical role in preventing FQ resistance development in C. jejuni during antibiotic tolerance by alleviating oxidative stress. Together, these results demonstrate that exposure of C. jejuni to antibiotics used to treat campylobacteriosis can induce antibiotic tolerance and that FQ-resistant (FQR) C. jejuni rapidly emerges through tolerance induction by FQs and non-FQ antibiotics. Work presented in this study shows mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of FQR C. jejuni and provides an insight into the effects of antibiotic tolerance on resistance development.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic tolerance compromises the efficacy of antibiotic treatment by extending bacterial survival and developing mutations associated with antibiotic resistance. Despite growing public health concerns about antibiotic resistance in C. jejuni, antibiotic tolerance has not yet been investigated in this important zoonotic pathogen. Here, our results show that exposure of C. jejuni to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, a common agricultural antibiotic, develops antibiotic tolerance, which subsequently facilitates the emergence of FQR C. jejuni. Since antibiotic-resistant C. jejuni is transmitted primarily from animals to humans, our study suggests that non-FQ drugs, such as tetracycline, used for animals can also promote FQ resistance development by inducing antibiotic tolerance in C. jejuni. Overall, the findings in this study help us understand mechanisms of resistance development through the induction of antibiotic tolerance.",
