    "abstract": "In a long-lived organism with a modular architecture, such as trees, somatic mutations accumulate throughout the long lifespan and result in genetic mosaicism in each module within the same individual. In recent years, next-generation sequencing technology has provided a snapshot of such intra-organismal genetic variability. However, the dynamic processes underlying the accumulation and expansion of somatic mutations during the growth remain poorly understood. In this study, we constructed a model to describe these processes in a form that can be applied to a real tree. Given that the proliferation dynamics of meristematic cells vary across plant species, multiple possible processes for elongation and branching were comprehensively expressed in our model. Using published data from a poplar tree, we compared the prediction of the models with the observation and explained the cell lineage dynamics underlying somatic mutations accumulation that were not evident from the snapshot of the sequenced data. We showed that the somatic genetic drift during growth increases inter-meristem mosaicism, resulting in genetically distinct branches and less integrity within an individual tree. We also showed that the somatic genetic drift during branching leads to the mutation accumulation pattern that does not reflect the tree topology. Our modelling framework can help interpret and provide further insights into the empirical findings of genetic mosaicism in long-lived trees.",

    "abstract": "In the history of humanity, most conflicts within and between societies have originated from perceived inequality in resource distribution. How humans achieve and maintain distributive justice has therefore been an intensely studied issue. However, most research on the corresponding psychological processes has focused on inequality aversion and has been largely agnostic of other motives that may either align or oppose this behavioral tendency. Here we provide behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging evidence that distribution decisions are guided by three distinct motives - inequality aversion, harm aversion, and rank reversal aversion - that interact and in fact can also deter individuals from pursuing equality. At the neural level, we show that these three motives are encoded by separate neural systems, compete for representation in various brain areas processing equality and harm signals, and are integrated in the striatum, which functions as a crucial hub for translating the motives to behavior. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the cognitive and biological processes by which multiple prosocial motives are coordinated in the brain to guide redistribution behaviors. This framework enhances our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying equality-related behavior, suggests possible neural origins of individual differences in social preferences, and provides a new pathway to understand the cognitive and neural basis of clinical disorders with impaired social functions.",

    "abstract": "Homeobox genes are prominent regulators of neuronal identity, but the extent to which their function has been probed in animal nervous systems remains limited. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, each individual neuron class is defined by the expression of unique combinations of homeobox genes, prompting the question of whether each neuron class indeed requires a homeobox gene for its proper identity specification. We present here progress in addressing this question by extending previous mutant analysis of homeobox gene family members and describing multiple examples of homeobox gene function in different parts of the C. elegans nervous system. To probe homeobox function, we make use of a number of reporter gene tools, including a novel multicolor reporter transgene, NeuroPAL, which permits simultaneous monitoring of the execution of multiple differentiation programs throughout the entire nervous system. Using these tools, we add to the previous characterization of homeobox gene function by identifying neuronal differentiation defects for 12 homeobox genes in 20 distinct neuron classes that are mostly unrelated by location, function and lineage history. 10 of these 20 neuron classes had no homeobox gene function ascribed to them before, while in the other 10 neuron classes, we extend the combinatorial code of transcription factors required for specifying terminal differentiation programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in a particular lineage, homeotic identity transformations occur upon loss of a homeobox gene and we show that these transformations are the result of changes in homeobox codes. Combining the present with past analysis, 111 of the 118 neuron classes of C. elegans are now known to require a homeobox gene for proper execution of terminal differentiation programs. Such broad deployment indicates that homeobox function in neuronal identity specification may be an ancestral feature of animal nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, are frequently associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), however, the neural mechanisms are unknown. Here, we showed that hypothalamic agouti-related protein (AgRP) neuronal activity was suppressed under chronic restraint stress (CRS), a condition known to induce anxiety-like behaviors and increase colitis susceptibility. Consistently, chemogenic activation (inhibition) of AgRP neurons reversed (mimicked) CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors and colitis susceptibility. Furthermore, CRS inhibited AgRP neuronal activity by suppressing the expression of c-Jun. As expected, overexpression of c-Jun in these neurons protected against the CRS-induced these effects and knockdown of c-Jun in AgRP neurons (c-Jun{Delta}AgRP) promoted anxiety-like behaviors and colitis. Moreover, relieving the anxiety with cyamemazine (an anxiolytic drug) alleviated colitis susceptibility in c-Jun{Delta}AgRP mice. Finally, according to a proteomic analysis, the levels of the secreted protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) were negatively associated with the increased anxiety-like behaviors and colitis susceptibility, supplementing recombinant THBS1 rescued colitis in c-Jun{Delta}AgRP mice. Taken together, these results reveal a critical role of hypothalamic AgRP neuron-derived c-Jun in orchestrating chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors and colitis susceptibility. These results provide a new perspective for understanding the neuronal mechanisms and potential therapeutic target for the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, and IBD.",

    "abstract": "Remembering the location of food is essential for survival. Rodents and humans employ mainly hippocampus-dependent spatial strategies, but when being stressed they shift to striatum-mediated stimulus-based strategies. To investigate underlying brain circuits, we tested mice with a heightened stress susceptibility due to a lack of the GABA-synthetizing enzyme GAD65 (GAD65-/- mice) in a dual solution task. Here, GAD65-/- mice preferred to locate a food reward in an open field via a proximal cue, while their wildtype littermates preferred a spatial strategy. The analysis of cFos co-activation across brain regions and of stress-induced mRNA expression changes of GAD65 pointed towards the hippocampal dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) as a central structure for mediating stress effects on strategy choices via GAD65. Reducing the GAD65 expression locally in the dDG by a shRNA mediated knock down was sufficient to replicate the phenotype of the global GAD65 knock out and to increase dDG excitability. Using DREADD vectors to specifically interfere with dDG circuit activity during dual solution retrieval but not learning confirmed that the dDG modulates strategy choices and that a balanced excitability of this structure is necessary to establish spatial strategy preference. These data highlight the dDG as a critical hub for choosing between spatial and non-spatial foraging strategies.",

CSF was assumed to exit the subarachnoid space (SAS) via different outflow routes such as the parasagittal dura, cribriform plate and/or meningeal lymphatics. We also modelled a reverse case where fluid was produced within the spinal canal and absorbed in the CP in line with observation on certain iNPH patients. No directional interstitial fluid flow was assumed within the brain parenchyma. Tracers were injected into the foramen magnum. The models demonstrate that convection in the SAS yield rapid clearance from both the SAS and the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and can speed up intracranial clearance from years, as would be the case for purely diffusive flow, to days.",

It has been identified to possess a tightly regulated gene expression profile that is integrally linked to its timely development during the intraerythrocytic stage. Epigenetic modifiers of the histone acetylation code have been identified as key regulators of the parasites transcriptome. In this study, we characterize the solitary class I histone deacetylase PfHDAC1 and demonstrate that phosphorylation is required for its catalytic activity. PfHDAC1 binds to and regulates parasite genes responsible for housekeeping and stress-responsive functions. We show that PfHDAC1 activity in parasites is crucial for normal intraerythrocytic development and that its cellular abundance is correlated with parasitemia progression. We further show that PfHDAC1 has differential abundance and genomic occupancy in artemisinin drug-resistant vs sensitive parasites and that inhibition of its deacetylase activity can modulate the sensitivity of parasites to the drug. We also identify that artemisinin exposure can interfere with PfHDAC1 phosphorylation and its genomic occupancy. Collectively, our results demonstrate PfHDAC1 to be an important regulator of basic biological functions in parasites while also deterministic of responses to environmental stresses such as antimalarial drugs.",

In Drosophila, the Scrib module proteins Scribble (Scrib) and Discs-large (Dlg) are required to limit Lgl phosphorylation at the basolateral cortex, but how Scrib and Dlg could carry out such a  protection activity is not clear. We tested Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) as a potential mediator of this activity but demonstrate that a significant component of Scrib and Dlg regulation of Lgl is PP1-independent and found no evidence for a Scrib-Dlg-PP1 protein complex. However, the Dlg SH3 domain plays a role in Lgl protection and, in combination with the N-terminal region of the Dlg HOOK domain, in recruitment of Scrib to the membrane. We identify a  minimal Dlg comprised of the SH3 and HOOK domains that is both necessary and sufficient for Scrib localization and epithelial polarity function in vivo.\n\nSummary StatementA minimal SH3-HOOK fragment of Dlg is sufficient to support epithelial polarity through mechanisms independent of the PP1 phosphatase.",

Intraspecific trade-off relationships between defense and competitiveness traits are important for understanding trophic interactions. However, quantifying the relevant traits forming defense-competitiveness trade-offs and how these traits determine prey and predator fitness remain major challenges. Here, we conducted feeding and growth experiments to assess multiple traits related to defense and competitiveness in 6 different strains of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exposed to predation by the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. We found large differences in defense and competitiveness traits among prey strains and negative relationships between defense and competitiveness traits. Because we compared trait differences among strains whose ancestors previously evolved in controlled environments where selection favored defense or competitiveness, these negative correlations suggest the presence of a trade-off between defense and competitiveness. This trade-off was found for multiple combinations of defense and competitiveness traits. Furthermore, the differences in traits translated into differences in prey and predator fitness, which demonstrated the contribution of intraspecific trade-offs for predicting the outcome of predator-prey interactions.",

    "abstract": "During a sophisticated developmental process, ciliates excise numerous internally eliminated sequences (IESs) from a germline genome copy, producing a functional somatic genome. Most IESs ultimately originate from transposons but homology is obscured by sequence decay. To obtain more representative perspectives on ciliate genome editing, we assembled forty thousand IESs of Blepharisma stoltei, from a much earlier-diverging lineage than existing models. Short IESs (< 115 bp) were largely non-repetitive, with a pronounced ~10 bp length periodicity, whereas longer IESs (max 7 kbp) were non-periodic and contained abundant interspersed repeats. Contrary to current models, the Blepharisma germline genome encodes few transposases. Instead, its most abundant repeat (8000 copies) was a Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Element (MITE), apparently a deletion derivative of a germline-limited Pogo-family transposon. We propose MITEs as an important and eventually self-limiting IES source. Rather than defending germline genomes against mobile elements, we argue that transposase domestication actually facilitates junk DNA accumulation.",

Thus, we characterized the depth-dependent composition and structure of normal and osteoarthritic human femoral condyle cartilage (n = 47) and related them to their viscoelastic and constituent-specific mechanical properties. We observed that, in superficial cartilage, the collagen network disorganization and proteoglycan loss were associated with the smaller initial fibril network modulus (collagen pretension). Furthermore, the proteoglycan loss was associated with the greater strain-dependent fibril network modulus (a measure of nonlinear mechanical behavior). The proteoglycan loss was also associated with greater cartilage viscosity at a low loading frequency (0.005 Hz), while the disorganization of the collagen network was associated with greater cartilage viscosity at a high loading frequency (1 Hz). Our results suggest that proteoglycan degradation and collagen disorganization reduce the pretension of the collagen network while proteoglycan degradation also increases the nonlinear mechanical response of the collagen network. Further, the results also highlight that proteoglycan degradation and collagen disorganization increase the viscosity of cartilage, but their contribution to increased viscosity occurs in completely different loading frequencies.",

Recent studies demonstrate the importance of inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) in plant Pi signaling and homeostasis, however the extent to which PP-InsPs impact plant development is not well understood. We report that transgenic expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme Diadenosine and Diphosphoinositol Polyphosphate Phosphohydrolase (DDP1) in Arabidopsis thaliana and Thlaspi arvense (pennycress) provide a unique translational utility for Pi phytoremediation as well as unique germplasm and insight on the long-term impacts of reduced PP-InsPs. Transgenic DDP1 expression in Arabidopsis decreased PP-InsPs, impacted growth and development, and increased Pi accumulation leading to Pi toxicity. Analysis of Pi Starvation Response (PSR) marker genes indicated that the PSR is activated in DDP1 expressing plants. We assessed translational utility through transformation of pennycress, a spring annual cover crop with emerging importance as a biofuel crop, with a DDP1 transgene. Pennycress plants expressing DDP1 showed similar altered Pi accumulation phenotypes, suggesting that these plants could potentially serve to remove Pi from Pi-rich soils. Our study addresses the long-term impacts of PP-InsP reduction on plant growth, as well as establishing a starting material for a unique Pi reclaiming cover crop.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA major challenge to food security is the phosphorus (P) crisis. A global P shortage is imminent based on the misuse of current resources and will be further aggravated by climate change and a lack of policy addressing sustainability. Our work addresses this crisis by investigating the sustained impact of altering inositol pyrophosphates to manipulate plant P accumulation, a strategy that could be used to remediate nutrient-polluted environments.",

Here, by manipulating RUNX2 expression with either knockdown or overexpression in human hematopoietic stem cell-based NK cell differentiation cultures, combined with transcriptomic and ChIP-sequencing analyses, we established that RUNX2 drives the generation of NK cells, possibly through induction of IL-2R{beta} expression in NK progenitor cells.

Further characterization showed that many of these genes were clustered in DNA regions of several tens to hundreds of kilobases in size, originally belonging to viruses related to known Tetraselmis spp. viruses (TetV and TsV). In contrast, the remaining candidate HGT genes were randomly dispersed in the algal genomes, more frequently transcribed and belonged to large multigene families. The presence of homologs in Viridiplantae suggested that these latter were more likely of algal rather than viral origin. We found a remarkable diversity Polinton- like virus (PLV) elements inserted in Tetraselmis genomes, all of which were most similar to the Tetrasemis striata virus TsV. The genes of PLV elements are transcriptionally inactive with the notable exception of the homologue of the TVSG_00024 gene of TsV whose function is unknown. We suggest that this gene may be involved in a sentinel process to trigger virus reactivation and excision in response to an environmental stimulus. Altogether, these results provide evidence that TsV- related viruses have a dual lifestyle, alternating between a free viral phase (i.e., virion) and a phase integrated into host genomes.",

    "abstract": "Caenorhabditis elegans embarks on a quiescent dauer state upon exposure to unfavourable conditions and can sustain for a very long period without food, but it returns to continuous life cycle upon arrival of suitable conditions. Thus, dauer state plays a critical role in its adaptive fitness and survival. ATP-independent endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2 has been implicated in dauer microRNA metabolism, perturbation of which causes their collapse within a very short span of time. Here, we present a detailed comparative analyses of dauer transcriptomes from a conditional mutant strain for the endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2, maintained under control and experimental conditions. We observed that even a limited disruption of microRNA homeostasis in experimental dauers results in deregulation of a large number of mRNA targets. Our bioinformatic analyses, supported by morphological, physiological, and behavioral evidence further demonstrate critical changes in metabolism leading to a state unsupportive of dauer maintenance, alongside potential defects in multiple neuronal activities, which might have caused an overall disruption of dauer plasticity. We explore a possible role of this endoribonuclease activity towards the maintenance of chromatin architecture and transposon expression that in turn might affect the transcriptional program critically required for the maintenance of non-aging, long-lived dauers. Finally, we also demonstrate that perturbation of the endoribonuclease activity during the dauer state exerts drastic adverse effects on the continuity of life cycle after dauer-exit. They not only fail to recapitulate the wild type events of germline development and embryogenesis, but also present traits of very old worms and formation of  tumor-like structures in the proximal gonad.",

Here we investigated the biological roles of these proteins during vertebrate development using knockout (KO) models in zebrafish. We demonstrate that loss of either or both proteins leads to a motor impairment, reduced survival, and compromised neuromuscular junction (NMJ) integrity in larval zebrafish. Compensation by Chchd10 was observed in the chchd2-/- model, but not by Chchd2 in the chchd10 -/- model. The assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I was impaired in chchd10 -/- and chchd2 -/- zebrafish larvae, but unexpectedly not in the double chchd10 -/- & chchd2 -/- model, suggesting that reduced mitochondrial Complex I cannot be solely responsible for the observed phenotypes, which are generally more severe in the double KO. Activation of the mitochondrial integrated stress response (mt-ISR) was only observed in the double KO model, possibly implicating this pathway in the recovery of the Complex I defect, and suggesting that Complex I assembly defect in our single KO is independent of the mt-ISR. Our results demonstrate that both proteins are required for normal vertebrate development, but their precise molecular function in the mitochondrial biology of motor neurons remains to be discovered.",

    "abstract": "The staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis, was once abundant in the Caribbean, but now is listed as critically endangered. To recover A. cervicornis populations, restoration efforts have focused on preserving genetic diversity and increasing coral cover. However, identifying stress-resistant corals can help to increase restoration success, by allocating genotypes to reefs where they are more likely to survive. We assessed the performance (growth, survivorship, and photochemical efficiency) and characterized the microbiome (prokaryotes) of six A. cervicornis genotypes that were maintained at control temperatures (~26 {degrees}C) and either ambient nutrients or elevated nutrients (elevated NH4, and elevated NH4 + PO4) for > 2 months. We then compared how these parameters changed when the corals were exposed to heat-stress (3-weeks at ~31.5 {degrees}C). We found that exposure to elevated nutrients reduced A. cervicornis performance under control temperatures and heat stress. However, there was a wide range of variation among genotypes, with three genotypes maintaining relatively higher survivorship and growth rates when exposed to nutrients alone, and nutrients followed by heat stress. Heat stress alone changed the microbial composition among genotypes more than elevated nutrients alone, but heat stress also interacted with nutrient pre-exposure to affect microbial communities. The relative abundance of Midichloriaceae and Spirochaetaceae varied by coral genotype and a high abundance of these bacterial taxa was a positive predictor of coral survivorship rate, suggesting a microbial signature that could aid in identifying resistant A. cervicornis genotypes. Our findings suggest there is significant variation among genotypes in the response of A. cervicornis to elevated nutrients and temperatures. Resistant genotypes may be identifiable via their microbiomes and prioritized for outplanting at sites characterized by high levels of nutrient pollution. Large-scale microbiome screening may help expedite targeted outplanting and could be tested and extended to facilitate the identification of genotypes with other resistance characteristics.",

    "abstract": "In this article, I present a new model of the interaction of the main protease (Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2 virus with its substrate. The reaction scheme used to describe this mechanism is an extension of the well-known Michaelis-Menten model proposed in 1913 by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten [1]. The model I present here takes into account that one Mpro enzyme monomer interacts with another Mpro monomer in the presence of the substrate, leading to the formation of an enzyme dimer bound to one substrate molecule. Indeed, this dimer is formed by the sequentially binding of one Mpro enzyme monomer to one molecule of substrate, followed by another Mpro enzyme monomer binding to this Mpro-substrate complex. This reaction mechanism is also known in the literature as substrate-induced dimerization [3]. Starting from this new reaction scheme established for this catalytic mechanism, I derived a mathematical expression describing the catalytic rate of the active Mpro enzyme dimer as a function of the substrate concentration [S]. The plot corresponding to this substrate-induced dimerization reaction shows a function f ([S]) that is not monotonic, i.e. not strictly increasing or decreasing, but with a second derivative initially negative and then becoming positive after having passed the Vmax point. This is typically a type of curve showing a phenomenon like the one of substrate inhibition (for instance, inhibition by excess-substrate [7]). The graphical representation of this process shows an interesting behaviour: from zero M/s, the reaction rate increases progressively, similar to the kind of curve described by the Michaelis-Menten model. However, after having reached its maximum catalytic rate, Vmax, the reaction rate decreases progressively as we continue to increase the substrate concentration. I propose an explanation to this interesting behavior. At the moment where Vcat is maximum, we can assume that, in theory, every single substrate molecule in solution is bound to two enzyme monomers (i.e. to one active dimer). The catalytic rate is thus theoretically maximized. At the time where the reaction rate begins to decrease, we observe a new phenomenon that appears: the enzyme monomers begin to be \"diluted\" in the solution containing the excess substrate. The dimers begin to dissociate and to bind increasingly to the substrate as inactive monomers instead of active dimers. Hence, it is more and more unlikely for the enzyme monomers to sequentially bind twice to the same substrate molecule (here, [E] << [S]). Thus, at this stage, the substrate-induced dimerization occurs less often. At the limit, when the substrate is in high excess, there is virtually no more dimerization which occurs. This is one example of excess-substrate inhibition. Furthermore, after having established this fact, I wanted to see if this catalytic behavior was also observed in vitro. Therefore, I conducted an experiment where I measured the catalytic rate of the Mpro dimer for different substrate concentrations. The properties of my substrate construct were such, that I could determine the catalytic rate of the enzyme dimer by directly measuring the spectrophotometric absorbance of the cleaved substrate at{lambda} = 405 nm. The results show explicitly -- within a margin of error -- that the overall shape of the experimental curve looks like the one of the theoretical curve. I thus conclude that the biochemical behavior of the Mpro in vitro follows a new path when it is in contact with its substrate: an excess substrate concentration decreases the activity of the enzyme by the phenomenon of a type of excess-substrate inhibition. This finding could open a new door in the discovery of drugs directed against the Mpro enzyme of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, acting on the inhibition by excess-substrate of the Mpro enzyme, this protein being a key component in the metabolism of the virus. Furthermore, I have established that the maximum of the fitted curve, Vmax, depends only on [E]T and not on [S]. [Formula] exhibits the same dependence pattern. Therefore, if I keep [E]T close to zero, the catalytic rate of the enzyme will also be greatly reduced, which can be understood intuitively. Finally, if we dilute the enzyme sufficiently in the host cell by injecting a suitably high concentration of the octapeptide substrate AVLQSGFR (an inhibitor of the original substrate), this artificial substrate will bind to the \"intermediate\" dimer from the polypeptide and prevent the precursor Mpro from auto-cleaving and dimerizing due to the \"distorted key\" effect of the octapeptide on the \"intermediate\" dimer. The precursor peptide Mpro will auto-cleave to a lesser extent than in the absence of the artificial octapeptide and thus the concentration of the total enzyme [E]T will be lowered in the cell. It would therefore be possible to control the virulence of the virus by adjusting the concentration of the artificial inhibitory octapeptide. However, this is only speculation and has yet to be verified in practice.",

Localisation of NLGN3 protein is challenging in intestinal tissue due to the lack of target-specific antibodies. Here, we combined RNAScope in situ hybridization for Nlgn3 mRNA and immunofluorescence for markers of all enteric neurons, cholinergic submucosal neurons, non-cholinergic submucosal neurons, nitregic and calretinin-containing myenteric neurons as well as glial cells. We also developed a quantitative 3-dimensional image analysis method to measure Nlgn3 mRNA cellular expression levels in enteric neurons and glia. We show that Nlgn3 mRNA is expressed in most submucosal and myenteric neurons as well as in enteric glia. The R451C mutation reduces Nlgn3 mRNA expression levels in cholinergic, nitrergic and calretinin enteric neuronal subpopulations but does not affect Nlgn3 mRNA expression in VIPergic submucosal neurons. In summary, we show that the autism-associated R451C mutation in Nlgn3 reduces Nlgn3 mRNA expression in the mouse ENS.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 exhibit higher transmissibility over BA.21. The new variants receptor binding and immune evasion capability require immediate investigation. Here, coupled with Spike structural comparisons, we show that BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 exhibit comparable ACE2-binding affinities to BA.2. Importantly, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 display stronger neutralization evasion than BA.2 against the plasma from 3-dose vaccination and, most strikingly, from post-vaccination BA.1 infections. To delineate the underlying antibody evasion mechanism, we determined the escaping mutation profiles2, epitope distribution3 and Omicron neutralization efficacy of 1640 RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), including 614 isolated from BA.1 convalescents. Interestingly, post-vaccination BA.1 infection mainly recalls wildtype-induced humoral memory. The resulting elicited antibodies could neutralize both wildtype and BA.1 and are enriched on non-ACE2-competing epitopes. However, most of these cross-reactive NAbs are heavily escaped by L452Q, L452R and F486V. BA.1 infection can also induce new clones of BA.1-specific antibodies that potently neutralize BA.1; nevertheless, these NAbs are largely escaped by BA.2/BA.4/BA.5 due to D405N and F486V, and react weakly to pre-Omicron variants, exhibiting poor neutralization breadths. As for therapeutic NAbs, Bebtelovimab4 and Cilgavimab5 can effectively neutralize BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5, while the S371F, D405N and R408S mutations would undermine most broad sarbecovirus NAbs. Together, our results indicate that Omicron may evolve mutations to evade the humoral immunity elicited by BA.1 infection, suggesting that BA.1-derived vaccine boosters may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new Omicron variants.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the evolution of pathogen effector molecules is critical to understand infection mechanisms of fungal phytopathogens and ensure crop security. However, rapid diversification that diminishes sequence similarities between homologous effectors has largely concealed the roots of effector evolution. We predicted the folds of 26,653 secreted proteins from 21 species with AlphaFold and performed structure-guided comparative analyses on two aspects of effector evolution: uniquely expanded effector families and common folds present across the fungal species. Extreme expansion of nearly lineage-specific effector families was found only in several obligate biotrophs, Blumeria graminis and Puccinia graminis. The highly expanded effector families were the source of conserved sequence motifs, such as the Y/F/WxC motif. We identified additional lineage-specific effector families that include known (a)virulence factors, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50 and Tin2. These families represented new classes of sequence-unrelated structurally similar effectors. Structural comparisons revealed that the expanded structural folds further diversify through domain duplications and fusion with disordered stretches. Sub-and neo-functionalized structurally similar effectors reconverge on regulation, expanding the functional pools of effectors in the pathogen infection cycle. We also found evidence that many effector families could have originated from ancestral folds that have been conserved across fungi. Collectively, our study highlights diverse mechanisms of effector evolution and supports divergent evolution of effectors that leads to emergence of pathogen virulence from ancestral proteins.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic condensates that often form as part of the cellular antiviral response. Despite the growing interest in understanding the interplay between SGs and other biological condensates and viral replication, the role of SG formation during coronavirus infection remains poorly understood. Several proteins from different coronaviruses have been shown to suppress SG formation upon overexpression, but there are only a handful of studies analyzing SG formation in coronavirus- infected cells. To better understand SG inhibition by coronaviruses, we analyzed SG formation during infection with the human common cold coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV2. We did not observe SG induction in infected cells and both viruses inhibited eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) phosphorylation and SG formation induced by exogenous stress (e.g. sodium arsenite treatment). Furthermore, in SARS-CoV2 infected cells we observed a sharp decrease in the levels of SG-nucleating protein G3BP1. Ectopic overexpression of nucleocapsid (N) and non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) from both HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 inhibited SG formation. The Nsp1 proteins of both viruses inhibited arsenite-induced eIF2 phosphorylation, and the Nsp1 of SARS- CoV2 alone was sufficient to cause decrease in G3BP1 levels. This phenotype was dependent on the depletion of cytoplasmic mRNA mediated by Nsp1 and associated with nuclear retention of the SG- nucleating protein TIAR. To test the role of G3BP1 in coronavirus replication, we infected cells overexpressing EGFP-tagged G3BP1 with HCoV-OC43 and observed a significant decrease in infection compared to control cells expressing EGFP. The antiviral role of G3BP1 and the existence of multiple SG suppression mechanisms that are conserved between HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV2 suggest that SG formation may represent an important antiviral host defense that coronaviruses target to ensure efficient replication.\n\nAuthor SummaryHost cells possess many mechanisms that can detect viral infections and trigger defense programs to suppress viral replication and spread. One of such antiviral mechanisms is the formation of stress granules - large aggregates of RNA and proteins that sequester viral components and cellular factors needed by the virus to replicate. Because of this threat, viruses evolved specific mechanisms that prevent stress granule formation. Understanding these mechanisms can reveal potential targets for therapies that would disable viral inhibition of stress granules and render cells resistant to infection. In this study we analyzed inhibition of stress granules by two human coronaviruses: the common cold coronavirus OC43 and the pandemic SARS-CoV2. We have demonstrated that these viruses employ at least two proteins - nucleocapsid protein (N) and the non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) to suppress stress granules. These proteins act through distinct complementary mechanisms to ensure successful virus replication. Because both OC43 and SARS-CoV2 each dedicate more than one gene product to inhibit stress granule formation, our work suggests that viral disarming of stress granule responses is central for a productive infection.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the phylogeny of 31 Onobrychis species with the help of seed and fruit macro & micro-morphological traits and ISSR molecular markers. The species were found to be highly variable in their seed and fruit morphological traits. Also, a new type of fruit (O. crista galli type), in addition to the three predefined types of fruit, was introduced. From molecular perspective, a set of 22 ISSR primers were shown to have a good efficiency for genetic discrimination among the species. Bayesian model based STRUCTURE analysis grouped the genotypes into 4 genetic clusters, and the high value of Fst calculated for these clusters indicated a high level of genetic differentiation among them. On the other hand, based on the Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree, our results are in agreement with the subgenus classification (Onobrychis and Sisyrosema), while contrary to Sisyrosema, the Onobrychis subgenus (the Lophobrychis and Onobrychis sections) appears not to be monophyletic. Furthermore, in contrast to the traditional taxonomic classification, species belonging to the Lophobrychis section do not form a coherent group, indicating that this section could be considered as a heterogeneous unit and perhaps could be merge into the Onobrychis section.\n\nHighlightThis paper discusses a worldwide phylogenic analysis and population structures of Onobrychis genus. The results of this paper provide a comprehensive answer to complexity of subgenus and section discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Base Excision Repair (BER) is carried out by a series of DNA repair proteins that function in a step-by-step process to identify, remove, and replace DNA damage. As DNA damage is processed during BER, the DNA transitions through various intermediate states, called BER intermediates, which if left exposed can develop into double-strand DNA breaks and trigger programmed cell death signaling. Previous studies have proposed that in order to minimize exposure of the BER intermediates, each protein may remain bound to its product prior to the next protein binding. Thus, a short-lived complex consisting of the BER intermediate, the incoming enzyme, and the outgoing enzyme may form between each step of the BER pathway. The transfer of BER intermediates between enzymes, known as BER coordination, has yet to be directly visualized and the mechanistic details of the process remain unclear. Here, we utilize single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to investigate the mechanism of BER coordination between apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and DNA polymerase {beta} (Pol {beta}). When preformed complexes comprised of APE1 and the incised AP-site product were subsequently bound by Pol {beta}, the Pol {beta} enzyme dissociated shortly after binding in a majority of the observations. In the events where Pol {beta} binding was followed by APE1 dissociation (i.e., DNA hand-off), Pol {beta} had remained bound for a longer period of time to allow disassociation of APE1. Our results indicate that, in the absence of other BER factors, transfer of the BER intermediate from APE1 to Pol {beta} during BER is dependent on the dissociation kinetics of APE1 and the duration that Pol {beta} remains bound near the APE1-5 nick complex. These findings provide insight into how APE1 and Pol {beta} coordinate the transfer of DNA within the BER pathway.",

However, the more precise parameters, such as the number of exons/introns, can also be determined using long-read methods. Comparing the numbers of exons and introns allows including more genes for downstream velocity analysis and resolves the precise cell fate. The recently developed concept of \"RNA velocity\" concerns with dynamic changes in mRNA expression and complements single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which are static snapshots of a certain cell state taken at a given time point1. RNA velocity measures the change in mRNA abundance by differentiating the newly transcribed unspliced pre-mRNAs from mature spliced mRNAs. The rapidly developing long-read sequencing technology lends itself for RNA velocity analysis of scRNA-seq data, which was previously performed primarily using second-generation sequencing.",

We investigated whether mechanical memory of past environments empowers cells to navigate new, three-dimensional environments. Here, we show that cells primed by stiff matrices apply higher forces, compared to soft-primed cells, to accumulate and align collagen fibers towards sustained invasion. This priming advantage persists in dense or stiffened collagen. Through an energy-minimization model, we elucidate how memory-laden cells overcome mechanosensing of softer or challenging environments via a cell-matrix transfer of memory. Consistent with model predictions, depletion of -catenin and YAP hamper coordinated forces and cellular memory required for collagen remodeling before invasion. We release tension in collagen fibers via laser ablation and disable fiber remodeling by lysyl-oxidase inhibition; both of which disrupt cell-to-matrix transfer of memory and reduce invasion. These results have implications for cancer, fibrosis, and aging, where potential matrix memory may generate prolonged cellular response.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCell invasion across mechanically dissimilar environments is mediated by force-based storage and extraction of cell and matrix memory.",

    "abstract": "YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator regulated by the Hippo Signaling Pathway, including NF2. Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, a large percentage exhibit heterozygous loss of chromosome 22 (harboring the NF2 gene) and functional inactivation of the remaining NF2 copy, implicating oncogenic YAP activity in these tumors. Recently, fusions between YAP1 and MAML2 have been identified in a subset of pediatric NF2-wild type meningiomas. Here, we show that human YAP1-MAML2-positive meningiomas resemble NF2-mutant meningiomas by global and YAP-related gene expression signatures. We then show that expression of YAP1-MAML2 in mice induces tumors that resemble human YAP1 fusion-positive and NF2-mutant meningiomas by gene expression. We demonstrate that YAP1-MAML2 primarily functions by exerting TEAD-dependent YAP activity that is resistant to Hippo signaling. Treatment with YAP-TEAD inhibitors is sufficient to inhibit the viability of YAP1-MAML2-driven mouse tumors ex vivo. Finally, we show that expression of constitutively active YAP1 (S127/397A-YAP1) is sufficient to induce similar tumors suggesting that the YAP component of the gene fusion is the critical driver of these tumors. In summary, our results implicate YAP1-MAML2 as a causal oncogenic driver and highlight TEAD-dependent YAP activity as an oncogenic driver in YAP1-MAML2-fusion meningioma as well as NF2-mutant meningioma in general.",

    "abstract": "Translation is a key determinant of gene expression and an important biotechnological engineering target. In bacteria, 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) are well-known mRNA parts controlling translation and thus cellular protein levels. However, the complex interaction of 5-UTR and CDS has so far only been studied for few sequences leading to non-generalisable and partly contradictory conclusions. Herein, we systematically assess the dynamic translation from over 1.2 million 5-UTR-CDS pairs in Escherichia coli to investigate their collective effect using a new method for ultradeep sequence-function mapping. This allows us to disentangle and precisely quantify effects of known and hypothetical sequence determinants of translation. We find that 5-UTR and CDS individually account for 53% and 20% of variance in translation, respectively, and show conclusively that, contrary to a common hypothesis, tRNA abundance does not explain expression changes between CDSs with different synonymous codons. Moreover, the obtained large-scale data clearly point to a base-pairing interaction between initiator tRNA and mRNA beyond the anticodon-codon interaction, an effect that is often masked for individual sequences and therefore inaccessible to low-throughput approaches. Our study highlights the indispensability of ultradeep sequence-function mapping to accurately determine the contribution of parts and phenomena involved in gene regulation.",

We demonstrate that the SNARE and Unc18 machinery in the nematode C. elegans can be replaced by yeast proteins and still carry out synaptic transmission. However, substitutions of individual components from yeast disrupts fusion. To understand the functional interactions within the core machinery we adopted an  interspecies complementation approach using yeast. Synaptic transmission could be restored in chimeras when two key interfaces were present: a novel Habc-Unc18 contact site and an Unc18-SNARE motif contact site. An open form of Unc18 could bypass the requirement for the Habc-Unc18 interface. Together, these data suggest that the Habc domain of syntaxin is required for Unc18 to adopt an open conformation; open Unc18 then templates SNARE complex formation.",

AMX0035, a combination of sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) and taurursodiol (TUDCA, Turso), has shown promising results in early ALS clinical trials, but its mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated. To obtain an unbiased landscape of AMX0035 effects we investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of primary skin fibroblasts from sporadic ALS patients and healthy controls treated with PB, TUDCA, or PB-TUDCA combination (Combo). Combo changed many more genes and metabolites than either PB or TUDCA individually. Most changes were unique to Combo and affected the expression of genes involved in ALS-relevant pathways, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport, unfolded protein response, mitochondrial function, RNA metabolism, and innate immunity. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis showed that significant correlations between ALS gene expression modules and clinical parameters were abolished by Combo. This study is the first to explore the molecular effects of Combo in ALS patient-derived cells. It shows that Combo has a greater and distinct impact compared to the individual compounds and provides clues to drug targets and mechanisms of actions, which may underlie the benefits of this investigational drug combination.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonas disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) and the abnormal accumulation of -Synuclein (-Syn) protein. Currently, no treatment can slow nor halt the progression of PD. Multiplications and mutations of the -Syn gene (SNCA) cause PD-associated syndromes and animal models that overexpress -Syn replicate several features of PD. Decreasing total -Syn levels, therefore, is an attractive approach to slow down neurodegeneration in patients with synucleinopathy. We previously performed a genetic screen for modifiers of -Syn levels and identified CDK14, a kinase of largely unknown function as a regulator of -Syn. To test the potential therapeutic effects of CDK14 reduction in PD, we ablated Cdk14 in the -Syn preformed fibrils (PFF)-induced PD mouse model. We found that loss of Cdk14 mitigates the grip strength deficit of PFF-treated mice and ameliorates PFF-induced cortical -Syn pathology, indicated by reduced numbers of pS129 -Syn-containing cells. In primary neurons, we found that Cdk14 depletion protects against the propagation of toxic -Syn species. We further validated these findings on pS129 -Syn levels in PD patient neurons. Finally, we leveraged the recent discovery of a covalent inhibitor of CDK14 to determine whether this target is pharmacologically tractable in vitro and in vivo. We found that CDK14 inhibition decreases total and pathologically aggregated -Syn in human neurons, in PFF- challenged rat neurons and in the brains of -Syn-humanized mice. In summary, we suggest that CDK14 represents a novel therapeutic target for PD-associated synucleinopathy.",

However, it is unclear what core members and their ecological organization ensures the stable provision of this organs essential health-relevant functions to the host. With high quality metagenome-assembled genomes as network nodes, here we identified two competing guilds3 of the most stably and highly connected bacteria that together correlate with a wide range of host health conditions. Genomes in these two guilds kept their ecological relationship unchanged despite experiencing profound abundance changes during a 3-month high fiber intervention and 1-year follow-up in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The genomes of one guild harbored more genes for plant polysaccharide degradation and butyrate production, while the other guild had more genes for virulence or antibiotic resistance. A Random Forest regression model showed that the abundance distributions of these genomes were associated with 41 out of 43 bio-clinical parameters in the study cohort. With these genomes as reference, Random Forest modeling successfully classified case and control of T2DM, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, ankylosing spondylitis, schizophrenia, and Parkinsons disease in 12 independent metagenomic datasets from 1,816 participants across ethnicity and geography.

    "abstract": "Trypanosomatid pathogens are transmitted by blood-feeding insects, causing devastating human infections. Survival of these parasites in their vertebrate and invertebrate hosts relies on their capacity to differentiate into distinct stages that are the result of a co-evolutionary process. These stages show in addition important phenotypic shifts that often impacts infection, affecting for example parasite pathogenicity, tissue tropism, or drug susceptibility. Despite their clinical relevance, the evolutionary mechanisms that allow for the selection of such adaptive phenotypes remain only poorly investigated. Here we use Leishmania donovani as a trypanosomatid model pathogen to shed first light on parasite evolutionary adaptation during experimental sand fly infection. Applying a comparative genomics approach on hamster- isolated amastigotes and derived promastigotes before (input) and after (output) infection of Phlebotomus orientalis revealed a strong bottleneck effect on the parasite population as judged by principal component and phylogenetic analyses of input and output parasite DNA sequences. Despite random genetic drift caused by the bottleneck effect, our analyses revealed various genomic signals that seem under positive selection given their convergence between independent biological replicates. While no significant fluctuations in gene copy number were revealed between input and output parasites, convergent selection was observed for karyotype, haplotype and allelic changes during sand fly infection. Our analyses further uncovered signature mutations of oxidative DNA damage in the output parasite genomes, suggesting that Leishmania suffers from oxidative stress inside the insect digestive tract. Our results propose a new model of Leishmania genomic adaptation during sand fly infection, where oxidative DNA damage and DNA repair processes drive haplotype and allelic selection. The experimental and computational framework presented here provides a useful blueprint to assess evolutionary adaptation of other eukaryotic pathogens inside their insect vectors, such as Plasmodium spp, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic cancer cells adapt to thrive in secondary organs. To investigate metastatic adaptation, we performed transcriptomic analysis of metastatic and non-metastatic murine breast cancer cells. We found that pleiotrophin (PTN), a neurotrophic cytokine, is a metastasis-associated factor that is expressed highly by aggressive breast cancers. Moreover, elevated PTN in plasma correlated significantly with metastasis and reduced survival of breast cancer patients. Mechanistically, we find that PTN activates NF-kB in cancer cells leading to altered cytokine production, subsequent neutrophil recruitment and an immune suppressive microenvironment. Consequently, inhibition of PTN, pharmacologically or genetically, reduces the accumulation of tumor associated neutrophils and reverts local immune suppression resulting in increased T cell activation and attenuated metastasis. Furthermore, inhibition of PTN significantly enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade + chemotherapy in reducing metastatic burden in mice. These findings establish PTN as a previously unrecognized driver of a pro-metastatic immune niche and thus represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Assessing cancer prognosis is a challenging task, given the heterogeneity of the disease. Multiple features (clinical, environmental, genetic) have been used for such assessments. The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a key feature, and describing the impact of its many components on cancer prognosis is an active field of research. The complexity of the tumor microenvironment context makes it difficult to use the human TIME to assess prognosis, as demonstrated by the example of regulatory T cells (Tregs). The effect of Tregs on prognosis is ambiguous, with different studies considering them to be negative, positive or neutral. We focused on five different cancer types (breast, colorectal, gastric, lung and ovarian). We clarified the definition of Tregs and their utility for assessing cancer prognosis by taking the context into account via the following parameters: the Treg subset, the anatomical location of these cells, and the neighboring cells. With a meta-analysis on these three parameters, we were able to clarify the prognostic role of Tregs. We found that CD45RO+ Tregs had a reproducible negative effect on prognosis across cancer types, and we gained insight into the contributions of the anatomical location of Tregs and of their neighboring cells on their prognostic value. Our results suggest that Tregs play a similar prognostic role in all cancer types. We also established guidelines for improving the design of future studies addressing the pathophysiological role of Tregs in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen effectors target diverse subcellular organelles to manipulate the plant immune system. Although nucleolus has been emerged as a stress marker, and several effectors are localized in the nucleolus, the roles of nucleolar-targeted effectors remain elusive. In this study, we showed Phytophthora infestans infection of Nicotiana benthamiana results in nucleolar inflation during the transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic phase. Multiple P. infestans effectors were localized in the nucleolus: Pi23226 induced cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana and nucleolar inflation similar to that observed in the necrotrophic stage of infection, whereas its homolog Pi23015 and a deletion mutant (Pi23226{Delta}C) did not induce cell death or affect nucleolar size. RNA immunoprecipitation and iCLIP-seq analysis indicated that Pi23226 bound to the 3'-end of 25S rRNA precursors, resulting in the accumulation of unprocessed 27S pre-rRNAs. The nucleolar stress marker NAC082 was strongly upregulated under Pi23226-expressing conditions. Pi23226 subsequently inhibited global protein translation in host cells by interacting with ribosomes. Pi23226 enhanced P. infestans pathogenicity, indicating that Pi23226-induced ribosome malfunction and cell death was beneficial for pathogenesis in the host. Our results provide evidence for the molecular mechanism underlying RNA-binding effector activity in host ribosome biogenesis, and lead to new insights into the nucleolar action of effectors in pathogenesis.",

Here we systematically evaluate the performance and robustness of cell-free systems in serum, plasma, urine, and saliva using two reporter systems, sGFP and luciferase. In all cases, clinical samples have a strong inhibitory effect. Of different inhibitors, only the RNase inhibitor mitigated matrix effects. However, we found that the recovery potential of RNase inhibitor was partially muted by interference from glycerol contained in the commercial buffer. We solved this issue by designing a strain producing an RNase inhibitor protein requiring no additional step in extract preparation. Furthermore, our new extract yielded higher reporter levels than previous conditions and tempered interpatient variability associated with matrix effects. This systematic evaluation and improvements of cell-free system robustness unified across many types of clinical samples is a significant step towards developing cell-free diagnostics for a wide range of conditions.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a major obstacle in developing specific diagnostic imaging agents for many neurological disorders. In this study we aimed to generate single domain anti-mouse transferrin receptor antibodies (anti-mTfR VHHs) to mediate BBB transcytosis as components of novel MRI molecular contrast imaging agents. Anti-mTfR VHHs were produced by immunizing a llama with mTfR, generation of a VHH phage display library, immunopanning, and in vitro characterization of candidates. Site directed mutagenesis was used to generate additional variants. VHH fusions with neurotensin (NT) allowed rapid, hypothermia-based screening for VHH-mediated BBB transcytosis in wild-type mice. One anti-mTfR VHH variant was fused with an anti-amyloid-beta (A{beta}) VHH dimer and labeled with fluorescent dye for direct assessment of in vivo target engagement in a mouse model of AD-related A{beta} plaque pathology. An anti-mTfR VHH called M1 and variants had binding affinities to mTfR of <1nM to 1.52nM. The affinity of the VHH binding to mTfR correlated with the efficiency of the VHH-NT induced hypothermia effects after intravenous injection of 600 nmol/kg body weight, ranging from undetectable for nonbinding mutants to -6{degrees}C for the best mutants. The anti-mTfR VHH variant M1P96H with the strongest hypothermia effect was fused to the anti-A{beta} VHH dimer and labeled with Alexa647; the dye-labeled VHH fusion construct still bound both mTfR and A{beta} plaques. However, after intravenous injection at 600 nmol/kg body weight into APP/PS1 transgenic mice, there was no detectible labeling of plaques above control levels. Thus, NT-induced hypothermia did not correlate with direct target engagement in cortex. There was a surprising dissociation between NT-induced hypothermia, presumably mediated by hypothalamus, and direct engagement with A{beta}-plaques in cortex. Alternative methods to assess anti-mTfR VHH BBB transcytosis will need to be developed for anti-mTfR VHH screening and the development of novel MRI molecular contrast agents.",

    "abstract": "Microglia have emerged as key players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimers disease (AD). In response to CNS stimuli, these cells adopt distinct transcriptional and functional subtypes known as states. However, an understanding of the function of these states has been elusive, especially in human microglia, due to lack of tools to model and manipulate this cell-type. Here, we provide a platform for modeling human microglia transcriptional states in vitro. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that exposure of human stem-cell differentiated microglia (iMGLs) to brain-related challenges generated extensive transcriptional diversity which mapped to gene signatures identified in human brain microglia. We identified two in vitro transcriptional clusters that were analogous to human and mouse disease-associated microglia (DAMs), a state enriched in neurodegenerative disease contexts. To facilitate scalable functional analyses, we established a lentiviral approach enabling broad and highly efficient genetic transduction of microglia in vitro. Using this new technology, we demonstrated that MITF (Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor), an AD-enriched transcription factor in microglia, drives both a disease-associated transcriptional signature and a highly phagocytic state. Finally, we confirmed these results across iMGLs differentiated from multiple iPSC lines demonstrating the broad utility of this platform. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive resource that enables the manipulation and functional interrogation of human microglial states in both homeostatic and disease-relevant contexts.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that inner hair cell (IHC) synaptopathy, i.e., loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and IHCs, leads to hidden hearing loss (HHL), i.e., poor performance on challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse density and suprathreshold ABR amplitude, without changing cochlear thresholds. Here, we show that IHC synapse density does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, was enhanced or reduced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that cochlear synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits, which may be a key contributor to the hearing impairments that define HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.",

    "abstract": "The growth and physiology of soil microorganisms, which play vital roles in biogeochemical cycling, are likely dependent on current and prior soil moisture levels. Here, we developed and applied a genome-resolved metagenomic implementation of quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) to an H218O labeling experiment to determine which microbial community members, and with what capacities, are growing under in situ conditions. qSIP enabled measurement of taxon-specific growth because isotopic incorporation into microbial DNA requires production of new genome copies. We studied three Mediterranean grassland soils across a rainfall gradient to evaluate the hypothesis that historic precipitation levels are an important factor controlling trait selection. We used qSIP-informed genome-resolved metagenomics to resolve an active subset of soil community members and identify the ecophysiological traits that characterize them. Higher year-round precipitation levels correlated with higher activity and growth rates of flagellar motile microorganisms. In addition to bacteria that were heavily isotopically labeled, we identified abundant isotope-labeled phages suggesting phage-induced cell lysis likely contributed to necromass production at all three sites. Further, there was a positive correlation between phage activity and the activity of putative phage hosts. Contrary to our expectations, the capabilities to decompose the diverse complex carbohydrates common in soil necromass or oxidize methanol and carbon monoxide were broadly distributed across active and inactive bacteria in all three soils, implying that these traits are not highly selected for by historical precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Storms can cause widespread seabird strandings and wrecking1,2,3,4,5, yet little is known about the maximum wind speeds that birds are able to tolerate or the conditions they avoid. We analyzed > 300,000 hours of tracking data from 18 seabird species, including flapping and soaring fliers, to assess how flight morphology affects wind selectivity, both at fine scales (hourly movement steps) and across the breeding season. We found no general preference or avoidance of particular wind speeds within foraging tracks. This suggests seabird flight morphology is adapted to a \"wind niche\", with higher wing loading being selected for in windier environments. In support of this, wing loading was positively related to the median wind speeds on the breeding grounds, as well as the maximum wind speeds in which birds flew. Yet globally, the highest wind speeds occur in the tropics (in association with tropical cyclones) where birds are morphologically adapted to low median wind speeds. Tropical species must therefore show behavioral responses to extreme winds, including long-range avoidance of wind speeds that can be twice their operable maxima. In contrast, procellariiformes flew in almost all wind speeds they encountered at a seasonal scale. Despite this, we describe a small number of cases where albatrosses avoided strong winds at close-range, including by flying into the eye of the storm. Extreme winds appear to pose context- dependent risks to seabirds, and more information is needed on the factors that determine the hierarchy of risk, given the impact of global change on storm intensity 6,7.",

    "abstract": "If life exists on Mars, it would face several challenges including the presence of perchlorates, which destabilize biomacromolecules by inducing chaotropic stress. However, little is known about perchlorate toxicity for microorganism on the cellular level. Here we present the first proteomic investigation on the perchlorate-specific stress responses of the halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii and compare these to generally known salt stress adaptations. We found that the responses to NaCl and NaClO4-induced stresses share many common metabolic features, e.g., signaling pathways, elevated energy metabolism, or osmolyte biosynthesis. However, several new perchlorate-specific stress responses could be identified, such as protein glycosylation and cell wall remodulations, presumably in order to stabilize protein structures and the cell envelope. These stress responses would also be relevant for life on Mars, which - given the environmental conditions - likely developed chaotropic defense strategies such as stabilized confirmations of biomacromolecules and the formation of cell clusters.",

    "abstract": "The human primosome, a four-subunit complex of primase and DNA polymerase alpha (Pol), synthesizes chimeric RNA-DNA primers for DNA polymerases delta and epsilon to initiate DNA replication on both chromosome strands. Despite recent structural insights into the action of its two catalytic centers, the mechanism of DNA synthesis termination is still unclear. Here we report results of functional and structural studies revealing how the human primosome counts RNA-DNA primer length and timely terminates DNA elongation. Using a single-turnover primer extension assay, we defined two factors that determine a mature primer length (~35-mer): 1) a tight interaction of the C-terminal domain of the DNA primase large subunit (p58C) with the primer 5-end, and 2) flexible tethering of p58C and the DNA polymerase alpha catalytic core domain (p180core) to the primosome platform domain by extended linkers. The obtained data allows us to conclude that p58C is a key regulator of all steps of RNA-DNA primer synthesis. The above-described findings provide a notable insight into the mechanism of DNA synthesis termination by a eukaryotic primosome, an important process for ensuring successful primer handover to replication DNA polymerases and for maintaining genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule proteomic studies are critically important for understanding the molecular origins of cellular phenotypes. However, no currently available technology can achieve both the single-molecule sensitivity and high dynamic range required to comprehensively analyze the complex mixtures of proteins in biological samples. One approach to achieve high sensitivity across a wide dynamic range would be to create a protein array that arranges billions of single molecules with regular spacing on a patterned surface. However, creating such a protein array has remained an unsolved challenge for the field. Here, we present a highly scalable method for fabricating dense single-molecule protein arrays using a specially designed DNA origami structure, protein click-conjugation, photolithography and surface functionalization. The origami-structure is enhanced via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-extension, which generates brush-like projections, increasing the effective size of the origami from 88 nm to greater than 200 nm. These particles are large enough to enable super-Poisson deposition of individual protein molecules on a nano-patterned chip (>98% occupancy with only 1% of sites occupied with multiple protein molecules). This approach allowed for single-molecule protein display of 600 million protein molecules per microscope slide-sized chip with the potential to scale further with denser feature spacing. We hypothesize that this technology will ultimately enable the development of highly scalable proteomic analysis platforms that address the currently unmet need for protein measurements at single-molecule sensitivity across an exceptionally wide dynamic range of protein concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Aggression is a complex behavior that is observed across the animal kingdom, and plays roles in resource acquisition, defense, and reproductive success. While there are many individual differences in propensity to be aggressive within and between populations, the mechanisms underlying differences in aggression between individuals in natural populations are not well understood. We addressed this using the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, a powerful model organism to understand behavioral evolution. A. mexicanus exists in two forms: a river-dwelling surface form and multiple populations of a blind cave form. We characterized aggression in surface fish and cavefish in a resident/intruder assay through quantifying multiple behaviors occurring during social interactions. Surface fish, which are aggressive, display multiple social behaviors in this context, which we characterized into two types of behaviors: aggression- associated and escape-associated behaviors. The majority of these behaviors were reduced or lost in Pachon cavefish. Further, both aggression-associated and escape-associated behaviors were not dependent on the presence of light, and both surface fish and cavefish remained aggressive or non-aggressive, respectively, when opposed to fish from a different population. Additionally, we found that within populations, levels of stress response were not correlated with aggression- or escape-associated behaviors. Finally, when we compared aggression- and escape- associated behaviors across four cavefish populations, we found that both types of behaviors are reduced in three cave populations, while still present in one. Together, these results reveal that multiple cavefish populations have repeatedly evolved reduced aggression through shared behavioral components, while other cavefish have retained aggression.\n\nSummary StatementComparison of aggression between surface fish and cavefish demonstrates that multiple complex behaviors compose aggression in surface fish and reveals heterogeneity in loss of aggression in cave populations.",
