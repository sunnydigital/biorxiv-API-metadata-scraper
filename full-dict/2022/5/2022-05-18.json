    "abstract": "Effectors are secreted by plant-associated microorganisms in order to modify the host cell physiology. As effectors, the Necrosis- and Ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NLPs) are involded in the early phases of plant infection and may trigger host immune responses. Corynespora cassiicola is a polyphagous plant-pathogen that causes target spot on many agriculturally important crops. Using genome assembly, gene prediction, and proteome annotation tools, we retrieved 135 NLP-encoding genes from proteomes of 44 isolates. We explored the evolutionary history of NLPs using Bayesian phylogeny, gene genealogies, and selection analyses. We accessed the expression profiles of the NLP genes during the early phase of C. cassiicola-soybean interaction. Three NLP effector genes (Cc_NLP1.1, Cc_NLP1.2A, and Cc_NLP1.2B) were maintained in the genomes of all isolates tested. A non-effector NLP gene (Cc_NLP1.3) was found in three isolates that had been originally obtained from soybean. NLP effectors were under different selective constraints: Cc_NLP1.1 was under stronger selective pressure, while Cc_NLP1.2A was under a more relaxed constraint. Meanwhile, Cc_NLP1.2B likely evolved under either positive or balancing selection. Despite highly divergent, the effector NLPs maintain conserved the residues necessary to trigger plant immune responses, suggesting they are potentially functional. Only the Cc_NLP1.1 effector gene was significantly expressed at the early hours of soybean colonization, while Cc_NLP1.2A and Cc_NLP1.2B showed much lower levels of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Phenological distributions are characterized by their central tendency, breadth, and shape, and all three determine the extent to which interacting species overlap in time. Pollination mutualisms rely on temporal co-occurrence of pollinators and their floral resources, and while much work has been done to characterize the shapes of flower phenological distributions, similar studies including pollinators are lacking. Here, we provide the first broad assessment of skewness, a component of distribution shape, for a bee community. We compare skewness in bees to that in flowers, related bee and flower skewness to other properties of their phenology, and quantify the potential consequences of differences in skewness between bees and flowers. Both bee and flower phenologies tend to be right-skewed, with a more exaggerated asymmetry in bees. Early-season species tend to be the most skewed, and this relationship is also stronger in bees than in flowers. Based on a simulation experiment, differences in bee and flower skewness could account for up to 14% of pair-wise overlap differences. Given the potential for interaction loss, we argue that difference in skewness of interacting species is an under-appreciated property of phenological change.",

    "abstract": "Galactose is a secondary fermentable sugar that requires specific regulatory and structural genes for its assimilation, which are under catabolite repression by glucose. When glucose is absent, the catabolic repression is attenuated, and the structural GAL genes are fully activated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the GAL pathway is under selection in environments where galactose is present. However, it is unclear the adaptive strategies in response to long-term propagation in galactose as a sole carbon source in laboratory evolution experiments. Here, we performed a 4,000-generation evolution experiment using 48 diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations to study adaptation in galactose. We show that fitness gains were greater in the galactose-evolved population than in identically evolved populations with glucose as a sole carbon source. Whole-genome sequencing of 96 evolved clones revealed recurrent de novo single nucleotide mutations in candidate targets of selection, copy number variations, and ploidy changes. We find that most mutations that improve fitness in galactose lie outside of the canonical GAL pathway and are involved in nutrient signaling. Reconstruction of specific evolved alleles in candidate target of selection, SEC23 and IRA1, showed a significant increase in fitness in galactose compared to glucose. In addition, most of our evolved populations (28/46; 61%) fixed aneuploidies on Chromosome VIII, suggesting a parallel adaptive amplification. Finally, we show greater loss of extrachromosomal elements in our glucose-evolved lineages compared with previous glucose evolution. Broadly, these data further our understanding of the evolutionary pressures that drive adaptation to less-preferred carbon sources.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile genome evolutionary processes of seed plants are intensively investigated, very little is known about seed-free plants in this respect. Here, we use one of the largest groups of seed-free plants, the mosses, and newly generated chromosome-scale genome assemblies to investigate three poorly known aspects of genome dynamics and their underlying processes in seed-free plants: (i) genome size variation, (ii) genomic collinearity/synteny, and (iii) gene set differentiation.\n\nResultsComparative genomic analyses on the model moss Physcomitrium (Physcomitrella) patens and two genomes of Funaria hygrometrica reveal that, like in seed plants, genome size change (approx. 140 Mbp) is primarily due to transposable element expansion/contraction. Despite 60 million years of divergence, the genomes of P. patens and F. hygrometrica show remarkable chromosomal stability with the majority of homologous genes located in conserved collinear blocks. In addition, both genomes contain a relatively large set of lineage-specific genes with no detectible homologs in the other species genome, suggesting a highly dynamic gene space fueled by the process of de novo gene birth and loss rather than by gene family diversification/duplication.\n\nConclusionsThese, combined with previous observations suggest that genome dynamics in mosses involves the coexistence of a collinear homologous and a highly dynamic species-specific gene sets. Besides its significance for understanding genome evolution, the presented chromosome-scale genome assemblies will provide a foundation for comparative genomic and functional studies in the Funariaceae, a family holding historical and contemporary model taxa in the evolutionary biology of mosses.",

    "abstract": "The topology of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network is highly regulated by various cellular and environmental stimuli and affects major functions such as protein quality control and the cells response to metabolic changes. The ability to quantify the dynamical changes of the ER structures in response to cellular perturbations is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against ER associated diseases, such as hereditary spastic paraplegias and Niemann Pick Disease type C. However, the rapid movement and small spatial dimension of ER networks make this task challenging. Here, we combine video-rate super-resolution imaging with a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method capable of automatically classifying sheet and tubular ER domains inside individual cells. Data are skeletonised and represented by connectivity graphs to enable the precise and efficient quantification and comparison of the network connectivity from different complex ER phenotypes. The method, called ERnet, is powered by a Vision Transformer architecture, and integrates multi-head self-attention and channel attention into the model for adaptive weighting of frames in the time domain. We validated the performance of ERnet by measuring different ER morphology changes in response to genetic or metabolic manipulations. Finally, as a means to test the applicability and versatility of ERnet, we showed that ERnet can be applied to images from different cell types and also taken from different imaging setups. Our method can be deployed in an automatic, high-throughput, and unbiased fashion to identify subtle changes in cellular phenotypes that can be used as potential diagnostics for propensity to ER mediated disease, for disease progression, and for response to therapy.",

    "abstract": "Valsa is a genus of ascomycetes fungi within the family Valsaceae that includes many wood destructive pathogens. The species such as Valsa mali and Valsa pyri that colonize fruit trees are threatening the global fruit production. Rapid host adaptation and fungicide resistance emergence are the main characteristics that make them devastating and hard to control. Efficient disease management can be achieved from early infection diagnosis and fungicide application, but lack of understandings of their genetic diversity and genomic features that underpin their pathogenicity evolution and drug resistance is essentially impeding the progress of effective and sustainable disease control. Here, we report genome assemblies of Valsa malicola, Valsa persoonii and Valsa sordida which represents close relatives of the two well known Valsa mali and Valsa pyri that cause canker disease with different host preferences. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that segmental rearrangements, inversions and translocations frequently occurred among Valsa spp. genomes. Genes identified in highly active regions exhibited high sequence differentiation and are enriched in membrane transporter proteins involved in anti-drug and nutrient transportation activities. Consistently, we also found membrane transporter gene families have been undergoing significant expansions in Valsa clade. Furthermore, unique genes that possessed or retained by each of the five Valsa species are more likely part of the secondary metabolic (SM) gene clusters which suggests SM one of the critical components that diverge along with the evolution of <I>Valsa</I> species. Repeat sequence content contributes significantly to genome size variation across the five species. The wide spread AT-rich regions resulted from repeat induced point C to T mutation (RIP) exhibited a specific proximity to secondary metabolic gene clusters and this positional proximity is correlated with the diversification of SM clusters suggesting a potential companion evolution between repeat sequence and secondary metabolism cluster. Lastly, we show that LaeA, the global regulator of secondary metabolic gene cluster, exhibiting diverged manner of regulation on the expression of clusters in vegetative and invasive mycelia of the devastating V. mali indicating the complexity of secondary metabolism in fungal species.",

To standardize the process of benchmarking, we unified existing benchmarking datasets and defined a rigorous set of evaluation metrics. We benchmarked the latest seven basecaller models and analyzed their deep learning architectures. Our results show that overall Bonito has the best architecture for basecalling.

Our comprehensive evaluation of 90 novel architecture demonstrates that different models excel at reducing different types of errors and using RNNs (LSTM) and a CRF decoder are the main drivers of high performing models.",

The automatic analysis of histopathology images stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) can help clinicians diagnose and quantify diseases. Computer vision methods based on deep learning can perform on par or better than pathologists in specific tasks [1, 2, 15]. Nevertheless, the visual heterogeneity in histopathology images due to batch effects, differences in preparation in different pathology laboratories, and the scanner can produce tissue appearance changes in the digitized whole-slide images. Such changes impede the application of the trained models in clinical scenarios where there is high variability in the images. We introduce stainlib, an easy-to-use and expandable python3 library that collects and unifies state-of-the-art methods for color augmentation and normalization of histopathology H&E images. stainlib also contains recent deep learning-based approaches that perform a robust stain-invariant training of CNN models. stainlib can help researchers build models robust to color domain shift by augmenting and harmonizing the training data, allowing the deployment of better models in the digital pathology practice.",

    "abstract": "The smut fungi are one of the largest groups of fungal plant pathogens, causing disease in all cereal crops. They directly penetrate their hosts and establish a biotrophic interaction. During colonization of the plant, smut fungi secrete a wide range of effector proteins, which suppress plant immunity and modulate cellular functions as well as development of the host, thereby determining the pathogens life-style and virulence potential.\n\nThe conserved effector Erc1 (enzyme required for cell-to-cell movement) contributes to virulence of the corn smut Ustilago maydis in maize leaves, but not on the tassel. Erc1 binds to host cell wall components and has a 1,3-{beta}-glucanase activity, which is required to attenuate {beta}-glucan-induced defense responses in host leaves. Confocal microscopy revealed that Erc1 has a cell type-specific virulence function, being necessary for fungal cell-to-cell movement in the plant bundle sheath. This cell type-specific virulence function of Erc1 is fully conserved in the barley pathogen Ustilago hordei, which has a functionally conserved Erc1 orthologue.\n\nThus, Erc1 is an enzymatically active core virulence factor with a cell type-specific virulence function in different hosts, which is important for cell-to-cell movement during host colonization of pathogenic smut fungi.",

Signalling peptides are produced under specific conditions and elicit physiological changes. PROZIP1 encodes such a signalling peptide, Zip1, that induces salicylic acid defence responses in maize (Zea mays) leading to a better protection against biotrophic pathogens. Despite salicylic acid pathway being conserved amongst plants, we observed that Zip1 only occurs in the Zea genus. PROZIP1s evolution is associated with transposons, as it resides in the terminal repeat of a retrotransposon from the Gyma family. We traced back the mutations that were encountered by this transposon and found that PROZIP1 emerged de novo in Zea. This emergence likely occurred less than 728,000 years ago. In conclusion, we describe the evolution of a recently emerged plant immune signalling peptide from a transposon sequence.",

The tumor cells survive under these chronic oxidative conditions by upregulating antioxidant systems compared to healthy cells. Radiation and the majority of chemotherapies used clinically for treatment of HNSCC rely directly or indirectly upon the generation of short-lived ROS to induce cancer cell death. To investigate the heterogeneity of cellular responses to chemotherapeutic ROS generation in tumor and healthy tissue, we leveraged single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to perform redox systems-level simulations of quinone-cycling {beta}-lapachone treatment as a source of NQO1-dependent rapid superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Transcriptomic data from 10 HNSCC patient tumors was used to populate over 4000 single cell antioxidant enzymatic models. The simulations reflected significant systems-level differences between the redox states of healthy and cancer cells, demonstrating in some patient samples a targetable cancer cell population or in others statistically indistinguishable effects between non-malignant and malignant cells. Subsequent multivariate analyses between healthy and malignant cellular models point to distinct contributors of redox responses between these phenotypes. This model framework provides a mechanistic basis for explaining mixed outcomes of NQO1-bioactivatable therapeutics despite the tumor specificity of these drugs as defined by NQO1/catalase expression.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria reorganize their physiology upon entry to stationary phase. What part of this reorganization improves starvation survival is a difficult question, because the change in physiology includes a global reorganization of the proteome, envelope and metabolism of the cell. In this work, we used several trade-offs between fast growth and long survival to statistically score over 2000 E. coli proteins for their global correlation with death rate. The combined ranking allowed us to narrow down the set of proteins that positively correlate with survival and validate the causal role of a subset of proteins. Remarkably, we found that important survival genes are related to the cell envelope, i.e., periplasm and outer membrane, because maintenance of envelope integrity of E. coli plays a crucial role during starvation. Our results uncover a new protective feature of the outer membrane that adds to the growing evidence that the outer membrane is not only a barrier that prevents abiotic substances from reaching the cytoplasm, but essential for bacterial proliferation and survival.\n\nStandfirst textA trade-off between the two major modes of bacterial lifestyle, growth and starvation can be explained by bacteria investing resources into the cell envelope to make it impermeable to ions, which improves their lifespan but comes at the expense of slowing down growth.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/492425v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7534d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e02e43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd4acdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@39e716_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA trade-off between growth rate and death rate confines fitness of bacteria across environments.\nC_LIO_LIAnalysis of proteome signatures in 126 conditions across five independent perturbations reveals the cell envelope as a key determinant of death rate.\nC_LIO_LIThe trade-off can be abolished by changing environment to a low-salt, but osmo-balanced medium where cell envelope integrity is not limiting.\nC_LI",

Additional pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that shrimp monocytic hemocytes and granulocytes were differentiated from a common progenitor which was similar with that of human myeloid cells. More interestingly, we identified that MH2, a terminal differentiated monocytic hemocyte, was a macrophage-like phagocytic cell which could engulf fluorescein labelled Vibrio parahaemolyticus and shared nine marker genes including inflammasome components Nlrp3 and Casp1 with human macrophage. After that, we compared our classification with traditional shrimp hemocytes classification and found that hyalinocyte included both prohemocyte and monocytic hemocyte while semi-granulocyte included both monocytic hemocyte and granulocyte. In general, our results redefine shrimp hemocyte classification based on functional marker genes and unveil evolutionary trace of myeloid cells in marine invertebrate.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in anti-tumor immunity by inducing T cell differentiation. Herein, we found that the mechanical sensor Piezo1 expressed by DCs integrates innate inflammatory stimuli and stiffness signals and directs the reciprocal differentiation of TH1 and regulatory T (Treg) cells in cancer. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in DCs inhibited the generation of TH1 cells while driving the development of Treg cells in promoting cancer growth. Mechanistically, Piezo1-deficient DCs regulated the secretion of the polarizing cytokines TGF{beta}1 and IL-12, leading to increased TGF{beta}R2-p-Smad3 activity and decreased IL-12R{beta}2-p-STAT4 activity while inducing the reciprocal differentiation of Treg and TH1 cells. In addition, Piezo1 integrated the SIRT1-hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1)-dependent metabolic pathway and calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway to orchestrate reciprocal TH1 and Treg lineage commitment through DC-derived IL-12 and TGF{beta}1. Our studies provide critical insight for understanding the role of the DC-based mechanical regulation of immunopathology in directing T cell lineage commitment in tumor microenvironments.",

Organizing mechanisms, such as loop-extrusion, have been extensively studied using Hi-C methods, which measure pairwise contacts between chromosomal regions. New multi-contact methods additionally measure which chromosomal contacts occur simultaneously. Here, we develop three predictors of baseline multi-contact frequencies given pairwise contact data, corresponding to distinct physical limits, and argue that a comparison between data and prediction can lead to biological insight. We test these predictors for two simulated polymer models with cross-linking or loop-extrusion, and find that simulated three-point contacts are only predicted by the physically appropriate approximation. Finally, we apply our approach to previously published experimental multi-contact data from human chromosomes. Strikingly, we discover that observed three-point contact frequencies are well predicted by a formula based on loop-extrusion, suggesting that multi-contact data can give insight into chromosome organization mechanisms.",

Two excavation seasons in 2019 and 2020 revealed a stratigraphical sequence composed of intact archaeological surfaces attributed to the  Arkov-Divshon cultural entity of the arid southern Levant. We present the faunal assemblages from the site, which are rare among the desert sites due to preservation problems. Our results suggest that the residents of the site exploited prime adult caprines (Capra cf. Capra ibex), but were also engaged in hunting of gazelles (Gazella cf. Gazella gazella), whose carcasses were selectively transported to the site and processed for within-bone nutrients. Long-range hunting trips are suggested by the body-part selection in relatively small bovids, and by the presence of species representing wetter habitat patches 20-30 km north of the site. The bi-focal emphasis on generalized gazelle and age-specific caprine hunting, is unique among Late Pleistocene sites from the Levant. The proportion of caprines increases through the stratigraphic sequence, suggesting more specialized economy through time and in inverse relations to site use intensity.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) comprise the lumenal lining of all blood vessels and are critical for the functioning of the cardiovascular system. Their phenotypes can be modulated by protein isoforms. To characterize the isoform landscape within ECs, we applied a long read proteogenomics approach to analyze human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Transcripts delineated from PacBio sequencing serve as the basis for a sample-specific protein database used for downstream MS analysis to infer protein isoform expression. We detected 53,836 transcript isoforms from 10,426 genes, with 22,195 of those transcripts being novel. Furthermore, the predominant isoform in HUVECs does not correspond with the accepted \"reference isoform\" 25% of the time, with vascular pathway-related genes among this group. We found 2,597 protein isoforms supported through unique peptides, with an additional 2,280 isoforms nominated upon incorporation of long-read transcript evidence. We characterized a novel alternative acceptor for endothelial-related gene CDH5, suggesting potential changes in its associated signaling pathways. Finally, we identified novel protein isoforms arising from a diversity of splicing mechanisms supported by uniquely mapped novel peptides. Our results represent a high resolution atlas of known and novel isoforms of potential relevance to endothelial phenotypes and function.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/490813v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86ca88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15ab038org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7553borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18cbae8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

A key issue with these proteins is their structure-function relationships since they present intrinsic regulatory features that rely on structural determinants, including pH-sensitivity and the stoichiometry of ion exchange. Crystal structures are only available for prokaryotic CPA, whereas the eukaryotic ones have been modeled using the former as templates. Here we show an updated and improved structural model of the tonoplast-localized K+,Na+/H+ antiporter NHX1 of Arabidopsis as a representative of the vacuolar NHX family that is key to the accumulation of K+ into plant vacuoles. Conserved residues judged as functionally important were mutated and the resulting protein variants were tested for activity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results indicate that residue N184 in the ND-motif characteristic of CPA1 could be replaced by the DD-motif of CPA2 family members with minimal consequences on activity, yet this residue may help to regulate the optimal pH range of the exchanger. Attempts to alter the electroneutrality of AtNHX1 by different combinations of amino acid replacements at N184, R353 and R390 residues resulted in inactive or partly active proteins with differential ability to control the vacuolar pH of the yeast.",

Here, using newly generated and public RNA-Seq data, we monitor circRNA expression throughout circadian rhythm in various mouse brain regions. We demonstrate that Cdr1as, despite its stable character, has a highly dynamic expression during the circadian cycle in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Cdr1as is one of the highest expressed RNAs in a cluster associated with light-induced synaptic transmission and phase shift in the SCN. Further, we identified that another brain enriched circRNA, mbl, is also substantially deregulated upon light induction in the fly head.

No effort has been made to unify tools for analyzing high-content phenotypic imaging data of worms and provide a platform for future extensibility. We have developed wrmXpress, a unified framework for analyzing a variety of phenotypes matched to high-content experimental assays of free-living and parasitic nematodes and flatworms. We demonstrate its utility for analyzing a suite of phenotypes, including motility, development/size, and feeding, and establish the package as a platform upon which to build future custom phenotypic modules, including those that incorporate deep learning techniques.

To gain insight into the activity of lysogenic phages within the context of their host genomes, we performed Hi-C on the 12 strains of the OMM12 synthetic bacterial community stably associated within mice gut (gnotobiotic mouse line OMM12) in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. High-resolution contact maps of the chromosome 3D organization of the bacterial genomes revealed a wide diversity of architectures, differences between environments and an overall stability over time in the gut of mice. The DNA contacts also pointed at 3D signatures of prophages leading to predict 16 of them as functional. We identified circularization signals and observed different 3D patterns depending on the condition. Concurrent virome analysis showed that 11 of these prophages produced viral particles in vivo and/or in vitro, and that OMM12 mice do not carry other intestinal viruses. By predicting functional prophages, the Hi-C approach unlocks the study of phage-bacteria interaction dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Pathophysiology associated with Huntingtons disease (HD) has been studied extensively in various cell and animal models since the 1993 discovery of the mutant huntingtin (mHtt) with abnormally expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts as the causative factor. However, the sequence of early pathophysiological events leading to HD still remains elusive. To gain new insights into the polyQ-induced early pathogenic events, we expressed Htt exon1 (Httex1) with a normal (21), or an extended (42 or 63) number of polyQ in tobacco plants, which lack an Htt ortholog to avoid any associated effects from endogenous Htt. Here, we show that transgenic plants accumulated Httex1 proteins with corresponding polyQ tracts, and that mHttex1 induced protein aggregation and affected plant growth, especially root and root hair development, in a polyQ length-dependent manner. Quantitative proteomic analysis of young roots from severely affected Httex1Q63 and unaffected Httex1Q21 plants showed that the most impaired protein by polyQ63 is a GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) along with many its related one-carbon (C1) metabolic pathway enzymes. GTPCH is a key enzyme involved in folate biosynthesis in plants and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis in mammals. Validating studies in 4-week-old R6/2 HD mice expressing a mHttex1 showed reduced levels of GTPCH and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, a key folate utilization/alternate BH4 biosynthesis enzyme), and impaired C1 and BH4 metabolisms. Our findings from mHttex1 plants and mice reveal impaired expressions of GTPCH and DHFR and contribute to a better understanding of mHtt-altered C1 metabolism and C1 interconnected BH4 metabolism leading to the pathogenesis of HD.",

Here, we report on the function of Smarce1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex, through the phenotypic analysis of homozygous mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells. Disruption of Smarce1 induced the dissociation of other complex components from the SWI/SNF complex. Histone binding to DNA was loosened in homozygous mutant ES cells, indicating that disruption of Smarce1 decreased nucleosome stability. Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis suggested an ectopic genomic distribution of the SWI/SNF complex, accounting for the misregulation of chromatin conformations. Unstable nucleosomes remained during ES cell differentiation, impairing the heterochromatin formation that is characteristic of the differentiation process. These results suggest that Smarce1 guides the SWI/SNF complex to the appropriate genomic regions to generate chromatin structures adequate for transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic morphogenesis is powered by dramatic changes in cell shape and arrangement, driven by the cytoskeleton and its connections to adherens junctions. This requires robust linkage, allowing morphogenesis without disrupting tissue integrity. The small GTPase Rap1 is a key regulator of cell adhesion, controlling both cadherin-mediated and integrin-mediated processes. We have defined multiple roles in morphogenesis for one Rap1 effector, Canoe/Afadin, which ensures robust junction-cytoskeletal linkage. We now ask what mechanisms regulate Canoe and other junction-cytoskeletal linkers during Drosophila morphogenesis, defining roles for Rap1 and one of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) regulators, Dizzy. Rap1 uses Canoe as one effector, regulating junctional planar polarity. However, Rap1 has additional roles in junctional protein localization and balanced apical constriction--in its absence, Bazooka/Par3 localization is fragmented, and cells next to mitotic cells apically constrict and invaginate, disrupting epidermal integrity. In contrast, the GEF Dizzy has phenotypes similar to but slightly less severe than Canoe loss, suggesting this GEF regulates Rap1 action via Canoe. Taken together, these data reveal that Rap1 is a crucial regulator of morphogenesis, likely acting in parallel via Canoe and other effectors, and that different Rap1 GEFs regulate distinct functions of Rap1.",

Enteritidis strains were divided into three phylogenetic clades (A, B and C). Clades A and C represented 16.4% and 3.5% of the total isolates, respectively, and were of local origin. Clade B accounted for 80.1% of the isolates which belonged to seven previously defined lineages but was dominated by the global epidemic lineage (MGT4-CC1). At MGT5 level, three out of five top sequence types (STs) in Australia were also top STs in Asia, suggesting that a fair proportion of Australian S. Enteritidis cases may be epidemiologically linked with Asian strains. In 2018, a large egg-associated local outbreak was caused by a recently defined clade B lineage prevalent in Europe and was closely related, but not directly linked, to three isolates from Europe. Additionally, antimicrobial-resistance genes were only found in Australian clade B isolates, with a predicted multidrug resistance (MDR) rate of 11.7%. Over half (54.8%) of the MDR isolates belonged to 10 MDR-associated MGT-STs, which were also frequent in Asian S. Enteritidis. IncX1 plasmids were frequently present in the Australian MDR isolates. Overall, this study investigated the genomic epidemiology of S. Enteritidis in Australia, including the first large local outbreak, using MGT. The open MGT platform enables a standardised and sharable nomenclature that can be effectively applied to public health for unified surveillance of S. Enteritidis nationally and globally.\n\nImportanceSalmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is a leading cause of foodborne infections. We previously developed a genomic typing database - MGTdb for S. Enteritidis to facilitate global surveillance of this pathogen. In this study we examined the genomic features of Australian S. Enteritidis using the MGTdb and found that Australian S. Enteritidis is mainly epidemiologically linked with Asian strains (especially strains carrying antimicrobial resistance genes) followed by European strains. The first large-scale egg-associated local outbreak in Australia was caused by a recently defined lineage prevalent in Europe, and three European isolates in the MGTdb were closely related but not directly linked to this outbreak. In summary, the S. Enteritidis MGTdb open platform is shown to be a potential powerful tool for national and global public health surveillance of this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The biodiversity of Ecuadorian stingless bees is almost 200 species. Traditional pot-honey harvest in Ecuador is mostly done from nests of the three genera selected here Geotrigona Moure, 1942, Melipona, Illiger, 1806 and Scaptotrigona, Moure 1943. The 20 pot-honey samples collected from cerumen pots and three ethnic honeys \"abeja de tierra\", \"bermejo\", and \"cushillomishki\" were analyzed for qualitative and quantitative 1H-NMR honey profiling and for the Honey Authenticity Test by Interphase Emulsion (HATIE). Extensive data of targeted organic compounds (41 parameters) was identified, quantified and described. The three honey types were compared by ANOVA. Amino acids, ethanol, hydroxymethylfurfural, aliphatic organic acids, sugars, and markers of botanical or entomological origin. The number of phases observed with the HATIE was one in Scaptotrigona and three in Geotrigona and Melipona honeys. Acetic acid (19.60 {+/-} 1.45 g/kg) and lactic acid (24.30 {+/-} 1.65 g/kg) were particularly high in Geotrigona honey (in contrast to 1.3 g/kg acetic acid and 1.6 g/kg lactic acid in Melipona and Scaptotrigona), with the lowest fructose + glucose (18.39 {+/-} 1.68) g/100g honey compared to Melipona (52.87 {+/-} 1.75) and Scaptotrigona (52.17 {+/-} 0.60). Three local honeys were tested using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), two were assigned with a correct declared bee origin, but \"bermejo\" was not a Melipona and grouped with the Scaptotrigona cluster. However, after HCA (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis), the three kinds of honey were positioned in the Melipona-Scaptotrigona cluster. This research supports the targeted NMR-based profiling in pot-honey metabolomics approach for multi-parameter visualization of organic compounds, descriptive and pertained multivariate statistics (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis HCA, and Principal Component Analysis PCA) to discriminate the stingless bee genus in a set of Geotrigona, Melipona and Scaptotrigona honey types. The NMR characterization of Ecuadorian honey produced by stingless bees is a contribution to the needed regulatory norms. A final note on searching stingless bee markers in pot-honey metabolites that may become nutritional trait candidates for phylogeny. Scaptotrigona honey revealed biosurfactant activity in the HATIE, originating a fingerprint Honey Biosurfactant Test (HBT) for the genus in this set of pot-honeys.",

    "abstract": "The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) sterol transporters are responsible for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in mammals by participating in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) or transintestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE). The heterodimeric ABCG5/G8 carries out selective sterol excretion, preventing the abnormal accumulation of plant sterols in human bodies, while homodimeric ABCG1 contributes to the biogenesis and metabolism of high-density lipoproteins. A sterol-binding site on ABCG5/G8 was proposed at the interface of the transmembrane domain and the core of lipid bilayers. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of ABCG5/G8 in a cholesterol-bound state. The structure combined with amino acid sequence analysis shows that in the proximity of the sterol-binding site, a highly conserved phenylalanine array supports functional implications for ABCG cholesterol/sterol transporters. Lastly, in silico docking analysis of cholesterol and stigmasterol (a plant sterol) suggests sterol-binding selectivity on ABCG5/G8, but not ABCG1. Together, our results provide a structural basis for cholesterol binding on ABCG5/G8 and the sterol selectivity by ABCG transporters.",

    "abstract": "NtrC family of proteins sense external stimuli and accordingly stimulate stress and virulence pathways via activation of associated {sigma}54-dependent RNA polymerases. Here, we establish that MopR, an NtrC protein, harbors a dynamic bi-directional electrostatic network that connects the phenol pocket to two distal regions, namely the \"G-hinge\" and the \"allo-steric-linker\". While G-hinge influences the entry of phenol, the allosteric-linker passes the signal to the downstream ATPase domain. Phenol binding induces a rewiring of the electrostatic connections by eliciting dynamic allostery, and it was demonstrated that perturbation of the core relay residues results in a complete loss of ATPase stimulation. A mutation of the G-hinge,[~]20[A] from the phenol pocket, demonstrated altered flexibility by shifting the pattern of conformational states accessed, leading to a protein with 7-fold enhanced phenol binding ability and enhanced transcriptional activation. A global analysis illustrates that dynamic allostery-driven conserved community networks are universal and evolutionarily conserved across species.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a lipidomic analysis of the whole body of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes at different time points over the course of feeding and reproduction. There were temporal biphasic increases of more than 80% of lipids identified at the time of feeding and from 16 h to 30 h post blood meal. During these two increases, the abundance of many lipids dropped while body weight remained stable, probably reflecting blood lipid digestion and the synthesis of vitellogenin in this period. A concerted temporal pattern was particularly strong at the second peak for membrane and signalling lipids such as PE, PI, CL, HexCer and LPA. Lyso-glycerophospholipids showed three distinct change patterns which are functionally related: LPE and LPC, which are membrane lipids, showed little change; LPA, a signalling lipid, showed a dramatic increase from 16 to 30 h PBM; LPI, a bioactive lipid, and both LPG and LPS which are bacterial membrane lipids, showed one significant increase from the time of feeding to 16 hours post blood meal. The result of our study on the anautogenous insect Ae. aegypti point to specific lipids likely to be important in the reproductive process with a role in the formation and growth of ovarian follicles.",

Evaluating the effects of the many possible amino acid changes to guide such projects is a significant task, even with recent advances in experimental and computational approaches. Here, we apply a computational model, GMMA, to extract substitution effects from a cost-effective genetic screen of a randomly mutated protein library. Using a high mutation frequency, the method can map stability effects of even very stable proteins for which conventional selection systems have reached their limit. Thus, we screened a mutant library of a highly stable and optimised model protein using an in vivo genetic sensor for folding and assigned a stability effect to 374 of 912 possible single amino acid substitutions. Combining the top 9 substitutions increased the thermodynamic stability by almost 50% in a single engineering step. This illustrates the capability of the method, which is applicable to any screen for protein function.",

HIF1 closely interacts with PPAR{gamma}, the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, but there are conflicting results how this co-regulation controls the excessive lipid accumulation that drives adipocyte dysfunction. Using single-cell imaging and modeling, we find that, surprisingly, HIF1 both promotes and represses lipid accumulation during adipogenesis. We show that the opposing roles of HIF1 are isolated from each other and depend on when HIF1 increases relative to the positive-feedback mediated upregulation of PPAR{gamma} that drives adipocyte differentiation.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGut microbiotas play a pivotal role in host physiology and behaviour, and may affect host life-history traits such as seasonal variation in host phenotypic state. Generally, seasonal gut microbiota variation is attributed to seasonal diet variation. However, seasonal temperature and day length variation may also drive gut microbiota variation. We investigated summer-winter differences in gut microbiota in 14 homing pigeons living outdoors under a constant diet by collecting cloacal swabs in both seasons during two years. Because temperature effects may be mediated by host metabolism, we determined basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body mass. Immune competence is influenced by day length and has a close relationship with gut microbiota, and it may thus be a link between day length and gut microbiota. Therefore, we measured seven innate immune indices. We expected gut microbiota to show summer-winter differences and gut microbiota to correlate with metabolism and immune indices.\n\nResultsBMR, body mass, and two immune indices varied seasonally, other host factors did not. Gut microbiota showed differences between seasons and sexes, and correlated with metabolism and immune indices. The most abundant genus (Lachnoclostridium 12, 12%) and associated higher taxa, were more abundant in winter, though not significantly at the phylum level, Firmicutes. Bacteroidetes were more abundant in summer. The Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio tended to be higher in winter. The KEGG ortholog functions for fatty acid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism (PICRUSt2) had increased abundances in winter.\n\nConclusionsThe gut microbiota of homing pigeons varied seasonally, even under a constant diet. The correlations between immune indices and gut microbiota did not involve consistently specific immune indices and included only one of the two immune indices that showed seasonal differences, suggesting that immune competence may be an unlikely link between day length and gut microbiota. The correlations between gut microbiota and metabolism indices, the higher Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in winter, and the resemblance of the summer-winter differences in gut microbiota with the general temperature effects on gut microbiota in the literature, suggest that temperature partly drove the summer-winter differences in gut microbiota in homing pigeons.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms terminating phytoplankton blooms are often not well understood. Potentially involved processes such as consumption by grazers, flocculation, and viral lysis each have different post-bloom consequences on the processing of the organic material, therefore it is important to develop a better understanding of the relevance of these processes, and potential interactions between them. In this study, we present a model-based analysis of a spring bloom observed in a mesocosm experiment. The intermediate-complexity (27-state variable) numerical model we extended from an earlier version to this end can resolve C, N, P and Si cycles, and relevant processes like formation of various organic material size classes (low and high molecular weight (hereafter small and large) dissolved organic carbon (DOC), transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), and small/large detritus) and their degradation by two bacterial sub-communities (free-living and particle-attached) and planktonic protists (heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates). The model can explain > 90% of the variation of a rich set of observations consisting of 11 independent variables over the course of 13 days during which a bloom largely dominated by diatoms develops, and disappears almost entirely. Fluxes estimated by the model point to the importance of coagulation (TEP formation) as a sink term for DOC, and a source term for POC. Consequently, aggregation with TEPs constitute an important loss term for phytoplankton. The flocculated phytoplankton, and detrital material, in turn become rapidly degraded by the particle attached bacteria and other protist heterotrophs. Through a scenario analysis, the relevance of nutrient-stress enhanced lysis rates; alterations between small and large DOC in phytoplankton exudates; and coagulation of smaller DOC molecules were investigated. Our results suggest that the former two processes have negligible effects in isolation, but when combined with the latter, they can synergistically cause substantial deviations in TEP formation, hence, in flocculation rates; and consequently in the peak magnitude of the diatom bloom, and in timing of its termination. Our results point to a need for better understanding of processes governing the termination of phytoplankton blooms, their inter-dependencies, and consequences on the global biogeochemical cycles.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining the integrity of the chromosome after the completion of each cell cycle is paramount for bacterial survival. Mechanistic details remain incomplete for how bacteria manage to retain intact chromosomes in each daughter cell after each cell division. In this study, we examined the partitioning protein ParA and its functions on chromosomal maintenance that go beyond triggering the onset of chromosome segregation. Our data demonstrate that ParA can promote the onset of chromosome replication initiation in Caulobacter crescentus cells with sub-physiological levels of the replication initiator protein DnaA. Increasing the cellular levels of ParA results in over-initiation of chromosome replication in this bacterium. We show that the ability of ParA to impact replication initiation is independent from ParAs ability to trigger the onset of chromosome segregation. Surprisingly, our work revealed that perturbing the balance of the components of ParAs nucleotide-dependent cycle can have severe defects in cell cycle coordination and can potentially be lethal to the cell. Increasing the levels of different forms of ParA also impacted cell length independent of their replication initiation frequencies. Our results, together with past observations, suggest a model where ParA can serve as a checkpoint coordinating various cell cycle events involved in maintenance of the chromosome.",

    "abstract": "The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) - the largest coral reef ecosystem in the world - supports over 1200 fish species with some of the highest population densities and diversities seen in vertebrates, offering a high potential for virus transmission among species. As such, the GBR represents an exceptional natural ecosystem to determine the impact of host community diversity on virus evolution and emergence. In recent decades the GBR has also experienced significant threats of extinction, making it one of the most vulnerable ecosystems on the planet. However, our understanding of virus diversity and connectivity in tropical reef fishes remains poor. Here, we employed metatranscriptomic sequencing to reveal the viromes of 61 reef fish species. This identified a total of 132 viruses, 38 of which were vertebrate-associated and therefore likely infecting the fish, including a novel isolate of Santee-cooper ranavirus (Iridoviridae). Notably, we found little evidence for virus transmission between fish species living within a very restricted geographical space - a 100 m2 coral reef ecosystem - suggesting that there might be important host genetic barriers to successful cross-species transmission despite regular exposure. We also identified differences in virome composition between reef fish families, such that cryptobenthic reef fishes - characterized by small body sizes and short life-spans - exhibited greater virome richness compared to large reef fishes. This study suggests that there are important barriers to cross-species transmission, and that successful emergence in a reef fish community likely requires active host adaptation, even among closely related host species.",

    "abstract": "Azole drugs target fungal sterol biosynthesis and are used to treat millions of human fungal infections each year. Resistance to azole drugs has emerged in multiple fungal pathogens including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Aspergillus fumigatus. The most well-studied resistance mechanism in A. fumigatus arises from missense mutations in the coding sequence combined with a tandem repeat in the promoter of cyp51A, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme in the fungal sterol biosynthesis pathway. Filamentous members of Ascomycota such as A. fumigatus have either one or two of three Cyp51 paralogs (Cyp51A, Cyp51B, and Cyp51C). Most previous research in A. fumigatus has focused on Cyp51A due to its role in azole resistance. We used the A. fumigatus Cyp51A protein sequence as the query in database searches to identify Cyp51 proteins across Fungi. We found 435 Cyp51 proteins in 301 species spanning from early-diverging fungi (Blastocladiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Zoopagomycota and Mucormycota) to late-diverging fungi (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). We found these sequences formed 4 major Cyp51 groups: Cyp51, Cyp51A, Cyp51B, and Cyp51C. Surprisingly, we found all filamentous Ascomycota had a Cyp51B paralog, while only 50% had a Cyp51A paralog. We created maximum likelihood trees to investigate the evolution of Cyp51 in Fungi. Our results suggest Cyp51 is present in all fungi with three paralogs emerging in Pezizomycotina, including Cyp51C which appears to have diverged from the progenitor of the Cyp51A and Cyp51B groups.\n\nAuthor SummaryEach year millions of people are infected by a fungal pathogen and receive antifungal treatment with azole drugs. Resistance to azole drugs is becoming increasingly prevalent and is mostly caused by mutations in the azole drug target, Cyp51. Aspergillus fumigatus is an airborne fungal pathogen that causes more than 600,000 deaths every year. Azole resistance in A. fumigatus is primarily driven by a promoter repeat coupled with mutations in cyp51A. In our study, we found 435 Cyp51 proteins in 4 major groups across Fungi, with some species having multiple Cyp51 proteins (Cyp51, Cyp51A, Cyp51B, and Cyp51C). Although most research in A. fumigatus has focused on Cyp51A, we found Cyp51B in all filamentous Ascomycota fungi showing it is more conserved than Cyp51A and likely plays a vital role in these fungi.\n\nAuthor Summary (Shortened)Resistance to azole drugs is becoming increasingly prevalent and is mostly caused by mutations in the azole drug target, Cyp51. Azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus is primarily driven by a promoter repeat coupled with mutations in cyp51A. We found 435 Cyp51 proteins in 4 major groups across Fungi, with some species having multiple Cyp51 proteins (Cyp51, Cyp51A, Cyp51B, and Cyp51C). Although most research focuses on Cyp51A, we found Cyp51B in all filamentous Ascomycota fungi showing its more conserved than Cyp51A.",

    "abstract": "The prevalent paradigm governing bacterial two-component signaling systems (TCSs) is specificity, wherein the histidine kinase (HK) of a TCS exclusively activates its cognate response regulator (RR). Crosstalk, where HKs activate noncognate RRs, is considered evolutionarily disadvantageous because it can compromise adaptive responses by leaking signals. Yet, crosstalk is observed in several bacteria. Here, to resolve this paradox, we propose an alternative paradigm where crosstalk can be advantageous. We envisioned  programmed environments, wherein signals appear in predefined sequences. In such environments, crosstalk that primes bacteria to upcoming signals may improve adaptive responses and confer evolutionary benefits. To test this hypothesis, we employed mathematical modeling of TCS signaling networks and stochastic evolutionary dynamics simulations. We considered the comprehensive set of bacterial phenotypes, comprising thousands of distinct crosstalk patterns, competing in varied signaling environments. Our simulations predicted that in programmed environments phenotypes with crosstalk facilitating priming would outcompete phenotypes without crosstalk. In environments where signals appear randomly, bacteria without crosstalk would dominate, explaining the specificity widely seen. Additionally, a testable prediction was that the phenotypes selected in programmed environments would display  one-way crosstalk, ensuring priming to  future signals. Interestingly, the crosstalk networks we deduced from available data on TCSs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis all displayed one-way crosstalk, offering strong support to our predictions. Our study thus identifies potential evolutionary underpinnings of crosstalk in bacterial TCSs, suggests a reconciliation of specificity and crosstalk, makes testable predictions of the nature of crosstalk patterns selected, and has implications for understanding bacterial adaptation and the response to interventions.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria use two-component signaling systems (TCSs) to sense and respond to environmental changes. The prevalent paradigm governing TCSs is specificity, where signal flow through TCSs is insulated; leakage to other TCSs is considered evolutionarily disadvantageous. Yet, crosstalk between TCSs is observed in many bacteria. Here, we present a potential resolution of this paradox. We envision programmed environments, wherein stimuli appear in predefined sequences. Crosstalk that primes bacteria to upcoming stimuli could then confer evolutionary benefits. We demonstrate this benefit using mathematical modeling and evolutionary simulations. Interestingly, we found signatures of predicted crosstalk patterns in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, specificity was selected in environments where stimuli occurred randomly, thus reconciling specificity and crosstalk. Implications follow for understanding bacterial evolution and for interventions.",

    "abstract": "The PII superfamily consists of widespread signal transduction proteins found in all domains of life. In addition to canonical PII proteins involved in C/N sensing, structurally similar PII-like proteins evolved to fulfill diverse, yet poorly understood cellular functions. In cyanobacteria, the bicarbonate transporter SbtA is expressed with the conserved PII-like protein, SbtB, to augment intracellular Ci levels for efficient CO2-fixation. We identified SbtB as a sensor of various adenine nucleotides including the second messenger nucleotides cAMP, known as carbon-status indicator, and c-di-AMP, involved in global cellular homeostasis. Moreover, many SbtB proteins possess a C-terminal extension with a disulfide bridge. We previously implied a redox-regulatory function of this extension, which we now call R-loop. Here, we reveal an unusual ATP/ADP apyrase (diphosphohydrolase) activity of SbtB that is controlled by the R-loop. We followed the sequence of the hydrolysis reactions from ATP over ADP to AMP in crystal-lographic snapshots and reveal the structural mechanism by which changes of the R-loop redox state modulate apyrase activity. We further gathered evidence that this redox state is controlled by thioredoxin TrxA, suggesting that it is generally linked to cellular metabolism. Finally, we present a refined model of how SbtB regulates SbtA activity, in which both the apyrase activity and its redox regulation play a central role. This highlights SbtB as a central switch-point in cyanobacterial cell physiology, integrating not only signals from the energy state (adenyl-nucleotide binding) and the carbon supply via cAMP binding, but also from the day/night status reported by the C-terminal redox-switch.",

    "abstract": "RationaleVascular beds have distinct susceptibility to atherosclerosis and aneurysm, yet the biological underpinnings of vascular bed specific disease risk are largely unknown. Vascular tissues have different developmental origins which may influence global chromatin accessibility. Understanding chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles on single cell resolution is crucial to gain insight into vascular bed specific disease risk.\n\nObjectiveWe aim to understand, at single cell resolution, the global chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles across distinct vascular beds in the healthy adult mouse to provide insight into the potential mechanisms of vascular bed specific disease risk.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe performed single cell chromatin accessibility (scATACseq) and gene expression profiling (scRNAseq) of healthy adult mouse vascular tissue from three vascular beds, 1) aortic root and ascending aorta, 2) brachiocephalic and carotid artery, and 3) descending thoracic aorta. By integrating datasets and comparing vascular beds within cell type, we identified thousands of differentially accessible chromatin peaks within smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, demonstrating numerous enhancers to be vascular bed specific. We revealed an epigenetic  memory of embryonic origin with differential chromatin accessibility of key developmental transcription factors such as Tbx20, Hand2, Gata4, and Hoxb family members. Increased transcription factor motif accessibility in ascending fibroblasts compared to descending further highlights SMAD2/3 functions and suggests a differential susceptibility to TGF{beta}. By isolating primary adventitial fibroblasts from ascending and descending thoracic aorta from adult mice, we demonstrate ascending fibroblasts to have a distinctly higher transcriptional response to TGF{beta} compared to descending fibroblasts, highlighting that distinct chromatin accessibility between vascular beds is retained following primary in vitro culture and influences responsiveness to disease relevant signaling.\n\nConclusionsThis work supports a paradigm that the epigenomic and transcriptional landscapes of vascular cells are cell type and vascular bed specific and that differentially accessible regions are enriched for disease risk genes.",

    "abstract": "Over the course of an individuals lifetime, genomic alterations accumulate in somatic cells. However, the mutational landscape by retrotranspositions of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1), a widespread mobile element in the human genome, is poorly understood in normal cells. Here, we explored the whole-genome sequences of 892 single-cell clones established from various tissues collected from 28 individuals. Remarkably, 88% of colorectal epithelial cells acquired somatic L1 retrotranspositions (soL1Rs), carrying [~]3 events per cell on average with substantial intra- and inter-individual variances, which was accelerated at least 10-fold during tumourigenesis. Breakpoints of soL1Rs suggested that a few variant mechanisms can be involved in the L1 retrotransposition processes. Fingerprinting of donor L1s using source-specific unique sequences revealed 34 hot L1s, 44% of which were newly discovered in this study, and many ultra-rare hot L1s in the human population showed higher retrotransposition potential in somatic lineages than common sources. Multi-dimensional analysis of soL1Rs with early embryonic developmental relationships, genome-wide methylation, and gene expression profiles of the clones demonstrated that (1) soL1Rs occur from early embryogenesis at a substantial rate, (2) epigenetic activation of hot L1s is stochastically acquired during the wave of early global epigenomic reprogramming, rather than by the sporadic loss-of-methylation at the late stage, and (3) most L1 transcripts in the cytoplasm do not generate soL1Rs in somatic lineages. In summary, this study provides insights into the retrotransposition dynamics of L1s in the human genome and the resultant somatic mosaicism in normal human cells.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation using heterobifunctional Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) or molecular glues has arisen as a powerful therapeutic modality for degrading disease targets. While PROTAC design is becoming more modular and straightforward, the discovery of novel molecular glue degraders has been more challenging. While several recent studies have showcased phenotypic screening and counter-screening approaches to discover new molecular glue degraders, mechanistically elucidating the ternary complex induced by the small-molecule that led to the initial phenotype--i.e. identifying the degraded target and relevant components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system--has remained cumbersome and laborious. To overcome these obstacles, we have coupled the screening of a covalent ligand library for anti-proliferative effects in leukemia cells with quantitative proteomic and chemoproteomic approaches to rapidly discover both novel covalent molecular glue degraders and their associated ternary complex components and anti-proliferative mechanisms. We have identified a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand EN450 that impairs leukemia cell viability in a NEDDylation and proteasome-dependent manner. Chemoproteomic profiling revealed covalent interaction of EN450 with an allosteric C111 in the E2 ubiquitin ligase UBE2D. Follow-up quantitative proteomic profiling revealed the proteasome-mediated degradation of the oncogenic transcription factor NFKB1 as a putative degradation target. Subsequent validation studies demonstrated that EN450 induced the ternary complex formation between UBE2D and NFKB1 and that both UBE2D and NFKB1 were important for the anti-proliferative mechanisms of EN450. Our study thus puts forth the discovery of a novel molecular glue degrader that uniquely induced the proximity of an E2 ligase with a transcription factor to induce its degradation and anti-proliferative effects in cancer cells. Taken more broadly, our study showcases a rapid and modular approach for discovering novel covalent molecular glue degraders and their respective ternary complex components in an unbiased fashion.",

    "abstract": "AimsInducible Co-Stimulator (ICOS), an immune costimulatory molecule, has been found to play an essential role across various malignancies. This study investigated the transcriptome profile and clinical characterization of ICOS in gliomas.\n\nMethodsClinical information and transcriptome data of 301 glioma samples were downloaded from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) data set for analysis. Furthermore, the results were validated in 697 samples with RNAseq data from the TCGA glioma data set. In addition, single-cell sequencing data from CGGA and GSE 163108 datasets were used to analyze the ICOS expression across different cell types. Statistical analyses and figure production were performed with R-language.\n\nResultsWe found that ICOS was significantly upregulated in higher-grade, IDH wildtype, and mesenchymal subtype of gliomas. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that ICOS was mainly involved in glioma-related immune response. Moreover, ICOS showed a robust correlation with other immune checkpoints, including PD1/PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway, CTLA4, ICOSL (ICOS ligand), and IDO1. Furthermore, based on seven clusters of metagenes, GSVA identified that ICOS was tightly associated with HCK, LCK, MHC-I, MHC-II, STAT1, and interferon, especially with LCK, suggesting a strong correlation between ICOS and T-cell activity in gliomas. In cell lineage analysis, ICOS-higher gliomas tended to recruit dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages into the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell sequencing analysis indicated that ICOS was highly expressed by regulatory T cells (Treg). Finally, patients with higher ICOS had shortened survival. ICOS was an independent prognosticator for glioma patients.\n\nConclusionsHigher ICOS was correlated with more malignancy of gliomas and significantly associated with Treg activity among glioma-related immune responses. Moreover, ICOS could contribute as an independent prognostic factor for gliomas. Our study highlighted the role of ICOS in glioma and may facilitate therapeutic strategies targeting ICOS for glioma.",

    "abstract": "Janus kinases (JAKs) mediate cytokine signaling, cell growth and hematopoietic differentiation.1 Gain-of-function mutations activating JAK2 signaling are seen in the majority of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients, most commonly due to the JAK2V617F driver allele.2 While clinically-approved JAK inhibitors improve symptoms and outcomes in MPNs, remissions are rare, and mutant allele burden does not substantively change with chronic JAK inhibitor therapy in most patients.3, 4 This has been postulated to be due to incomplete dependence on constitutive JAK/STAT signaling, alternative signaling pathways, and/or the presence of cooperating disease alleles;5 however we hypothesize this is due to the inability of current JAK inhibitors to potently and specifically abrogate mutant JAK2 signaling. We therefore developed a conditionally inducible mouse model allowing for sequential activation, and then inactivation, of Jak2V617F from its endogenous locus using a Dre-rox/Cre-lox dual orthogonal recombinase system. Deletion of oncogenic Jak2V617Fabrogates the MPN disease phenotype, induces mutant-specific cell loss including in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and extends overall survival to an extent not observed with pharmacologic JAK inhibition. Furthermore, reversal of Jak2V617F in MPN cells with antecedent loss of Tet26, 7 abrogates the MPN phenotype and inhibits mutant stem cell persistence suggesting cooperating epigenetic-modifying alleles do not alter dependence on mutant JAK/STAT signaling. Our results suggest that mutant-specific inhibition of JAK2V617F represents the best therapeutic approach for JAK2V617F-mutant MPN and demonstrate the therapeutic relevance of a dual-recombinase system to assess mutant-specific oncogenic dependencies in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Deinococcus radiodurans is a deep-branching extremophilic bacterium that is remarkably tolerant to numerous environmental stresses, including large doses of ultraviolet radiation and extreme temperatures. It can even survive in outer space for several years. This endurance of D. radiodurans has been partly ascribed to its atypical cell envelope comprising an inner membrane, a large periplasmic space with a thick peptidoglycan (PG) layer, and an outer membrane (OM) covered by a surface layer (S-layer). Despite intense research, molecular principles governing envelope organization and OM stabilization are unclear in D. radiodurans and related bacteria. Here, we report an electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the abundant D. radiodurans OM protein SlpA, showing how its C-terminal segment forms homotrimers of 30-stranded {beta}-barrels in the OM, whereas its N-terminal segment forms long, homotrimeric coiled coils linking the OM to the PG layer via S-layer homology (SLH) domains. Using the power of structure prediction and sequence-based bioinformatics, we further show that SlpA-like proteins are widespread in deep-branching Gram-negative bacteria, plausibly constituting an ancestral superfamily of OM-PG connectors, important for organizing the cell envelopes of many bacteria. Finally, combining our atomic structures with tomography of cell envelopes, we report a model for the cell surface of D. radiodurans, with implications on understanding the cell surface organization and hyperstability of D. radiodurans and related bacteria. Furthermore, the widespread occurrence of SlpA-like OM-PG connectors in deep-branching bacteria will help in understanding the evolutionary transition between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Widespread mapping of coral thermal resilience is essential for developing effective management strategies and requires replicable and rapid multi-location assays of heat resistance and recovery. One- or two-day short-term heat stress experiments have been previously employed to assess heat resistance, followed by single assays of bleaching condition. We tested the reliability of short-term heat stress resistance, and linked resistance and recovery assays, by monitoring the post short-term heat stress phenotypic response of fragments from 101 Acropora hyacinthus colonies located in Palau (Micronesia). Following short-term heat stress, bleaching and mortality were recorded after 16 hours, daily for seven days, and after months one and two into recovery. To follow corals over time, we utilized a qualitative, non-destructive visual bleaching score metric that correlated with standard symbiont retention assays. The bleaching state of coral nubbins 16 hours post-heat stress was highly indicative of their state over the next 7 days, suggesting that symbiont population sizes within corals may quickly stabilize post-heat stress. Bleaching 16 hours post-heat stress predicted likelihood of mortality over the subsequent 3-5 days, after which there was little additional mortality. Together, bleaching and mortality suggested that rapid assays of the phenotypic response following short-term heat stress were good metrics of the total heat treatment effect. Additionally, our data confirm geographic patterns of intraspecific variation in Palau and show that bleaching severity among colonies was highly correlated with mortality over the first week post-stress. We found high survival (98%) and visible recoverability (100%) two months after heat stress among coral nubbins that survived the first week post-stress. These findings help simplify rapid, widespread surveys of heat sensitivity in Acropora hyacinthus by showing that standardized short-term experiments can be confidently assayed after 16 hours, and that bleaching sensitivity may be linked to subsequent survival using experimental assessments.",

    "abstract": "Cancer evolution is a multifaceted process involving the acquisition of somatic mutations and progressive epigenetic dysregulation of cellular fate. Both cell-intrinsic mechanisms and environmental interactions provide selective pressures capable of promoting clonal evolution and expansion, with single-cell and bulk DNA sequencing offering increased resolution into this process1-4. Advances in genome editing, single-cell biology and expressed lentiviral barcoding have enabled new insights into how transcriptional/epigenetic states change with clonal evolution5,6. Despite the extensive catalog of genomic alterations revealed by resequencing studies7,8, there remain limited means to functionally model and perturb this evolutionary process in experimental systems9. Here we integrated multi-recombinase (Cre, Flp, and Dre) tools for modeling reversible, sequential mutagenesis from premalignant clonal hematopoiesis to acute myeloid leukemia. We demonstrate that somatic acquisition of Flt3 activating mutations elicits distinct phases of acute and chronic activation resulting in differential cooperativity with Npm1 and Dnmt3a disease alleles. We next developed a generalizable allelic framework allowing for the reversible expression of oncogenic mutations at their endogenous loci. We found that reversal of mutant Flt3 resulted in rapid leukemic regression with distinct alterations in cellular compartments depending upon co-occurring mutations. These studies provide a path to model sequential mutagenesis and deterministically investigate mechanisms of transformation and oncogenic dependency in the context of clonal evolution.",

    "abstract": "Facial vibrissae (whiskers) are thin, tapered, and flexible hair-like structures that are an important source of tactile sensory information for many species of animals. In contrast to insect antennae, whiskers have no sensors along their lengths. Instead, when a whisker touches an object, the resulting deformation is transmitted to mechanoreceptors in a follicle at the whisker base. Previous work has shown that the mechanical signals transmitted along the whisker will depend strongly on the whiskers geometric parameters, in particular on its taper (how diameter varies with arc length) and on its intrinsic curvature. Although previous studies have largely agreed on how to define taper, multiple approaches have been used to quantify intrinsic curvature. The present work, compares and contrasts different mathematical methods to quantify intrinsic curvature, including polynomial, fractional exponent, elliptical, and Cesaro. Comparisons are performed across ten species of whiskered animals, ranging from rodents to pinnipeds. The fractional exponent model is shown to be a particularly promising approach for distinguishing between whiskers of different species. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using the different models for different modeling situations.",

    "abstract": "The Ajuba LIM protein Jub mediates regulation of Hippo signaling by cytoskeletal tension through interaction with the kinase Warts, and also participates in feedback regulation of junctional tension through regulation of the cytohesin Steppke. To investigate how Jub interacts with and regulates its distinct partners, we investigated the ability of Jub proteins missing different combinations of its three LIM domains to rescue jub phenotypes and to interact with -catenin, Warts and Steppke. Multiple regions of Jub contribute to its ability to bind -catenin and to localize to adherens junctions in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cultured cells identified a specific requirement for LIM2 for binding to Warts. However, in vivo, both LIM1 and LIM2, but not LIM3, were required for regulation of wing growth, Yorkie activity, and Warts localization. Conversely, LIM2 and LIM3, but not LIM1, were required for regulation of cell shape and Steppke localization in vivo, and for maximal Steppke binding in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These observations identify distinct functions for the different LIM domains of Jub.",

    "abstract": "Synapses are the nexus of signal transmission in the nervous system. Despite decades of work, the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton that concentrates at presynapses remain poorly known, hindering our comprehensive understanding of its roles in presynaptic physiology. In this work, we take advantage of a validated model of bead-induced presynapses to measure and visualize isolated presynaptic actin by diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopy. We first identify a major population of actin-enriched presynapses that concentrates more presynaptic components, and shows higher synaptic vesicle cycling than their non-enriched counterparts. Using pharmacological perturbations, we determine that an optimal amount of actin is necessary for this effect of actin enrichment. Modulation of this effect by actin nucleation inhibitors indicates its dependance on distinct presynaptic actin assemblies. Using Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM), we directly visualize these nano-structures in isolated presynapses, defining an actin mesh at the active zone, actin rails between the active zone and deeper reserve pools, and actin corrals around the whole presynaptic compartment. We finally show that these three types of presynaptic actin nano-structures are differentially affected by actin nucleation inhibitors, consistent with their effect on presynaptic component concentration and on synaptic vesicle cycling.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic fungicides have effectively controlled plant pathogenic fungi but their continued use has been detrimental to natural biological systems, and sometimes resulted into development of fungal resistance. They also have undesirable effects on non-target organisms and foster environmental and human health concerns thus new biodegradable alternatives have to be investigated. Lipoxygenases (LOX) are ubiquitous non-heme Iron containing dioxygenases that catalyze the addition of molecular oxygen to Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) such as Linoleic acid to form Oxylipins that possess anti-microbial activity.The aim of this study was to generate a recombinant 9-Lipoxygenase protein for chemo enzymatic synthesis of Oxylipin based biodegradable fungicides. Golden gate assembly, a molecular cloning method that allows assembly of many DNA fragments into a complete piece using Type II s restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase was used to clone the complete 9-LOX gene into the expression plasmid vector pPICZB. Protein expression in Pichia pastoris yeast cells was induced by addition of absolute methanol every after 24h for up to four days. Analysis of protein expression from cell lysates was achieved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting probed with anti-histidine antibody which showed putative protein bands of 97kDa representing recombinant 9-LOX protein. It is recommended that optimization studies on the yeast kex2 convertase and the - secretion factor can be done to enable secretion of recombinant Solanum tuberosum 9-LOX protein since the protein in this study was recovered from cell lysates.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial surface sensing is often conferred by flagella. The flagellar motor protein FliL plays a key role in this process, but its exact role has been obscured by varying fliL mutant phenotypes. We reanalyzed results from studies on these fliL alleles and found they inadvertently compared mutants with differing length of the retained native N-terminal region, including the transmembrane helix (TM). We find that TM retention in the mutants that lack the native C-terminal domain results in loss of swimming and swarming motility, while alleles that completely lack the TM retain motility. We suggest FliL negatively regulates motor function via its N-terminal region, an observation that may relate to FliL function in mechanosensing.",
