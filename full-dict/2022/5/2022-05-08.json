    "abstract": "Quantifying pairwise sequence similarities is a key step in metagenomics studies. Alignment-free methods provide a computationally efficient alternative to alignment-based methods for large-scale sequence analysis. Several neural network-based methods have recently been developed for this purpose. However, existing methods do not perform well on sequences of varying lengths and are sensitive to the presence of insertions and deletions. In this paper, we describe the development of a new method, referred to as AsMac, that addresses the aforementioned issues. We proposed a novel neural network structure for approximate string matching for the extraction of pertinent information from biological sequences and developed an efficient gradient computation algorithm for training the constructed neural network. We performed a large-scale benchmark study using real-world data that demonstrated the effectiveness and potential utility of the proposed method. The open-source software for the proposed method and trained neural-network models for some commonly used metagenomics marker genes were developed and are freely available at www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~yijunsun/lab/AsMac.html.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells (SCs) decision to self-renew or differentiate largely depends on the external control of their niche. However, the complex mechanisms that underlie this crosstalk are poorly understood. To address this question, we focused on the corneal epithelial SC model in which the SC niche, known as the limbus, is spatially segregated from the differentiation compartment. We report that the unique biomechanical property of the limbus supports the nuclear localization and function of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a putative mediator of the mechanotransduction pathway. Perturbation of tissue stiffness or YAP activity affects SC function as well as tissue integrity under homeostasis and significantly inhibited the regeneration of the SC population following SC depletion. In vitro experiments revealed that substrates with the rigidity of the corneal differentiation compartment inhibit YAP localization and induce differentiation, a mechanism that is mediated by the TGF{beta}-SMAD2/3 pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that SC sense biomechanical niche signals and that manipulation of mechano-sensory machinery or its downstream biochemical output may bear fruits in SC expansion for regenerative therapy.\n\nHighlightsO_LIYAP is essential for limbal SC function, regeneration, and dedifferentiation\nC_LIO_LILox over-expression stiffens the limbal niche, affects SC phenotype and corneal integrity\nC_LIO_LICorneal rigidity represses YAP and stemness in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner\nC_LIO_LIManipulation of mechanosensory or TGF-{beta} pathway influences limbal SC expansion in vitro\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from gut bacteria are associated with protective roles in diseases ranging from obesity to colorectal cancers. Intake of microbially accessible dietary fibers (prebiotics) lead to varying effects on SCFA production in human studies, and gut microbial responses to nutritional interventions vary by individual. It is therefore possible that prebiotic therapies will require customizing to individuals.\n\nResultsHere, we explored prebiotic personalization by conducting a three-way crossover study of three prebiotic treatments in healthy adults. We found that within individuals, metabolic responses were correlated across the three prebiotics. Individual identity, rather than prebiotic choice, was also the major determinant of SCFA response. Across individuals, prebiotic response was inversely related to basal fecal SCFA concentration, which, in turn, was associated with habitual fiber intake. Experimental measures of gut microbial SCFA production for each participant also negatively correlated with fiber consumption, supporting a model in which individuals gut microbiota are limited in their overall capacity to produce fecal SCFAs from fiber.\n\nConclusionsOur findings support developing personalized prebiotic regimens that focus on selecting individuals who stand to benefit, and that such individuals are likely to be deficient in fiber intake.",

    "abstract": "Learning and memory requires coordinated activity between different regions of the brain. Here we studied the interaction between infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal dorsal CA1 during associative odorant discrimination learning in the male mouse. We found that as the animal learns to discriminate odorants in a go- no go task the coupling of high frequency neural oscillations to the phase of theta oscillations (theta-referenced phase-amplitude coupling or tPAC) changes in a manner that results in divergence between rewarded and unrewarded odorant-elicited changes in the theta-phase referenced power (tPRP) for beta and gamma oscillations. In addition, in the proficient animal there was a decrease in the coordinated oscillatory activity between CA1 and mPFC in the presence of the unrewarded odorant. Furthermore, the changes in tPAC resulted in a marked increase in the accuracy for decoding contextual odorant identity from tPRP when the animal became proficient. Finally, we studied the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II  (CaMKII), a protein involved in learning and memory, in oscillatory neural processing in this task. We find that the accuracy for decoding the contextual odorant identity from tPRP decreases in CaMKII knockout mice and that this accuracy correlates with behavioral performance. These results implicate a role for tPAC and CaMKII genotype in olfactory go-no go associative learning in the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.\n\nSignificance statementCoupling of neural oscillations between hippocampal CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in spatial learning and memory, but the role of oscillation coupling for other learning tasks is not well understood. Here we performed local field potential recording in CA1 and mPFC in mice learning to differentiate rewarded from unrewarded odorants in an associative learning task. We find that odorant-elicited changes in the power of bursts of gamma oscillations at distinct phases of theta oscillations become divergent as the animal becomes proficient allowing decoding of contextual odorant identity. Finally, we find that the accuracy to decode contextual odorant identity decreases in mice deficient for the expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II , a protein involved in synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PKD1 (encoding polycystin-1) or PKD2 (encoding polycystin-2) gene cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), however high levels of polycystins are detected in renal tissues of ADPKD patients. Animal studies showed that loss and gain of function of polycystins are both pathogenic and can induce cystic phenotype in the kidney, which are associated with enhanced renal fibrosis. Recent studies showed that increased expression of polycystins contributes to organ fibrosis. However, the role of polycystins in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 was highly expressed in the kidney of two different fibrotic mouse models and positively correlated with expression of collagen-I. Pharmaceutical inhibition of polycystin-2 with triptolide or genetic knockout of polycystin-2 reduced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in fibrotic kidneys. Similarly, conditional knockout of Pkd1 gene also attenuated renal fibrosis in mouse models. Thus, we further hypothesized that inhibition of polycystins delays cyst growth by mitigating renal fibrosis. Here, we showed that polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 was up-regulated in Pkd2 or Pkd1 mice respectively and tightly correlated with the growth of renal cysts and fibrosis development. Genetic deletion of both polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 retarded cyst growth in Pkd1 or Pkd2 mice. Finally, we deleted pkd1 gene in a fibrosis triggered adult ADPKD mouse model at different time point before or after the fibrotic injury. We showed that early and long-term inactivation of Pkd1 delayed fibrosis triggered renal cyst growth in adult Pkd1 mice as compared with mice with late and short-term inactivation of Pkd1 gene. We conclude that tubular obstruction induced polycystin up-regulation is pro-fibrotic and accelerates cyst growth through enhancing renal interstitial fibrosis in ADPKD mice. Our study indicates that ADPKD is caused by both loss and gain function of polycystins. Reduction of the aberrant upregulation of polycystins in cystic kidneys is a therapeutic option for ADPKD patients.\n\nResearch highlightsO_LIPolycystin1 and polycystin-2 are up-regulated in fibrotic kidneys\nC_LIO_LIInhibition or deletion of polycystins inhibits EMT and attenuates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis\nC_LIO_LIUpregulation of polycystin1 or polycystin-2 is positively correlated with fibrosis progression and renal cyst growth in ADPKD mice\nC_LIO_LIDouble knockout of Pkd1 and Pkd2 gene inhibits renal cyst growth in ADPKD mice\nC_LIO_LILong-term deletion of Pkd1 gene delayed fibrosis triggered renal cyst growth in ADPKD mice\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "There is increasing appreciation that human complex traits are determined by poorly understood interactions between our genomes and daily environments. These \"genotype x environment\" (GxE) interactions remain difficult to map at the organismal level, but can be uncovered using molecular phenotypes. To do so at large-scale, we profiled transcriptomes across 12 cellular environments using 544 immortalized B cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project. We mapped the genetic basis of gene expression across environments and revealed a context-dependent genetic architecture: the average heritability of gene expression levels increased in treatment relative to control conditions and, on average, each treatment revealed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) at 11% of genes. In total, 22% of all eQTL were context-dependent, and this group was enriched for trait- and disease-associated loci. Further, evolutionary analyses revealed that positive selection has shaped GxE loci involved in responding to immune challenges and hormones, but not man-made chemicals, suggesting there is reduced opportunity for selection to act on responses to molecules recently introduced into human environments. Together, our work highlights the importance of considering an exposures evolutionary history when studying and interpreting GxE interactions, and provides new insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that maintain GxE loci in human populations.",

A previous study has shown that face-to-face interactions in pairs of strangers increase IBS. However, it is unclear whether this can be observed when the nature of the interacting partners is different. Herein, we aimed to extend these findings to pairs of acquaintances. Neural activity in the frontal and temporal regions was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. Participants played an ultimatum game that required virtual economic exchange in two experimental settings: the face-to-face and face-blocked conditions. Random pair analysis confirmed whether IBS was induced by social interaction. Contrary to the aforementioned study, our results did not show any cooperative behavior or task-induced IBS increase. Conversely, the random pair analysis results revealed that the pair-specific IBS was significant only in the task condition at the left and right superior frontal, middle frontal, orbital superior frontal, right superior temporal, precentral, and postcentral gyri. Our results revealed that face-to-face interaction in acquainted pairs did not increase IBS and supported the idea that IBS is affected by \"with whom we interact and how.\"",

    "abstract": "Comparing artificial neural networks with outputs of neuroimaging techniques has recently seen substantial advances in (computer) vision and text-based language models. Here, we propose a framework to compare biological and artificial neural computations of spoken language representations and propose several new challenges to this paradigm. The proposed technique is based on a similar principle that underlies electroencephalography (EEG): averaging of neural (artificial or biological) activity across neurons in the time domain, and allows to compare encoding of any acoustic property in the brain and in intermediate convolutional layers of an artificial neural network. Our approach allows a direct comparison of responses to a phonetic property in the brain and in deep neural networks that requires no linear transformations between the signals. We argue that the brain stem response (cABR) and the response in intermediate convolutional layers to the exact same stimulus are highly similar and quantify this observation. The proposed technique not only reveals similarties, but also allows for analysis of the encoding of actual acoustic properties in the two signals: we compare peak latency (i) in cABR relative to the stimulus in the brain stem and in (ii) intermediate convolutional layers relative to the input/output in deep convolutional networks. We also examine and compare the effect of prior language exposure on the peak latency in cABR and in intermediate convolutional layers. Substantial similarities in peak latency encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional networks emerge based on results from eight trained networks (including a replication experiment). The proposed technique can be used to compare encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional layers for any acoustic property and for other neuroimaging techniques.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging is a multifactorial event that leads to changes in HSC properties and function. These changes are intrinsically coordinated and affect the early hematopoiesis, involving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The objective of this work is to better understand the mechanisms and factors controlling these changes. We have therefore developed an original strategy to construct a Boolean network of genes explaining the priming and homeostasis of HSCs (graphical abstract). Based on our previous scRNA-seq data, we performed an exhaustive analysis of the transcriptional network and identified active transcription modules or regulons along the differentiation trajectory of selected HSPC states. This global view of transcriptional regulation led us to focus on 15 components, 13 selected TFs (Tal1, Fli1, Gata2, Gata1, Zfpm1, Egr1, Junb, Ikzf1, Myc, Cebpa, Bclaf1, Klf1, Spi1) and 2 complexes regulating the ability of HSC to cycle (CDK4/6 - Cyclin D and CIP/KIP). We then defined the connections controlling the differentiation dynamics of HSC states and constructed an influence graph between the TFs involved in the dynamics by mixing observations from our scRNA-seq data and knowledge from the literature. Then, using answer set programming (ASP) and in silico perturbation analysis, we obtained a Boolean model which is the solution of a Boolean satisfiability problem. Finally, perturbation of the model based on age-related changes revealed important regulations, such as the overactivation of Egr1 and Junb or the loss of Cebpa activation by Gata2, which were found to be relevant for the myeloid bias of aged HSC. Our work shows the efficiency of the combination of manual and systematic methods to elaborate a Boolean model. The developed strategy led to the proposal of new regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation bias of aged HSCs, explaining the decreased transcriptional priming of HSCs to all mature cell types except megakaryocytes.\n\nGraphical abstractFrom single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and current knowledge in early hematopoiesis (literature and biological database investigation), 3 inputs were obtained to define the network synthesis as a Boolean Satisfiability Problem depending on observations of states in the differentiation process: O_LIInfluence graph between selected components.\nC_LIO_LIDiscretized component activity levels in the considered states (blue: 0/inactive, white: */unknown or free, red: 1/active).\nC_LIO_LIDynamic relations (stable states, (non) reachability) between the considered states.

This model is altered according to the characteristics of aging observed in our scRNA-seq data, in order to identify the main molecular actors and mechanisms of aging.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/479548v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbf1d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c0ee97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@70365corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100ff60_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstract:C_FLOATNO Overview of the scRNA-seq assisted gene Boolean network synthesis strategy.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Development of the male gametophyte is a tightly regulated process that requires precise control of cell division and gene expression. A relevant aspect to understand the events underlying pollen development regulation constitutes the identification and characterization of the genes required for this process. In this work we showed that the DC1 domain protein BINUCLEATE POLLEN (BNP) is essential for pollen development and germination. Pollen grains carrying the defective BNP allele failed to complete mitosis II and are impaired in pollen germination. By yeast two-hybrid analysis and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we identified a set of BNP-interacting proteins. Among confirmed interactors we found NAC family transcriptional regulators Vascular Plant One-Zinc Finger 1 (VOZ1) and VOZ2. VOZ1 localization changes during pollen development, moving to the vegetative nucleus at the tricellular stage. We observed that this relocalization requires BNP, as in the absence of BNP in pollen from bnp/BNP plants, VOZ1 nuclear localization is impaired. As voz1voz2 double mutants showed the same developmental defect observed in bnp pollen grains, we propose that BNP requirement to complete microgametogenesis could be linked to its interaction with VOZ1/2 proteins. BNP could have a role of scaffold protein, recruiting VOZ1/2 to the endosomal system into assemblies that are required for their further translocation to the nucleus, where they act as transcriptional regulators.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=180 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484815v3_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (67K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8680b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6ac6fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ddf1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193693c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO BNP codes for a DC1 domain containing protein.

    "abstract": "The helical shape of H. pylori cells promotes robust stomach colonization, however, how the helical shape of H. pylori cells is determined is unresolved. Previous work identified helical-cell-shape-promoting protein complexes containing a peptidoglycan-hydrolase (Csd1), a peptidoglycan precursor synthesis enzyme (MurF), a non-enzymatic homologue of Csd1 (Csd2), non-enzymatic transmembrane proteins (Csd5 and Csd7), and a bactofilin (CcmA). Bactofilins are highly conserved, spontaneously polymerizing cytoskeletal bacterial proteins. We sought to understand CcmAs function in generating the helical shape of H. pylori cells. Using CcmA deletion analysis, in vitro polymerization, and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments we identified that the bactofilin domain and N-terminal region of CcmA are required for helical cell shape and the bactofilin domain of CcmA is sufficient for polymerization and interactions with Csd5 and Csd7. We also found that CcmAs N-terminal region inhibits interaction with Csd7. Deleting the N-terminal region of CcmA increases CcmA-Csd7 interactions and destabilizes the peptidoglycan-hydrolase Csd1. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that Csd5 recruits CcmA to the cell envelope and promotes CcmA enrichment at the major helical axis. Thus, CcmA helps organize cell-shape-determining proteins and peptidoglycan synthesis machinery to coordinate cell wall modification and synthesis, promoting the curvature required to build a helical cell.",

    "abstract": "Molluscs constitute the second largest phylum of animals in the world, and shell colour and stripes are one of their most important phenotypic characteristics. Studies on the mechanism of shell pigmentation help understand the evolutionary and ecological significance of shell colour and serve as the basis for shell colour breeding. In this study, a matched-pair design was used in comparing the black- and white-striped mantles of the same oyster. The result showed that the stripes of shell surface are corresponding to the stripes of the mantle edge. Transcriptomic analysis identified an uncharacterized protein gene (we named it as Crassostrea gigas chitin-binding protein, CgCBP) highly expressed in the black mantles. Three folds (inner fold, middle fold and outer fold) were found on the mantle edge of oyster, but only the outer fold has the same colour as the shell. Transcriptomic comparison indicated that the three folds of the mantle edge are functionally differentiated, and the CgCBP gene is ultra-highly expressed only in the outer fold. We obtained new black and white shell periostraca from the shell notching experiment and found their structural differences by scanning electron microscope. Chitin was successfully extracted and identified from the shell periostraca. Proteomic analysis revealed differences in protein composition between the two shell periostraca. Particularly, the black shell periostraca have more proteins related to melanin biosynthesis and chitin binding compared with the white ones, and melanin particles were observed in the black mantle edge using transmission electron microscope. Magnetic bead binding and Western blot experiments showed that the CgCBP protein can specifically bind to chitin and in vivo RNAi screening indicated that CgCBP knockdown can change the structure of the shell periostracum and reduce its pigmentation. All these results suggest that the outer fold of mantle may have more important roles in shell pigmentation, shell periostracum structure is functionally correlated with shell pigmentation, and the CgCBP gene ultra-highly expressed in the outer fold may influence shell pigmentation by affecting its periostracum structure.",

    "abstract": "Herpesviruses - ubiquitous pathogens that cause persistent infections - have some of the most complex cell entry mechanisms. Entry of the prototypical herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) requires coordinated efforts of 4 glycoproteins, gB, gD, gH, and gL. The current model posits that the glycoproteins do not interact prior to receptor engagement and that binding of gD to its receptor causes a \"cascade\" of sequential pairwise interactions, first activating the gH/gL complex and subsequently activating gB, the viral fusogen. But how these glycoproteins interact remains unresolved. Here, using a quantitative split-luciferase approach, we show that pairwise HSV-1 glycoprotein complexes form prior to fusion, remain stable throughout fusion, and do not depend on the presence of the cellular receptor. Based on our findings, we propose a revised \"conformational cascade\" model of HSV-1 entry. We hypothesize that all 4 glycoproteins assemble into a complex prior to fusion, with gH/gL positioned between gD and gB. Once gD binds to a cognate receptor, the proximity of the glycoproteins within this complex allows for efficient transmission of the activating signal from the receptor-activated gD to gH/gL to gB through sequential conformational changes, ultimately triggering the fusogenic refolding of gB. Our results also highlight previously unappreciated contributions of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains to glycoprotein interactions and fusion. Similar principles could be at play in other multicomponent viral entry systems, and the split luciferase approach used here is a powerful tool for investigating protein-protein interactions in these and a variety of other systems.\n\nIMPORTANCEHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects the majority of humans for life and can cause diseases ranging from painful sores to deadly brain inflammation. No vaccines or curative treatments currently exist. HSV-1 infection of target cells requires coordinated efforts of four viral glycoproteins. But how these glycoproteins interact remains unclear. Using a quantitative protein interaction assay, we found that HSV-1 glycoproteins form stable, receptor-independent complexes. We propose that the 4 proteins form a complex, which could facilitate transmission of the entry-triggering signal from the receptor-binding component to the membrane fusogen component through sequential conformational changes. Similar principles could be applicable across other multicomponent protein systems. A revised model of HSV-1 entry could facilitate the development of therapeutics targeting this process.",

    "abstract": "To understand the process by which new protein functions emerge, we examined how the yeast heterochromatin protein Sir3 arose through gene duplication from the conserved DNA replication protein Orc1. Orc1 is a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which marks origins of DNA replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Orc1 also promotes heterochromatin assembly by recruiting the structural proteins Sir1-4 to silencer DNA. In contrast, the paralog of Orc1, Sir3, is a nucleosome-binding protein that spreads across heterochromatic loci in conjunction with other Sir proteins. We previously found that a non-duplicated Orc1 from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis behaved like ScSir3 but did not have a silencer-binding function like ScOrc1. Moreover, K. lactis lacks Sir1, the protein that interacts directly with ScOrc1. Here, we searched for the presumed intermediate state in which non-duplicated Orc1 possesses both the silencer-binding and spreading functions. In the non-duplicated species Torulaspora delbrueckii, which has an ortholog of Sir1 (TdKos3), we found that TdOrc1 spreads across heterochromatic loci independently of ORC, as ScSir3 and KlOrc1 do. This spreading is dependent on the nucleosome binding BAH domain of Orc1 and on Sir2 and Kos3. However, TdOrc1 does not have a silencer-binding function: T. delbrueckii silencers do not require ORC binding sites to function, and Orc1 and Kos3 do not appear to interact. Instead, Orc1 and Kos3 both spread across heterochromatic loci with other Sir proteins. Thus, Orc1 and Sir1/Kos3 originally had different roles in heterochromatin formation than they do now in S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death important for the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. The BCL-2 protein family controls key steps in apoptosis, dysregulation of which can lead to a wide range of human diseases. BCL-2 proteins comprise three groups: anti-apoptotic proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins, and BH3-only proteins. BAK is one of two pro-apoptotic proteins, and previous work has shown that binding of certain BH3-only proteins such as truncated BID (tBID), BIM, or PUMA to BAK leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, the release of cytochrome c, and ultimately cell death. This process, referred to as activation, involves the BH3-stimulated conversion of BAK from monomer to dimer and then to oligomers that promote membrane disruption. Crystal structures of putative intermediates in this pathway, crosslinking data, and in vitro functional tests have provided insights into the activation event, yet the sequence-function relationships that make some but not all BH3-only proteins function as activators remain largely unexamined. In this work, we used computational protein design, yeast surface-display screening of candidate BH3-like peptides, and structure-based energy scoring to identify ten new binders of BAK that span a large sequence space. Among the new binders are two peptides from human proteins BNIP5 and PXT1 that promote BAK activation in liposome assays and induce cytochrome-c release from mitochondria, expanding current views of how BAK-mediated cell death may be triggered in cells. High-resolution crystal structures and binding experiments revealed a high degree of similarity in binding geometry, affinity, and association kinetics between peptide activators and inhibitors, including peptides described previously and those identified in this work. We propose a model for BAK activation that is based on differential engagement of BAK monomers vs. the BAK activation transition state that integrates our observations with previous reports of BAK binders, activators, and inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a lethal swine hemorrhagic disease and is currently responsible for widespread damage to the pig industry. The molecular mechanisms of ASFV pathogenicity and its interaction with host responses remain poorly understood. In this study, we profiled the temporal viral and host transcriptomes in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) infected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours with highly virulent (SY18) and low virulent (HuB20) ASFV strains. We first identified profound differences in the virus expression programs between SY18 and HuB20, while the transcriptome dynamics in host cells were dominated by infection time. Through integrated computational analysis and experimental validation, we identified differentially expressed genes and related biological processes, and elaborated differential usage of the NF-kappaB related pathways by the two virus strains. In addition, we observed that compared to the highly virulent SY18 strain, HuB20 infection quickly activates expression of receptors, sensors, regulators, as well as downstream effectors, including cGAS, STAT1/2, IRF9, MX1/2, suggesting rapid induction of a strong immune response. Lastly, we constructed a host-virus coexpression network, which shed light on pathogenic functions of several ASFV genes. Taken together, these results will provide a basis for further mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved in different responses.\n\nAuthor SummarySince it was first described in Kenya in 1921, ASF has spread across sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, the Western Europe, the Trans-Caucasus region, and the Russian Federation. Recent outbreaks have also been reported in Asia, which has devastated the pig industry, resulting in an approximately 40% reduction in pork worldwide. In the absence of effective vaccine or treatment, the mortality for infections with highly virulent strains approaches 100%, while low virulent strains causing less mortality spreads fast recently. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of ASFV pathogenicity, especially the differences between highly and low virulent strains remain poorly understood. Here, we used RNA-seq to analyze the viral and host transcriptome changes in PAMs infected with a virulent strain (SY18) or an attenuated strain (HuB20) at different stages. We found that the presence of ASFV significantly affected the cellular transcriptome profile. In addition, we did temporal and described the dynamic expression programs induced in the host cells by ASFV infection of different virulence strains. In particular, we identified differential gene expression patterns in host innate immune responses and expressed cytokines and chemokines between ASFV strains of different virulence. Our study provides new insights into ASFV pathogenicity research and novel drug or vaccine targets.",

However, their applications are confined due to the cost-efficiency of microalgal mass production. One-step strategy and continuous culturing systems could be solutions. However, current studies for optimization throughout microalgae-based biofuel production pipelines are generally derived from the batch culture process. Better tools are needed to study algal growth kinetics in continuous systems. A microfluidics chemostatic bioreactor array was presented, providing low-adhesion cultivation for algae in the gas, nutrition, and temperature (GNT) well-controlled environment with high throughput. The chip wasused to mimic the continuous culture environment of bioreactors. It allowed simultaneously studying of 8x8 different chemostatic conditions on algal growth and oil production in parallel on a 7x7 cm2 footprint. On-chip experiments of batch and continuous cultures of Chlorella. sp. were performed to study growth and lipid accumulation under different nitrogen concentrations. The results demonstrated that microalgal cultures can be regulated to grow and accumulate lipids concurrently, thus enhancing lipid productivity in one step. The developed on-chip culturing condition screening, which was more suitable for continuous bioreactor, was achieved at a half shorter time, 64-times higher throughput, and less reagent consumption.

    "abstract": "Amyloid plaques, composed of aggregates of the amyloid beta (A{beta}) protein, are one of the central manifestations of Alzheimers disease pathology. Aggregation of A{beta} from amorphous oligomeric species to mature fibrils has been extensively studied. However, significantly less in known about early-stage aggregates compared to fibrils. In particular, structural heterogeneities in prefibrillar species, and how that affects the structure of later stage aggregates are not yet well understood. Conventional spectroscopies cannot attribute structural facets to specific aggregates due to lack of spatial resolution, and hence aggregates at any stage of aggregation must be viewed as having the same average structure. The integration of infrared spectroscopy with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM-IR) allows for identifying the signatures of individual nanoscale aggregates by spatially resolving spectra. In this report, we use AFM-IR to demonstrate that amyloid oligomers exhibit significant structural variations as evidenced in their infrared spectra, ranging from ordered beta structure to disordered conformations with predominant random coil and beta turns. This heterogeneity is transmitted to and retained in protofibrils and fibrils. We show for the first time that amyloid fibrils do not always conform to their putative ordered structure and structurally different domains can exist in the same fibril. We further show the implications of these results in amyloid plaques in Alzheimers tissue using infrared imaging, where these structural heterogeneities manifest themselves as lack of expected beta sheet structure.",

    "abstract": "The photorespiratory pathway in plants comprises metabolic reactions distributed across several cellular compartments. It emerges from the dual catalytic function of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) which either carboxylates or oxygenates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). Carboxylation reactions produce 3-phospho-glycerate (3PGA) molecules which are substrate for central carbohydrate metabolism while oxygenation forms 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) molecules which are substrate for the multicompartmental recovery process of photorespiration. Further, 2PG is a strong inhibitor of several enzymes involved in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle which challenges the experimental and theoretical study of carbon assimilation, photorespiration and metabolic regulation in vivo. Here, an approach of structural kinetic modeling (SKM) is presented to investigate the extend of stabilization of CBC and carbohydrate metabolism by photorespiration. Further, our approach highlights the importance of feedback regulation by 2-PG for alleviation of environmental perturbation. Our findings indicate that oxygenation of RuBP by Rubisco significantly stabilizes CBC activity and, thus, carbohydrate metabolism. Based on our findings, we suggest a trade-off function of photorespiration which reduces carbon assimilation rates but simultaneously stabilizes metabolism by increasing plasticity of metabolic regulation within the chloroplast. Furthermore, our analysis suggests a stabilizing effect of increasing the partition of newly assimilated carbon going towards sucrose biosynthesis. With this, our analysis sheds light on the role of a multicompartmental metabolic pathway in stabilizing plant metabolism within a changing environment.",

We compared these models by their ability to predict cerebellar activity patterns for novel Task Sets. Models that allow some degree of convergence provided the best predictions, arguing for convergence of multiple cortical inputs onto single cerebellar voxels. Importantly, the degree of convergence varied across the cerebellum with the highest convergence observed in areas linked to language, working memory, and social cognition. These findings suggest important differences in the way that functional subdivisions of the cerebellum support motor and cognitive function.\n\nHighlightsO_LIModels of cortico-cerebellar connectivity are quantified using task-based fMRI\nC_LIO_LIConvergent rather than sparse inputs best characterize cortico-cerebellar connectivity\nC_LIO_LICerebellar areas linked to cognition receive high convergence of cortical inputs\nC_LIO_LIModels successfully generalize to new tasks and new participants\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Injury triggers genetic program to induce gene expression for regeneration. Several studies have recently reported the identification of regeneration-response enhancers (RREs) in zebrafish; however, it remains unclear whether a common mechanism operates in RREs. Here, we show that E-box and activator protein 1 (AP-1) motifs cooperatively function as RREs. We identified three RREs from the fn1b promoter by a search of conserved sequences and an in vivo transgenic assay for regeneration-response in zebrafish. Two of them derived from transposons displayed RRE activity only when combined with the -0.7 kb fn1b promoter, while another non-transposable element functioned as a standalone enhancer. A search for transcription factor-binding motifs and validation by transgenic assay revealed that both of E-box and AP-1 motifs are necessary and sufficient for RREs. Such RREs responded to variety of tissue injuries including zebrafish heart and Xenopus limb bud regenerations. Our findings highlight that regeneration is regulated by merging two activating signals evoked by tissue injuries. It is speculated that a large pool of potential enhancers in the genome shaped regenerative capacities during evolution.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe study revealed that regeneration-response enhancer is composed of two transcription factor-binding motifs. The fidelity of regeneration-dependent gene expression is ensured by merging two activating signals evoked by injuries.",

    "abstract": "Biotic interactions are known to play an important role in shaping species geographic distributions and diversity patterns. However, the role of mutualistic interactions in shaping global diversity patterns remains poorly quantified, particularly with respect to interactions with invertebrates. Moreover, it is unclear how the nature of different mutualisms interacts with abiotic drivers and affects diversity patterns of mutualistic organisms. Here, we present a global-scale biogeographic analysis of three different ant-plant mutualisms, differentiating between plants bearing domatia, extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), and elaiosomes, based on comprehensive geographic distributions of [~]15,000 flowering plants and [~]13,000 ant species. Domatia and extrafloral nectaries involve indirect plant defenses provided by ants, while elaiosomes attract ants to disperse seeds. Our results show distinct biogeographic patterns of different ant-plant mutualisms, with domatium- and EFN-bearing plant richness decreasing sharply from the equator towards the poles, while elaiosome-bearing plants prevail at mid-latitudes. Contemporary climate, especially mean annual temperature and precipitation, emerge as the most important predictor of ant-associated plant diversity. In hot and moist regions, typically the tropics, domatium- and EFN-bearing plant richness increases with related ant guild richness, while in warm regions plants with elaiosomes are strongly linked to interacting ants. Our results suggest that ant richness in combination with climate drives the spatial variation of plants bearing domatia, extrafloral nectaries, and elaiosomes, highlighting the importance of mutualistic interactions for understanding plant biogeography and its response to global change.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control locomotion in a dynamic environment provides a competitive advantage for microorganisms, thus driving the evolution of sophisticated regulatory systems. Nineteen known categories of chemotaxis systems control motility mediated by flagella or Type IV pili, plus other cellular functions. A key feature that distinguishes chemotaxis systems from generic two-component regulatory systems is separation of receptor and kinase functions into distinct proteins, linked by CheW scaffold proteins. This arrangement allows for formation of varied arrays with remarkable signaling properties. We recently analyzed sequences of CheW-like domains found in CheA kinases and CheW and CheV scaffold proteins. Sixteen Architectures of CheA, CheW, and CheV proteins contain [~]94% of all CheW-like domains and form six Classes with likely functional specializations.\n\nWe surveyed chemotaxis system categories and proteins containing CheW-like domains in [~]1900 prokaryotic species, the most comprehensive analysis to date, revealing new insights. Co-occurrence analyses suggested that many chemotaxis systems occur in non-random combinations within species, implying synergy or antagonism. Furthermore, many Architectures of proteins containing CheW-like domains occurred predominantly with specific categories of chemotaxis systems, suggesting specialized functional interactions. We propose Class 1 ([~]80%) and Class 2 ([~]20%) CheW proteins exhibit preferences for distinct chemoreceptor structures. Furthermore, rare ([~]1%) Class 6 CheW proteins frequently co-occurred with methyl-accepting coiled coil (MAC) proteins, which contain both receptor and kinase functions and so do not require connection via a CheW scaffold but may benefit from arrays. Lastly, rare multi-domain CheW proteins may interact with different receptors than single domain CheW proteins.",

    "abstract": "Boolean network models have widely been used to study the dynamics of gene regulatory networks. However, such models are coarse-grained to an extent that they abstract away molecular specificities of gene regulation. In contrast, bipartite Boolean network models of gene regulation explicitly distinguish genes from transcription factors (TFs). In such models, multiple TFs may simultaneously contribute to the regulation of a gene by forming heteromeric complexes. The formation of heteromeric complexes gives rise to composition structures in the corresponding bipartite network. Remarkably, composition structures can severely restrict the number of Boolean functions (BFs) that can be assigned to a gene. The introduction of bipartite Boolean network models is relatively recent, and so far an empirical investigation of their biological plausibility is lacking. Here, we estimate the prevalence of composition structures arising through heteromeric complexes in Homo sapiens. Moreover, we present an additional mechanism by which composition structures arise as a result of multiple TFs binding to the cis-regulatory regions of a gene and we provide empirical support for this mechanism. Next, we compare the restriction in BFs imposed by composition structures and by biologically meaningful properties. We find that two types of minimally complex BFs, namely nested canalyzing functions (NCFs) and read-once functions (RoFs), are more restrictive than composition structures. Finally, using a compiled dataset of 2687 BFs from published models, we find that composition structures are highly enriched in real biological networks, but that this enrichment is most likely driven by NCFs and RoFs.",

What remains unexplored, is the actual structure of the waves--their shapes and patterns over finite timescales. To address this, we used two independent approaches to link wave forms to their physiological functions: the first is based on quantifying their consistency with the underlying mean behavior, and the second assesses \"orderliness\" of the waves features. The corresponding measures capture the waves characteristic and abnormal behaviors, such as atypical periodicity or excessive clustering, and demonstrate coupling between the patterns dynamics and the animals location, speed and acceleration. Specifically, we studied patterns of{theta} and{gamma} waves, and Sharp Wave Ripples, and observed speed-modulated changes of the waves cadence, an antiphase relationship between orderliness and acceleration, as well as spatial selectiveness of patterns. Further-more, we found an interdependence between orderliness and regularity: larger deviations from steady oscillatory behavior tend to accompany disarrayed temporal cluttering of peaks and troughs. Taken together, our results offer a complementary--mesoscale--perspective on brain wave structure, dynamics, and functionality.",

    "abstract": "Conservation management for a species generally rests on intraspecific units, while identification of their geographic boundaries is necessary for the implementation. Intraspecific units can be discriminated using population genetic methods, yet an analytical approach is still lacking for detecting their geographic boundaries. Here, based on landscape connectivity, we present a geographical boundary delineation method, habCluster, using community detection algorithm. Community detection is an algorithm in graph theory used to identify clusters of highly connected nodes within a network. We assume that the habitat raster cells with better connections tend to form a continuous habitat patch than the others, thus making the range of an intraspecific unit. The method is tested on grey wolf (Canis lupus) habitat in Europe and on giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat in China. The habitat suitability for grey wolves and giant pandas were evaluated using species distribution modeling. Each cell in the habitat suitability index (HSI) raster is treated as a node and directly connected with its eight neighbor cells. The edge weight between nodes is the distance between the center of them weighted by the average of their HSI values. We implement habCluster using R programming language with inline C++ code to speed up the computing. The geographical clusters detected were compared with the HSI maps for both species and with the nature reserves for giant panda. We found the boundaries of the clusters delineated using habCluster could serve as a good indicator of habitat patches, and they match generally well with nature reserves in the giant panda case. habCluster can provide spatial analysis basis for conservation management plans such as monitoring, translocation and reintroduction, as well as for population structure research.",

SBR is a new and fast spreading disease in Central Europe that leads to high yield losses. To date the development of management strategies is hampered by insufficient knowledge about general life history traits of the planthopper and, most importantly, the year round availability of insects reared under controlled conditions. Rearing of P. leporinus has been considered challenging and to date no protocol exists.\n\nRESULTSHere we describe a method for mass rearing P. leporinus on sugar beet from egg to adult, which has produced five generations and >20,000 individuals between June 2020 and March 2022. An alternative host such as wheat is not necessary for completing the life cycle. No-choice experiments showed that P. leporinus lays 139.1 {+/-} 132.9 eggs on sugar beet, whereas no oviposition was observed on its nymphal host wheat. Head capsule width was identified as a trait that unequivocally distinguished the five nymphal instars. Developmental time from first instar to adult was 193.6 {+/-} 35.8 days for males and 193.5 {+/-} 59.2 days for females. Infection rates of adults were tested with nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results demonstrated that 70-80% of reared planthoppers across all generations carried the SBR proteobacterium.\n\nCONCLUSIONThe mass rearing protocol and life history data will help overcome an important bottleneck in SBR research and enhance efforts in developing integrated pest management tools.",

The models were evaluated using the confusion matrix to perform an error analysis and the classification report to compute F1-score, recall and precision. As results, the three models have shown an excellent performance with best combination of hyper-parameters for training models. First and second models predicted adenocarcinoma predominant patterns on two different datasets with an accuracy, respectively, of 96.15% and 89.51%. The third model has exceeded an accuracy of 99.72% in classifying major non-small cell lung cancer types.

An individual domain can occur in a variety of domain architectures that perform unique functions and are subject to different evolutionary selective pressures. We describe an approach to evaluate the variability in amino acid sequences of a single domain across architectural contexts. The ability to distinguish different evolutionary outcomes of one protein domain can help determine whether existing knowledge about a specific domain will apply to an uncharacterized protein, lead to insights and hypotheses about function, and guide experimental priorities.\n\nWe developed and tested our approach on CheW-like domains (PF01584), which mediate protein/protein interactions and are difficult to compare experimentally. CheW-like domains occur in CheW scaffolding proteins, CheA kinases, and CheV proteins that regulate bacterial chemotaxis. We analyzed 16 domain architectures that included 94% of all CheW-like domains found in nature. We identified six Classes of CheW-like domains with presumed functional differences. CheV and most CheW proteins contained Class 1 domains, whereas some CheW proteins contained Class 6 ([~]20%) or Class 2 ([~]1%) domains instead. Most CheA proteins contained Class 3 domains. CheA proteins with multiple Hpt domains contained Class 4 domains. CheA proteins with two CheW-like domains contained one Class 3 and one Class 5.\n\nWe also created SimpLogo, an innovative method for visualizing amino acid composition across large sets of multiple sequence alignments of arbitrary length.

    "abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system fight-or-flight response is characterized by a rapid increase in heart rate, which is mediated by an increase in the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing rate of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. Sympathetic neurons stimulate sinoatrial myocytes (SAMs) by activating {beta} adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) and increasing cAMP. The funny current (If) is among the cAMP-sensitive currents in SAMs. If is critical for pacemaker activity, however, its role in the fight-or-flight response remains controversial. In this study, we used AP waveform analysis, machine learning, and dynamic clamp experiments in acutely-isolated SAMs from mice to quantitatively define the AP waveform changes and role of If in the fight-or-flight response. We found that while {beta}AR stimulation significantly altered nearly all AP waveform parameters, the increase in AP firing rate was only correlated with changes in a subset of parameters (diastolic duration, late AP duration, and diastolic depolarization rate). Dynamic clamp injection of the {beta}AR-sensitive component of If showed that it accounts for approximately 41% of the fight-or-flight increase in AP firing rate and 60% of the decrease in the interval between APs. Thus, If is an essential contributor to the fight-or-flight increase in heart rate.",

    "abstract": "Highly multiplexed quantitative subcellular imaging holds enormous promise for understanding how spatial context shapes the activity of our genome and its products at multiple scales. Yet unbiased analysis of subcellular organisation across experimental conditions remains challenging, because differences in molecular profiles between conditions confound differences in molecular profiles across space. Here, we introduce a deep-learning framework called CAMPA (Conditional Autoencoder for Multiplexed Pixel Analysis), which uses a variational autoencoder conditioned on cellular states and perturbations to learn consistent molecular signatures. Clustering the learned representations into subcellular landmarks allows quantitative comparisons of landmark sizes, shapes, molecular compositions and relative spatial organisation between conditions. By performing high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence on human cells, we use CAMPA to reveal how subnuclear organisation changes upon different perturbations of RNA production or processing, and how different membraneless organelles scale with cell size. Furthermore, by integrating information across the cellular and subcellular scales, we uncover new links between the molecular composition of membraneless organelles and bulk RNA synthesis rates of single cells. We anticipate that CAMPA will greatly accelerate the systematic mapping of multiscale atlases of biological organisation to identify the rules by which context shapes physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic analysis of the mammalian retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) aims to identify cellular networks that influence ocular development, maintenance, function, and disease. However, available evidence points to RPE cell heterogeneity in the native tissue, which adds complexity to transcriptomic analysis. Here, to assess cell heterogeneity, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of RPE cells from two young adult male C57BL/6J mice. Following quality control to ensure robust transcript identification limited to cell singlets, we detected 13,858 transcripts among 2,667 and 2,846 RPE cells, respectively. Dimensional reduction by principal component analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection revealed six distinct cell popu-lations. All clusters expressed transcripts typical of RPE cells; the smallest (C1, containing 1-2% of total cells) exhibited hallmarks of stem and/or progenitor cells. Placing C1-6 along a pseudotime axis suggested a relative decrease in melanogenesis and stem/progenitor gene expression, and a corresponding increase in visual cycle gene expression upon RPE maturation. K-means testing of all detected transcripts identified additional expression patterns that may advance understanding of RPE stem/pro-genitor cell maintenance and the evolution of cellular metabolic networks during development. This work provides new insights into the transcriptome of the mouse RPE and a baseline for identifying experimentally induced transcriptional changes in future studies of this tissue.",

In the present study, we demonstrate in medaka that allogeneic adult testicular tissue will engraft in adult recipients immediately after partial castration without the use of immunosuppressive drugs. The allografted testes are retained in the recipients body for at least three months and are able to produce viable sperm that yield offspring after natural mating. Some recipients showed a high frequency (over 60%) of offspring derived from spermatozoa produced by the transplanted testicular tissue. Histological analyses showed that allografted testicular tissues included both germ cells and somatic cells that had established within an immunocompetent recipient testis. The relative simplicity of this testis transplantation approach will benefit investigations of the basic processes of reproductive immunology and will improve the technique of gonadal tissue transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of a taxonomic key for the identification of Artemia species, molecular markers have been increasingly used for phylogenetic studies. The mtCOI marker is a regularly considered marker for the molecular systematics of Artemia populations. The proposed universal and specific primers have mostly failed to amplify the Artemia aff. sinica mtCOI marker, and on the whole, the successfully amplified products of the PCR were inefficient, primarily through the representation of poly-peak or incomplete sequences. We presumed that if a forward primer could be developed regarding the joint regions of the last part of the previous gene (tRNATyr) and the beginning of the target gene mtCOI, the sequence could be relevant to the target-sequence of mtCOI. Thus, here, we describe a new set of primers, which could be used to amplify the mtCOI barcoding region of Artemia aff. sinica Cai, 1989, with a high performance of sequencing. The new primer set worked well also for other Artemia bisexual species, as well as for parthenogenetic populations. It is recommended that joint regions between the previous/next gene(s) and the target marker, could be aimed at when designing specific primers for other markers and taxa.",

Results showed the largest diameter of untreated cyst, diameter of decapsulated cyst and thicker chorion ordinarily belong to invasive populations. Because of the small cysts, which have an effect on increasing quantity per unit weight and could be the cause of increased hatching efficiency, commercial productions of A. franciscana cyst from native sources should potentially be considered higher quality than productions from non-indigenous environments. Principal Component Analysis revealed that all cyst batches from San Francisco Bay were classified in one group and the most invasive populations could arrange in other separated group. Although, diameter of decapsulated cyst and chorion thickness showed a negative and significant correlation among invasive populations, there was no significant relationship within native populations.

Brain inflammation has emerged as a key pathogenic mechanism in AD. We hypothesized that oxytocin, a pro-social hypothalamic neuropeptide with anti-inflammatory properties, could have therapeutic actions in AD. We investigated oxytocin production in mouse models of AD, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin. We observed lower levels of hypothalamic oxytocin in wild-type mice following brain infusion of amyloid-{beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), as well as in APP/PS1 AD model mice. Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with intranasal oxytocin reduced microglial activation and favored deposition of A{beta} in dense core plaques, a potentially neuroprotective mechanism. Oxytocin further alleviated social and non-social memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings point to oxytocin as a potential therapeutic target to reduce brain inflammation and correct memory deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract of Ataxin-2 (ATXN2). Other polyQ-containing proteins such as ATXN7 and huntingtin are associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases when their N-terminal polyQ domains are expanded. Furthermore, they undergo proteolytic processing events that produce N-terminal fragments that include the polyQ stretch, which are implicated in pathogenesis. Interestingly, N-terminal ATXN2 fragments were reported in a brain extract from a SCA2 patient, but it is currently unknown whether an expanded polyQ domain contributes to ATXN2 proteolytic susceptibility. Here, we used transient expression in HEK293 cells to determine whether ATXN2 is a target for specific N-terminal proteolysis. We found that ATXN2 proteins with either normal or expanded polyQ stretches undergo proteolytic cleavage releasing an N-terminal polyQ-containing fragment. We identified a short amino acid sequence downstream of the polyQ domain that is necessary for N-terminal cleavage of full-length ATXN2 and sufficient to induce proteolysis of a heterologous protein. However, this sequence is not required for cleavage of a short ATXN2 isoform produced from an alternative start codon located just upstream of the CAG repeats encoding the polyQ domain. Our study extends our understanding of ATXN2 posttranslational regulation by revealing that this protein can be the target of specific proteolytic cleavage events releasing polyQ-containing products that are modulated by the N-terminal domain of ATXN2. N-terminal ATXN2 proteolysis of expanded polyQ domains might contribute to SCA2 pathology, as observed in other neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyQ domain expansion.",

In the present MEG study, we empirically tested a computational model that leverages an oscillating inhibition algorithm to minimise overlap between memories. We used a proactive interference task, where a reminder word could be associated with either a single image (non-competitive condition) or two competing images, and participants were asked to always recall the most recently learned word-image association. Time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect the reactivated content of target and competitor memories from MEG sensor patterns, and the timing of these neural reactivations was analysed relative to the phase of the dominant hippocampal 3Hz theta oscillation. In line with our preregistered hypotheses, target and competitor reactivations locked to different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm after several repeated recalls. Participants who behaviourally experienced lower levels of interference also showed larger phase separation between the two overlapping memories. The findings provide evidence that the temporal segregation of memories, orchestrated by slow oscillations, plays a functional role in resolving mnemonic competition by separating and prioritising relevant memories under conditions of high interference.",

Neurons of the same birthdate displayed distinct connectivity, coactivity across brain states, and assembly dynamics. Same birthdate hippocampal neurons were topographically organized, in that anatomically clustered (<500{micro}m) neurons exhibited overlapping spatial representations. Overall, the wiring and functional features of CA1 pyramidal neurons reflected a combination of birthdate and the rate of neurogenesis.

    "abstract": "Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that causes high rates of global mortality and morbidity. Although snakebite can cause a variety of pathologies in victims, haemotoxic effects are particularly common and are typically characterised by haemorrhage and/or venom-induced consumption coagulopathy. Despite polyclonal antibody-based antivenoms being the mainstay life-saving therapy for snakebite, they are associated with limited cross-snake species efficacy, as there is often extensive toxin variation between snake venoms, including those used as immunogens for antivenom production. This restricts the therapeutic utility of any antivenom to certain geographical regions. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using recombinantly expressed toxins as immunogens to stimulate focused, pathology-specific, antibodies to broadly counteract specific toxins associated with snakebite envenoming. Three snake venom serine proteases (SVSP) toxins, sourced from geographically diverse and medically important viper snake venoms were successfully expressed in HEK293F mammalian cells and used for murine immunisation. Analyses of the resulting antibody responses revealed that ancrod and RVV-V stimulated the strongest immune responses, and that experimental antivenoms directed against these recombinant SVSP toxins, and a mixture of the three different immunogens, extensively recognised and exhibited immunological binding towards a variety of native snake venoms. While the experimental antivenoms showed some reduction in abnormal clotting parameters stimulated by the toxin immunogens and crude venom, specifically reducing the depletion of fibrinogen levels and prolongation of prothrombin times, fibrinogen degradation experiments revealed they broadly protected against venom- and toxin-induced fibrinogenolytic functional activities. Overall, our findings further strengthen the case for the use of recombinant venom toxins as supplemental immunogens to stimulate focused and desirable antibody responses capable of neutralising venom-induced pathological effects, and therefore potentially circumventing some of the limitations associated with current snakebite therapies.",

    "abstract": "Polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1 (Pnpt1) plays critical roles in mitochondrial homeostasis by controlling mitochondrial RNA (mt-RNA) processing, trafficking and degradation. Pnpt1 deficiency results in mitochondrial dysfunction that triggers a Type I interferon response, suggesting a role in inflammation. However, the role of Pnpt1 in inflammasome activation remains largely unknown. In this study, we generated myeloid-specific Pnpt1-knockout mice, and demonstrated that Pnpt1 depletion enhanced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1{beta}) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) secretion in mouse sepsis models. Using cultured peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages we demonstrated that Pnpt1 regulated NLRP3 inflammasome dependent IL-1{beta} release in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), followed by nigericin, ATP or poly (I:C) treatment. Pnpt1 deficiency in macrophages increased glycolysis after LPS, and mt-reactive oxygen species (mt-ROS) after NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Pnpt1 activation of the inflammasome was dependent on both increased glycolysis and expression of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), but not NF-{kappa}B signaling. Collectively, these data strengthen the concept that Pnpt1 is an important mediator of inflammation as shown by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse sepsis and cultured macrophages.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDUnderstanding the networks of trophic interactions into which generalist predators are embedded is key to assessing their ecological role of in trophic networks and the biological control services they provide. The advent of affordable DNA metabarcoding approaches greatly facilitates quantitative understanding of trophic networks and their response to environmental drivers. Here, we examine how key environmental gradients interact to shape predation by Lycosidae in highly dynamic vegetable growing systems in China.\n\nRESULTSFor the sampled Lycosidae, crop identity, pesticide use, and seasons shape the abundance of preydetected in spider guts. For the taxonomic richness of prey, local- and landscape-scale factors gradients were more influential. Multivariate ordinations confirm that these crop-abundant spiders dynamically adjust their diet to reflect environmental constraints and seasonal availability to prey.\n\nCONCLUSIONThe plasticity in the diet composition is likely to account for the persistence of spiders in relatively ephemeral brassica crops. Our findings provide further insights into the optimization of habitat management for predator-based biological control practices.",

Here, we provide the first comprehensive climate impact assessment for reptiles on a global scale.\n\nLocationGlobal, excluding Antarctica\n\nTime period1995, 2050, 2080\n\nMajor taxa studiedReptiles\n\nMethodsWe modelled the distribution of 6,296 reptile species and assessed potential global as well as realm-specific changes in species richness, the change in global species richness across climate space, and species-specific changes in range extent, overlap and position under future climate change. To assess the future climatic impact on 3,768 range-restricted species, which could not be modelled, we compared the future change in climatic conditions between both modelled and non-modelled species.\n\nResultsReptile richness was projected to decline significantly over time, globally but also for most zoogeographic realms, with the greatest decrease in Brazil, Australia and South Africa. Species richness was highest in warm and moist regions, with these regions being projected to shift further towards climate extremes in the future. Range extents were projected to decline considerably in the future, with a low overlap between current and future ranges. Shifts in range centroids differed among realms and taxa, with a dominating global poleward shift. Non-modelled species were significantly stronger affected by projected climatic changes than modelled species.\n\nMain conclusionsWith ongoing future climate change, reptile richness is likely to decrease significantly across most parts of the world. This effect as well as considerable impacts on species range extent, overlap, and position were visible across lizards, snakes and turtles alike. Together with other anthropogenic impacts, such as habitat loss and harvesting of species, this is a cause for concern. Given the historical lack of global reptile distributions, this calls for a reassessment of global reptile conservation efforts, with a specific focus on anticipated future climate change.",

To identify candidate plants, they fitted lambda models of evolution to edible species with known values in each of six B vitamins (232 to 280 species) and used the estimated parameters to predict B-vitamin profiles of edible plants lacking nutritional data (6460 to 6508 species). The latter species were defined as potential sources of a B vitamin if the predicted vitamin content was [&ge;]15% towards recommended dietary allowances for active females between 31-50 years per 100 g of fresh edible plant material consumed. Unfortunately, the reliability of the predictions that informed the list of candidate species is questionable due to insufficient phylogenetic signal in the data (Pagels {lambda} between 0.171 and 0.665) and a high incidence of species with missing values (over 95% of all the species analyzed in the study). We found that of the 1044 species proposed as promising B-vitamin sources, 626 to 993 species showed accuracies that were indistinguishable from those obtained under a white noise model of evolution (i.e. random predictions conducted in absence of any phylogenetic structure) in at least one of the vitamins, which proves the weakness of the inference drawn from imputed information in the original study. We hope this commentary serves as a cautionary note for future phylogenetic imputation exercises to carefully assess whether the data meet the requirements for the predictions to be valuable, or at least more accurate than expected by chance.",

    "abstract": "The domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, and its wild progenitor, B. mandarina, are extensively studied as a model case of the evolutionary process of domestication. A conspicuous difference between these species is the dramatic reduction in pigmentation in both larval and adult B. mori. Here we evaluate the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-targeted knockouts of pigment-related genes as a tool to understand their potential contributions to domestication-associated pigmentation loss in B. mori. To demonstrate the efficacy of targeted knockouts in B. mandarina, we generated a homozygous CRISPR/Cas9-targeted knockout of yellow-y. In yellow-y knockout mutants, black body color became lighter throughout the larval, pupal and adult stages, confirming a role for this gene in pigment formation. Further, we performed allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9-targeted knockouts of the pigment-related transcription factor, apontic-like (apt-like) in B. mori x B. mandarina F1 hybrid individuals. Knockout of the B. mandarina allele of apt-like in F1 embryos results in depigmented patches on the dorsal integument of larvae, whereas corresponding knockouts of the B. mori allele consistently exhibit normal F1 larval pigmentation. These results demonstrate a contribution of apt-like to the evolution of reduced pigmentation in B. mori. Together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9-targeted knockouts as a tool for understanding the genetic basis of traits associated with B. mori domestication.\n\nBrief abstractBombyx mori and its wild progenitor are an important model for the study of phenotypic evolution associated with domestication. As proof-of-principle, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate targeted knockouts of two pigmentation-related genes. By generating a homozygous knockout of yellow-y in B. mandarina, we confirmed this gene\"s role in pigment formation. Further, by generating allele-specific knockouts of apontic-like (apt-like) in B. mori x B. mandarina F1 hybrids, we establish that evolution of apt-like contributed to reduced pigmentation during B. mori domestication.\n\nGraphical TOC/Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=148 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/490996v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10e5708org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@73ec82org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac6094org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8a54e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Most signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits point to noncoding genetic variants with putative gene regulatory effects. However, currently identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a small fraction of GWAS signals. By analyzing GWAS hits for complex traits in the UK Biobank, and cis-eQTLs from the GTEx consortium, we show that these assays systematically discover different types of genes and variants: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites, while GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in numerous functional annotations, are under strong selective constraint and have a complex regulatory landscape across different tissue/cell types, while genes near eQTLs are depleted of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand these observations, including how natural selection on complex traits hinders discovery of functionally-relevant eQTLs. Our results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically biased toward different types of variants, and support the use of complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation of eQTL studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that arise from the peripheral nervous system. Half of the tumors develop in the context of the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and the rest are sporadic sarcomas. MPNSTs have a dismal prognosis due to their aggressiveness and tendency to metastasize, and new treatment options are needed. The diagnosis of MPNSTs can be challenging, especially outside of the NF1 context since specific histological criteria have not been completely established. Genomic analysis may both facilitate differential diagnoses and suggest precision medicine strategies.\n\nMethodsWe generated a complete genomic resource of a set of widely used human NF1-related and sporadic MPNST cell lines by applying ploidy analysis, whole genome and whole exome sequencing and SNP-array analysis, complemented by methylome-based classification and immunofluorescence of cell identity markers (SOX9, SOX10, S100B).\n\nResultsNF1 MPNST cell lines faithfully recapitulated the genomic copy number profile of primary MPNSTs. Structural variants were key players in the complete inactivation of most recurrently altered tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) (NF1, CDKN2A, SUZ12/EED), while small variants played a minor role in the NF1 context, both concerning TSG inactivation and due to the absence of gain-of-function mutations. In clear contrast, the sporadic cell lines (STS-26T, HS-Sch-2, HS-PSS) did not recapitulate the copy number profile of primary MPNSTs. They carried different TSG inactivation and exhibited gain-of-function mutations by predicted kinase activation or generation of fusion genes. Mutational frequencies and signatures emerged as promising informative tools for aiding in MPNST differential diagnosis. Due to the multiple genomic differences exhibited, we complemented their characterization using a methylome-based classifier. All NF1-related cell lines were assigned within the MPNST group, while sporadic cell lines clustered either with melanomas or with an uncertain MPNST-like sarcoma group. The staining of cell identity markers reinforced the idea of a potential misdiagnose of the MPNSTs used to derive the sporadic cell lines analyzed.\n\nConclusionsDeep genomic analysis, together with methylome-based sarcoma classification and cell identity marker analysis, challenged the MPNST identity of sporadic cell lines. Results presented here open an opportunity to revise MPNST differential diagnosis and classification.",

Here, we infer the mixture of ways polygenic effects on physiological traits covary between males and females. We find that GxSex is pervasive but acts primarily through systematic sex differences in the magnitude of many genetic effects (\"amplification\"), rather than in the identity of causal variants. Amplification patterns account for sex differences in trait variance. In some cases, testosterone may mediate amplification. Finally, we develop a population-genetic test linking GxSex to contemporary natural selection and find evidence for sexually antagonistic selection on variants affecting testosterone levels.

    "abstract": "Cell-type-specific gene expression is maintained in large part by transcription factors (TFs) selectively binding to distinct sets of sites in different cell types. Recent research works have provided evidence that such cell-type-specific binding is determined by TFs intrinsic sequence preferences, cooperative interactions with cofactors, cell-type-specific chromatin landscapes, and 3D chromatin interactions. However, computational prediction and characterization of cell-type-specific and shared binding sites is rarely studied. In this paper, we propose two computational approaches for predicting and characterizing cell-type-specific and shared binding sites by integrating multiple types of features, in which one is based on XGBoost and another is based on convolutional neural network (CNN). To validate the performance of our proposed approaches, ChIP-seq datasets of 10 binding factors were collected from the GM12878 (lymphoblastoid) and K562 (erythroleukemic) human hematopoietic cell lines, each of which was further categorized into cell-type-specific (GM12878-specific and K562-specific) and shared binding sites. Then, multiple types of features for these binding sites were integrated to train the XGBoost-based and CNN-based models. Experimental results show that our proposed approaches significantly outperform other competing methods on three classification tasks. To explore the contribution of different features, we performed ablation experiments and feature importance analysis. Consistent with previous studies, we find that chromatin features are major contributors in which chromatin accessibility is the best predictor. Moreover, we identified independent feature contribution for cell-type-specific and shared sites through SHAP values, observing that chromatin features play a main role in the cell-type-specific sites while motif features play a main role in the shared sites. Beyond these observations, we explored the ability of the CNN-based model to predict cell-type-specific and shared binding sites by excluding or including DNase signals, showing that chromatin accessibility significantly improves the prediction performance. Besides, we investigated the generalization ability of our proposed approaches to different binding factors in the same cellular environment or to the same binding factors in the different cellular environments.",

    "abstract": "The neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with wide-ranging connections that support information flow and functional connectivity. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicate a moderate coupling between structural and functional connectivity at the system level. However, how do connections of different directions (feedforward and feedback) and regions with different excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neurons shape the hemodynamic activity and functional connectivity over the hierarchy are unknown. Here, we used functional MRI to detect optogenetic-evoked and resting-state activities over a somatosensory pathway in the mouse brain in relation to axonal projection and E/I distribution. Using a highly sensitive ultrafast imaging, we identified extensive activation in regions up to the third order of axonal projections following optogenetic excitation of the ventral posteriomedial nucleus of the thalamus. The evoked response and functional connectivity correlated with feedforward projections more than feedback projections and weakened with the hierarchy. The hemodynamic response exhibited regional and hierarchical differences, with slower and more variable responses in high-order areas and bipolar response predominantly in the contralateral cortex. Importantly, the positive and negative parts of the hemodynamic response correlated with E/I neuronal densities, respectively. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity was more associated with E/I distribution whereas stimulus-evoked effective connectivity followed structural wiring. These findings indicate that the structure-function relationship is projection-, cell-type- and hierarchy-dependent. Hemodynamic transients could reflect E/I activity and the increased complexity of hierarchical processing.\n\nSignificance StatementThe neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with complicated feedforward and feedback connections to selectively enhance (excitation) or suppress (inhibit) information from massive sensory inputs. How brain activity is shaped by the structural wiring and excitatory and inhibitory neurons is still unclear. We characterize how brain-wide hemodynamic responses reflect these structural constituents over the hierarchy of a somatosensory pathway. We find that functional activation and connectivity correlate with feedforward connection strengths and neuronal distributions. This association subsides with hierarchy due to slower and more variable hemodynamic responses, reflecting increased complexity of processing and neuronal compositions in high-order areas. Our findings indicate that hemodynamics follow the hierarchy of structural wiring and neuronal distribution.",

    "abstract": "Subjective tinnitus is an auditory phantom perceptual disorder without an objective biomarker. Fast and efficient diagnostic tools will advance clinical practice by detecting or confirming the condition, tracking change in severity, and monitoring treatment response. Motivated by evidence of subtle anatomical or functional morphological information in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we examined data-driven machine learning methods for joint tinnitus classification (tinnitus or no tinnitus) and tinnitus severity prediction. We propose a deep multi-task multi-modal framework for joint functionalities using structural MRI (sMRI) data. To leverage cross-information multimodal neuroimaging data, we integrated two modalities of 3-dimensional sMRI - T1 weighted (T1w) and T2 weighted (T2w) images. To explore the key components in the MR images that drove task performance, we segmented both T1w and T2w images into three different components - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and examined performance of each segmented image. Results demonstrate that our multimodal framework capitalizes on the information across both modalities (T1w and T2w) for the joint task of tinnitus classification and severity prediction. Our model outperforms existing learning-based and conventional methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide has been long recognized as an important modulator of neural plasticity, but characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved - specially the guanylyl cyclase-independent ones - has been challenging. There is evidence that NO could modify BDNF-TRKB signaling, a key mediator of neuronal plasticity. However, the mechanism underlying the interplay of NO and TRKB remains unclear. Here we show that nitric oxide induces nitration of the tyrosine 816 in the TRKB receptor in vivo and in vitro, and that post-translational modification inhibits TRKB phosphorylation and binding of phospholipase C{gamma}1 (PLC{gamma}1) to this same tyrosine residue. Additionally, nitration triggers clathrin-dependent endocytosis of TRKB through the adaptor protein AP2M and ubiquitination, thereby increasing translocation of TRKB away from the neuronal surface and directing it towards lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, inhibition of nitric oxide increases TRKB phosphorylation and TRKB-dependent neurite branching in neuronal cultures. In vivo, chronic inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) dramatically reduced TRKB nitration and facilitated TRKB signaling in the primary visual cortex, and promoted a shift in ocular dominance upon monocular deprivation in the visual cortex - an indicator of increased plasticity. Altogether, our data describe and characterize a new molecular brake on plasticity, namely nitration of TRKB receptors.\n\nSignificance statementWe described the nitration of TRKB receptors at the tyrosine residue 816 as a new post-translational modification (PTM) that restrains the signaling of the neurotrophic factor BDNF in neurons. This new PTM leads to endocytosis and degradation of the TRKB receptors. Intriguingly, this mechanism is tonically active under physiological conditions in vivo, and it is important for restricting ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex. This mechanism directly links two major systems involved in brain plasticity, BDNF/TRKB and nitric oxide. Our data provides a model for how NO production from nNOS can compromise TRKB function, and for the effects of nNOS inhibitors promoting plasticity.",

We demonstrated that scSpace can define biologically meaningful cell subpopulations neglected by single-cell RNA-seq or spatially resolved transcriptomics. The use of scSpace to uncover the spatial association within single-cell data, reproduced, the hierarchical distribution of cells in the brain cortex and liver lobules, and the regional variation of cells in heart ventricles and the intestinal villus. scSpace identified cell subclusters in intratelencephalic neurons, which were confirmed by their biomarkers.

    "abstract": "Since December 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected billions of people around the world and caused millions of deaths. The ability for this RNA virus to mutate has produced variants that have been responsible for waves of infections across the globe. The spike protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virion is responsible for cell entry in the infection process. Here we have studied the spike proteins from the Original, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B1.617.2), Delta-plus (B1.617.2-AY1), Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 variants. Using models built from cryo-EM structures with linoleate bound (6BZ5.pdb) and the N-terminal domain from 7JJI.pdb, each is built from the first residue, with missing loops modelled and 45 disulphides per trimer. Each spike variant was modified from the same Original model framework to maximise comparability. Three replicate, 200 ns atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed for each case. (These data also provide the basis for further, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, published elsewhere.) The analysis of our equilibrium molecular dynamics reveals that sequence variation at the closed receptor binding domain interface particularly for Omicron BA.2 has implications for the avidity of the locked conformation, with potential effects on Omicron BA.1 and Delta-plus. Linoleate binding has a mildly stabilizing effect on furin cleavage site motions in the Original and Alpha variants, but has no effect in Delta, Delta-plus and slightly increases motions at this site for Omicron BA.1, but not BA.2, under these simulation conditions.",

    "abstract": "Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde (PFA) is an essential step in numerous biological techniques as it is thought to preserve a snapshot of biomolecular transactions in living cells. Fixed cell imaging techniques such as immunofluorescence have been widely used to detect liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vivo. Here, we compared images, before and after fixation, of cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins that are able to undergo LLPS. Surprisingly, we found that PFA fixation can both enhance and diminish putative LLPS behaviors. For specific proteins, fixation can even cause their droplet-like puncta to artificially appear in cells that do not have any detectable puncta in the live condition. Fixing cells in the presence of glycine, a molecule that modulates fixation rates, can reverse the fixation effect from enhancing to diminishing LLPS appearance. We further established a kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein-protein interactions. Simulations based on the model suggest that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and notably, the difference between fixation rates of different proteins. Consistent with simulations, live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments showed that a fast overall rate of fixation relative to protein-protein interaction dynamics can minimize fixation artifacts. Our work reveals that PFA fixation changes the appearance of LLPS from living cells, presents a caveat in studying LLPS using fixation-based methods, and suggests a mechanism underlying the fixation artifact.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of human population history in deep time has been assisted by fitting \"admixture graphs\" to data: models that specify the ordering of population splits and mixtures which is the only information needed to capture the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations. Not needing to specify population size changes, split times, or whether admixture events were sudden or drawn out simplifies the space of models that need to be searched. However, the space of possible admixture graphs relating populations is vast and cannot be sampled fully, and thus most published studies have identified fitting admixture graphs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the vast majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all admixture graphs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this findGraphs tool within a software package, ADMIXTOOLS 2, which is a reimplementation of the ADMIXTOOLS software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to admixture graphs that played key roles in eight published studies and find that graphs modeling more than six populations and two or three admixture events are often not unique, with many alternative models fitting nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from admixture graphs should only be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature, that fit the allele frequency correlation data, and that are not obviously wrong.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection shapes the genetic architecture of many human traits. However, the prevalence of different modes of selection on genomic regions associated with variation in traits remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed an efficient computational framework to calculate enrichment of different evolutionary measures among regions associated with complex traits. We applied the framework to summary statistics from >900 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and 11 evolutionary measures of sequence constraint, population differentiation, and allele age while accounting for linkage disequilibrium, allele frequency, and other potential confounders. We demonstrate that this framework yields consistent results across GWASs with variable sample sizes, numbers of trait-associated SNPs, and analytical approaches. The resulting evolutionary atlas maps diverse signatures of selection on genomic regions associated with complex human traits on an unprecedented scale. We detected positive enrichment for sequence conservation among trait-associated regions for the majority of traits (>77% of 290 high power GWASs), which was most dominant in reproductive traits. Many traits also exhibited substantial enrichment for population differentiation and recent positive selection, especially among hair, skin, and pigmentation traits. In contrast, we detected widespread negative enrichment for balancing selection (51% GWASs) and no evidence of enrichment for selection signals in regions associated with late-onset Alzheimers disease. These results support a pervasive role for negative selection on regions of the human genome that contribute to variation in complex traits, but also demonstrate where diverse modes of selection have shaped trait-associated loci. This atlas of signatures of different modes of natural selection across the diversity of available GWASs will enable exploration of the relationship between the genetic architecture and selection in the human genome.",

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers redistribution of cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by its proteasomal degradation. No changes to other cyclins or cyclin dependent kinases were observed. Further, cyclin D depletion was independent from SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell cycle arrest in early S phase or S/G2/M phase. Cyclin D3 knockdown by small interfering RNA specifically enhanced progeny virus titres in supernatants. Finally, cyclin D3 co-immunoprecipitated with SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Membrane proteins. We propose that cyclin D3 inhibits virion assembly and is depleted during SARS-CoV-2 infection to restore efficient assembly and release of newly produced virions.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) is the main cell surface receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and is expressed in a variety of cell types, including cells of the respiratory tract. A bacterial lysate used for the prophylaxis of respiratory infections (OM-85), was recently shown to downregulate the expression of ACE2 in epithelial cells, suggesting its possible role as a prophylaxis of the onset of COVID19. Another bacterial lysate (Lantigen B, administered sublingually) is used in the prophylaxis of recurrent respiratory tract infections. It contains antigens obtained by chemical lysis from the most representative microbes of the respiratory tract. In this in vitro study, the capacity of Lantigen B to decrease ACE2 in human oropharyngeal cells was evaluated. The study was carried out in 40 healthy donors undergoing oropharyngeal swab for routine SARS-CoV-2 detection. Cells were treated in vitro with a 1:2 of Lantigen B. ACE2 expression was evaluated using a fluorescent anti-ACE2 monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry. A reduction in the number of positive cells was observed in 72% of the patients, while a modulation of ACE2 expression was observed in 62% of the samples. As a control, the expression of the CD54 rhinovirus receptor in the same cells was unaffected. To evaluate the functional effects of down regulation, in a subset of samples, the same oropharynx cells were incubated with Lantigen B and infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. After 24 hours, viral RNA, as assessed by rt-PCR, was significantly lower in samples treated with Lantigen B. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Lantigen B, at a pharmacological dose, modulates the expression of the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor in oropharyngeal cells, and reduces viral yield. This activity could be synergistic with other approaches (vaccination and therapy) by reducing the number of potentially infected cells and thus reducing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, sperm acquire fertilization ability after a series of physiological and biochemical changes, collectively known as capacitation, that occur inside the female reproductive tract. In addition to other requirements, sperm bioenergetic metabolism has been identified as fundamental component in the acquisition of the capacitated status. Mammalian sperm produce ATP by means of two main metabolic processes, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and aerobic glycolysis, that are localized in two different flagellar compartments, midpiece and principal piece, respectively. In mouse sperm, the occurrence of many events associated to capacitation depends on the activity of these two energy-producing pathways, leading to the hypothesis that some of these events may impose changes in sperm energetic demands. In the present study, we used extracellular flux analysis to evaluate the changes in the glycolytic and respiratory parameters of murine sperm that occur as a consequence of capacitation. Furthermore, we examined whether these variations affect sperm ATP sustainability. Our results show that capacitation promotes a shift in the usage ratio of the two main metabolic pathways, from oxidative to glycolytic. However, this metabolic rewiring does not seem to affect the rate at which the sperm consume ATP. We conclude that the probable function of the metabolic switch is to increase the ATP supply in the distal flagellar regions, thus sustaining the energetic demands that arise from capacitation.",

    "abstract": "Peristalsis is one of the most common locomotion patterns in limbless animals. This motion is generated by propagating muscular contraction and relaxation along the body axis. While the kinematics of peristalsis has been examined intensively, the kinetics and mechanical control of peristalsis remain unclear, partially due to the lack of suitable physical models to analyse the force and temporal control in soft-bodied animals locomotion. Here, based on a soft-bodied animal, Drosophila larvae, we proposed a vacuum-actuated soft robot replicating their crawling behaviour. The soft structure, made with hyperelastic silicon rubber, was designed to mimic the larval hydrostatic structure. To estimate the adequate range of pressures and time scales for control of the soft robots, a numerical simulation by the finite element method was conducted. Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) was used to generate time-series signals to control the vacuum pressure in each segment. Based on this control system, the soft robots could exhibit the peristaltic pattern resembling fly larval crawling. The soft robots reproduced two previous experimental results on fly larvae: slower crawling speed in backward crawling than in forward crawling, and the involvement of segmental contraction duration and intersegmental delay in crawling speed. Furthermore, the soft robot provided a novel prediction that the larger the contraction force, the faster the crawling speed. These observations indicate that the use of soft robots could serve to examine the kinetics and mechanical regulation of crawling behaviour in soft-bodied animals.",

    "abstract": "Although successful COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, multiple pathogenic coronavirus species exist, urging for development of multi-species coronavirus vaccines. Here we developed prototype LNP-mRNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and test how multiplexing of these LNP-mRNAs can induce effective immune responses in animal models. A triplex scheme of LNP-mRNA vaccination induced antigen-specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with a relatively weaker MERS-CoV response in this setting. Single cell RNA-seq profiled the global systemic immune repertoires and the respective transcriptome signatures of multiplexed vaccinated animals, which revealed a systemic increase in activated B cells, as well as differential gene expression signatures across major adaptive immune cells. Sequential vaccination showed potent antibody responses against all three species, significantly stronger than simultaneous vaccination in mixture. These data demonstrated the feasibility, antibody responses and single cell immune profiles of multi-species coronavirus vaccination. The direct comparison between simultaneous and sequential vaccination offers insights on optimization of vaccination schedules to provide broad and potent antibody immunity against three major pathogenic coronavirus species.\n\nOne sentence summaryMultiplexed mRNA vaccination in simultaneous and sequential modes provide broad and potent immunity against pathogenic coronavirus species.",

    "abstract": "Since the realization in the 1970s that simple discrete-time population growth models can show complex unstable dynamics of population size, many explanations were proposed for the evolution of enhanced population stability. The most plausible of these was density-dependent selection, suggested to favour greater stability due to r-K trade-offs. However, the first experiment aimed at testing this prediction revealed that Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted to larval crowding did not evolve greater constancy stability than their ancestral controls. A subsequent study showed that D. ananassae populations adapted to larval crowding had evolved greater constancy and persistence than ancestral controls. These D. ananassae populations had experienced chronic larval crowding in conditions of very low amounts of food, whereas the earlier studied D. melanogaster populations had experienced chronic larval crowding at fairly high food amounts. Further theoretical work also suggested that populations adapting to crowding could evolve greater stability even in the absence of r-K trade-offs. Most recently, studies in our laboratory showed that two sets of crowding adapted D. melanogaster populations, derived from a common ancestral lineage, which differed in the food amounts at which they experienced larval crowding, evolved different patterns of constancy and persistence stability. These two sets of populations also differed in the traits, e.g. larval feeding rate, that evolved as they became more competitive. Here, we examine the response of key fitness components to larval and adult densities in these two sets of populations, to see whether differences in their stability attributes can be explained by variation in how their life-histories respond to crowding at different life stages. Of all traits examined, only pre-adult survivorship responded differently to larval density across the two sets of populations. The populations that adapted to larval crowding at low food amounts showed reduced sensitivity of pre-adult survivorship to larval density, compared to those that adapted to larval crowding at high food amounts. We discuss our results in the context of different ways in which density-dependent selection may facilitate the evolution of greater constancy or persistence, depending on the ecological details of how crowding was experienced.",

    "abstract": "TRAF6 is an adapter protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in signaling downstream of cell receptors essential for development and the immune system. TRAF6 participates in many protein-protein interactions, some of which are mediated by a C-terminal MATH domain that recruits TRAF6 to cell-surface receptors and associated proteins. The TRAF6 MATH domain binds to short peptide segments containing the motif PxExx[FYWHDE], where x is any amino acid. Blocking TRAF6 interactions is associated with favorable effects in various disease models. To better define the TRAF6 MATH domain binding preferences, we generated a bacterial cell-surface peptide display library to sample the TRAF6 motif sequence space. We performed sorting experiments and identified 236 of the best TRAF6-interacting peptides and a set of 1,200 peptides that match the sequence PxE but do not bind TRAF6. Selected binders, tested by single-clone bacterial display titrations and bio-layer interferometry, bound TRAF6 tighter than previously measured native peptides. To elucidate the structural basis for TRAF6 interaction preferences, we built all-atom structural models of the TRAF6 MATH domain in complex with high-affinity binders and motif-matching nonbinders that were identified in the screen. We identified motif features that favor binding to TRAF6 as well as negative design elements distributed across the motif that can disfavor or preclude binding. Searching the human proteome for matches to the library screening-defined binding motif revealed that most known, biologically relevant TRAF6 motif matches occupy a different sequence space from the most enriched hits discovered in combinatorial library screening. Our experimentally determined binding preferences and structural models can support the design of peptide-based interaction inhibitors with higher affinities than endogenous TRAF6 ligands.",

Cardiac patches could attenuate adverse LV remodeling by providing mechanical support to infarcted myocardium and border zone tissue.

By transcriptome analysis, we found that the myocardial transcription levels of mechanosensitive ion channel proteins Piezo1 and Piezo2 significantly increased in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In vitro tensile tests with local tissue information revealed a significant decrease in local strain and mechanical load in rat infarct. Cardiac function and geometry were preserved compared to non-treated control. Further, in LV myocardium of the patch-treated group, MI induced expression levels of Piezo1/2 were significantly reverted to the similar levels of the Sham group, indicating that cardiac patch beneficial effects were correlated with suppressing mechanosensitive genes, particularly Piezo1/2.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMSThe adipokine C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (CTRP3) has anti-inflammatory effects in several non-intestinal disorders. Although CTRP3 is reduced in the serum of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its function in IBD has not been established. We aimed to elucidate the function of CTRP3 and related molecular mechanisms in intestinal inflammation using a colitis model of genetically-modified CTRP3 mice and intestinal epithelial tissue from patients with Crohns disease (CD), one of the two main forms of IBD.\n\nMETHODSCTRP3 knockout (KO) and overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice along with their corresponding wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to drinking water containing dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 6-10 days to induce acute colitis. Mouse colitis symptoms and histological data were analyzed. CTRP3-mediated signaling was examined in the intestinal tissue of mice and patients with CD.\n\nRESULTSCTRP3 mRNA and protein were detected in murine and human intestinal epithelial cells, as well as in murine intestinal smooth muscle cells and mesenteric fat. In DSS-induced acute colitis models, CTRP3 KO mice developed more severe colitis than their WT littermates, while CTRP3 overexpressing Tg mice developed less severe colitis than their WT littermates. In both water- and DSS-treated CTRP3 KO mice, reduced CTRP3 levels correlated with decreased levels of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a histone deacetylase, increased levels of phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) subunit p65, resulting in increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The results from CTRP3 Tg mice mirrored those from CTRP3 KO mice in most respects. This CTRP3/SIRT1/NF-{kappa}B relationship was also observed in the intestinal epithelial tissue of patients with active and inactive CD.\n\nCONCLUSIONSCTRP3 expression levels correlate negatively with intestinal inflammation in mouse colitis models and CD patients. CTRP3 attenuates intestinal inflammation via SIRT1/NF-{kappa}B signaling to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse colitis models and patients with IBD. The manipulation of CTRP3 signaling, including through the use of SIRT1 agonists, may offer translational potential in the treatment of IBD.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWO_ST_ABSBACKGROUND AND CONTEXTC_ST_ABSAdipokine C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 (CTRP3) is a novel adipokine with known non-intestinal anti-inflammatory effects. CTRP3 is reduced in the serum of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, little is known about whether and how CTRP3 influences intestinal inflammation in IBD.\n\nNEW FINDINGSCTRP3 mRNA and protein were detected in murine and human intestinal epithelial cells, as well as in murine intestinal smooth muscle cells and mesenteric fat. CTRP3 deletion was associated with more severe acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, while CTRP3 overexpression was associated with less severe colitis. In both mice and humans, reduced CTRP3 levels correlated with reduced levels of the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), resulting in the up-regulation of phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) p65 and pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis.\n\nLIMITATIONSThis study was performed using genetically modified mice and human tissue samples. An acute DSS-induced colitis model was used; additional mouse colitis models designed to mimic other aspects of IBD will be examined in future studies. The specific source of the secreted CTRP3 protein which influences intestinal inflammation is yet to be identified. The use of recombinant CTRP3 protein supplementation and SIRT1 agonists to mitigate intestinal inflammation also requires further study.\n\nIMPACTCTRP3 is a novel anti-inflammatory adipokine that attenuates intestinal inflammation in colitis mouse models and intestinal epithelial tissue of patients with IBD. CTRP3 attenuates intestinal inflammation by activating SIRT1, which suppresses the pro-inflammatory transcriptional activity of phosphorylated NF-{kappa}B p65. CTRP3 and SIRT1 agonists have potential as novel IBD drug targets.",

Herein, we executed a meta-analysis of the existing recent literature investigating the impact of Li sources and levels on plant species under different growth conditions to understand the existing state of knowledge. Toxic effects of Li exposure in plants varies as a function of medium and interestingly, more negative responses are reported in hydroponic media as compared to soil and foliar application. Additionally, toxic effects of Li vary with Li source materials and LiCl more negatively affected plant development parameters such as plant germination (n=48) and root biomass (n=57) and recorded highly uptake in plants (n=78), while LiNO3 has more negative effects on shoot biomass. The Li at <50 mg L-1 concentrations significantly influenced the plant physiological indicators including plant germination and root biomass, while 50-500 mg L-1 Li concentration influence the biochemical parameters. The uptake potential of Li is dose dependent and their translocation/bioaccumulation remains unknown. Future work should include complete lifespan studies of the crop to elucidate the bioaccumulation of Li in edible tissues and to investigate possible trophic transfer of Li.\n\nEnvironmental significanceAccumulation of Li sources is increasing in ecosystem compartments, and this might be vulnerable to plants.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning the hidden relational structure from sequences of events is a crucial ability humans possess, which help them to predict the future and make inferences. Besides simple statistical properties, humans also excel in learning more complex relational networks. Several brain regions are engaged in the process, yet the time-resolved neural implementation of relational structure learning and its behavioral relevance remains unknown. Here human subjects performed a probabilistic sequential prediction task on image sequences generated from a transition graph-like network, with their brain activities recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrate the emergence of two key aspects of relational knowledge - lower-order transition probability and higher-order community structure, which arise around 840 msec after image onset and well predict behavioral performance. Furthermore, computational modeling suggests that the formed higher-order community structure, i.e., compressed clusters in the network, could be well characterized by a successor representation operation. Overall, human brains are constantly computing the temporal statistical relationship among discrete inputs, based on which new abstract knowledge could be inferred.",

Several works show the ability to predict the performance of WM with machine learning (ML) methods, and although good prediction results are obtained in these works, ignoring the intersubject variability and the temporal and spatial characterization in a WM task to improve the prediction in each subject. In this paper, we take advantage of the spectral properties of WM to characterize the individual differences in visual WM capacity and predict the subjects performance. Feature selection was implemented through the selection of electrodes making use of methods to treat unbalanced classes. The results show a correlation between the accuracy achieved with an Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis (RLDA) classifier using the power spectrum of the EEG signal and the accuracy achieved by each subject in the behavioral experiment response of a WM task with retro-cue. The proposed methodology allows identifying spatial and temporal characteristics in the WM performance in each subject. Our methodology shows that it is possible to predict the WM performance in each subject. Finally, our results showed that by knowing the spatiotemporal characteristics that predict WM performance, it is possible to customize a WM task and optimize the use of electrodes for agile processing adapted to a specific subject.

Analyzing transmission at calyx of Held synapses reveals that differences in synaptic strength and STP are not primarily caused by variable fusion probability (pfusion) but determined by the fraction of docked synaptic vesicles equipped with a mature release machinery. Our simulations show, that traditional quantal analysis methods do not necessarily report pfusion of SVs with a mature release machinery but reflect both pfusion and the distribution between mature and immature priming states at rest. Thus, the approach holds promise for a better mechanistic dissection of the roles of presynaptic proteins in the sequence of SV docking, two-step priming and fusion and suggests a mechanism for activity-induced redistribution of synaptic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA internal modification and has been shown to regulate the development, physiology and pathology of various tissues. However, the functions of the m6A epitranscriptome in the visual system remain unclear. In this study, using a retina-specific conditional knockout mouse model, we show that retinas deficient in Mettl3, the core component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, exhibit structural and functional abnormalities beginning at the end of retinogenesis. Immunohistological and scRNA-seq analyses of retinogenesis processes reveal that retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and Muller glial cells are the two cell types primarily affected by Mettl3 deficiency. Integrative analyses of scRNA-seq and MeRIP-seq data suggest that m6A fine-tunes the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Muller cells by promoting the degradation of RPC transcripts, the disruption of which leads to abnormalities in late retinogenesis and compromises the glial functions of Muller cells. Finally, overexpression of m6A-regulated RPC-enriched transcripts in late RPCs partially recapitulates the Mettl3-deficient retinal phenotype. Collectively, our study reveals an epitranscriptomic mechanism governing progenitor-to-glial cell transition during late retinogenesis, which is essential for the homeostasis of the mature retina. The mechanism revealed in this study might also apply to other nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "Human genetic diversity can reveal critical factors in host-pathogen interactions. This is especially useful for human-restricted pathogens like Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the cause of Typhoid fever. One key dynamic during infection is competition for nutrients: host cells attempt to restrict intracellular replication by depriving bacteria of key nutrients or delivering toxic metabolites in a process called nutritional immunity. Here, a cellular genome-wide association study of intracellular replication by S. Typhi in nearly a thousand cell lines from around the world--and extensive follow-up using intracellular S. Typhi transcriptomics and manipulation of magnesium concentrations--demonstrates that the divalent cation channel mucolipin-2 (MCOLN2) restricts S. Typhi intracellular replication through magnesium deprivation. Our results reveal natural diversity in Mg2+ limitation as a key component of nutritional immunity against S. Typhi.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryHuman immune cells genetically vary in their ability to use magnesium deprivation to restrict growth of the typhoid fever bacterium.",

    "abstract": "Cell type composition of intact bulk tissues can vary across samples. Deciphering cell type composition and its changes during disease progression is an important step towards understanding disease pathogenesis. To infer cell type composition, existing cell type deconvolution methods for bulk RNA-seq data often require matched single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, generated from samples with similar clinical conditions, as reference. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining scRNA-seq data in diseased samples, only limited scRNA-seq data in matched disease conditions are available. Using scRNA-seq reference to deconvolve bulk RNA-seq data from samples with different disease conditions may lead to biased estimation of cell type proportions. To overcome this limitation, we propose an iterative estimation procedure, MuSiC2, which is an extension of MuSiC [1], to perform deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-seq data generated from samples with multiple clinical conditions where at least one condition is different from that of the scRNA-seq reference. Extensive benchmark evaluations indicated that MuSiC2 improved the accuracy of cell type proportion estimates of bulk RNA-seq samples under different conditions as compared to the traditional MuSiC [1] deconvolution. MuSiC2 was applied to two bulk RNA-seq datasets for deconvolution analysis, including one from human pancreatic islets and the other from human retina. We show that MuSiC2 improves current deconvolution methods and provides more accurate cell type proportion estimates when the bulk and single-cell reference differ in clinical conditions. We believe the condition-specific cell type composition estimates from MuSiC2 will facilitate downstream analysis and help identify cellular targets of human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid aggregation of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) into neurofibrillary tangles is closely associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). Several molecular chaperones have been reported to bind Tau and impede its pathological aggregation. Recent findings of elevated levels of Hsp27 in the brains of patients with AD suggested its important role in pTau pathology. However, the molecular mechanism of Hsp27 in pTau aggregation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Hsp27 partially co-localizes with pTau tangles in the brains of patients with AD. Notably, phosphorylation of Tau by microtubule affinity regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), dramatically enhances the binding affinity of Hsp27 to Tau. Moreover, Hsp27 efficiently prevents pTau fibrillation in vitro and mitigates neuropathology of pTau aggregation in a Drosophila tauopathy model. Further mechanistic study reveals that Hsp27 employs its N-terminal domain to directly interact with multiple phosphorylation sites of pTau for specific binding. Our work provides the structural basis for the specific recognition of Hsp27 to pathogenic pTau, and highlights the important role of Hsp27 in preventing abnormal aggregation and pathology of pTau in AD.",

Most commonly used epitope tags are bound by conventional, full-size antibodies (Abs). The complex architecture of Abs complicates their application in protein engineering and intracellular applications. To address these shortcomings, single domain antibodies (nanobodies, Nbs) that recognize short peptide epitopes have become increasingly prized. Here we characterize the interaction between a Nb (Nb6E) and a 14-mer peptide epitope. We identify residues in the peptide epitope essential for high affinity binding. Using this information in combination with computational modeling we propose a mode of interaction between Nb6E and this epitope. We apply this nanobody-epitope pair to augment the potency of a ligand at an engineered adenosine A2A receptor. This characterization of the nanobody-epitope pair opens the door to diverse applications including mechanistic studies of G protein-coupled receptor function.",

Recent advancements in representation learning have been shown to greatly improve the performance of molecular property prediction. However, due to limited labeled data, supervised learning-based molecular representation algorithms can only search limited chemical space and suffer from poor generalizability.\n\nResultsIn this work, we proposed a self-supervised learning method, ATMOL, for molecular representation learning and properties prediction. We developed a novel molecular graph augmentation strategy, referred to as attention-wise graph masking, to generate challenging positive samples for contrastive learning. We adopted the graph attention network (GAT) as the molecular graph encoder, and leveraged the learned attention weights as masking guidance to generate molecular augmentation graphs. By minimization of the contrastive loss between original graph and augmented graph, our model can capture important molecular structure and higher-order semantic information. Extensive experiments showed that our attention-wise graph mask contrastive learning exhibited state-of-the-art performance in a couple of downstream molecular property prediction tasks. We also verified that our model pretrained on larger scale of unlabeled data improved the generalization of learned molecular representation. Moreover, visualization of the attention heatmaps showed meaningful patterns indicative of atoms and atomic groups important to specific molecular property.",

Maps of multiple epigenetics marks have been integrated into cell or tissue type-specific chromatin state annotations for many cell or tissue types. With the increasing availability of multiple chromatin state maps for biologically similar samples, there is a need for methods that can effectively summarize the information about chromatin state annotations within groups of samples and identify differences across groups of samples at a high resolution.\n\nResultsWe developed CSREP, which takes as input chromatin state annotations for a group of samples and then probabilistically estimates the state at each genomic position and derives a representative chromatin state map for the group. CSREP uses an ensemble of multi-class logistic regression classifiers to predict the chromatin state assignment of each sample given the state maps from all other samples. The difference of CSREPs probability assignments for two groups can be used to identify genomic locations with differential chromatin state patterns.\n\nUsing groups of chromatin state maps of a diverse set of cell and tissue types, we demonstrate the advantages of using CSREP to summarize chromatin state maps and identify biologically relevant differences between groups at a high resolution.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe CSREP source code is openly available under http://github.com/ernstlab/csrep.\n\nContact: jason.ernst@ucla.edu",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and applied cancer studies that use individual-based models (IBMs) have been limited by the lack of a mathematical formulation that enables rigorous analysis of these models. However, spatial cumulant models (SCMs), which have arisen from theoretical ecology, describe population dynamics generated by a specific family of IBMs, namely spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs). SCMs are spatially resolved population models formulated by a system of differential equations that approximate the dynamics of two STPP-generated summary statistics: first-order spatial cumulants (densities), and second-order spatial cumulants (spatial covariances).\n\nWe exemplify how SCMs can be used in mathematical oncology by modelling theoretical cancer cell populations comprising interacting growth factor-producing and non-producing cells. To formulate model equations, we use computational tools that enable the generation of STPPs, SCMs and mean-field population models (MFPMs) from user-defined model descriptions (Cornell et al., 2019). To calculate and compare STPP, SCM and MFPM-generated summary statistics, we develop an application-agnostic computational pipeline. Our results demonstrate that SCMs can capture STPP-generated population density dynamics, even when MFPMs fail to do so. From both MFPM and SCM equations, we derive treatment-induced death rates required to achieve non-growing cell populations. When testing these treatment strategies in STPP-generated cell populations, our results demonstrate that SCM-informed strategies outperform MFPM-informed strategies in terms of inhibiting population growths. We thus demonstrate that SCMs provide a new framework in which to study cell-cell interactions, and can be used to describe and perturb STPP-generated cell population dynamics. We, therefore, argue that SCMs can be used to increase IBMs applicability in cancer research.\n\nStatements and DeclarationsThe authors have no competing interests to declare that are relevant to the content of this article.",

Returning to high-intensity exercise may place bones at risk of failure due to increased porosity caused by bone resorption. We used microradiographs of bone slices from highly-loaded (metacarpal, tibia) and minimally-loaded (rib) bones from 12 racehorses, 6 that died during a period of high-intensity exercise and 6 that had a period of intense exercise followed by at least 35 days of rest prior to death, and measured intracortical canal cross-sectional area (Ca.Ar) and number (N.Ca) to infer remodelling activity across sites and exercise groups. Large canals that are the consequence of bone resorption (Ca.Ar > 0.04 mm2) were 1.4x to 18.7x greater in number and area in the third metacarpal bone from rested than exercised animals (p = 0.005- 0.008), but were similar in number and area in ribs from rested and exercised animals (p = 0.575-0.688). An intermediate relationship was present in the tibia, and when large canals and smaller canals that result from partial bony infilling (Ca.Ar > 0.002 mm2) were considered together. The mechanostat may override targeted remodelling during periods of high mechanical load by enhancing bone formation, reducing resorption and suppressing turnover.

    "abstract": "The rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), the initial CNS site for processing gustatory information, is comprised of two major cell types, glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, but the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. The current investigation used mice expressing ChR2 under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. In vivo single-unit recording of rNST cells during optogenetic stimulation allowed us to address two important questions: (1) what are the gustatory response characteristics of \"optotagged\", putative GABAergic (G+TASTE) neurons? and (2) how does optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impact taste responses in non-GABAergic (G-TASTE) neurons? We observed that chemosensitive profiles of G+TASTE neurons were similar to non-GABA taste neurons but had much lower response rates. We further observed that there was a population of GABA cells unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+UNR) and located more ventrally in the nucleus. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-TASTE neurons across all qualities and types of chemosensitive neurons. Tuning curves were modestly sharpened but the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe rNST, the CNS gateway for taste, is rich in GABAergic neurons and synapses. Our in vivo recordings from GAD65/ChR2 mice reveal that gustatory response profiles of optotagged GABAergic neurons resemble non-GABAergic neurons, but with much reduced amplitudes. A novel population of GABA neurons were unresponsive to oral stimulation suggesting they are targets for centrifugal influences. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry modestly sharpened gustatory tuning but preserved the ensemble pattern for taste quality despite markedly suppressed responses. In behaving mice, activating rNST GAD65-expressing neurons with DREADDs shifted response-concentration curves for palatable and unpalatable stimuli, but preserved appropriate behaviors. These observations unveil previously unknown features of rNST GABA cells and demonstrate substantial inhibitory modulation at the first central taste relay.",

    "abstract": "Suppression gene drives are designed to bias their inheritance and increase in frequency in a population, disrupting an essential gene in the process. When the frequency is high enough, the population will be unable to reproduce above the replacement level and could be eliminated. CRISPR suppression drives based on the homing mechanism have already seen success in the laboratory, particularly in malaria mosquitoes. However, several models predict that the use of these drives in realistic populations with spatial structure may not achieve complete success. This is due to the ability of wild-type individuals to escape the drive and reach empty areas with reduced competition, allowing them to achieve high reproductive success and leading to extinction-recolonization cycles across the landscape. Here, we extend our continuous space gene drive framework to include two competing species or predator-prey species pairs. We find that in both general and mosquito-specific models, the presence of a competing species or predator can greatly facilitate drive-based suppression, even for drives with modest efficiency. However, the presence of a competing species also substantially increases the frequency of outcomes in which the drive is lost before suppression is achieved. These results are robust in models with seasonal population fluctuations that mosquito populations often experience. We also found that suppression can be somewhat more difficult if targeting a predator with strong predator-prey interactions. Our results illustrate the difficulty of predicting outcomes of interventions that could substantially affect populations of interacting species in complex ecosystems. However, our results are also potentially promising for the prospects of less powerful suppression gene drives for achieving successful elimination of target mosquito and other pest populations.",
