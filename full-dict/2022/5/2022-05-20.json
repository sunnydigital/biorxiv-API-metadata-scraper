    "abstract": "Resource availability and sociality are tightly coupled. Sociality facilitates resource access in a wide range of animal species. Simultaneously, resource availability may change sociality. However, experimental evidence for resource-driven social changes in the wild, beyond local aggregations at the resource, remains scarce. Moreover, it is largely unclear how potential changes in sociality relate to the social foraging benefits obtained by individual group members. Here, we recorded immediate and prolonged changes in social dynamics following ephemeral food availability in 18 mixed-sex Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) groups in natural rainforest pools. Using a counter-balanced within-group design, the social associations within each group was observed before, between and after ephemeral patch availability for two consecutive days. We show that groups increased their time spent socially two-fold following ephemeral food patch, but not control (empty) patch, availability. Groups with stronger foraging motivation, measured as the average proportion of fish feeding, showed a stronger increase in sociality. This resource-induced increase in sociality was still detectable the next day. Increase in the time spent socially by a group also positively correlated with the more frequent arrival at detected food patches for individual members of motivated groups, which, in turn, correlated strongly with individual food consumption. Our study causally demonstrates that changes in ephemeral resource availability can induce rapid, substantial, and prolonged changes in the social dynamics of wild fish and that this change positively correlated with individual foraging success. Further research is needed to investigate whether this social change is a cause or consequence of individual foraging success and why some groups respond more strongly than others.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFungi produce a wide range of specialized metabolites (SMs) involved in biotic interactions. Pathways for the production of SMs are often encoded in clusters of tightly arranged genes identified as biosynthetic gene clusters. Such gene clusters can undergo horizontal gene transfers between species and rapid evolutionary change within species. The acquisition, rearrangement and deletion of gene clusters can generate significant metabolome diversity. However, the genetic basis underlying variation in SM production remains poorly understood.\n\nResultsHere, we analyzed metabolite production of a large population of the fungal pathogen of wheat, Zymoseptoria tritici. The pathogen causes major yield losses and shows variation in gene clusters. We performed untargeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry to profile the metabolite diversity among 102 isolates of the same species. We found substantial variation in the abundance of the detected metabolites among isolates. Integrating whole-genome sequencing data, we performed metabolite genome-wide association mapping to identify loci underlying variation in metabolite production (i.e. metabolite-GWAS). We found that significantly associated SNP reside mostly in coding and gene regulatory regions. Associated genes encode mainly transport and catalytic activities. The metabolite-GWAS identified also a polymorphism in the 3UTR region of a virulence gene related to metabolite production and showing expression variation.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, our study provides a significant resource to unravel polymorphism underlying metabolome diversity within a species. Integrating metabolome screens should be feasible for a range of different plant pathogens and help prioritize molecular studies.",

    "abstract": "Many prokaryotes harbor the adaptive CRISPR-Cas system, which stores small nucleotide fragments from previous invasions of nucleic acids via viruses or plasmids. This molecular archive blocks further invaders carrying identical or similar nucleotide sequences. However, very few of these systems have been experimentally confirmed to be active in gut bacteria. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the type I-C CRISPR-Cas system of the prevalent gut bacterium Eggerthella lenta can specifically target and cleave foreign DNA in vitro by using a plasmid transformation assay. We also show that the CRISPR-Cas system acquires new immunities (spacers) from the genome of a virulent E. lenta phage using traditional phage-assays in vitro but also in vivo using gnotobiotic (GB) mice. An increased number of spacer acquisition events were observed when E. lenta was exposed to a low multiplicity of infection in vitro, and three phage genes were found to contain protospacer hotspots. Interestingly, much less new spacer acquisitions were detected in vivo than in vitro. Longitudinal analysis of phage-bacteria interactions showed sustained coexistence in the gut of GB mice, with phage abundance being approximately one log higher than the bacteria. Our findings show that while the type I-C CRISPR-Cas system is active in vitro and in vivo, a highly virulent phage in vitro was still able co-exist with its bacterial host in vivo. Taken altogether, our results suggest that the CRISPR-Cas defense system of E. lenta provides only partial immunity in the gut.",

    "abstract": "The vector-borne bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is responsible for Pierces disease (PD), a lethal grapevine illness that originated in the Americas. The international plant trade is expanding the geographic range of this pathogen, posing a new threat to viticulture worldwide. To assess the potential incidence of PD, we have built a dynamic epidemiological model based on the response of 36-grapevine varieties to the pathogen in inoculation assays and on the vectors distribution when this information is available. Key temperature-driven epidemiological processes, such as PD symptom development and recovery, are mechanistically modelled. Integrating into the model highresolution spatiotemporal climatic data from 1981 onward and different infectivity (R0) scenarios, we show how the main wine-producing areas thrive mostly in non-risk, transient, or epidemic-risk zones with potentially low growth rates in PD incidence. Epidemic-risk zones with moderate to high growth rates are currently marginal outside the United States. However, a global expansion of epidemic-risk zones coupled with small increments in the disease growth rate is projected for 2050. Our study globally downscales the risk of PD establishment while highlighting the importance of considering climate variability, vector distribution and an invasive criterion in obtaining accurate risk maps to guide policy decision-making in plant health.",

    "abstract": "Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is a main pathogenicity factor of - and {beta}-coronaviruses. Nsp1 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suppresses the host gene expression by sterically blocking 40S host ribosomal subunits and promoting host mRNA degradation. This mechanism leads to the downregulation of the translation-mediated innate immune response in host cells, ultimately mediating the observed immune evasion capabilities of SARS-CoV-2. Here, by combining extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations, fragment screening and crystallography, we reveal druggable pockets in Nsp1. Structural and computational solvent mapping analyses indicate the partial crypticity of these newly discovered and druggable binding sites. The results of fragment-based screening via X-ray crystallography confirm the druggability of the major pocket of Nsp1. Finally, we show how the targeting of this pocket could disrupt the Nsp1-mRNA complex and open a novel avenue to design new inhibitors for other Nsp1s present in homologous {beta}-coronaviruses.",

Although studies have shown olfactory and hematogenous entry into the brain and neuroinflammation, little attention has been paid to the susceptibility of the peripheral nervous system to infection or to alternative routes of CNS invasion. We show that neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system are susceptible to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infection of K18-hACE2 mice, wild-type mice, golden Syrian hamsters, and primary neuronal cultures demonstrate viral RNA, protein, and infectious virus in peripheral nervous system neurons and satellite glial cells, spinal cord, and specific brain regions. Moreover, neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 neuronal infection. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly invades and establishes a productive infection in the peripheral and central nervous system via direct invasion of neurons prior to viremia, which may underlie some cognitive and sensory symptoms associated with COVID-19.",

We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may target IS assembly in CTLs to escape killing. We show that primary human CD8+ T cells strongly upregulate the expression of ACE2, the Spike protein receptor, during differentiation to CTLs. CTL pre-incubation with the Wuhan or Omicron Spike variants inhibits IS assembly and function, as shown by defective synaptic accumulation of TCRs and tyrosine phosphoproteins as well as defective centrosome and lytic granule polarisation to the IS, resulting in impaired target cell killing. These defects were reversed by anti-Spike antibodies that interfere with ACE2 binding and were reproduced by ACE2 engagement with Angiotensin-II or an anti-ACE2 antibody, but not by the ACE2 product Ang (1-7). These results highlight a new strategy of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 based on the Spike-dependent, ACE2-mediated targeting of the lytic IS to prevent the elimination of infected cells.\n\nSummary statementWe report a new mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 based on direct disabling CTLs to form immune synapses through Spike protein binding to ACE2.

    "abstract": "Widespread and frequent testing is critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and rapid antigen tests are the diagnostic tool of choice in many settings. With new viral variants continuously emerging and spreading rapidly, the effect of mutations on antigen test performance is a major concern. In response to the spread of variants the National Institutes of Healths Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx(R)) initiative created a Variant Task Force to assess the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants on in vitro diagnostic testing. To evaluate the impact of mutations on rapid antigen tests we developed a lentivirus-mediated mammalian surface-display platform for the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, the target of the majority of rapid antigen tests. We employed deep mutational scanning (DMS) to directly measure the effect of all possible Nucleocapsid point mutations on antibody binding by 17 diagnostic antibodies used in 11 commercially available antigen tests with FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). The results provide a complete map of the antibodies epitopes and their susceptibility to mutational escape. This approach identifies linear epitopes, conformational epitopes, as well as allosteric escape mutations in any region of the Nucleocapsid protein. All 17 antibodies tested exhibit distinct escape mutation profiles, even among antibodies recognizing the same folded domain. Our data predict no vulnerabilities of rapid antigen tests for detection of mutations found in currently and previously dominant variants of concern and interest. We confirm this using the commercial tests and sequence-confirmed COVID-19 patient samples. The antibody escape mutation profiles generated here serve as a valuable resource for predicting the performance of rapid antigen tests against past, current, as well as any possible future variants of SARS-CoV-2, establishing the direct clinical and public health utility of our system. Further, our mammalian surface-display platform combined with DMS is a generalizable platform for complete mapping of protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 remained genetically stable during the first three months of the pandemic, before acquiring a D614G spike mutation that rapidly spread worldwide, and then generating successive waves of viral variants with increasingly high transmissibility. We set out to evaluate possible epistatic interactions between the early occurring D614G mutation and the more recently emerged cleavage site mutations present in spike of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern. The P681H/R mutations at the S1/S2 cleavage site increased spike processing and fusogenicity but limited its incorporation into pseudoviruses. In addition, the higher cleavage rate led to higher shedding of the spike S1 subunit, resulting in a lower infectivity of the P681H/R-carrying pseudoviruses compared to those expressing the Wuhan wild-type spike. The D614G mutation increased spike expression at the cell surface and limited S1 shedding from pseudovirions. As a consequence, the D614G mutation preferentially increased the infectivity of P681H/R-carrying pseudoviruses. This enhancement was more marked in cells where the endosomal route predominated, suggesting that more stable spikes could better withstand the endosomal environment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the D614G mutation stabilized S1/S2 association and enabled the selection of mutations that increased S1/S2 cleavage, leading to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants expressing highly fusogenic spikes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe successive emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is fueling the COVID pandemic, thus causing a major and persistent public health issue. The parameters involved in the emergence of variants with higher pathogenic potential remain incompletely understood. The first SARS-CoV-2 variant that spread worldwide in early 2020 carried a D614G mutation in the viral spike, making this protein more stable in its cleaved form at the surface of virions, and resulting in viral particles with higher infectious capacity. The Alpha and the Delta variants that spread in late 2020 and early 2021, respectively, proved increasingly transmissible and pathogenic when compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Interestingly, Alpha and Delta both carried mutations in a spike cleavage site that needs to be processed by cellular proteases prior to viral entry. The cleavage site mutations P681H/R made the Alpha and Delta spikes more efficient at viral fusion, by generating a higher fraction of cleaved spikes subunits S1 and S2. We show here that the early D614G mutation and the late P681H/R mutations act synergistically to increase the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Specifically, viruses with increased spike cleavage due to P681H/R were even more dependent on the stabilizing effect of D614G mutation, which limited the shedding of cleaved S1 subunits from viral particles. These findings suggest that the worldwide spread of the D614G mutation was a prerequisite to the emergence of more pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants with highly fusogenic spikes.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coordinates viral RNA synthesis as part of an assembly known as the replication-transcription complex (RTC)1. Accordingly, the RTC is a target for clinically approved antiviral nucleoside analogs, including remdesivir2. Faithful synthesis of viral RNAs by the RTC requires recognition of the correct nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) for incorporation into the nascent RNA. To be effective inhibitors, antiviral nucleoside analogs must compete with the natural NTPs for incorporation. How the SARS-CoV-2 RTC discriminates between the natural NTPs, and how antiviral nucleoside analogs compete, has not been discerned in detail. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the RTC bound to each of the natural NTPs in states poised for incorporation. Furthermore, we investigate the RTC with the active metabolite of remdesivir, remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP), highlighting the structural basis for the selective incorporation of RDV-TP over its natural counterpart ATP3,4. Our results elucidate the suite of interactions required for NTP recognition, informing the rational design of antivirals. Our analysis also yields insights into nucleotide recognition by the nsp12 NiRAN, an enigmatic catalytic domain essential for viral propagation5. The NiRAN selectively binds GTP, strengthening proposals for the role of this domain in the formation of the 5 RNA cap6.",

    "abstract": "The second and third years of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been marked by the repeated emergence and replacement of  variants with genetic and phenotypic distance from the ancestral strains, the most recent examples being Delta and Omicron. Here we describe a hamster contact exposure challenge model to assess protection conferred by vaccination or prior infection against re-infection. We found that 2-doses of self-amplifying RNA vaccine based on the ancestral spike ameliorated weight loss following Delta infection and decreased viral loads, but had minimal effect on Omicron/BA.1 infection. Prior infection with ancestral or Alpha variant was partially protective against Omicron/BA.1 infection, whereas all animals previously infected with Delta and exposed to Omicron became infected, although shed less virus. We further tested whether prior infection with Omicron/BA.1 protected from re-infection with Delta or Omicron/BA.2. Omicron/BA.1 was protective against Omicron/BA.2, but not Delta reinfection, again showing Delta and Omicron have a very large antigenic distance. Indeed, cross-neutralisation assays with human antisera from otherwise immunonaive individuals (unvaccinated and no known prior infection), confirmed a large antigenic distance between Delta and Omicron. Prior vaccination followed by Omicron or Delta breakthrough infection led to a higher degree of cross-reactivity to all tested variants. To conclude, cohorts whose only immune experience of COVID is Omicron/BA.1 infection may be particularly vulnerable to future circulation of Delta or Delta-like derivatives. In contrast, repeated exposure to antigenically distinct spikes, via infection and or vaccination drives a more cross-reactive immune response, both in hamsters and people.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInfection with the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants do not provide cross-protective immunity against reinfection with one another in hamsters.",

    "abstract": "Understanding allosteric mechanisms of the Hsp90 chaperone interactions with cochaperones and client protein clientele is fundamental to dissect activation and regulation of many proteins. In this work, atomistic simulations are combined with perturbation-based approaches and dynamic network modeling for a comparative mutational profiling of the Hsp90 binding and allosteric interaction networks in the three Hsp90 maturation complexes with FKBP51 and P23 cochaperones and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) client. The conformational dynamics signatures of the Hsp90 complexes and dynamics fluctuation analysis revealed how the intrinsic plasticity of the Hsp90 dimer can be modulated by cochaperone and client protein to stabilize the closed dimer state required at the maturation stage of the ATPase cycle. In silico deep mutational scanning of the protein residues characterized the hotspots of protein stability and binding affinity in the Hsp90 complexes, showing that binding hotspots may often coincide with the regulatory centers that modulate dynamic allostery in the Hsp90 dimer. We introduce a perturbation-based network approach for mutational scanning of allosteric residue potentials and characterize allosteric switch clusters that control mechanism of cochaperone-dependent client recognition and remodeling by the Hsp90 chaperone. The results revealed a conserved network of allosteric switches in the Hsp90 complexes that allow cochaperones and GR protein become integrated into the Hsp90 system by anchoring to the conformational switch points in the functional Hsp90 regions. This study suggests that the Hsp90 binding and allostery may operate under a regulatory mechanism in which activation or repression of the Hsp90 activity can be pre-encoded in the allosterically regulated Hsp90 dimer motions. By binding directly to the conformational switch centers on the Hsp90, cochaperones and interacting proteins can efficiently modulate allosteric interactions and long-range communications required for client remodeling and activation.",

We identify a bipartite interaction between CDC37 and BRAF and delimitate the essential structural elements of CDC37 involved in BRAF recognition. We find an extended and conserved CDC37 motif, 20HPNID---SL--W31, responsible for recognizing the C-lobe of BRAF kinase domain, while the c-terminal domain of CDC37 is responsible for the second of the bipartite interaction with BRAF. We show that dimerization of BRAF, independent of nucleotide binding, can act as a potent signal that prevents CDC37 recognition and discuss the implications of mutations in BRAF and the consequences on signaling in a clinical setting, particularly for class 2 BRAF mutations.",

    "abstract": "An altered neuronal excitability of spinal motoneurones has consistently been implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) leading to several investigations of synaptic input to these motoneurones. One such input that has repeatedly been shown to be affected is a population of large cholinergic synapses terminating mainly on the soma of the motoneurones referred to as C-boutons. Most research on these synapses during disease progression has used transgenic Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) mouse models of the disease which have not only produced conflicting findings, but also fail to recapitulate the key pathological feature seen in ALS; cytoplasmic accumulations of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Additionally, they fail to distinguish between slow and fast motoneurones, the latter of which have more C-boutons but are lost earlier in the disease.\n\nTo circumvent these issues, we quantified the frequency and volume of C-boutons on traced soleus and gastrocnemius motoneurones, representing predominantly slow and fast motor pools respectively. Experiments were performed using the TDP-43{Delta}NLS mouse model that carries a transgenic construct of TDP-43 devoid of its nuclear localization signal, preventing its nuclear import. This results in the emergence of pathological TDP-43 inclusions in the cytoplasm, modelling the main pathology seen in this disorder, accompanied by a severe and lethal ALS phenotype.\n\nOur results confirmed changes in both the number and volume of C-boutons with a decrease in number on the more vulnerable, predominantly fast gastrocnemius motoneurones and an increase in number on the less vulnerable, predominantly slow soleus motoneurones. Importantly, these changes were only found in male mice. However, both sexes and motor pools showed a decrease in C-bouton volume. Our experiments confirm that cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation is sufficient to drive C-bouton changes.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian gut is home to a vibrant community of microbes. As the gut microbiota has evolved, its members have formed a complex yet stable relationships that prevent non-indigenous microorganisms, such as Clostridioides difficile, from establishing within the gut. Using a bioreactor model of the gut, we characterize how variation in microbial community assembly changes its ability to resist C. difficile. We established diluted microbial communities from healthy human stool in a bioreactor gut model and subsequently challenged them with vegetative C. difficile. 16S rRNA-gene sequencing and selective plating revealed that dilution progressively increases microbiota variability and decreases C. difficile colonization resistance. Using Dirichlet Multinomial Mixtures and linear discriminant analysis of effect size, we identified 19 bacterial taxa, including Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Lachnospiraceae, that associate with more resistant community types. Since these taxa are associated with butyrate production, which is tied to C. difficile colonization resistance, we performed another reactor experiment where we increased inulin concentrations prior to C. difficile challenge. Diluted communities concurrently lost their ability to produce additional butyrate in response to inulin, as measured by high performance liquid chromatography, and resist C. difficile colonization. These data demonstrate that a similar level of microbiota cohesiveness is required to prevent C. difficile colonization and metabolize inulin. It also suggests that metabolic activity of butyrate-producing microbes is tied to colonization resistance. Future work can leverage these findings to develop treatments that leverage knowledge of these ecological dynamics to improve efficacy.\n\nImportanceThe microbes living in the human large intestine helps create an environment that is resistant to organisms that do not normally reside there, such as the pathogen Clostridioides difficile. Differences in ways in which microbial communities make an environment their home can change their ability to provide that resistance. To study those differences, we use a model of the intestine that incorporates only microbial variables (i.e. no host is involved). By diluting microbial communities to decrease their complexity, we show that communities lose their ability to resist C. difficile at a particular point and, at the same time, their ability to use inulin, a common dietary fiber, in ways that make the environment more toxic to C. difficile. These findings will help future researchers dissect the microbial components that create a resistant intestinal environment.",

    "abstract": "Managed and wild insect pollinators play a key role in ensuring that mankind is adequately supplied with food. Among the pollinating insects, the managed Western honey bee providing about 90% of commercial pollination is of special importance. Hence, diseases as well as disease causing pathogens and parasites that threaten honey bees, have become the focus of many research studies. The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor together with deformed wing virus (DWV) vectored by the mite have been identified as the main contributors to colony losses, while the role of the microsporidium Nosema ceranae in colony losses is still controversially discussed. In an attempt to solve this controversy, we statistically analyzed a unique data set on honey bee colony health comprising data on mite infestation levels, Nosema spp. infections and winter losses continuously collected over 15 years. We used various statistical methods to investigate the relationship between colony mortality and the two pathogens, V. destructor and N. ceranae. Our multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that V. destructor is the major cause of colony winter losses. When using cumulative data sets, we also found a significant relationship between N. ceranae infections and colony losses. However, determining the effect size revealed that this statistical significance was of low biological relevance, because the deleterious effects of N. ceranae infection are normally masked by the more severe effects of V. destructor on colony health and therefore only detectable in the few colonies that are not infested with mites or are infested at low levels.",

Spores of Clostridium are inert in healthy normoxic tissue, but germinate when in the hypoxic regions of solid tumors, causing tumor regression. However, such treatments fail to completely eradicate tumors because of higher oxygen levels rise at the tumors outer rim. In this study, we demonstrate that a degree of aerotolerance can be introduced to C. sporogenes by transfer of the noxA gene from C. aminovalericum. NoxA is a water-forming NADH oxidase enzyme. Thus, its activity has no detrimental effect on cell viability. In addition to its potential in cancer treatment, the noxA-expressing strain described here could be used to alleviate challenges related to oxygen sensitivity of C. sporogenes in biomanufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Many metabolic pathways are of ancient origin and have evolved over long periods of time (Noda-Garcia et al., 2018). Yet, new pathways can also emerge in short time scales in response, for instance, to the presence of anthropogenic chemicals in the environment (Copley, 2009). Models of metabolic pathway emergence and evolution often emphasize the acquisition of new reactions through horizontal gene transfer and promiscuous enzyme functionalities (Pal et al., 2005; Schulenburg & Miller, 2014; Copley, 2015; Noda-Garcia et al., 2018; Peracchi, 2018). A fundamentally different mechanism of metabolic innovation is revealed by the evolutionary repair experiments reported here. A block in the proline biosynthetic pathway that compromises cell survival is efficiently rescued by many single mutations (12 at least) in the gene of glutamine synthetase. The mutations cause the leakage to the intracellular milieu of a sequestered phosphorylated intermediate common to the biosynthetic pathways of proline and glutamine, thus generating a new route to proline. Metabolic intermediates may undergo a variety of chemical and enzymatic transformations, but are typically protected as shielded reaction intermediates or through channeling in multi-enzyme complexes and metabolons (Srere, 1987; Huang et al., 2001; Grunwald, 2018; Pareek et al., 2021). Our results show that intermediate leakage can readily occur and contribute to organismal adaptation. Enhanced availability of reactive molecules may enable the generation of new biochemical pathways. We therefore anticipate applications of mutation-induced leakage in metabolic engineering.",

    "abstract": "The phylum Apicomplexa includes thousands of species of unicellular parasites that cause a wide range of human and animal diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. To infect, the parasite must first initiate active movement to disseminate through tissue and invade into a host cell, and then cease moving once inside. The parasite moves by gliding on a surface, propelled by an internal cortical actomyosin-based motility apparatus. One of the most effective invaders in Apicomplexa is Toxoplasma gondii, which can infect any nucleated cell and any warm-blooded animal. During invasion, the parasite first makes contact with the host cell \"head-on\" with the apical complex, which features an elaborate cytoskeletal apparatus and associated structures. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new component of the apical complex, Preconoidal region protein 2 (Pcr2). Pcr2 knockout parasites replicate normally, but they are severely diminished in their capacity for host tissue destruction due to significantly impaired invasion and egress, two vital steps in the lytic cycle. When stimulated for calcium-induced egress, Pcr2 knockout parasites become active, and secrete effectors to lyse the host cell. Calcium-induced secretion of the major adhesin, MIC2, also appears to be normal. However, the movement of the Pcr2 knockout parasite is spasmodic, which drastically compromises egress. In addition to faulty motility, the ability of the Pcr2 knockout parasite to assemble the moving junction is impaired. Both defects likely contribute to the poor efficiency of invasion. Interestingly, actomyosin activity, as indicated by the motion of mEmerald tagged actin chromobody, appears to be largely unperturbed by the loss of Pcr2, raising the possibility that Pcr2 may act downstream of or in parallel with the actomyosin machinery.",

In yeast, sphingolipid depletion induces a state resembling amino acid restriction, which we hypothesized may be due to altered stability of amino acid transporters at the plasma membrane. To test this, we measured surface abundance for a diverse panel of membrane proteins in the presence of myriocin, a sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor. Unexpectedly, we found that surface levels of most proteins examined were either unaffected or increased during myriocin treatment, consistent with an observed decrease in bulk endocytosis. In contrast, sphingolipid depletion triggered selective endocytosis of the methionine transporter Mup1. Unlike methionine-induced Mup1 endocytosis, myriocin triggers Mup1 endocytosis that requires the Rsp5 adaptor Art2, C-terminal lysine residues, and the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin polymers. These findings reveal cellular adaptation to sphingolipid depletion by ubiquitin-mediated remodeling of nutrient transporter composition at the cell surface.",

The molecular mechanisms of cell migration are well-studied in 2D, but membrane shape-driven molecular migratory landscape in 3D fibrous matrices remains poorly described. 1D fibers recapitulate 3D migration, and here, we examined the role of membrane curvature regulator IRSp53 as a coupler between actin filaments and plasma membrane during cell migration on suspended 1D fibers. Cells attached, elongated, and migrated on the 1D fibers with the coiling of their leading-edge protrusions. IRSp53 depletion reduced cell-length spanning actin stress fibers, reduced protrusive activity, and contractility, leading to uncoupling of the nucleus from cellular movements. Using a theoretical model, the observed transition of IRSp53 depleted cells from rapid stick-slip migration to smooth, and slower migration was predicted to arise from reduced actin polymerization at the cell edges, which was verified by direct measurements of retrograde actin flow using speckle microscopy. Overall, we trace the effects of IRSp53 deep inside the cell from its actin-related activity at the cellular tips, thus demonstrating a unique role of IRSp53 in controlling cell migration in 3D.",

Here, we describe a complete biophysical study of the interaction between BUFII and Escherichia coli gDNA via spectrofluorimetric, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques, complemented with whole-genome sequencing. The E. colis DNA-BUFII interactome was isolated by an in vitro pull-down method aided by BUFII-magnetite nanobioconjugates. Our results demonstrated that DNA-BUFII formed round-shape nanoscale complexes by strong electrostatic interactions, likely occurring nonspecifically throughout the entire bacterial genome. Further sequencing of the isolated DNA fragments corroborated this notion and led to hypothesize that BUFII is possibly responsible for inducing DNAs supercoiling.\n\nOther evidence for this idea was provided by the significant DNA conformational changes observed upon interaction with BUFII. Even though the evidence found fails to describe the complete action mechanism of BUFII in vivo, our findings pave the way to engineer DNA-peptide supramolecular complexes very precisely, which might find application in the field of gene therapy delivery.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Drug resistance is the major cause for therapeutic failure in PDAC patients with progressive disease. The mechanisms underlying resistance formation are complex and remain poorly understood.\n\nTo gain insights into molecular changes during the formation of resistance to oncogenic MAPK pathway inhibition we utilized short-term passaged primary tumor cells from ten PDACs of genetically engineered mice. We followed gain and loss of resistance upon MEKi exposure and withdrawal by longitudinal integrative analysis of whole genome sequencing, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry data.\n\nWe found that resistant cell populations under increasing MEKi treatment evolved by the expansion of a single clone but were not a direct consequence of known resistance-conferring mutations. Rather, resistant cells showed adaptive DNA hypermethylation of 209 and hypomethylation of 8 genomic sites, most of which overlap with regulatory elements known to be active in murine PDAC cells. Both DNA methylation changes and MEKi resistance were transient and reversible upon drug withdrawal. The effector caspase CASP3 is one of the 114 genes for which transcriptional downregulation inversely correlated with the methylation status of the associated DNA region. CASP3 inactivation in resistant cells led to attenuation of drug-induced apoptosis which could be reversed by DNA methyltransferase inhibition with remarkable sensitivity exclusively in the resistant cells.\n\nOverall, our data provide a context for characterization and targeting of epigenetically mediated resistance mechanisms in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Redirection of T lymphocytes against tumor-associated or tumor-specific antigens, via bispecifc T cells engagers (BiTEs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), is a successful therapeutic strategy against certain hematologic malignancies. In contrast, so far it has failed against solid tumors. Given the scarcity of tumor-specific antigens, the vast majority of BiTEs and CAR Ts developed to date have been directed against tumor-associated antigens. These are expressed in some normal tissues and, as a consequence, frequent and serious side effects caused by on-target off-tumor activity have limited the use of BiTEs and CARs in the clinic. P95HER2 is a fragment of the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 expressed in more than 30% of HER2-amplified tumors. It has been previoulsy shown that p95HER2 is a tumor-specific antigen. Here we present the generation of CARs targeting p95HER2. p95HER2 CAR T cells show remarkable activity against p95HER2-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. Further, they are also effective against lung and brain metastasis. These tumor-specific CAR T cells could be used in the near future to deliver additional anti-tumor therapies in a safe manner.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlternative RNA splicing is widely dysregulated in cancers including lung adenocarcinoma, where aberrant splicing events are frequently caused by somatic splice site mutations or somatic mutations of splicing factor genes. However, the majority of mis-splicing in cancers is unexplained by these known mechanisms. We hypothesize that the aberrant Ras signaling characteristic of lung cancers plays a role in promoting the alternative splicing observed in tumors.\n\nMethodsWe recently performed transcriptome and proteome profiling of human lung epithelial cells ectopically expressing oncogenic KRAS and another cancer-associated Ras GTPase, RIT1. Unbiased analysis of phosphoproteome data identified altered splicing factor phosphorylation in KRAS-mutant cells, so we performed differential alternative splicing analysis using rMATS to identify significantly altered isoforms in lung epithelial. To determine whether these isoforms were uniquely regulated by KRAS, we performed a large-scale splicing screen in which we generated over 300 unique RNA sequencing profiles of isogenic A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells ectopically expressing 75 different wild-type or variant alleles across 28 genes implicated in lung cancer.\n\nResultsMass spectrometry data showed widespread downregulation of splicing factor phosphorylation in lung epithelial cells expressing mutant KRAS compared to cells expressing wild-type KRAS. We observed alternative splicing in the same cells, with 2196 and 2416 skipped exon events in KRASG12V and KRASQ61H cells, respectively, 997 of which were shared (p < 0.001 by hypergeometric test). In the high-throughput splicing screen, mutant KRAS induced the greatest number of differential alternative splicing events, second only to the RNA binding protein RBM45 and its mutant allele RBM45M126I. We identified ten high confidence cassette exon events across multiple KRAS variants and cell lines. These included differential splicing of the Myc Associated Zinc Finger (MAZ). As MAZ regulates expression of KRAS, this splice variant may be a mechanism for the cell to modulate wild-type KRAS levels in the presence of oncogenic KRAS.\n\nConclusionProteomic and transcriptomic profiling of lung epithelial cells uncovered splicing factor phosphorylation and mRNA splicing events regulated by oncogenic KRAS. These data suggest that in addition to widespread transcriptional changes, Ras signaling pathways in cancer promote post-transcriptional splicing changes that may contribute to oncogenic processes.",

In this study, we show that amino acid motif LRELL on PGC-1{beta} is responsible for the physical interaction with ERR and promotes ERR mRNA and protein expression. We used RNAsequencing to determine the genes regulated by both PGC-1{beta} & ERR and found that mitochondrial Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) was the gene that decreased most significantly after depletion of both genes. Depletion of PCK2 in colorectal cancer cells was sufficient to reduce anchorage-independent growth and inhibit glutamine utilization by the TCA cycle. Lastly, shRNA-mediated depletion of ERR decreased anchorage-independent growth and glutamine metabolism, which could not be rescued by plasmid derived expression of PCK2. These findings suggest that transcriptional control of PCK2 is one mechanism used by PGC-1{beta} and ERR to promote glutamine metabolism and colorectal cancer cell survival.",

Tissue damage at the bite-site often leaves victims with catastrophic life-long injuries and is largely untreatable by currently available antivenoms. Repurposing small molecule drugs that inhibit specific snake venom toxins offers a potential new treatment strategy for tackling this neglected tropical disease. Using human skin cell assays as an initial model for snakebite-induced dermonecrosis, we show that the repurposed drugs 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), marimastat, and varespladib, alone or in combination, reduce the cytotoxic potency of a broad range of medically important snake venoms up to 5.7-fold. Thereafter, using a preclinical murine model of dermonecrosis, we demonstrate that the dual therapeutic combinations of DMPS or marimastat with varespladib potently inhibit the dermonecrotic activity of three geographically distinct and medically important snake venoms. These findings strongly support the future translation of repurposed drug combinations as broad-spectrum therapeutics for preventing morbidity caused by snakebite.",

    "abstract": "As the elderly population increases, chronic, age-associated diseases are challenging healthcare systems around the world. Nutrient limitation is well known to slow the aging process and improve health. Regrettably, practicing nutrient restriction to improve health is unachievable for most people. Alternatively, pharmacological strategies are being pursued including myriocin which increases lifespan in budding yeast. Myriocin impairs sphingolipid synthesis, resulting in lowered amino acid pools which promote entry into a quiescent, long-lived state. Here we present transcriptomic data during the first 6 hours of drug treatment that improves our mechanistic understanding of the cellular response to myriocin and reveals a new role for ubiquitin in longevity. Previously we found that the methionine transporter Mup1 traffics to the plasma membrane normally in myriocin-treated cells but is not active and undergoes endocytic clearance. We now show that UBI4, a gene encoding stressed-induced ubiquitin, is vital for myriocin-enhanced lifespan. Furthermore, we show that Mup1 fused to a deubiquitinase domain impairs myriocin-enhanced longevity. Broader effects of myriocin treatment on ubiquitination are indicated by our finding of a significant increase in K63-linked ubiquitin polymers following myriocin treatment. Although proteostasis is broadly accepted as a pillar of aging, our finding that ubiquitination of an amino acid transporter promotes longevity in myriocin-treated cells is novel. Addressing the role of ubiquitination/deubiquitination in longevity has the potential to reveal new strategies and targets for promoting healthy aging.",

Here, we show that SEPTIN9 regulates RhoA signaling at the base of cilia by binding and activating the RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor, ARHGEF18. GTP-RhoA is known to activate the membrane targeting exocyst complex, and suppression of SEPTIN9 causes disruption of ciliogenesis and mislocalization of an exocyst subunit, SEC8. Using basal body-targeted proteins we show that upregulating RhoA signaling at the cilium can rescue ciliary defects and mislocalization of SEC8 caused by global SEPTIN9 depletion. Moreover, we demonstrate that transition zone components, RPGRIP1L and TCTN2 fail to accumulate at the transition zone in cells lacking SEPTIN9 or depleted of the exocyst complex. Thus, SEPTIN9 regulates the recruitment of transition zone proteins on Golgi-derived vesicles by activating the exocyst via RhoA to allow the formation of primary cilia.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are highly diverse, and understanding the factors that promote and modulate this diversity is a major area of research in microbial ecology. Recent work has proposed a reductionist perspective to microbial coexistence, where pairwise coexistence between strains in isolation is required for their coexistence in a more complex community. In this view, species exclusion in pairwise co-culture would preclude their coexistence in a more complex community too. An alternative view is that coexistence is a more complex property of the entire community, requiring the presence of additional community members. If this view were correct, competitive exclusion in pairwise co-culture would not necessarily preclude species coexistence in more complex community contexts. Empirically testing these alternative hypotheses is complicated by the intractably high microbial diversity of most natural communities, and the challenges of reconstituting every pair of coexisting species under the exact same habitat where their community of origin was assembled. To address this challenge, we have experimentally reconstituted all possible pairwise co-cultures between stably coexisting species from 13 different, low-diversity microbial enrichment communities, which had previously been assembled in a well-controlled synthetic habitat. We find that, when isolated from the rest of their community members, most species pairs fail to coexist. This result highlights the importance of community context for microbial coexistence and indicates that pairwise exclusion may not reflect the ability of species to coexist in more complex, multispecies ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Non-carbapenemase-producing carbapenem resistant Enterobacterales (non-CP-CRE) are increasingly recognized as important contributors to prevalent carbapenem resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections. However, there is limited understanding of mechanisms underlying non-CP-CRE causing invasive disease. Long- and short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to elucidate carbapenem non-susceptibility determinants in Enterobacterales bloodstream isolates at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. We investigated carbapenem non-susceptible Enterobacterales (CNSE) mechanisms through a combination of phylogenetic analysis, antimicrobial resistant (AMR) gene detection/copy number quantification, porin assessment, and mobile genetic element (MGE) characterization. Most CNSE isolates sequenced were non-CP-CRE (41/79; 51.9%) whereas 25.3% (20/79) were carbapenem intermediate Enterobacterales (CIE) and 22.8% (18/79) were carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales (CPE). Statistically significant copy number variants (CNVs) of extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase (ESBL) genes (Wilcoxon Test; p-value < 0.001) were present in both non-CP-CR E. coli (median CNV = 2.6X; n= 17) and K. pneumoniae (median CNV = 3.2X, n = 17). All non-CP-CR E. coli and K. pneumoniae had predicted reduced expression of at least one outer membrane porin gene (i.e., ompC/ompF or ompK36/ompK35). Completely resolved CNSE genomes revealed that IS26 and ISEcp1 structures harboring blaCTX-M variants along with other AMR elements were the primary drivers of gene amplification, occurring in mostly IncFIB/IncFII plasmid contexts. MGE mediated {beta}-lactamase gene amplifications resulted in either tandem arrays, primarily mediated by IS26  translocatable units, or segmental duplication, typically due to ISEcp1  transposition units. Non-CP-CRE strains were the most prevalent cause of CRE bacteremia with carbapenem non-susceptibility driven by concurrent porin loss and MGE-mediated amplification of blaCTX-M genes.\n\nIMPORTANCECarbapenem resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are considered urgent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threats. The vast majority of CRE research has focused on carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales (CPE) even though non-carbapenemase-producing CRE (non-CP-CRE) comprise 50% or more of isolates in some surveillance studies. Thus, carbapenem resistance mechanisms in non-CP-CRE remain poorly characterized. To address this problem, we applied a combination of short- and long-read sequencing technologies to a cohort of CRE bacteremia isolates and used these data to unravel complex mobile genetic element structures mediating {beta}- lactamase gene amplification. By generating complete genomes of 65 carbapenem non-susceptible Enterobacterales (CNSE) covering a genetically diverse array of isolates, our findings both generate novel insights into how non-CP-CRE overcome carbapenem treatments and provide researchers scaffolds for characterization of their own non-CP-CRE isolates. Improved recognition of mechanisms driving development of non-CP-CRE could assist with design and implementation of future strategies to mitigate the impact of these increasingly recognized AMR pathogens.",

To accurately model these data in downstream analyses, previous work has shown that droplet-based scRNA-seq data are not zero-inflated, but whether droplet-based snRNA-seq data follow the same probability distributions has not been systematically evaluated. Using pseudo-negative control data from nuclei in mouse cortex sequenced with the 10x Genomics Chromium system, we found that snRNA-seq data follow a negative binomial distribution, suggesting that parametric statistical models applied to scRNA-seq are transferable to snRNA-seq. Furthermore, we found that the quantification choices in adapting quantification mapping strategies from scRNA-seq to snRNA-seq can play a significant role in downstream analyses and biological interpretation. In particular, reference transcriptomes that do not include intronic regions result in significantly smaller library sizes and incongruous cell type classifications. We also confirmed the presence of a gene length bias in snRNA-seq data, which we show is present in both exonic and intronic reads, and investigate potential causes for the bias.",

These AML cells could regenerate AML post-transplantation. Prospective niche characterization revealed that skin harbored mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) with a similar phenotype as BM mesenchymal stem cells. These skin MPCs protected AML-initiating stem cells (LSCs) from chemotherapy in vitro partially via mitochondrial transfer. Furthermore, Lama4 deletion in skin MPCs promoted AML LSC proliferation and chemoresistance. Importantly, more chemoresistant AML LSCs appeared to be retained in Lama4-/- mouse skin post-cytarabine treatment.

    "abstract": "Adult mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase (AC) type VIII (TGAC8) adapt to an incessantly increased cAMP-induced cardiac workload ([~]30% increases in heart rate, ejection fraction and cardiac output) for up to a year without signs of heart failure or excessive mortality. Here we show that despite markedly increased cardiac work, classical cardiac hypertrophy markers were absent in TGAC8, total left ventricular (LV) mass was not increased: a reduced LV cavity volume in TGAC8 was encased by thicker LV walls harboring an increased number of small cardiac myocytes and a network of small interstitial non-cardiac myocytes, manifesting increased proliferation markers and compared to WT. Protein synthesis, proteosome activity, autophagy, and Nrf-2, Hsp90, ACC2 protein levels were increased in TGAC8, but LV ATP and phosphocreatine levels in vivo did not differ by genotype. 2,323 transcripts and 2,184 proteins identified in unbiased omics analyses, spanning a wide array of biological processes and molecular functions in numerous cellular compartments differed in TGAC8 vs WT; and over 250 canonical signaling pathways characteristic of adaptive survival circuitry of cancers, including PI3K and growth factor signaling, cytokine and T cell receptor signaling, immune responses, ROS scavenging, proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and nutrient sensing, were activated in TGAC8; and compared to WT there was a shift from fatty acid oxidation to increased aerobic glycolysis in the context of increased utilization of the pentose phosphate shunt and nucleotide synthesis. Thus, the adaptive paradigm, that becomes activated in the LV of TGAC8 in response to severe chronic, intense AC/PKA/Ca2+ signaling embodies many hallmarks of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Animals constantly perceive and integrate information across sensory modalities, and their nervous systems must select behavioral responses appropriate to the current situation and prior experience. Genetic factors supporting this behavioral flexibility are often disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions, and our previous work revealed the disease-associated ap2s1 gene critically supports habituation learning in acoustically-evoked escape behavior of zebrafish. ap2s1 encodes a subunit of the AP2 endocytosis adaptor complex and has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, though its mechanism and direct behavioral importance have not been established. Here, we show that multiple subunits of the AP2 complex regulate acoustically-evoked behavior selection and habituation learning. Furthermore, ap2s1 biases the choice between distinct escape behaviors in sensory modality-specific manners, and more broadly regulates action selection across different sensory contexts. Using tissue-specific and inducible transgenic rescue, we demonstrate that the AP2 complex functions acutely and in the nervous system to modulate acoustically-evoked habituation learning, suggesting several spatially and/or temporally distinct mechanisms through which AP2 regulates different aspects of escape behavior selection and performance. Altogether, we demonstrate that the AP2 complex coordinates action selection across stimulus modalities and contexts, providing a new vertebrate model for the role of ap2s1 in human conditions including autism spectrum disorder.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe AP2S1 gene has been linked to learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), though the mechanisms underlying its impact on human behavior are unknown. We explored how, when, and where this gene regulates vertebrate behavior, developing a zebrafish model to identify the roles and mechanisms through which ap2s1 modulates behavior. We find that ap2s1 regulates simple acoustically-evoked learning, as well as how individuals bias behavioral choice in a wide variety of contexts. We show that ap2s1 acts at multiple distinct time periods and locations both within and outside of neuronal tissues, revealing the diverse mechanisms and pathways through which it modulates vertebrate behavior.",

    "abstract": "The encoding of touch in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) and its influence on tactile representations in the brain are poorly understood. Using a range of mechanical stimuli applied to the skin, large scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and genetic manipulations, here we show that neurons in the mouse spinal cord DH receive convergent inputs from both low- and high-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes and exhibit one of six functionally distinct mechanical response profiles. Genetic disruption of DH feedforward or feedback inhibitory motifs, comprised of interneurons with distinct mechanical response profiles, revealed an extensively interconnected DH network that enables dynamic, flexible tuning of postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) output neurons and dictates how neurons in primary somatosensory cortex respond to touch. Thus, mechanoreceptor subtype convergence and nonlinear transformations at the earliest stage of the somatosensory hierarchy shape how touch of the skin is represented in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Oriented cell divisions balance self-renewal and differentiation in stratified epithelia such as the skin epidermis. During peak epidermal stratification, the distribution of division angles among basal keratinocyte progenitors is bimodal, with planar and perpendicular divisions driving symmetric and asymmetric daughter cell fates, respectively. An apically-polarized, evolutionarily-conserved spindle orientation complex that includes the scaffolding protein LGN/Pins/Gpsm2 plays a central role in promoting perpendicular divisions and stratification, but little is known about the molecular regulation of planar divisions. Here, we demonstrate that the LGN paralog, AGS3/Gpsm1, is a novel negative regulator of LGN, and inhibits perpendicular divisions. Static and ex vivo live imaging reveal that AGS3 overexpression displaces LGN from the apical cortex and increases planar orientations, while AGS3 loss prolongs cortical LGN localization and leads to a perpendicular orientation bias. Genetic epistasis experiments in double mutants confirm that AGS3 operates through LGN. Finally, clonal lineage tracing shows that LGN and AGS3 promote asymmetric and symmetric fates, respectively, while also influencing differentiation through delamination. Collectively, these studies shed new light into how spindle orientation influences epidermal stratification.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of ancient DNA in fossil bones is providing invaluable information on the genetics of past human and other animal populations. These studies have been aided enormously by the discovery that ancient DNA is relatively well preserved in the petrous bone compared to most other bones. The reasons for this better preservation are however not well understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that one reason for better DNA preservation in the petrous bone is that fresh petrous bone contains more DNA than other bones. We therefore determined the concentrations of osteocyte cells occluded inside lacunae within the petrous bone and compared these concentrations to other bones from the domestic pig using high resolution microCT. We show that the concentrations of osteocyte lacunae in the inner layer of the pig petrous bone adjacent to the otic chamber are about three times higher than in the temporal bone, as well as the cortical bone of the femur. The sizes and shapes of the lacuna in the inner layer of the petrous bone are similar to those in the femur. We also confirm that the petrous bone lacunae do contain osteocytes using a histological stain for DNA. We therefore conclude that one possible reason for better preservation of ancient DNA in the petrous bone is that this bone initially contains up to three times more DNA than other bones, and hence during diagenesis more DNA is likely to be preserved. We also note that the osteocytes in the inner layer of the petrous bone may have a function in hearing.",
