    "abstract": "The parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1 receptor (PTH1R) is a class B1 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that critically regulates skeletal development and calcium homeostasis. Despite extensive study, the molecular underpinnings of PTH1R stimulation by its cognate hormones, as well as by therapeutic agents, remain unclear. Here, we describe cryo-EM structures of the PTH1R in complex with active fragments of the two hormones, PTH and parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), the peptidic drug abaloparatide, as well as the engineered tool compounds, long-acting PTH (LA-PTH) and the truncated peptide, M-PTH(1-14). We found that the N-terminus of each agonist that is critical for activity, engages the transmembrane bundle in a topologically similar fashion, which reflects similarities in measures of Gs activation. The full-length peptides bind the extracellular domain (ECD) using a shared interface but induce subtly different ECD orientations relative to the transmembrane domain (TMD). In the structure bound to M-PTH, an agonist which only binds the TMD, the ECD is completely unresolved, demonstrating that the ECD is highly dynamic when unconstrained by a peptide. High resolutions enabled identification of water molecules near the peptide and G protein binding sites, some of which are structurally conserved with other class B1 GPCRs. Our results shed light on the action of orthosteric agonists of the PTH1R and provide a foundation for structure based-drug design.",

    "abstract": "Functional mitochondria are essential for cell viability and depend on protein import from the cytosol. Impaired protein import initiates various well-characterized cellular programs that rescue or remove dysfunctional mitochondria. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies the initial reduction of protein import into defective mitochondria remained unknown. Here, we found that the redistribution of mtHsp70, mitochondrial chaperone that is involved in both protein import and protein folding, regulates the efficiency of protein import. During early mitochondrial stress, before rescue programs are initiated and membrane potential is affected, mtHsp70-dependent import was specifically impaired and association of mtHsp70 with the import complex reduced. Even under non-stress conditions, the majority of mtHsp70 is found in a substrate-bound state. We propose that the availability of free mtHsp70 limits protein import into mitochondria during stress.",

Here we quantify and compare the passive transport of three aminoglycosides (kanamycin, gentamicin, and amikacin) across general or sugar specific porins of Escherichia coli (OmpF, OmpC, LamB and ChiP). Our analysis revealed that permeation of aminoglycosides (Kanamycin/Gentamycin/Amikacin) is about the same through ChiP ({approx}5/3/2 molecules/s), OmpF ({approx}10/15/<1 molecules/s) and OmpC ({approx}11/8/<1 molecules/s). In contrast, LamB of smaller pore diameter has no significant permeation ([&le;]1/1/1 molecules/s, all values recalculated for a gradient of 10 {micro}M).

    "abstract": "The design of compounds that can discriminate between closely related target proteins remains a central challenge in drug discovery. Specific therapeutics targeting the highly conserved myosin motor family are urgently needed as mutations in at least 6 of its members cause numerous diseases. Allosteric modulators, like the myosin-II inhibitor blebbistatin, are a promising means to achieve specificity. However, it remains unclear why blebbistatin inhibits myosin-II motors with different potencies given that it binds at a highly conserved pocket that is always closed in blebbistatin-free experimental structures. We hypothesized that the probability of pocket opening is an important determinant of the potency of compounds like blebbistatin. To test this hypothesis, we used Markov state models (MSMs) built from over 2 milliseconds of aggregate molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. We find that blebbistatins binding pocket readily opens in simulations of blebbistatin-sensitive myosin isoforms. Comparing these conformational ensembles reveals that the probability of pocket opening correctly identifies which isoforms are most sensitive to blebbistatin inhibition and that docking against MSMs quantitatively predicts blebbistatin binding affinities (R2=0.82). To test our ability to make blind predictions, we predicted blebbistatins binding affinity for an isoform (Myh7b) whose blebbistatin sensitivity was unknown. Encouragingly, we find good agreement between the predicted and measured IC50 (0.67 {micro}M vs. 0.36 {micro}M). Therefore, we expect this framework to be useful for the development of novel specific drugs across numerous protein targets.\n\nSignificanceDrug development requires the discovery of compounds which specifically target one member of a protein family without triggering side effects that arise from interactions with other related proteins. Myosins are a family of motor proteins that are drug targets for heart diseases, cancer, and parasitic infections. Here, we investigate why the compound blebbistatin specifically inhibits some myosins more potently than others, even though its binding site is closed in all known experimental structures. We find that the blebbistatin binding pocket opens in molecular dynamics simulations of certain myosin motors, and that the probability of opening predicts how potently blebbistatin inhibits a particular motor. Our work suggests that differences in cryptic pocket formation can be exploited to develop specific therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "CD59 is an abundant immuno-regulatory receptor that protects human cells from damage during complement activation. Here we show how the receptor binds complement proteins C8 and C9 at the membrane to prevent insertion and polymerization of membrane attack complex (MAC) pores. We present cryoelectron microscopy structures of two inhibited MAC precursors known as C5b8 and C5b9. We discover that in both complexes, CD59 binds the pore-forming {square}-hairpins of C8 to form an intermolecular {square}-sheet that prevents membrane perforation. While bound to C8, CD59 deflects the cascading C9 {square}-hairpins, rerouting their trajectory into the membrane. Preventing insertion of C9 restricts structural transitions of subsequent monomers and indirectly halts MAC polymerization. We combine our structural data with cellular assays and molecular dynamics simulations to explain how the membrane environment impacts the dual roles of CD59 in controlling pore formation of MAC, and as a target of bacterial virulence factors which hijack CD59 to lyse human cells.",

Thus, we profiled EV small RNAs during different infection phases to understand the potential relationship between these EV-associated small RNAs and viral infection.\n\nDesignA well characterized simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of HIV was used to profile EV-enriched blood plasma fractions harvested during pre-infection, acute infection, latent infection/ART treatment, and rebound after ART interruption.\n\nMethodsMeasurement of EV concentration, size distribution, and morphology was complemented with qPCR array for small RNA expression, followed by individual qPCR validations. Iodixanol density gradients were used to separate EV subtypes and virions.\n\nResultsPlasma EV particle counts correlated with viral load and peaked during acute infection. However, SIV gag RNA detection showed that virions did not fully explain this peak. EV microRNAs miR-181a, miR-342-3p, and miR-29a decreased with SIV infection and remained downregulated in latency. Interestingly, small nuclear RNA U6 had a tight association with viral load peak.\n\nConclusionsThis study is the first to monitor how EV concentration and EV small RNA expression change dynamically in acute viral infection, latency, and rebound in a carefully controlled animal model. These changes may also reveal regulatory roles in retroviral infection and latency.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are responsible for cycling carbon (C) through soils, and the predictions of how soil C stocks change with warming are highly sensitive to the assumptions made about the mechanisms controlling the microbial physiology response to climate warming. Two mechanisms, microbial thermal-acclimation and changes in the quantity and quality of substrates available for microbial metabolism have been suggested to explain the long-term warming impact on microbial physiology. Yet studies disentangling these two mechanisms are lacking. To resolve the drivers of changes in microbial physiology in response to long-term warming, we sampled soils from 13- and 28-year old soil warming experiments in different seasons. We performed short-term laboratory incubations across a range of temperatures to measure the relationship between temperature sensitivity of physiology (growth, respiration, carbon use efficiency and extracellular enzyme activity) and the chemical composition of soil organic matter. We observed apparent thermal acclimation in microbial processes important for C cycling, but only when warming had exacerbated the seasonally-induced, already small soil organic matter pools. Irrespective of warming, greater quantity and quality of soil carbon enhanced the extracellular enzymatic pool and its temperature sensitivity. We suggest that fresh litter input into the system seasonally cancels apparent thermal acclimation of C-cycling processes. Our findings reveal that long-term warming has indirectly affected microbial physiology via reduced C availability in this system, implying that earth system models including these negative feedbacks may be best suited to describe long-term warming impact in soils.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria utilize type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) to secrete proteins across their highly hydrophobic and diderm cell envelope. Pathogenic mycobacteria have up to five different T7SSs, called ESX-1 to ESX-5, which are crucial for growth and virulence. Here, we use a functionally reconstituted ESX-5 system in the avirulent species Mycobacterium smegmatis that lacks ESX-5, to define the role of each esx-5 gene in system functionality. By creating an array of gene deletions and assessing protein levels of components and membrane complex assembly, we observed that only the five components of the inner membrane complex are required for its assembly. However, in addition to these five core components, active secretion also depends on both the Esx and PE/PPE substrates. Tagging the PPE substrates followed by subcellular fractionation, surface labeling and membrane extraction showed that these proteins localize to the mycobacterial outer membrane. This indicates that they could play a role in secretion across this enigmatic outer barrier. These results provide a first full overview of the role of each esx-5 gene in T7SS functionality.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory systems that maintain prophage quiescence integrate phage and host gene expression with environmental conditions1,2. In the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pf filamentous bacteriophages play critical roles in biofilm formation and virulence3-5, but mechanisms governing Pf prophage activation in biofilms are largely unknown. Here, we report a new type of prophage regulatory module in a widely-distributed P. aeruginosa lineage that not only controls virion production of co-resident Pf prophages, but also mediates defense against diverse lytic phages. By comparing two lineages of the prototype P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 that harbor different Pf prophages, we identified a prophage-encoded kinase-kinase-phosphatase (KKP) system that controls Pf production in biofilms. KKP components exhibit dynamic stoichiometry, where high kinase levels in planktonic conditions maintain phosphorylation of the host H-NS protein MvaU, repressing prophage activation. During biofilm formation, phosphatase expression is heightened, leading to MvaU dephosphorylation and alleviating repression of prophage gene expression. KKP clusters are present in hundreds of diverse temperate prophages and other mobile elements across Gram-negative bacteria. Characterization of KKP modules from different species revealed that, in addition to regulating Pf phage lysogeny, KKP functions as a tripartite toxin-antitoxin system that mediates host defense from predatory lytic phages. KKP represents a new phosphorylation-based mechanism for prophage regulation and for phage defense. The dual function of this module raises the question of whether other newly described phage defense systems6-9 also regulate intrinsic prophage biology in diverse hosts.",

Although exercise is a well-established inducer of this pathway, little is known about the effects of different types of training protocols on the autophagy levels of tissues that are tightly linked to the obesity pandemic (like brown adipose tissue) but not easily accessible in humans. Here, we take advantage of animal models to assess the effects of short- and long-term resistance and endurance training in both white and brown adipose tissue, reporting distinct alterations in autophagy proteins LC3B and p62. For instance, both short-term endurance and resistance training protocols increased the levels of these proteins in white adipose tissue before this similarity diverges during long training, while autophagy regulation appears to be far more complex in brown adipose tissue. Additionally, we also analyzed the repercussion of these interventions in fat tissues of mice lacking autophagy protease ATG4B, further assessing the impact of exercise in these dynamic, regulatory organs (which are specialized in energy storage) when autophagy is limited. In this regard, only resistance training could slightly increase the presence of lipidated LC3B, while p62 levels increased in white adipose tissue after short-term training but decreased in brown adipose tissue after long-term training. Altogether, our study suggests an intricated regulation of exercise-induced autophagy in adipose tissues that is dependent on the training protocol and the autophagy competence of the organism.",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation yields many mRNA isoforms whose 3 termini occur disproportionately in clusters within 3 UTRs. Previously, we showed that profiles of poly(A) site usage are regulated by the rate of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II (Geisberg et., 2020). Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates confer an upstream-shifted poly(A) profile, whereas fast Pol II strains confer a downstream-shifted poly(A) profile. In yeast, upstream and downstream shifts within isoform clusters occur steadily at the nucleotide level. In contrast, changes from one isoform to the next are much smaller between clusters, even when the distances between them are relatively large. GC content in a region 13-30 nt downstream from isoform clusters is linked to Pol II elongation rate. In human cells, the upstream shift caused by a slow Pol II mutant also occurs continuously at the nucleotide level within clusters, but not between them. Pol II occupancy increases just downstream of the most speed-sensitive poly(A) sites, suggesting a linkage between reduced elongation rate and cluster formation. These observations suggest that 1) Pol II elongation speed affects the nucleotide-level dwell time allowing polyadenylation to occur, 2) poly(A) site clusters are linked to the local elongation rate and hence do not arise simply by intrinsically imprecise cleavage and polyadenylation of the RNA substrate, 3) DNA sequence elements can affect Pol II elongation and poly(A) profiles, and 4) the cleavage/polyadenylation and Pol II elongation complexes are spatially, and perhaps physically, coupled so that polyadenylation occurs rapidly upon emergence of the nascent RNA from the Pol II elongation complex.",

    "abstract": "Delayed skin wound healing and excessive scarring are consequences of an impaired healing process and represent a major health and economic burden worldwide. Current intervention strategies lack efficacy and suffer from high recurrence rates necessitating the investigation into alternative treatment modalities like circular RNAs (circRNAs). By RNA sequencing, we profiled circRNA expression changes during human skin wound healing as well as in keratinocytes and fibroblasts isolated from donor-matched skin and acute wounds. CircGLIS3 was found to be transiently upregulated in the dermal fibroblasts upon skin injury, which was at least partially due to the activated IL-1 signaling. Similarly, overabundant circGLIS3 expression was detected in human keloid lesions compared to the surrounding healthy skin. We found that circGLIS3 resided mainly in the cytoplasm, where it interacted with and stabilized Procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1 (PCPE-1) protein to enhance TGF-{beta} signaling, fibroblast activation, and production of extracellular matrix - important biological processes required for wound repair. Accordingly, knockdown of circGLIS3 in human ex vivo wounds potently reduced wound contraction and delayed re-epithelialization. Collectively, we have identified a previously uncharacterized circRNA regulator of human skin wound healing that may open an avenue for circRNA-based therapeutics for abnormal scarring or nonhealing wounds.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTransient increase of the circular RNA circGLIS3 promotes the wound fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix production to facilitate wound closure.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins are essential regulators of RNA processing and function. Translational repression assays can be used to study how they interact with specific RNA sequences by insertion of such a consensus sequence into the 5 untranslated region of a reporter mRNA and measuring reporter protein translation. The straightforward set-up of these translational repression assays avoids the need for the isolation of the protein or the RNA providing speed, robustness, and a low-cost method. Here we report the optimization of the assay to function with linear RNA sequences instead of the previously reported hairpin type sequences to allow the study of a wider variety of RNA-binding proteins. Multiplication of a consensus sequence strongly improves the signal allowing analysis by both fluorescence intensity measurements and fluorescence activated cell sorting.",

    "abstract": "The loading of copper (Cu) into cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in mitochondria is essential for energy production in cells. Extensive studies have been performed with mitochondrial cuproenzymes, such as Sco1, Sco2 and Cox17, which contributes to the metallation of the oxidase. However, limited information is available on the upstream mechanism of Cu transport and delivery to mitochondria, especially through Cu-impermeable membranes, in mammalian cells. The mitochondrial phosphate transporter SLC25A3, also known as PiC2, is also able to bind Cu+ and acts as an active copper transporter in eukaryotic cells through these membranes, and ultimately aid in the metallation of COX. We used a well-established differentiation model of primary myoblasts derived from mouse satellite cells, where Cu availability is necessary for growth and maturation, and showed PiC2 is a target of MTF1, its expression is induced during myogenesis and favored by Cu supplementation. PiC2 deletion using CRISPR/Cas9 showed that the transporter is required for proliferation and differentiation of primary myoblasts, as both processes are delayed upon PiC2 knock-out. The effects of PiC2 deletion were ameliorated by the addition of Cu to the growth medium, implying the deleterious effects of PiC2 knockout in myoblasts may be in part due to a failure to deliver sufficient Cu to the mitochondria, which can be compensated by other mitochondrial cuproproteins. Co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation of PiC2 and COX also strongly suggest that PiC2 may act to directly load Cu into COX, which was verified by in vitro Cu+-transfer experiments. The data indicate an important role for PiC2 in both the delivery of Cu to the mitochondria, COX and, subsequently, the differentiation of primary myoblasts.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks are [~]24-hour timekeepers that control rhythms in almost all aspects of our behavior and physiology. While it is well known that subcellular localization of core clock proteins plays a critical role in circadian regulation, very little is known about the spatiotemporal organization of core clock mRNAs and its role in generating [~]24-hr circadian rhythms. Here we describe a streamlined single molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) protocol and a fully automated analysis pipeline to precisely quantify the number and subcellular location of mRNAs of Clock, a core circadian transcription factor, in individual clock neurons in whole mount Drosophila adult brains. Specifically, we used [~]48 fluorescent oligonucleotide probes that can bind to an individual Clock mRNA molecule, which can then be detected as a diffraction-limited spot. Further, we developed a machine learning-based approach for 3-D cell segmentation, based on a pretrained encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, to automatically identify the cytoplasm and nuclei of clock neurons. We combined our segmentation model with a spot counting algorithm to detect Clock mRNA spots in individual clock neurons. Our results demonstrate that the number of Clock mRNA molecules cycle in large ventral lateral clock neurons (lLNvs) with peak levels at ZT4 (4 hours after lights are turned on) with ~80 molecules/neuron and trough levels at ZT16 with [~]30 molecules/neuron. Our streamlined smFISH protocol and deep learning-based analysis pipeline can be employed to quantify the number and subcellular location of any mRNA in individual clock neurons in Drosophila brains. Further, this method can open mechanistic and functional studies into how spatiotemporal localization of clock mRNAs affect circadian rhythms.",

    "abstract": "AimsAdvanced age is unequivocally linked to the development of cardiovascular disease, however, the mechanisms leading to loss of endothelial cell regenerative capacity during aging remain poorly understood. Here we aimed to investigate novel mechanisms involved in endothelial cell senescence, that impact on endothelial cell transcription and the vascular repair response upon injury\n\nMethods and resultsRNA sequencing of a unique collection of native endothelial cells from young and aged individuals, showed that aging (20 vs. 80 years) is characterized by p53- mediated reprogramming to promote the expression of senescence-associate genes. Molecular analysis revelead that p53 accumulated and acetylated in the nucleus of aged human endothelial cells to suppress glycolysis. Metabolic flux analysis identified an associated reduction in glucose uptake and ATP availability that inhibited the assembly of the telomerase complex, which was essential for proliferation. Nuclear translocation of p53 in aged endothelial cells was attributed to the loss of the vasoprotective enzyme, cystathionine {gamma}-lyase (CSE), which physically anchored p53 in the cytosol. In mice, loss of endothelial cell CSE activated p53 and arrested vascular repair upon injury, while the AAV9 mediated re-expression of an active CSE mutant retained p53 in the cytosol, maintained endothelial glucose metabolism and proliferation, and prevented endothelial cell senescence. Adenoviral overexpression of CSE in human native aged endothelial cells maintained low p53 activity and re-activated telomerase to revert endothelial cell senescence.\n\nConclusionOur data identified the interaction between CSE and p53 as a promising target to preserve vascular regeneration during aging.\n\nKey QuestionTo identify the mechanisms that regulate endothelial cell senescence under native conditions and their impact on vascular repair in aging.\n\nKey FindingLack of a physical interaction between CSE and p53 metabolically reprogrammes endothelial cells to reduce telomerase activity and halt endothelial cell regeneration.\n\nTake home messageInterventions to increase CSE expression represent a novel therapy against p53-induced endothelial cell cycle arrest and senescense\n\nTranslational perspectiveEndothelial rejuvenation strategies could serve as promising therapies against age-related cardiovascular diseases. By investigating human native endothelial cells from young and aged individuals, we identified that the age-related nuclear accumulation of p53 reprograms endothelial cell metabolism, regulates telomerase activity and inhibits endothelial cell regeneration. Nuclear localization of p53 resulted from a loss of its interaction with the cysteine catabolizing enzyme cystathionine {gamma}-lyase in the cytoplasm. Enhancing the physical interaction of p53 with CSE by gene therapy could revert endothelial cell senescence and activate endothelial reparative responses.",

Here we show that transient (4 hours) activation of overexpressed AHL15-GR in Arabidopsis seedlings has long-term effects on plant development. RNA sequencing analysis detected an extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome 4 hours after AHL15-GR activation, with respectively 540 and 1107 genes showing more than 2-fold up- and down-regulation. AHL15 seemed to act in a transcription leveldependent manner, activating predominantly low expressed genes and repressing mostly highly expressed genes. Rapid decondensation of heterochromatin was observed after AHL15 activation in leaf primordia and axillary meristems, indicating that the global reprogramming of the transcriptome by transient activation of this AT-Hook domain protein might be caused by extensive modulation of the chromatin configuration. We also found that co-activated or co-repressed genes were often physically linked in small chromosomal clusters, which is in line with regulation at the chromatin level.",

    "abstract": "Imbalance between the growth rate of different organs can amplify to large deviations of their size proportions during development. We show that, for the C. elegans pharynx, such size divergence is prevented by reciprocal coordination of pharyngeal growth with other tissues. Live imaging of hundreds of individuals revealed that small pharynxes grow more rapidly than large pharynxes, catching up in volume during development. Moreover, pharynx-to-body size proportions were robust to even strong tissue-specific inhibition of mTORC1 and insulin signalling. Tissue-specific depletion of these pathways slowed-down the growth of the respective tissue and additionally triggered a systemic growth response that ensured appropriate organ size proportions. By mathematical modelling, we show that the conservation of proportions requires a bi-directional ultra-sensitive coupling of body growth and pharynx size that cannot be explained by a reduction of food uptake alone. Instead, organ growth coordination requires regulation by the mechano-transducing transcriptional co-activator YAP/yap-1. Knock-down of yap-1 makes animals sensitive to tissue-specific inhibition mTORC1 inhibition, causing a disproportionate pharynx and developmental arrest. Our data suggests that mechano-transduction tightly coordinates organ growth during C. elegans development to ensure the uniformity of body plan proportions among individuals.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by gene editing tools are primarily resolved either by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) using exogenous synthetic DNA templates. Repaired by error-prone NHEJ may lead to unexpected indels at the targeted site. In the case of most genetic disorders, HDR-mediated precise correction using an exogenous homologous sequence is ideal. However, the therapeutic application of HDR might be especially challenging given the requirement for the codelivery of exogenous DNA templates with toxicity into cells, and the low efficiency of HDR could also limit its clinical application. Here, we used hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with genetic mutations to cause {beta}-thalassemia in HBB coding regions and discovered that many cells are actually repaired by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene conversion (GC) independent of exogenous synthetic DNA templates. We show that pathogenic mutations in the HBB coding regions of HSCs can be repaired efficiently through CRISPR/GC using the paralog gene HBD as the internal template. Electroporations of Cas9 for ribonucleoprotein with sgRNA into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with a variety of pathogenic gene mutations also resulted in effective conversion of mutations to normal wild-type sequences without exogenous DNA template. Moreover, the edited HSCs can repopulate the haematopoietic system and generate erythroid cells with a greatly reduced propensity for thalassemia after transplantations. Thus, CRISPR/GC, independent of exogenous DNA templates, holds great promise for gene therapy of genetic diseases.",

Moreover, the conversion of this chemoenzymatic engineering could be finished in minutes, or up to hours, affording homogeneous products. The trisaccharide linker of these antibody conjugates exhibits excellent hydrophilicity and stability and reduced ADCC activity.

    "abstract": "Fibrinogen is a soluble, multi-subunit and multi-domain dimeric protein, which, upon its proteolytic cleavage by thrombin, is converted to insoluble fibrin initiating polymerization that substantially contributes to clot growth. The consentaneous structural view of the soluble form of fibrinogen is relatively straight and rigid-like. However, fibrinogen contains numerous, transiently-accessible \"cryptic\" epitopes for hemostatic and immunologic proteins, suggesting that fibrinogen exhibits conformational flexibility, which may play functional roles in its temporal and spatial interactions. Hitherto, there has been limited information on the solution structure and internal flexibility of soluble fibrinogen. Here, utilizing an integrative, biophysical approach involving temperature-dependent hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, small angle X-ray scattering, and negative stain electron microscopy, we present a holistic, conformationally dynamic model of human fibrinogen in solution. Our data reveal a high degree of internal flexibility, accommodated by four major and distinct flexible sites along the central axis of the protein. We propose that the fibrinogen structure in solution consists of a complex, conformational landscape with multiple local minima, rather than a single, rigid topology. This is further supported by the location of numerous point mutations that are linked to dysfibrinogenemia, and post-translational modifications, residing near fibrinogen flexions. This work provides a molecular basis for the structural \"dynamism\" of fibrinogen that is expected to influence the broad swath of functionally diverse macromolecular interactions and fine-tune the structural and mechanical properties of blood clots.",

It also serves as a hub for cardiac hypertrophic signaling by interacting with multiple proteins such as FHL1(Sheikh et al, 2008), FHL2(Lange et al, 2002), and Erk2(Perkin et al, 2015). N2B-us is thought to be an intrinsically disordered region. In addition, N2B-us bears force; therefore, the functions of N2B-us are likely regulated by mechanical stretching. In the work, we investigated the conformation of N2B-us as well as its force-dependent interaction with FHL2 using a combination of AlphaFold2 predictions and single-molecule experimental validation. Surprisingly, a stable alpha/beta structural domain (~115 a.a.) was predicted and confirmed in N2B-us, which can be mechanically unfolded at forces greater than 5 pN. More than twenty FHL2 LIM domain binding sites were predicted to spread throughout N2B-us including the regions cryptic in the structural domain. Mechanosensitive binding of FHL2 to N2B-us is revealed in single-molecule manipulation experiments. Together, the results unveil several previously unknown aspects of the N2B-us conformations and its force-dependent interactions with FHL2, which provides new insights into the physiological functions of the force-bearing N2B-us region.",

Here, continuous tens of microsecond-long molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations reveal that an -helical lid, located within the RuvC domain, plays a pivotal role in the traversal of the TS by anchoring the crRNA:TS hybrid and elegantly guiding the TS toward the RuvC core, as also corroborated by DNA cleavage experiments. In this mechanism, the REC2 domain pushes the crRNA:TS hybrid toward the core of the enzyme, while the Nuc domain aids the bending and accommodation of the TS within the RuvC core by bending inward. Understanding of this cardinal process in the functioning of Cas12a will enrich fundamental knowledge and facilitate further engineering strategies for genome-editing.",

Optical modulation of bacterial membrane potential could fill this gap and provide a new approach to studying and controlling bacterial physiology and electrical signalling. Here, we show that a membrane-targeted azobenzene (Ziapin2) can be used to photo-modulate the membrane potential in cells of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We found that upon exposure to blue-green light ({lambda} = 470 nm), isomerization of Ziapin2 in the bacteria membrane induces hyperpolarisation of the potential. In order to investigate the origin of this phenomenon we examined ion-channel-deletion strains and ion channel blockers. We found that in presence of the chloride channel blocker idanyloxyacetic acid-94 (IAA-94) or in absence of KtrAB potassium transporter, the hyperpolarisation response is attenuated. These results reveal that the Ziapin2 isomerization can induce ion channel opening in the bacterial membrane, and suggest that Ziapin2 can be used for studying and controlling bacterial electrical signalling. This new optical tool can contribute to better understand microbial phenomena, such as biofilm electric signalling and antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "SCARB1 belongs to class B of Scavenger receptors (SRs) that are known to be involved in binding and endocytosis of various pathogens. SRs have emerging role in regulating innate immunity and host-pathogen interactions by acting in co-ordination with Toll-like receptors. Little is known about the function of SCARB1 in milk-derived mammary epithelial cells (MECs). This study reports the role of SCARB1 in infection and its potential association in TLR4 signaling on bacterial challenge in Goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). The novelty in the establishment of MEC culture lies in the method that aims to enhance the viability of the cells with intact characteristics upto a higher passage number. We represent MEC culture to be used as a potential infection model for deeper understanding of animal physiology especially around the mammary gland. On E.coli challenge the expression of SCARB1 was significant in induced GMECs at 6 h. Endoribonuclease-esiRNA based silencing of SCARB1 affects the expression of TLR4 and its pathways i.e. MyD88 and TRIF pathways on infection. Knockdown also affected the endocytosis of E.coli in GMECs demonstrating that E.coli uses SCARB1 function to gain entry in cells. Furthermore, we predict 3 unique protein structures of uncharacterized SCARB1 (Capra hircus) protein. Overall, we highlight SCARB1 as a main participant in host defence and its function in antibacterial advances to check mammary gland infections.",

    "abstract": "The development of highly effective malaria vaccines and improving drug treatment protocols to boost anti-parasitic immunity is critical for malaria elimination. However, these efforts are hampered by parasite-specific immunoregulatory networks that are rapidly established following exposure to malaria parasites. Here, we identify stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as a critical mediator of type I interferon production by CD4+ T cells during blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum infection. STING activation by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) stimulated IFNB gene transcription that promoted development of IL-10 and IFN{gamma} co-producing CD4+ T (type I regulatory; Tr1) cells. CD4+ T cell sensitivity to STING phosphorylation increased in healthy volunteers following P. falciparum infection, particularly in Tr1 cells. Finally, we found the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib modulated this innate signalling axis in CD4+ T cells to increase parasite-specific Th1 and diminish Tr1 cell responses. These findings identify STING as a critical mediator of Tr1 cell development during malaria.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis liver fibrosis is characterized by the foci of a classical type 2 granulomatous inflammation in response to egg soluble antigen. The inducible costimulator (ICOS)/ICOSL signaling can mediate Th2 polarization and regulate the disease process of chronic schistosomiasis by adaptive immune response. ICOS/ICOSL signaling could regulate innate immune cells, including B cells and macrophage (M{varphi}), and participate in pulmonary fibrosis. The purpose of the study was to identify whether ICOS/ICOSL signaling could regulate the polarization of M{varphi}, and to explore the potential role of IL-33 in ICOSL knockout (ICOSL-KO) mice with schistosomiasis. Firstly, the expression level of CD86, CD206 and IL-33 was checked respectively in ICOSL-KO and WT mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum). Then recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) was injected into ICOSL-KO mice infected with S. japonicum. Our experiments showed that the liver M{varphi} was successfully polarized toward to classical activated M{varphi} (M1) and the expression of IL-33 was inhibited in ICOSL-KO mice. Furthermore, the injection of rIL-33 successfully aggravated liver fibrosis in ICOSL-KO mice, increased the numbers of lymphocyte antigen 6C (Ly6C)hi, enhanced the expression of C-C chemokine ligand (CCL)2,, CCL5 and C-X-C motif chemokine 2 (CXCL2), and promoted polarization of T helper (Th) cells to Th2 cells, as well as induced the autophagy and apoptosis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Overall, the liver fibrosis was alleviated in ICOSL-KO mice along with the reduced expression of IL-33, which could skew the polarization of M{varphi} toward to M1, induce Th cells activation, HSCs apoptosis and autophagy through Smad2/3 and TGF-{beta} signaling pathway, thus participated in the homeostasis of liver fibrosis of schistosomiasis.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian oocytes develop and mature in a mutually dependent relationship with surrounding cumulus cells. The oocyte actively regulates cumulus cell differentiation and function by secreting soluble paracrine oocyte-secreted factors (OSFs). We characterized the molecular mechanisms by which two model OSFs, cumulin and BMP15, regulate oocyte maturation and cumulus-oocyte cooperativity. Exposure to these OSFs during maturation altered the proteomic and multispectral autofluorescence profiles of both the oocyte and cumulus cells. In oocytes, cumulin significantly upregulated proteins involved in nuclear function. In cumulus cells, both OSFs elicited marked upregulation of a variety of metabolic processes (mostly anabolic), including lipid, nucleotide, and carbohydrate metabolism, while mitochondrial metabolic processes were downregulated. The mitochondrial changes were validated by functional assays confirming altered mitochondrial morphology, respiration, and content, whilst maintaining ATP homeostasis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that OSFs remodel cumulus cell metabolism during oocyte maturation in preparation for ensuing fertilization and embryonic development.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIDuring oocyte maturation, oocyte-secreted factors promote cell cooperativity between the oocyte and cumulus cells by altering the molecular composition of both cell types.\nC_LIO_LIOocyte-secreted factors downregulate protein catabolic processes, and upregulate DNA binding, translation, and ribosome assembly in oocytes.\nC_LIO_LIOocyte-secreted factors alter mitochondrial number, morphology, and function in cumulus cells.\nC_LIO_LIOocyte-secreted factors further enhance metabolic plasticity in cumulus cells by upregulating anabolic pathways for macromolecules and small molecule organics.\nC_LIO_LIThe oocyte, via oocyte-secreted factors, instructs cumulus cells to increase metabolic workload on its behalf, thereby subduing oocyte metabolism.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) encode at least three different enzymes for a common biosynthetic pathway. Comparative genome analyses highlighted the role of duplications, deletions and rearrangements in MGC formation. We hypothesized that these mechanisms also contribute to MGC intraspecies diversity and play a role in adaptation. We assessed copy number variations (CNVs) of four Arabidopsis thaliana MGCs in a population of 1,152 accessions, with experimental and bioinformatic approaches. The MGC diversity was lowest in marneral gene cluster (one private deletion CNV) and highest in the arabidiol/baruol gene cluster where 811 accessions had gene gains or losses, however, there were no presence/absence variations of the entire clusters. We found that the compact version of thalianol gene cluster was predominant in A. thaliana and more conserved than the noncontiguogus version. In arabidiol/baruol cluster we found a large insertion in 35% of analyzed accessions, that contained duplications of the reference genes CYP705A2 and BARS1. The BARS1 paralog, which we named BARS2, encoded a novel oxidosqualene synthase. Unexpectedly, in accessions with the insertion, the arabidiol/baruol gene cluster was expressed not only in roots but also in leaves. Additionally, they presented different root growth dynamics and were associated with warmer climates compared to the reference-like accessions. We also found that paired genes encoding terpene synthases and cytochrome P450 oxidases had higher copy number variability compared to non-paired ones. Our study highlights the importance of intraspecies variation and nonreference genomes for dissecting secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways and understanding their role in adaptation and evolution.",
