    "abstract": "Detection of germline variants in next-generation sequencing data is an essential component of modern genomics analysis. Variant detection tools typically rely on statistical algorithms such as de Bruijn graphs, Hidden Markov Models and regression models, often coupled with heuristic techniques and thresholds to identify variants. Here we describe a new approach that replaces these handcrafted statistical methods with a single, end-to-end deep learning model that directly infers germline haplotypes from short read pileups. Our model, called Jovian, frames variant detection as a sequence-tosequence modeling task, akin to language translation, and employs a transformer-based architecture to translate alignment columns into two predicted haplotype sequences. After training with 17 whole genome sequences from Genome-in-a-Bottle cell lines, we demonstrate that this method learns to realign complex and ambiguous read mappings to produce accurate haplotype predictions, predicts variant genotypes and phase accurately, and leverages the local read context to inform predictions about a given position. We also demonstrate that a 2-dimensional positional encoding significantly improved precision of the detected variants. Compared to other callers, sensitivity and precision is higher than GATK HaplotypeCaller, but lower than DeepVariant and Strelka2.",

    "abstract": "Neutralization assays are important in understanding and quantifying neutralizing antibody responses towards SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 Lentivirus Surrogate Neutralization Assay (SCLSNA) can be used in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories and has been shown to be a reliable, alternative approach to the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In this study, we optimized and validated the SCLSNA to assess its ability as a comparator and pre-screening method to support the PRNT. Comparability between the PRNT and SCLSNA was determined through clinical sensitivity and specificity evaluations. Clinical sensitivity and specificity produced acceptable results with 100% (95% CI: 94-100) specificity and 100% (95% CI: 94-100) sensitivity against ancestral Wuhan spike pseudotyped lentivirus. The sensitivity and specificity against B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped lentivirus resulted in 88.3% (95% CI: 77.8 to 94.2) and 100% (95% CI: 94-100), respectively. Assay precision measuring intra-assay variability produced acceptable results for High (1:[&ge;] 640 PRNT50), Mid (1:160 PRNT50) and Low (1:40 PRNT50) antibody titer concentration ranges based on the PRNT50, with %CV of 14.21, 12.47, and 13.28 respectively. Intermediate precision indicated acceptable ranges for the High and Mid concentrations, with %CV of 15.52 and 16.09, respectively. However, the Low concentration did not meet the acceptance criteria with a %CV of 26.42. Acceptable ranges were found in the robustness evaluation for both intra-assay and inter-assay variability. In summary, the validation parameters tested met the acceptance criteria, making the SCLSNA method fit for its intended purpose, which can be used to support the PRNT.",

These broadly neutralizing MAbs (BNMAbs) may be used as therapeutics and/or to assist in the rational design of vaccines that induce BNMAbs. 1249A8 is a BNMAb that targets the stem helix (SH) region of CoV spike (S) protein and neutralizes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) original strain, delta, and omicron VoC, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). To understand its mechanism of action, the crystal structure of 1249A8 bound to a MERS-CoV SH peptide was determined at 2.1[A] resolution. BNMAb 1249A8 mimics the SARS-CoV-2 S loop residues 743-749, which interact with the C-terminal end of the SH helix in the S postfusion conformation. The crystal structure shows that BNMAb 1249A8 disrupts SH secondary structure and packing rearrangements required for CoV S to adopt its prefusion conformation that mediates membrane fusion and ultimately infection. The mechanisms regulating BNMAb 1249A8 CoV S specificity are also defined. This study provides novel insights into the neutralization mechanisms of SH-targeting CoV BNMAbs that may inform vaccine development and the design of optimal BNMAb therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 viruses engage ACE2 as a functional receptor with their spike protein. The S1 domain of the spike protein contains a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) and an N-terminal domain (NTD). The NTD of other coronaviruses includes a glycan-binding cleft. However, for the SARS-CoV-2 NTD protein-glycan binding was only observed weakly for sialic acids with highly sensitive methods. Amino acid changes in the NTD of Variants of Concern (VoC) shows antigenic pressure, which can be an indication of NTD-mediated receptor binding. Trimeric NTD proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron did not reveal a receptor binding capability. Unexpectedly, the SARS-CoV-2 Beta subvariant strain (501Y.V2-1) NTD binding to Vero E6 cells was sensitive to sialidase pretreatment. Glycan microarray analyses identified a putative 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as a ligand, which was confirmed by catch-and-release ESI-MS, STD-NMR analyses, and a graphene-based electrochemical sensor. The Beta (501Y.V2-1) variant attained an enhanced glycan binding modality in the NTD with specificity towards 9-O-acetylated structures, suggesting a dual-receptor functionality of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain, which was quickly selected against. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can probe additional evolutionary space, allowing binding to glycan receptors on the surface of target cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=76 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/507904v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f98a70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1efc119org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e8bc6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a74e6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SynopsisCoronaviruses utilize their N-terminal domain (NTD) for initial reversible low-affinity interaction to (sialylated) glycans. This initial low-affinity/high-avidity engagement enables viral surfing on the target membrane, potentially followed by a stronger secondary receptor interaction. Several coronaviruses, such as HKU1 and OC43, possess a hemagglutinin-esterase for viral release after sialic acid interaction, thus allowing viral dissemination. Other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, do not possess a hemagglutinin-esterase, but interact reversibly to sialic acids allowing for viral surfing and dissemination. The early 501Y.V2-1 subvariant of the Beta SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern has attained a receptor-binding functionality towards 9-O-acetylated sialic acid using its NTD. This binding functionality was selected against rapidly, most likely due to poor dissemination. Ablation of sialic acid binding in more recent SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern suggests a fine balance of sialic acid interaction of SARS-CoV-2 is required for infection and/or transmission.",

    "abstract": "The use of next-generation sequencing technology has enabled phylogenetic studies with hundreds of thousands of taxa. Such large-scale phylogenies have become a critical component in genomic epidemiology in pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. However, detailed phenotypic characterization of pathogens or generating a computationally tractable dataset for detailed phylogenetic analyses requires bias free subsampling of taxa. To address this need, we propose parnas, an objective and flexible algorithm to sample and select taxa that best represent observed diversity by solving a generalized k-medoids problem on a phylogenetic tree. parnas solves this problem efficiently and exactly by novel optimizations and adapting algorithms from operations research. For more nuanced selections, taxa can be weighted with metadata or genetic sequence parameters, and the pool of potential representatives can be user-constrained. Motivated by influenza A virus genomic surveillance and vaccine design, parnas can be applied to identify representative taxa that optimally cover the diversity in a phylogeny within a specified distance radius. We demonstrated that parnas is more efficient and flexible than current approaches, and applied it to select representative influenza A virus in swine genes derived from over 5 years of genomic surveillance data. Our objective selection of 4 to 6 strains selected every two years from the 16 distinct genetic clades were sufficient to cover 80% of diversity circulating in US swine. We suggest that this method, through the objective selection of representatives in a phylogeny, provides criteria for rational multivalent vaccine design and for quantifying diversity.

    "abstract": "Mutation, recombination, and transposition occurring during meiosis provide the variation on which natural selection can act and the rates at which they occur are important parameters in models of evolution. The de novo mutation rate determines levels of genetic diversity, responses to ongoing selection, and levels of genetic load. Recombination breaks up haplotypes and reduces the effects of linkage, helping to spread beneficial alleles and purge deleterious ones. Transposable elements (TE) selfishly replicate themselves through the genome, imposing fitness costs on the host and introducing complex mutations that can affect gene expression and give rise to new genes. However, even for key evolutionary models such as Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans few estimates of these parameters are available, and we have little idea of how rates vary between individuals, sexes, populations, or species. Here, we provide direct estimates of mutation, recombination, and transposition rates and their variation in a West African and a European population of D. melanogaster and a European population of D. simulans. Across 89 flies, we observe 58 single nucleotide mutations, 286 crossovers, and 89 TE insertions. Compared to the European D. melanogaster, we find the West African population has a lower mutation rate (1.67 vs. 4.86 x 10-9 site-1 gen-1) and transposition rate (8.99 vs. 23.36 x 10-5 copy-1 gen-1), but a higher recombination rate (3.44 vs. 2.06 cM/Mb). The European D. simulans population has a similar mutation rate to European D. melanogaster but a significantly higher recombination rate and a lower but not significantly different transposition rate. Overall, we find paternal-derived mutations are more frequent than maternal ones in both species.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDe novo mutation rates are 1.67 x 10-9 site-1 gen-1 (95% HPD CI: 0.54 - 3.14 x 10-9), 4.86 x 10-9 site-1 gen-1 (2.11 - 8.02 x 10-9), and 4.51 x 10-9 site-1 gen-1 (1.94 - 7.75 x 10-9) for the West African D. melanogaster, the European D. melanogaster and the European D. simulans population, respectively.\nC_LIO_LIIn females, recombination rates in the absence of large genomic inversions are 3.44 cM/Mb (2.72 - 4.18), 2.06 cM/Mb (1.57 - 2.57), and 3.04 cM/Mb (2.45 - 3.73) for the three populations, respectively.

Subunit protein vaccines are manufactured at large scales at low costs, have less stringent temperature requirements for distribution in LMICs, and several candidates have shown protection against SARS-CoV-2. We previously reported an engineered variant of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain antigen (RBD-L452K-F490W; RBD-J) with enhanced manufacturability and immunogenicity compared to the ancestral RBD. Here, we report a second-generation engineered RBD antigen (RBD-J6) with two additional mutations to a hydrophobic cryptic epitope in the RBD core, S383D and L518D, that further improved expression titers and biophysical stability. RBD-J6 retained binding affinity to human convalescent sera and to all tested neutralizing antibodies except antibodies that target the class IV epitope on the RBD core. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice immunized with three doses of a Beta variant of RBD-J6 displayed on a virus-like particle (VLP) generated neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to nine SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern at similar levels as two doses of Comirnaty. The vaccinated mice were also protected from challenge with Alpha or Beta SARS-CoV-2. This engineered antigen could be useful for modular RBD-based subunit vaccines to enhance manufacturability and global access, or for further development of variant-specific or broadly acting booster vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has diversified into a large number of lineages and globally caused multiple waves of infection. Lineages have the potential to spread rapidly and internationally if they have higher intrinsic transmissibility and/or can evade host immune responses, as has been seen with the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern (VoCs). Phylogenetic methods provide the gold standard for representing the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify newly emerging lineages. However, these methods are computationally expensive, struggle when datasets get too large, and require manual curation to designate new lineages. These issues will only intensify as the vast number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes already available continues to grow. It will therefore be beneficial to develop complementary methods that can incorporate all of the genetic data available, without down sampling, to extract meaningful information rapidly and with minimal curation. Here, we demonstrate the utility of using algorithmic approaches based on word-statistics to represent whole sequences, bringing speed, scalability, and interpretability to the construction of genetic topologies, and that can be used to augment traditional classification practice based on phylogeny.",

However, editing normally requires efficient recombination and high transformation efficiencies, which are unavailable in most strains. Here, we show that systematically attenuating DNA targeting activity enables RecA-mediated repair in different bacteria, allowing chromosomal cleavage to drive genome editing. Attenuation can be achieved by altering the format or expression strength of guide (g)RNAs; using nucleases with reduced cleavage activity; or engineering attenuated gRNAs (atgRNAs) with disruptive hairpins, perturbed nuclease scaffolds, non-canonical PAMs, or guide mismatches. These modifications greatly increase cell counts and even improve the efficiency of different types of edits for Cas9 and Cas12a in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. We further applied atgRNAs to restore ampicillin sensitivity in Klebsiella pneumoniae, establishing a new resistance marker for genetic studies. Attenuating DNA targeting thus offers a counterintuitive means to achieve CRISPR-driven editing across bacteria.",

Transmitted by ticks and maintained primarily in rodents and birds, the Lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) is an ideal model to investigate the mechanisms of host tropism. In order to survive in hosts and escape complement-mediated clearance, a first-line host immune defense, Bb produces the outer surface protein CspZ that binds to the complement inhibitor factor H (FH) to facilitate bacterial dissemination in vertebrates. Despite high sequence conservation, CspZ variants vary in human FH-binding ability. Together with the FH polymorphisms found amongst vertebrate hosts, these findings raise a hypothesis that minor sequence variation in a bacterial outer surface protein confers dramatic differences in host- specific, FH-binding-mediated infectivity. We tested this hypothesis by determining the crystal structure of the CspZ-human FH complex, identifying a minor change localized in the FH-binding interface, and uncovered that the bird and rodent FH-specific binding activity of different CspZ variants directly impacts infectivity. Swapping the divergent loop region in the FH-binding interface between rodent- and bird-associated CspZ variants alters the ability to promote rodent- and bird-specific early-onset dissemination. By employing phylogenetic tree thinking, we correlated these loops and respective host-specific, complement-dependent phenotypes with distinct CspZ lineages and elucidated evolutionary mechanisms driving CspZ emergence. Our multidisciplinary work provides mechanistic insights into how a single, short pathogen protein motif could greatly impact host tropism.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLyme disease presents a suitable model for the investigation of host tropism - a pathogens ability to colonize and survive in different host species - since its causative agent, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) is transmitted by ticks and maintained in rodent and bird reservoir hosts.

Protein sequence conservation seems to be linked to FH-binding activity divergence, raising the hypothesis that even minor variation can confer host-specific, FH- binding-mediated infectivity. Our work shows that that this minor variation is located in a loop in the CspZ protein localized in the CspZ-FH binding interface. Our functional experiments prove that this loop promotes bird- or rodent-specific FH-binding activity and infectivity. Swapping loops between rodent- and bird-associated CspZ variants alters their capability to confer host- specific dissemination. We further investigated the evolutionary mechanisms driving the emergence of the CspZ loop-mediated, host-dependent complement evasion. This multifaceted work demonstrates how a single, short protein motif can significantly impact host tropism.",

    "abstract": "In Bangladesh, fish provide over 60% of animal-source food with 56.2% of this coming from aquaculture produced predominantly in rural freshwater ponds. Increasing demand for fish products is driving intensification and resulting in higher disease prevalence, posing a risk to food security. Biosecurity is often absent in rural aquaculture practices in Bangladesh and antibiotics are commonly used to treat and prevent disease outbreaks. Antibiotics are often administered incorrectly - a key factor associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR can be disseminated rapidly within microbial ecosystems via mobile genetic elements, posing a risk for humans and animals infected with AMR pathogens as treatments with antibiotics become ineffective. Early AMR detection and understanding of the spread of antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) in rural aquaculture practices is critical for both food security and human health protection. Here, we apply a metagenomic approach to assess the ARG composition in pond water from six finfish (tilapia and pangasius) farms in the Mymensingh division of North-central Bangladesh. We found microbial communities within the ponds had similar alpha and beta diversities, with multiple ARGs predicted to confer resistance to eighteen different classes of antimicrobials. The most common ARGs conferred resistance to aminoglycosides and sulphonamides and were present in taxa associated with both fish and human pathogens. This ARG diversity potentially confers resistance to a wide variety of antibiotic classes and questions the effectiveness of current and future treatment of diseases with antibiotics in earthen aquaculture ponds. The microbial and ARG compositions between fish ponds within each farm were similar, which may relate to parallels in farming practices creating similar microbial selection pressures and thus comparable microbial populations. Without a more controlled approach towards antibiotic usage, will inevitably further exacerbate the challenges in treating and preventing disease outbreaks as aquaculture production intensifies in Bangladesh.\n\nHighlightsO_LIARGs in Bangladesh rural fishponds indicate resistance to 18 different antibiotics\nC_LIO_LIThe most common AMR were to aminoglycosides and sulphonamides\nC_LIO_LIARGs were present in plasmids and taxa-associated pathogens\nC_LIO_LIFarming practices strongly influence microbial and ARG compositions\nC_LIO_LIIdentified ARGs question antibiotic treatment of disease in rural aquaculture\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic protists of the genus Leishmania have evolved various strategies to exploit macrophages as host cells and subvert their immuno-metabolic functions to favour intracellular parasite survival. Surprisingly little is known on how Leishmania affects regulated cell death (RCD) pathways of its host cell, even though increased survival of in vitro infected macrophages has been reported, and chronic macrophage infection in vivo causes the devastating immunopathologies of leishmaniasis. To overcome this limitation and gain first systems-level insight into the interaction between intracellular Leishmania and the host cell RCD pathways, including apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis, we applied transcriptomic analyses on L. amazonensis-infected, primary macrophages (termed LIMs) and used YO-PRO-1 to monitor cell death by fluorescent microscopy. RNAseq analyses at day 3 post-infection (PI) revealed dichotomic dysregulation of more than 60% of RCD-related genes in LIMs, characterized by up-regulation of anti-RCD and down-regulation of pro-RCD markers, including key regulators common to the three forms of cell death such as casp8, fadd, tradd, tnfaip3, tax1bp1, birc3, and itch. This profile correlated with expression changes of transcription factors known to regulate RCD, including AP1 and NF-{kappa}B family members, ppar{gamma} and cebp{beta}. Consequently, LIMs showed remarkable longevity in culture for at least 50 days, despite a constant increase of parasite burden to about 100 parasites per cell, while non-infected cells were cleared from the culture in just a few days. Longitudinal expression analysis of LIMs at days 0, 3, 15, and 30 PI by RT-qPCR confirmed stable maintenance of this high longevity profile with the dichotomic decrease and increase of RCD-activators and -inhibitors, respectively. LIMs further showed significant resistance to RCD-inducing signals compared to non-infected cells, including CSF-1 deprivation (intrinsic apoptosis), actinomycin D treatment (extrinsic apoptosis), LPS/ATP stimulation (pyroptosis). Significantly, we extended the anti-RCD expression pattern and RCD resistance phenotype to L. amazonensis-infected macrophages recovered from lesions, thus validating our long-term in vitro infection system as an easily accessible model to study chronic macrophage infection. In conclusion, our analyses firmly document the pan-anti RCD effect of L. amazonensis on its macrophage host cell in vitro and in vivo and shed important new light on mechanisms underlying Leishmania chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "Removal of RNA/DNA hybrids for the maturation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, or due to misincorporation of ribonucleotides by DNA polymerases, is essential for all types of cells. In prokaryotic cells such as Escherichia coli, DNA polymerase 1 and RNase HI are supposed to remove RNA from Okazaki fragments, but many bacteria lack HI-type RNases, such as Bacillus subtilis. Here, four proteins have been shown to be able to remove RNA from RNA/DNA hybrids in vitro, but their actual contribution to DNA replication is unclear. We have studied the dynamics of DNA polymerase A (similar to Pol 1), 5->3 exonuclease ExoR, and the two endoribonucleases RNase HII and HIII in B. subtilis using single molecule tracking. We found that all four enzymes show a localization pattern similar to that of replicative DNA helicase. By scoring the distance of tracks to replication forks, we found that all four enzymes are enriched at DNA replication centers. After inducing UV damage, RNase HIII was even more strongly recruited to the replication forks, and PolA showed a more static behavior, indicative of longer binding events, whereas RNase HII and ExoR showed no response. Inhibition of replication by HPUra clearly demonstrated that both RNase HII and RNase HIII are directly involved in replication, with RNase HIII playing a major role. We found that the absence of ExoR increases the likelihood of RNase HIII at the forks, indicating that substrate availability rather than direct protein interactions may be a major driver for the recruitment of RNases to the lagging strands. Thus, B. subtilis replication forks appear to be an intermediate between E. coli type and eukaryotic replication forks and employ a multitude of RNases, rather than any dedicated enzyme for RNA/DNA hybrid removal.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes represent the most important pathogen vectors and are responsible for the spread of a wide variety of poorly treatable diseases. Wolbachia are obligate intracellular bacteria that are widely distributed among arthropods and collectively represents one of the most promising solutions for vector control. In particular, Wolbachia has been shown to limit the transmission of pathogens, and to dramatically affect the reproductive behavior of their host through its phage WO. While much research has focused on deciphering and exploring the biocontrol applications of these WO-related phenotypes, the extent and potential impact of the Wolbachia mobilome remain poorly appreciated. Notably, several Wolbachia plasmids, carrying WO-like genes and Insertion Sequences (IS), thus possibly interrelated to other genetic units of the endosymbiont, have been recently discovered. Here we investigated the diversity and biogeography of the first described plasmid of Wolbachia in Culex pipiens (pWCP) in several islands and continental countries around the world--including Cambodia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Thailand, and Mexico--together with mosquito strains from colonies that evolved for 2 to 30 years in the laboratory. Together with earlier observation, our results show that pWCP is omnipresent and strikingly conserved among Wolbachia populations within mosquitoes from distant geographies and environmental conditions. These data suggest a critical role for the plasmid in Wolbachia ecology and evolution, and the potential of a great tool for the further genetic dissection or potential manipulation of the endosymbiont.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria exist and interact within polymicrobial communities. These interactions produce unique compounds, increased virulence and augmented antibiotic resistance. One community associated with negative healthcare outcomes consists of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. When co-cultured, virulence factors secreted by P. aeruginosa reduce metabolism and growth in S. aureus. When grown in vitro this allows P. aeruginosa to drive S. aureus towards extinction. However, when found in vivo, both species can co-exist. Previous work has noted that this may due to altered gene expression or mutations. However, little is known about how the growth environment could influence co-existence of both species. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation, we show that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine final population composition. We found that changing the carbon source in growth medium affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric we call absolute growth. We found that as a growth environment increases absolute growth for one species, that species will dominate the co-culture. This is due to interactions between growth, metabolism and metabolism altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. Finally, we show that the relationship between absolute growth and final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. Our results demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage-bacteria interactions are affected by phage satellites, elements that exploit phages for transfer between bacterial cells. Satellites can encode defense systems, antibiotic resistance genes, and virulence factors, but their number and diversity are unknown for lack of a tool to identify them. We developed a flexible and updateable program to identify satellites in bacterial genomes - SatelliteFinder - and use it to identify the best described families: P4-like, phage inducible chromosomal islands (PICI), capsid-forming PICI, and phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements (PLE). We vastly expanded the number of described elements to [~]5000, finding hundreds of bacterial genomes with two different families of satellites, and dozens of Escherichia coli genomes with three. Most satellites were found in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but some are in novel taxa such as Actinobacteria. We characterized the gene repertoires of satellites, which are variable in size and composition, and their genomic organization, which is very conserved. With the partial exception of PICI and cfPICI, there are few homologous core genes between families of satellites, and even fewer homologous to phages. Hence, phage satellites are ancient, diverse, and probably evolved multiple times independently. Occasionally, core genes of a given family of satellites are found in another, suggesting gene flow between different satellites. Given the many elements found in spite of our conservative approach, the many bacteria infected by phages that still lack known satellites, and the recent proposals for novel families, we speculate that we are at the beginning of the discovery of massive numbers and types of satellites.

    "abstract": "Aquatic habitats are particularly susceptible to chemical pollution from domestic, agricultural, and industrial sources. Antimicrobials are commonly used in medical and industrial environments to reduce harmful bacteria and biofilms. This has led to the rapid increase in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) genes. Alternate remedies to fight pathogenic bacteria and biofilms are in development including synthetic and biological surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and rhamnolipids respectively. In the aquatic environment these surfactants are present as pollutants with potential to affect biofilm formation and AMR gene occurrence; however, there is limited research showing the actual environmental impact of such exposure. We tested the effects of rhamnolipid and SDS on natural aquatic biofilms in a freshwater stream in Northern Ireland. We grew biofilms on contaminant exposure substrata deployed within the stream over four weeks, and then carried out shotgun sequencing to determine microbial community composition, through 16s rRNA analyses (64,678 classifiable reads identified), and AMR gene occurrence (81 instances of AMR genes over 9 AMR gene classes) through a metagenomic analysis. There were no significant changes in community composition within all systems; however, biofilm exposed to rhamnolipid had a greater number of unique taxa as compared to our SDS treatments and controls. AMR gene prevalence was higher in surfactant-treated biofilms, with biofilm exposed to rhamnolipids having the highest presence of AMR genes and classes compared to the control or SDS treatments, in which genes encoding for rifampin resistance were detected. Our results suggest that the presence of rhamnolipid, and to a lesser extent SDS, encourages an increase in the prevalence of AMR genes in biofilms produced in mixed use water bodies.",

    "abstract": "C-di-GMP primarily controls motile to sessile transitions in bacteria. Diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) catalyze the synthesis of c-di-GMP from two GTP molecules. Typically, bacteria encode multiple DGCs that are activated by specific environmental signals. Their catalytic activity is modulated by c-di-GMP binding to autoinhibitory sites (I-sites). YfiN is a conserved inner membrane DGC that lacks these sites. Instead, YfiN activity is directly repressed by periplasmic YfiR, which is inactivated by redox stress. In E. coli, an additional envelope stress causes YfiN to relocate to the mid-cell to inhibit cell division by interacting with the division machinery. Here, we report a third activity for YfiN in E. coli, where cell growth is inhibited without YfiN relocating to the division site. This action of YfiN is only observed when the bacteria are cultured on gluconeogenic carbon sources, and is dependent on absence of the autoinhibitory sites. Restoration of I-site function relieves the growth-arrest phenotype, and disabling this function in a heterologous DGC causes acquisition of this phenotype. Arrested cells are tolerant to a wide range of antibiotics. We show that the likely cause of growth arrest is depletion of cellular GTP from run-away synthesis of c-di-GMP, explaining the dependence of growth arrest on gluconeogenic carbon sources that exhaust more GTP during production of glucose. This is the first report of c-di-GMP-mediated growth arrest by altering metabolic flow.\n\nSignificanceThe c-di-GMP signaling network in bacteria not only controls a variety of cellular processes such as motility, biofilms, cell development and virulence, but does so by a dizzying array of mechanisms. The DGC YfiN singularly represents the versatility of this network in that it not only inhibits motility and promotes biofilms, but also arrests growth in E. coli by relocating to the mid-cell and blocking cell division. The work described here reveals that YfiN arrests growth by yet another mechanism in E. coli - changing metabolic flow. This function of YfiN, or of DGCs without autoinhibitory I-sites, may contribute to antibiotic tolerant persisters in relevant niches such as the gut where gluconeogenic sugars are found.",

    "abstract": "Marine viruses play a key role in regulating phytoplankton populations, greatly affecting the biogeochemical cycling of major nutrients in the ocean. Resistance to viral infection has been reported for various phytoplankton species under laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, the occurrence of resistant cells in natural populations is underexplored due to the lack of sensitive tools to detect these rare phenotypes. Consequently, our current understanding of the ecological importance of resistance and its underlying mechanisms is limited. Here, we sought to discover lipid biomarkers for the resistance of the bloom-forming alga Emiliania huxleyi to its specific virus, E. huxleyi virus (EhV). We identified novel glycosphingolipids (GSLs) that characterize resistant E. huxleyi strains by applying an untargeted lipidomics approach. Further, we detected these lipid biomarkers in E. huxleyi isolates that were recently collected from E. huxleyi blooms and used them to detect resistant cells in the demise phase of an open ocean E. huxleyi bloom. Lastly, we show that the GSL composition of E. huxleyi cultures that recover following infection and gain resistance to the virus resembles that of resistant strains. These findings highlight the metabolic plasticity and co-evolution of the GSL biosynthetic pathway and underscore its central part in this host-virus arms race.",

Microecological patterns in diversity, structure, co-occurrence network, species turnover, and assembly process were revealed and varying between bacteriome and mycobiome, possibly driven by multiple factors including host selection, community cohesion, and particularly size-dependent dispersal limitation. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that host selection historically recruits microbiotas, whereas microbial size affects the subsequent turnovers due to the limited dispersal of larger-size microbes. This hypothesis was supported by datasets from other plant species and confirmed by stochastic dispersal experiments showing that smaller-size microbes are more likely to escape/disperse from endosphere niches, contributing to fleeting niches occupied by larger-size microbes.

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is the most studied and well understood microorganism, but research in this system can still be limited by available genetic tools, including the ability to rapidly integrate multiple DNA constructs efficiently into the chromosome. Site-specific, large serine recombinases can be useful tools, catalyzing a single, unidirectional recombination event between two specific DNA sequences, attB and attP, without requiring host proteins for functionality. Using these recombinases, we have developed a system to integrate up to twelve genetic constructs sequentially and stably into in the E. coli chromosome. A cassette of attB sites was inserted into the chromosome and the corresponding recombinases were cloned onto temperature sensitive plasmids to mediate recombination between a non-replicating, attP- containing \"cargo\" plasmid and the corresponding attB site on the chromosome. The efficiency of DNA insertion into the E. coli chromosome was approximately 107 cfu/g DNA for six of the recombinases when the competent cells already contained the recombinase-expressing plasmid and approximately 105 cfu/g DNA or higher when the recombinase-expressing plasmid and \"cargo\" plasmid were co-transformed. The \"cargo\" plasmid contains {Phi}C31 recombination sites flanking the antibiotic gene, allowing for resistance markers to be removed and reused following transient expression of the {Phi}C31 recombinase. As an example of the utility of this system, eight DNA methyltransferases from Clostridium clariflavum 4-2a were inserted into the E. coli chromosome to methylate plasmid DNA for evasion of the C. clariflavum restriction systems, enabling the first demonstration of transformation of this cellulose-degrading species.\n\nImportanceMore rapid genetic tools can help accelerate strain engineering, even in advanced hosts like Escherichia coli. Here, we adapt a suite of site-specific recombinases to enable simple, rapid, and highly efficient site-specific integration of heterologous DNA into the chromosome. This utility of this system was demonstrated by sequential insertion of eight DNA methyltransferases into the E. coli chromosome, allowing plasmid DNA to be protected from restriction in Clostridium clariflavum and enabling genetic transformation of this organism. This integration system should also be highly portable into non-model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency affects over 500 million individuals who can experience anemia in response to oxidative stressors such as certain foods and drugs. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for revisiting G6PD variant classification as a priority to implement genetic medicine in low- and middle-income countries. Towards this goal, we sought to collect reports of G6PD variants and provide interpretations. We identified 1,341 G6PD variants in population and clinical databases. Using the ACMG standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants, we provided interpretations for 268 variants, including 186 variants that were not reported or of uncertain significance in ClinVar, bringing the total number of variants with non-conflicting interpretations to 400. For 414 variants with functional or clinical data, we analyzed associations between activity, stability, and current classification systems, including the new 2022 WHO Classification. We corroborated known challenges with classification systems, including phenotypic variation, emphasizing the importance of comparing variant effects across patients and studies. Biobank data made available by All of Us illustrate the benefit of large-scale sequencing and phenotyping by adding additional support connecting variants to G6PD-deficient anemia. By leveraging available data and interpretation guidelines, we created a repository for information on G6PD variants and nearly doubled the number of variants with clinical interpretations. These tools enable better interpretation of G6PD variants for the implementation of genetic medicine.",

It involves melting a cryo sample with a laser beam to allow dynamics of the embedded particles to occur. Once the laser beam is switched off, the sample revitrifies within just a few microseconds, trapping the particles in their transient configurations, which can subsequently be imaged to obtain a snap shot of the dynamics at this point in time. While we have previously performed such experiments with a modified transmission electron microscope, we here demonstrate a simpler implementation that uses an optical microscope. We believe that this will make our technique more easily accessible and hope that it will encourage other groups to apply microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM to study the fast dynamics of a variety of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by two protein-rich membranes with a peptidoglycan layer sandwiched between them. Together they form the envelope (or cell wall), crucial for energy production, lipid biosynthesis, structural integrity, and for protection against the physical and chemical environmental challenges. To achieve envelope biogenesis, periplasmic and outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) must be transported from the cytosol and through the inner-membrane, via the ubiquitous SecYEG protein-channel. Emergent proteins either fold in the periplasm or cross the peptidoglycan (PG) layer towards the outer-membrane for insertion through the {beta}-barrel assembly machinery (BAM). Trafficking of hydrophobic proteins through the periplasm is particularly treacherous given the high protein density and the absence of energy (ATP or chemiosmotic potential). Numerous molecular chaperones assist in the prevention and recovery from aggregation, and of these SurA is known to interact with BAM, facilitating delivery to the outer-membrane. However, it is unclear how proteins emerging from the Sec-machinery are received and protected from aggregation and proteolysis prior to an interaction with SurA. Through biochemical analysis and electron microscopy we demonstrate the binding capabilities of the unoccupied and substrate-engaged SurA to the inner-membrane translocation machinery complex of SecYEG-SecDF-YidC - aka the holo-translocon (HTL). Supported by AlphaFold predictions, we suggest a role for periplasmic domains of SecDF in chaperone recruitment to the protein translocation exit site in SecYEG. We propose that this immediate interaction with a recruited chaperone helps to prevent aggregation and degradation of nascent envelope proteins, facilitating their safe passage to the periplasm and outer-membrane.",

Here, we have deployed capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry to identify and record the levels of InsPs and PP-InsPs in several tissues obtained from wild type mice and a newly-created PPIP5K2 knockout strain. We observe that the mouse colon harbours unusually high levels of InsPs and PP-InsPs. Additionally, the PP-InsP profile is considerably more complex than previously reported for animal cells: using chemically synthesized internal stable isotope references, and high-resolution mass spectra, we characterize two new PP-InsP isomers as 4/6-PP-InsP5 and 2-PP-InsP5. The latter has not previously been described in Nature. Analysis of feces and the commercial mouse diet suggest the latter is one potential source of noncanonical isomers in the colon. However, we also identify both molecules in the heart, indicating unknown synthesis pathways in mammals. We also demonstrate that the CE-MS method is sensitive enough to measure PP-InsPs from patient samples such as colon biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Strikingly, PBMCs also contain 4/6-PP-InsP5 and 2-PP-InsP5. In summary, our study substantially expands PP-InsP biology in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Palladin is an actin binding protein that is specifically upregulated in metastatic cancer cells but also co-localizes with actin stress fibers in normal cells and is critical for embryonic development as well as wound healing. Of nine isoforms present in humans, only the 90 kDa isoform of palladin, comprising three immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and one proline-rich region, is ubiquitously expressed. Previous work has also established that the Ig3 domain of palladin is the minimal binding site for F-actin. In this work, we compare functions of the 90 kDa isoform of palladin to the isolated actin binding domain. To understand the mechanism of action for how palladin can influence actin assembly, we monitored F-actin binding and bundling as well as actin polymerization, depolymerization, and copolymerization. We also provide initial evidence that 90 kDa palladin exists in a closed conformation that prevents binding by the Ig3 domain to G-actin as compared to the isolated domain. Understanding the role of palladin in regulating the actin cytoskeleton may help us develop means to prevent cancer cells from reaching the metastatic stage of cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Tubulin is an essential protein to maintain the cellular structure and for the cell division process. Inhibiting tubulin polymerization has proven to be an effective method for slowing cancer cell growth. Traditionally, identifying tubulin polymerization inhibitors involved using pure tubulin for in vitro assays or procedures using cells that require cell fixing and anti-tubulin antibody staining. This study explores using a cell line developed via CRISPR genome editing as a cell model to identify tubulin polymerization inhibitors with live cells without using exogenous staining. The cell line has endogenous tagging with fluorescent proteins of {beta}-tubulin and a nuclear protein to facilitate image cellular segmentation by high-content imaging analysis (HCI). The cells were treated with known tubulin polymerization inhibitors, colchicine and vincristine, and the presence of phenotypic changes that indicate tubulin polymerization inhibition were confirmed via HCI. A library of 429 kinase inhibitors was screened to discover tubulin polymerization inhibitors and three compounds that inhibit tubulin polymerization were found (ON-01910, HMN-214, and KX2-391). Live cell tracking analysis confirms that depolymerization of tubulin occurs rapidly after compound treatments. These results suggest that CRISPR-edited cells with fluorescent endogenous tagging of {beta}-tubulin can be used to screen larger compound libraries containing diverse chemical families to identify novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous defects in runt-related transcription factor-1 (RUNX1) are causative of a familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM). Since RUNX1-deficient animal models do not mimic FPDMMs bleeding disorder or leukemic risk, establishment of a proper model system is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms of the observed phenotype and to identify therapeutic interventions. We previously reported an in vitro-megakaryopoiesis system using human CD34+-hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that recapitulated the FPDMM quantitative megakaryocyte defect by decreasing RUNX1 expression using a lentiviral short-hairpin RNA (shRNA for RUNX1 or shRX) strategy. We now show that shRX-megakaryocytes have a marked reduction in agonist responsiveness. We then infused shRX-megakaryocytes into immunocompromised NOD-SCID gamma (NSG) mice and demonstrated that these megakaryocytes released fewer platelets than megakaryocytes transfected with a non-targeting shRNA, and these platelets had a diminished half-life. The platelets were also poorly responsive to agonists, unable to correct thrombus formation in NSG mice homozygous for a R1326H mutation in von Willebrand Factor (VWFR1326H), which switches species-binding specificity of the VWF from mouse to human glycoprotein Ib. A small-molecule inhibitor RepSox, which blocks the transforming-growth factor beta pathway, and which rescued defective megakaryopoiesis in vitro, corrected the thrombopoietic defect, platelet half-life and agonist response, and thrombus formation in NSG/VWFR1326H mice. Thus, this model recapitulates the defect in FPDMM megakaryocytes and platelets, identifies previously unrecognized defects in thrombopoiesis and platelet half-life, and demonstrates, for the first time, reversal of RUNX1 deficiencys hemostatic defects by a drug.\n\nKey PointsO_LIRUNX1-deficient megakaryocytes exhibit thrombopoietic and platelet defects in NSG/VWFR1326H mice.\nC_LIO_LIPre-exposure of RUNX1-deficient megakaryocytes to a TGF{beta}1-pathway inhibitor ameliorated both defects, correcting hemostasis.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The cytokine interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) has pivotal roles in antimicrobial immunity, but also incites inflammatory pathology. Bioactive IL-1{beta} is released following proteolytic maturation of the pro-IL-1{beta} precursor by caspase-1 inflammasomes. UBE2L3/UBCH7, a conserved ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, promotes pro-IL-1{beta} ubiquitylation and proteasomal disposal. However, UBE2L3 actions in vivo and ubiquitin ligases involved in this process are unknown. Here we report that deletion of Ube2l3 in mice markedly reduces pro-IL-1{beta} turnover in macrophages, leading to excessive mature IL-1{beta} production, neutrophilic inflammation and disease symptoms following inflammasome activation. A family-wide siRNA screen identified two ubiquitin ligases, TRIP12 and AREL1, which we show add K27-, K29- and K33- poly-ubiquitin chains on lysine residues in the  pro domain and destabilise pro-IL-1{beta}. Mutation of ubiquitylation sites increased pro-IL-1{beta} stability, but did not affect proteolysis by caspase-1. The extent of mature IL-1{beta} production is therefore determined by precursor abundance, and UBE2L3, TRIP12 and AREL1 limit inflammation by shrinking the cellular pool of pro-IL-1{beta}. Our study has uncovered fundamental processes governing IL-1{beta} homeostasis and provided molecular insights that could be exploited to mitigate its adverse actions in disease.",

In this work, we tackle these issues and propose biologically-informed viral genome assembly coverage as a method to improve diagnostic certainty. We use the identification of viral replicases, an essential function of viral life cycles, to define genome coverage thresholds in which biological functions can be described. We validate the analysis pipeline, Viroscope, using field samples, synthetic and published datasets and demonstrate that it provides sensitive and specific viral detection. Furthermore, we developed Viroscope.io a web-service to provide on-demand NGS data viral diagnosis to facilitate adoption and implementation by phytosanitary agencies to enable precise viral diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important human pathogen that can cause severe wound and lung infections. It employs the type VI secretion system (H1-T6SS) as a molecular weapon to carry out a unique dueling response to deliver toxic effectors to neighboring sister cells or other microbes after sensing an external attack. However, the underlying mechanism for such dueling is not fully understood. Here, we examined the role of all H1-T6SS effectors and VgrG proteins in assembly and signal sensing by ectopic expression, combinatorial deletion and point mutations, and imaging analyses. Expression of effectors targeting the cell wall and membrane resulted in increased H1-T6SS assembly. Deletion of individual effector and vgrG genes had minor- to-moderate effects on H1-T6SS assembly and dueling activities. The dueling response was detectable in the P. aeruginosa mutant lacking all H1-T6SS effector activities. In addition, double deletions of vgrG1a with either vgrG1b or vgrG1c and double deletions of effector genes tse5 and tse6 severely reduced T6SS assembly and dueling activities, suggesting their critical role in T6SS assembly. Collectively, these data highlight the diverse roles of effectors in not only dictating antibacterial functions but also their differential contributions to the assembly of the complex H1-T6SS apparatus.",

    "abstract": "In macromolecular structure determination using X-ray diffraction from multiple crystals, the presence of different structures (structural polymorphs) necessitates the classification of diffraction data for appropriate structural analysis. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is a promising technique that has so far been used to extract isomorphous data, mainly for single structure determination. Although in principle the use of HCA can be extended to detect polymorphs, the absence of a reference for defining a threshold used for grouping the isomorphous datasets ( isomorphic threshold) poses a challenge. Here, we have applied unit cell-based and intensity-based HCAs to the datasets of apo-trypsin and inhibitor-bound trypsin that were mixed post-data acquisition to investigate how effective HCA is in classifying polymorphous datasets. Single-step intensity-based HCA successfully classified polymorphs with a certain  isomorphic threshold. In datasets of several samples containing an unknown degree of structural heterogeneity, polymorphs could be identified by intensity-based HCA using the suggested  isomorphic threshold. Polymorphs were also detected in single crystals using the data collected by the continuous helical scheme. These findings are expected to facilitate the determination of multiple structural snapshots by exploiting automated data collection and analysis.\n\nSynopsisSingle-step intensity-based hierarchical clustering is demonstrated to allow the detection of structural polymorphs in the diffraction datasets obtained from multiple crystals. By splitting the datasets collected by continuous helical scheme into several chunks, both inter and intra-crystal polymorphs can be successfully analyzed.",
