    "abstract": "The assembly of intracellular proteins into biomolecular condensates is a fundamental process underlying the organisation of intracellular space and the regulation of many cellular processes. Mapping and characterising phase behaviour of biomolecules is essential to understand the mechanisms of condensate assembly, and to develop therapeutic strategies targeting biomolecular condensate systems. A central concept for characterising phase-separating systems is the phase diagram. Phase diagrams are typically built from numerous individual measurements sampling different parts of the parameter space. However, even when performed in microwell plate format, this process is slow, low throughput and requires significant sample consumption. To address this challenge, we present here a combinatorial droplet microfluidic platform, termed PhaseScan, for rapid and high-resolution acquisition of multidimensional biomolecular phase diagrams. Using this platform, we characterise the phase behaviour of a wide range of systems under a variety of conditions and demonstrate that this approach allows the quantitative characterisation of the effect of small molecules on biomolecular phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblasts play an important role in maintaining tissue integrity by secreting components of the extracellular matrix and initiating response to injury. Although the function of fibroblasts has been extensively studied in adults, the embryonic origin and diversification of different fibroblast subtypes during development remain largely unexplored. Using zebrafish as a model, we show that the sclerotome, a sub-compartment of the somite, is the embryonic source of multiple fibroblast subtypes including tenocytes (tendon fibroblasts), blood vessel associated fibroblasts, fin mesenchymal cells, and interstitial fibroblasts. High-resolution imaging shows that different fibroblast subtypes occupy unique anatomical locations with distinct morphologies. Long-term Cre-mediated lineage tracing reveals that the sclerotome also contributes to cells closely associated with the axial skeleton. Ablation of sclerotome progenitors results in extensive skeletal defects. Using photoconversion-based cell lineage analysis, we find that sclerotome progenitors at different dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior positions display distinct differentiation potentials. Single-cell clonal analysis combined with in vivo imaging suggests that the sclerotome mostly contains unipotent and bipotent progenitors prior to cell migration, and the fate of their daughter cells is biased by their migration paths and relative positions. Together, our work demonstrates that the sclerotome is the embryonic source of trunk fibroblasts as well as the axial skeleton, and local signals likely contribute to the diversification of distinct fibroblast subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Models of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) capture the dynamics of the regulatory processes that occur within the cell as a means to understand the variability observed in gene expression between different conditions. Arguably the simplest mathematical construct used for modeling is the Boolean network, which dictates a set of logical rules for transition between states described as Boolean vectors. Due to the complexity of gene regulation and the limitations of experimental technologies, in most cases knowledge about regulatory interactions and Boolean states is partial. In addition, the logical rules themselves are not known a-priori. Our goal in this work is to create an algorithm that finds the network that fits the data optimally, and identify the network states that correspond to the noise-free data. We present a novel methodology for integrating experimental data and performing a search for the optimal consistent structure via optimization of a linear objective function under a set of linear constraints. In addition, we extend our methodology into a heuristic that alleviates the computational complexity of the problem for datasets that are generated by single-cell RNA-Sequencing(scRNA-Seq). We demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools using a public scRNA-Seq dataset and the GRN that is associated with it. Our methodology will enable researchers to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and their biological role.",

    "abstract": "Favored characteristics evolve at two roughly-defined rates: selection of fitness < truncation {approx} truncation with fitness. The fastest route is also the most probable path; the path of least selection. When possible, truncations, requiring x [&ge;] threshold xt, implement least selection for x. Least selection is also speeded by maximal{sigma} (standard deviation) and maximal threshold xt (consistent with some survivors). Least selection applies to both chemical and biological evolution. Non-genetic truncation is free of the Haldane cost of natural selection; and can yield very rapid non-Darwinian evolution. Least selection also unites prior examples of brisk evolution. For example: evolution via  starting bloc selection (in which initial action is crucial) and  chance utility (opportune fluctuation) and  near-ideal reactions (where undependable reactants recurrently yield a product) occur via transitory paths of least selection. Least selections optimized path may still be clear even for transitions whose origins are lost.  Bayesian convergence (which defines a most probable path) is guaranteed by least selections extremum.  Distribution fitness (specific outcomes from diffuse concurrent variation) is least selection from rare highly functional minorities. Inheritance of encoded chemical capabilities emerges because least selection exploits coexistence of templating and catalysis in a single molecular complex. The  crescendo of codes leading to the Standard Genetic Code is a specific device that makes a least selection. Thus, plausible evolutionary paths reach biological goals via least selections. Extinctions and radiations are events with coercive thresholds, ensuring that Earths history reflects truncation/least selection.",

A link between drug discontinuation and cognitive improvement was seen for opioids, antidepressants as well as for anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives.\n\nConclusionsAlthough our results may be confounded by subjacent conditions, they suggest that long-term use of CNS medications may have domain-specific negative effects on cognitive performance over time, whereas the discontinuation of these medications may partly reverse these effects. These results open up for future studies that address subjacent conditions on cognition to develop a more complete understanding of the cognitive effects of CNS medications.\n\nKey pointsO_LIOpioid use was associated with decline in visuospatial ability, and individuals discontinuing using opioids showed improvement in visuospatial ability compared to individuals continuing using opioids.\nC_LIO_LIAntidepressant use was associated with decline in semantic memory, and individuals discontinuing using antidepressants showed improvement in semantic memory compared to individuals continuing using antidepressants.\nC_LIO_LIFor anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives there was no difference between continued users and non-users, but drug discontinuation was associated with more positive cognitive development both in episodic memory and visuospatial ability.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes the modification of serine and threonine residues on nuclear and cytosolic proteins with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). OGT is essential for mammalian cell viability, but the underlying mechanisms are still enigmatic. We employed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 viability screen in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with inducible Ogt gene deletion and showed that the block in cell viability induced by OGT deficiency stems from mitochondrial dysfunction secondary to mTOR hyperactivation. In normal cells, OGT maintains low mTOR activity and mitochondrial fitness through suppression of proteasome activity; in the absence of OGT, increased proteasome activity results in increased steady-state amino acid levels, which in turn promote mTOR lysosomal translocation and activation, and increased oxidative phosphorylation. mTOR activation in OGT-deficient mESCs was confirmed by an independent phosphoproteomic screen. Our study highlights a novel series of events whereby OGT regulates the proteasome/ mTOR/ mitochondrial axis in a manner that maintains homeostasis of intracellular amino acid levels, mitochondrial fitness and cell viability. A similar mechanism operates in CD8+ T cells, indicating its generality across mammalian cell types. Manipulating OGT activity may have therapeutic potential in diseases in which this signaling pathway is impaired.",

    "abstract": "White matter (WM) injury is frequently observed along with dementia. Positron emission tomography with amyloid-ligands (A{beta}-PET) recently gained interest for detecting WM injury. Yet, little is understood about the origin of the altered A{beta}-PET signal in WM regions. Here, we investigated the relative contributions of diffusion MRI-based microstructural alterations, including free water and tissue-specific properties, to A{beta}-PET in WM and to cognition. We included a unique cohort of 115 participants covering the spectrum of low-to-severe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden and cognitively normal to dementia. We applied a bi-tensor diffusion-MRI model that differentiates between (i) the extracellular WM compartment (represented via free water), and (ii) the fiber-specific compartment (via free water-adjusted fractional anisotropy [FA]). We observed that, in regions of WMH, a decrease in A{beta}-PET related most closely to higher free water and higher WMH volume. In contrast, in normal-appearing WM, an increase in A{beta}-PET related more closely to higher cortical A{beta} (together with lower free water-adjusted FA). In relation to cognitive impairment, we observed a closer relationship with higher free water than with either free water-adjusted FA or WM PET. Our findings support free water and A{beta}-PET as markers of WM abnormalities in patients with mixed dementia, and contribute to a better understanding of processes giving rise to the WM PET signal.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is regulated cell death that depends on caspases. Upstream of each apoptotic signalling pathway is involved a specific initiator caspase. Characterised in nematode, fly and mammals, intrinsic apoptosis is considered to be ancestral and conserved among animals, and depends on shared initiators; caspase-9, Apaf-1 and Bcl-2. However, the biochemical role of mitochondria, the pivotal function of cytochrome c and the modality of caspase activation remain highly heterogeneous and hide profound molecular divergences among apoptotic pathways in animals. Uncovering the phylogenetic history of apoptotic actors, especially caspases, is crucial to shed light on intrinsic apoptosis evolutionary history. Here, we demonstrate by phylogenetic analyses, that caspase-9, the fundamental key of intrinsic apoptosis, is deuterostome-specific, while caspase-2 is ancestral to bilaterians. Our analysis of Bcl-2 and Apaf-1 confirm heterogeneity in functional organisation of apoptotic pathways in animals. Our results support emergence of distinct intrinsic apoptotic pathways during metazoan evolution.",

We first investigated brain activation patterns during a think-aloud condition and found that significantly activated brain areas included all brain regions required for speech. We then calculated the relationship between divergence in thought content and brain activation during think-aloud and found that divergence in thought content was associated with many brain regions. Finally, we explored the neural representation of self-generated thoughts by performing representational similarity analysis (RSA) at three neural scales: a voxel-wise whole-brain searchlight level; a region-level whole-brain analysis using the Schaefer 400-parcels; at the systems level using the Yeo seven-networks. We found that \"resting-state\" self-generated thoughts were distributed across a wide range of brain regions, involving all seven Yeo networks.

While several secreted proteins, secondary metabolites and retrotransposons-derived small RNAs have been characterized as virulence factors, their roles in host specialization remain unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the genomic correlates of host-specialization in populations of B. cinerea associated with grapevine and tomato. Using PacBio sequencing, we produced complete assemblies of the genomes of strains Sl3 and Vv3 that represent the French populations T and G1 of B. cinerea, specialized on tomato and grapevine, respectively. Both assemblies revealed 16 core chromosomes that were highly syntenic with chromosomes of the reference strain B05.10. The main sources of variation in gene content were the subtelomeric regions and the accessory chromosomes, especially the chromosome BCIN19 of Vv3 that was absent in Sl3 and B05.10. The repertoires and density of transposable elements were clearly different between the genomes of Sl3 and Vv3 with a larger number of subfamilies (26) and a greater genome coverage in Vv3 (7.7%) than in Sl3 (14 subfamilies, 4.5% coverage). An Helitron-like element was found in almost all subtelomeric regions of the Vv3 genome, in particular in the flanking regions of a highly duplicated gene encoding a Telomere-Linked Helicase, while both features were absent from the Sl3 and B05.10 genomes. Different retrotransposons in the Sl3 and the Vv3 strains resulted in the synthesis of distinct sets of small RNAs. Finally, extending the study to additional strains indicated that the accessory chromosome BCIN19 and the small RNAs producing retrotransposons Copia_4 and Gypsy_7 are common features of the G1 population that are scarcely if ever found in strains isolated from other populations. This research reveals that accessory chromosomes, repertoires of transposons and their derived small RNAs differ between populations of B. cinerea specialized on different hosts. The genomic data characterized in our study pave the way for further studies aiming at investigating the molecular mechanisms underpinning host specialization in a polyphagous pathogen.",

Recent polyploid genotyping methods use allelic frequencies, rate of heterozygosity, parental cross or other information to resolve read assignment, but good subgenomic references offer the most direct information. The typical strategy aligns reads to the joint reference, performs diploid genotyping within each subgenome, and filters the results, but persistent read misassignment results in an excess of false heterozygous calls.\n\nResultsWe introduce the Comprehensive Allopolyploid Genotyper (CAPG), which formulates an explicit likelihood to weight read alignments against both subgenomic references and genotype individual allopolyploids from whole genome resequencing (WGS) data. We demonstrate CAPG in allotetraploids, where it performs better than GATKs HaplotypeCaller applied to reads aligned to the combined subgenomic references.\n\nAvailabilityCode and tutorials are available at https://github.com/Kkulkarni1/CAPG.git.",

Here, we formalize suboptimalities as part of the brains probabilistic model of the task. Data from a traditional binary discrimination task cannot separate between different kinds of biases, or between sensory noise and approximate computations. We showed that this was possible using a recently developed causal inference task in which observers discriminated auditory cues in the presence of choice-uninformative visual cues.

    "abstract": "The brain is a system that performs numerous functions by controlling its states. Quantifying the cost of this control is essential as it reveals how the brain can be controlled based on the minimization of the control cost, and which brain regions are most important to the optimal control of transitions. Despite its great potential, the current control paradigm in neuroscience uses a deterministic framework and is therefore unable to consider stochasticity, severely limiting its application to neural data. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a novel framework for the evaluation of control costs based on a linear stochastic model. Following our previous work, we quantified the optimal control cost as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence between the uncontrolled and controlled processes. In the linear model, we established an analytical expression for minimal cost and showed that we can decompose it into the cost for controlling the mean and covariance of brain activity. To evaluate the utility of our novel framework, we examined the significant brain regions in the optimal control of transitions from the resting state to seven cognitive task states in human whole-brain imaging data. We found that, in realizing the different transitions, the lower visual areas commonly played a significant role in controlling the means, while the posterior cingulate cortex commonly played a significant role in controlling the covariances.\n\nSignificance StatementThe brain performs many cognitive functions by controlling its states. Quantifying the cost of this control is essential as it reveals how the brain can be optimally controlled in terms of the cost, and which brain regions are most important to the optimal control of transitions. Here, we built a novel framework to quantify control cost that takes account of stochasticity of neural activity, which is ignored in previous studies. We established the analytical expression of the stochastic control cost, which enables us to compute the cost in high-dimensional neural data. We identified the significant brain regions for the optimal control in cognitive tasks in human whole-brain imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex demonstrate spatially periodic firing patterns, which are thought to provide a map of space on behaviorally relevant length scales. It is unknown, however, whether such periodicity exists for behaviorally relevant time scales in the human brain. Here we investigated neuronal firing during a temporally continuous uninterrupted experience by presenting fourteen neurosurgical patients with an audiovisual video while recording single neuron activity from multiple brain regions. We report on a set of units that modulate their activity in a strikingly periodic manner across different timescales--from seconds to many minutes. These cells were most prevalent in the entorhinal cortex. Time within the video could be decoded from their population activity. Furthermore, these cells remapped their dominant periodicity to shorter timescales during a subsequent recognition memory task. When the audiovisual sequence was presented at two different speeds (regular and faster), a significant percentage of these temporally periodic cells (TPCs) maintained their timescales, suggesting a degree of invariance with respect to the narrative content. The temporal periodicity of TPCs may complement the spatial periodicity of grid cells Whether these cells provide scalable spatiotemporal metrics for encoding and retrieval of human experience warrants future investigations.",

The algorithm identifies cell-cell communications in which metabolites, such as lipids, are secreted by sender cells and traveled to interact with sensor proteins of receiver cells. The sensor proteins on receiver cell might be cell surface receptors, transporters across the cell membrane, or nuclear receptors. MEBOCOST relies on a comprehensive database of metabolite-sensor partners, which we manually curated from the literatures and other public sources. MEBOCOST defines sender and receiver cells for an extracellular metabolite based on the expression levels of the enzymes and sensors, respectively, thus identifies metabolite-sensor communications between the cells. Applying MEBOCOST to mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT) successfully recaptured known metabolite-mediated cell communications and further identified new communications. Additionally, MEBOCOST identified a set of BAT intercellular metabolite-sensor communications that was regulated by cold exposure of the mice. MEBOCOST will be useful to numerous researchers to investigate metabolite-mediated cell-cell communications in many biological and disease models.

Indeed, GTA particles resemble caudoviricete virions but, in contrast to caudoviricetes (or any viruses), GTAs can encapsidate at best only part of their own genomes, are induced solely in small subpopulations of prokaryotic host cells and are transmitted vertically as part of cellular genomes during replication and division. Therefore, the lifecycles of GTAs are analogous to virus-derived entities found in parasitoid wasps, which have recently been recognized as non-virus entities and therefore reclassified as viriforms. We evaluated three distinct, independently exapted GTA groups for which the genetic basis for GTA particle production has been established. Based on the evidence, we outline a classification scheme for these viriforms.",

    "abstract": "Predictions for millions of protein three-dimensional structures are only a few clicks away since the release of AlphaFold2 results for UniProt. However, many proteins have so-called intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that do not adopt unique structures in isolation. These IDRs are associated with several diseases, including Alzheimers Disease. We showed that three recent disorder measures of AlphaFold2 predictions (pLDDT, \"experimentally resolved\" prediction and \"relative solvent accessibility\") correlated to some extent with IDRs. However, expert methods predict IDRs more reliably by combining complex machine learning models with expert-crafted input features and evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). MSAs are not always available, especially for IDRs, and are computationally expensive to generate, limiting the scalability of the associated tools. Here, we present the novel method SETH that predicts residue disorder from embeddings generated by the protein Language Model ProtT5, which explicitly only uses single sequences as input. Thereby, our method, relying on a relatively shallow convolutional neural network, outperformed much more complex solutions while being much faster, allowing to create predictions for the human proteome in about one hour on a consumer-grade PC with one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. Trained on a continuous disorder scale (CheZOD scores), our method captured subtle variations in disorder, thereby providing important information beyond the binary classification of most methods. High performance paired with speed revealed that SETHs nuanced disorder predictions for entire proteomes capture aspects of the evolution of organisms. Additionally, SETH could also be used to filter out regions or proteins with probable low-quality AlphaFold2 3D structures to prioritize running the compute-intensive predictions for large data sets.

    "abstract": "Immediately following their deposition into the mammalian host by an infected sand fly vector, Leishmania parasites encounter and are engulfed by a variety of cell types. From there, parasites may transit to other cell types, primarily macrophages or dendritic cells, where they replicate and induce pathology. During this time, Leishmania cells undergo a dramatic transformation from the motile non-replicating metacyclic stage to the non-motile replicative amastigote stage, a differentiative process that can be termed amastigogenesis. To follow this at the single cell level, we identified a suite of experimental  landmarks delineating different stages of amastigogenesis qualitatively or quantitatively, including new uses of amastigote-specific markers that showed interesting cellular localizations at the anterior or posterior ends. We compared amastigogenesis in synchronous infections of peritoneal and bone-marrow derived macrophages (PEM, BMM) or dendritic cells (BMDC). Overall, the marker suite expression showed an orderly transition post-infection with similar kinetics between host cell types, with the emergence of several amastigote traits within 12 hours, followed by parasite replication after 24 hours, with parasites in BMM or BMDC initiating DNA replication more slowly. Lipophosphoglycan (LPG) is a Leishmania virulence factor that facilitates metacyclic establishment in host cells but declines in amastigotes. Whereas LPG expression was lost by parasites within PEM by 48 hours, >40% of the parasites infecting BMM or BMDC retained metacyclic-level LPG expression at 72 hr. Thus L. major may prolong LPG expression in different intracellular environments, thereby extending its efficacy in promoting infectivity in situ and during cell-to-cell transfer of parasites expressing this key virulence factor.\n\nAuthor SummaryLeishmaniasis caused by species of the trypanosomatid protozoan parasite Leishmania is an important widespread global health problem. Humans become infected by Leishmania following the bite of sand flies bearing the flagellated metacyclic promastigote stage, and the first 24-48 hours thereafter are critical to the outcome of infection. During this time, parasites are engulfed by several host cell types, where they differentiate into the rounded amastigote stage, adapted for intracellular survival and proliferation, with concomitant changes in metabolism and virulence factor expression. We developed a suite of markers that allowed us to monitor promastigote-to-amastigote differentiation (amastigogenesis) on a single-cell level. Two showed amastigote-specific expression and localized to the anterior or posterior regions. Our marker suite allowed us to chart the course of amastigogenesis in different host cell environments and to determine the timing of amastigote development relative to the initiation of parasite replication and the expression of the virulence factor lipophosphoglycan (LPG). We report that the amastigogenesis process follows a determined sequence of events that occurs prior to parasite replication. In contrast, parasites may respond to different host cell environments by prolonging LPG expression, thereby extending the duration of its pro-infectivity functions within or in transit between host cell destinations.",

Countering models that presume antibodies are generated largely by stochastic processes, we demonstrate that polymorphisms within the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) significantly impact the naive and antigen-experienced antibody repertoire, indicating that genetics predisposes individuals to mount qualitatively and quantitatively different antibody responses. We pair recently developed long-read genomic sequencing methods with antibody repertoire profiling to comprehensively resolve IGH genetic variation, including novel structural variants, single nucleotide variants, and genes and alleles. We show that IGH germline variants determine the presence and frequency of antibody genes in the expressed repertoire, including those enriched in functional elements linked to V(D)J recombination, and overlapping disease-associated variants. These results illuminate the power of leveraging IGH genetics to better understand the regulation, function and dynamics of the antibody response in disease.",

    "abstract": "Ethanol is a known vertebrate teratogen that causes craniofacial defects as a component of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Our results show that sea urchin embryos treated with ethanol similarly show broad skeletal patterning defects, potentially analogous to the defects associated with FAS. The sea urchin larval skeleton is a simple patterning system that involves only two cell types: the primary mesenchymal cells (PMCs) that secrete the calcium carbonate skeleton and the ectodermal cells that provide migratory, positional, and differentiation cues for the PMCs. Perturbations in RA biosynthesis and Hh signaling pathways are thought to be causal for the FAS phenotype in vertebrates. Surprisingly, our results indicate that these pathways are not functionally relevant for the teratogenic effects of ethanol in developing sea urchins. We found that developmental morphology as well as the expression of ectodermal and PMC genes was delayed by ethanol exposure. Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed significant impacts of ethanol on signaling and metabolic gene expression, and a disruption in the timing of GRN gene expression that includes both delayed and precocious gene expression throughout the specification network. We conclude that the skeletal patterning perturbations in ethanol-treated embryos likely arise from a loss of temporal synchrony within and between the instructive and responsive tissues.",

    "abstract": "LD score regression (LDSC) is a method to estimate narrow-sense heritability from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics alone, making it a fast and popular approach. The key concept underlying the LDSC framework is that there is a positive linear relationship between the magnitude of GWAS allelic effect estimates and linkage disequilibrium (LD) when complex traits are generated under the infinitesimal model -- that is, causal variants are uniformly distributed along the genome and each have the same expected contribution to phenotypic variation. We present interaction-LD score (i-LDSC) regression: an extension of the original LDSC framework that accounts for non-additive genetic effects. By studying a wide range of generative models in simulations, and by re-analyzing 25 well-studied quantitative phenotypes from 349,468 individuals in the UK Biobank and up to 159,095 individuals in BioBank Japan, we show that the inclusion of a cis-interaction score (i.e., interactions between a focal variant and nearby variants) significantly recovers substantial non-additive heritability that is not captured by LDSC. For each of the 25 traits analyzed in the UK Biobank and 23 of the 25 traits analyzed in BioBank Japan, i-LDSC detects a significant amount of variation contributed by genetic interactions. The i-LDSC software and its application to these biobanks represent a step towards resolving further genetic contributions of sources of non-additive genetic effects to complex trait variation.",

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis is increasingly providing a promising minimally invasive alternative to tissue biopsies in precision oncology. However, current methods of ctDNA mutation profiling have limited resolution because of the high background noise and false-positive rate caused by benign variants in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA), majorly generated during clonal hematopoiesis. Although personalized parallel white blood cell (WBC) genome sequencing suppresses the noise of clonal hematopoiesis variances observed in ctDNA based liquid biopsy, the system cost and complexity restrict its extensive application in clinical settings. To address this challenge, we describe a Matched WBC Genome sequencing Independent CtDNA profiling (MaGIC) approach, which enables the sensitive detection of recurrent tumor mutant information harbored by ctDNA from a bulk cfDNA background based on hybrid capture cfDNA deep sequencing, in silico background elimination, and a reliable readout measurement by the calculation the number of key mutated exons. Leveraging somatic mutation data from 10163 patients across 24 cancer types obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we confirm that the MaGIC approaches are of ideal performance in prediction of prognosis by tissue biopsy samples of patients across multiple cancers. Meanwhile, MaGIC approaches enable the classification of prostate cancer patients from heathy cohorts by ctDNA sequencing data. We further profiled the ctDNAs of 80 plasma samples from 40 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before and during chemotherapy by MaGIC approaches. The MaGICv2 can predict the chemosensitivity with high accuracy by simply using one liquid biopsy sample of each patient before a stereotypical treatment course. We anticipate that this new approach has the potential utility of ctDNA detection in multiple clinical cancer contexts, thus facilitating precise cancer therapy.\n\nTeaserA liquid biopsy analysis method for multifunctional patient classification such as diagnosis and chemosensitivity prediction.",

In the zebrafish, all retinofugal axons cross at the optic chiasm to innervate the contralateral tectum. Here, the mutant for the Robo2 receptor presents severe axon guidance defects, which were not completely reproduced in a Slit2 ligand null mutant. Since slit3 is also expressed around this area at the stage of axon crossing, we decided to analyze the possibility that it collaborates with Slit2 in this process. We found that the disruption of slit3 expression by sgRNA-Cas9 injection caused similar, albeit slightly milder, defects than those of the slit2 mutant, while the same treatment in the slit2-/- background caused much more severe defects, comparable to those observed in robo2 mutants. Tracking analysis of in vivo time-lapse experiments indicated differential but complementary functions of these secreted factors in the correction of axon turn errors around the optic chiasm. Interestingly, RT-qPCR analysis showed a mild increase in slit2 expression in slit3 deficient embryos, but not the opposite. Our observations support the previously proposed \"repulsive channel\" model for Slit-Robo action at the optic chiasm, with both Slits acting in different manners, most probably relating to their different spatial expression patterns.",

    "abstract": "The geographic nature of biological dispersal shapes patterns of genetic variation over landscapes, making it possible to infer properties of dispersal from genetic variation data. Here we present an inference tool that uses geographically distributed genotype data in combination with a convolutional neural network to estimate a critical population parameter: the mean per-generation dispersal distance. Using extensive simulation, we show that our deep learning approach is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly at small sample sizes. In addition, we evaluate varying nuisance parameters during training--including population density, demographic history, habitat size, and sampling area--and show that this strategy is effective for estimating dispersal distance when other model parameters are unknown. Whereas competing methods depend on information about local population density or accurate identification of identity-by-descent tracts, our method uses only single-nucleotide-polymorphism data and the spatial scale of sampling as input. Strikingly, and unlike other methods, our method does not use the geographic coordinates of the genotyped individuals. These features make our method, which we call \"disperseNN\", a potentially valuable new tool for estimating dispersal distance in non-model systems with whole genome data or reduced representation data. We apply disperseNN to 12 different species with publicly available data, yielding reasonable estimates for most species. Importantly, our method estimated consistently larger dispersal distances than mark-recapture calculations in the same species, which may be due to the limited geographic sampling area covered by some mark-recapture studies.

    "abstract": "C3 and C4 plants are the two major terrestrial plant groups that respond differently to temperature, water, and CO2. Although much research has focused on the individual effect of warming, water availability, and elevated CO2 on biomass production and competitive interactions between C3 and C4 plants, the joint effects of these factors remain underexplored. We grew naturally co-occurring C3 (Oplismenus composites) and C4 (Paspalum conjugatum) grass under three temperature warming scenarios (control, +2{degrees}C, and +4{degrees}C), two water supply intervals (normal 2 days vs. prolonged 7 days [drought]), and two CO2 concentrations (ambient 400 ppm vs. elevated 800 ppm) in growth chambers and measured their above- and below-ground dry biomass in monoculture and mixture to quantify their biomass performances and competitive responses. Warming and elevated CO2 together enhanced the above- and/or below-ground biomass of both C3 and C4 grass. Moreover, temperature, water, and CO2 interacted to increase the below-ground biomass of the C4 grass. Surprisingly, the C3 grass performed worse under interspecific competition (mixture biomass) relative to intraspecific competition (monoculture biomass) at elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2, while the reverse is true for the C4 grass. Furthermore, the C4 grass was most competitive against the C3 grass under simultaneous 4{degrees}C warming, drought, and elevated CO2. Taken together, our results suggest that the competitive balance could potentially shift in favor of C4 plants under the projected temperature warming, increased drought frequencies, and rising atmospheric CO2, with an increase in C4 relative abundance in future plant communities.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAn interlude of dark exposure for about one week is known to shift the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance of the mammalian visual cortex, promoting cortical plasticity across species and accelerating visual recovery in animals that have experienced cortical lesions during development. However, the translational impact of our understanding of dark exposure from animal studies on humans remains elusive. Here, we use magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a probe for E/I balance in the primary visual cortex (V1) to determine the effect of 60-min dark exposure, and measure binocular combination as a behavioral assay to assess visual plasticity in 18 normally sighted human adults (13 females). To induce neuroplastic changes in the observers, 60-min monocular deprivation was performed, which is known to shift sensory eye balance in favor of the previously deprived eye. We report that prior dark exposure strengthens cortical excitability in V1 and boosts visually plasticity in normal adults. Our findings are surprising, given the fact that the interlude is very brief. We present direct evidence that an environmental manipulation that reduces intracortical inhibition can act as a metaplastic facilitator for visual plasticity in adult humans.",

    "abstract": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by extreme mood shifts, anxiety, and irritability during the premenstrual period. Abnormal sensitivity to allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that normally potentiates inhibition, and an increased ratio of neural excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) have been linked to the pathophysiology of PMDD. We hypothesized that in subjects with PMDD these factors will lead to an altered frequency of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) visual gamma oscillations, altered modulation of their power by the strength of excitatory drive and to an altered perceptual spatial suppression.\n\nWe examined women with PMDD and age-matched control women twice: during the asymptomatic follicular and symptomatic luteal phases of the menstrual cycle (MC). MEG gamma oscillations were recorded while modulating excitatory drive to the visual cortex by increasing drift rate of high-contrast visual grating. Visual perceptual suppression was assessed as the degree of deterioration of motion direction discrimination with increasing stimulus size.\n\nIn women with PMDD, the peak frequency of the gamma response (GR) and its modulation by the drift rate were normal, whereas modulation of the GR power was significantly altered. A moderate increase in drift rate had an unusually strong facilitating effect on the GR power in PMDD, regardless of the MC phase. In contrast, the normally suppressive effect of a strong increase in drift rate was attenuated in PMDD during the luteal phase and predicted symptom severity assessed on the same day. Perceptual spatial suppression did not differ between the groups, but decreased from the follicular to the luteal phase only in PMDD subjects.\n\nThe atypical GR power modulation suggests that neuronal excitability in the visual cortex is constitutively elevated in women with PMDD, and that this E/I imbalance is further exacerbated during the luteal phase, possibly due to an abnormal sensitivity to neurosteroids. However, the unchanged frequency of GR and normal spatial suppression in women with PMDD speak against the dysfunction of their inhibitory neurons, at least those involved in generation of visual gamma oscillations.\n\nThree key pointsO_LIAtypical modulation of visual gamma power by excitatory drive in women with PMDD suggests the presence of neuronal hyperexcitability, which is exacerbated during the symptomatic luteal phase, possibly due to altered sensitivity to neurosteroids.\nC_LIO_LIThe peak frequency of gamma oscillations does not differ between women with PMDD and control women and demonstrates the luteal phase-specific effect of the 1st scan in both groups, which suggest normal functioning of inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex in PMDD.\nC_LIO_LIThe presence of normal perceptual spatial suppression also speaks against inhibitory deficit in the visual cortex in PMDD.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG) is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen strongly associated with colorectal cancer. Here, through comparative genomics analysis, we demonstrated that the genetic locus encoding the Type VIIb Secretion System (T7SSb) machinery is uniquely present in SGG in two different arrangements. SGG UCN34 carrying the most prevalent T7SSb genetic arrangement was chosen as the reference strain. To identify the effectors secreted by this secretion system, we inactivated the essC gene encoding the motor of this machinery. Comparison of the proteins secreted by UCN34 WT and its isogenic {Delta}essC mutant revealed six T7SSb effector proteins, including the expected WXG effector EsxA and three LXG-containing proteins. In this work, we characterized an LXG-family toxin named herein TelE displaying pore-forming activity. Seven homologs of TelE harboring a conserved glycine zipper motif at the C-terminus were identified in different SGG isolates. Scanning mutagenesis of this motif showed that the glycine residue at position 470 was crucial for TelE pore-forming activity. Unlike other pore-forming toxins commonly antagonized by a membrane protein, TelE activity was antagonized by a small protein TipE belonging to the DUF5085 family. Overall, we report herein a unique SGG T7SSb effector exhibiting a pore-forming activity against non-immune bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, 38 clinical isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG) were sequenced and a genetic locus encoding the Type VIIb secretion system (T7SSb) was found conserved and absent from 16 genomes of the closely related S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (SGP). The T7SSb is a bona fide pathogenicity island. Here, we report that the model organism SGG strain UCN34 secretes six T7SSb effectors. One of the six effectors named TelE displayed a strong toxicity when overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Our results indicate that TelE is a pore forming toxin whose activity can be antagonized by a non-canonical immunity protein named TipE. Overall, we report a unique toxin-immunity protein pair and our data expand the range of effectors secreted through T7SSb.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma mobile is a fish pathogen that glides on solid surfaces by means of a unique mechanism. The gliding machinery of M. mobile is composed of internal and surface structures. In the present study, we focused on the function and structure of Gli123, a surface protein that is essential for the localization of other surface proteins. The amino acid sequence of Gli123, which is 1128 amino acids long, contains lipoprotein-specific repeats. We isolated the native Gli123 protein from M. mobile cells and a recombinant protein, rGli123, from Escherichia coli. The isolated rGli123 complemented a non-binding and non-gliding mutant of M. mobile that lacked Gli123. Circular dichroism and rotary-shadowing electron microscopy (EM) showed that rGli123 has a structure that is not significantly different from that of the native protein. Rotary-shadowing EM suggested that the molecules changed their shape between globular and rod-like structures, depending on the ionic strength of the solution. Negative-staining EM coupled with single-particle analysis revealed that Gli123 forms a globular structure featuring a small protrusion with dimensions of 20.0, 14.5, and 16.0 nm. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses indicated a rod-like structure composed of several tandem globular domains with total dimensions of approximately 34 nm length and 4 nm width. Both molecular structures were suggested to be dimers based on the predicted molecular size and structure. Gli123 may have evolved by multiplication of repeating lipoprotein units and acquired clumping role of surface proteins.\n\nIMPORTANCEMycoplasmas are pathogenic bacteria that are widespread in animals. They are characterized by small cell and genome sizes but are equipped with unique abilities to escape host immunity, such as surface variation and gliding. Here, we focused on a surface-localizing protein that is essential for Mycoplasma mobile gliding. The findings of this study suggested that the protein undergoes drastic conformational changes between its rod-like and globular structures. These changes may be caused by a repetitive structure common in the surface proteins that is responsible for the modulation of the cell surface structure and related to the assembly process for the surface gliding machinery. An evolutionary process for this unique mycoplasma gliding mechanism has also been suggested in the present study.",

How CTCF establishes TAD boundaries and to what extent these are permeable to cohesin is unknown9. To address these questions, we visualize interactions of single CTCF and cohesin molecules on DNA in vitro. We show that CTCF is sufficient to block diffusing cohesin, possibly reflecting how cohesive cohesin accumulates at TAD boundaries, as well as to block loop-extruding cohesin, reflecting how CTCF establishes TAD boundaries. CTCF functions asymmetrically, as predicted, but unexpectedly is dependent on DNA tension. Moreover, CTCF regulates cohesins loop extrusion activity by changing its direction and by inducing loop shrinkage. Our data indicate that CTCF is not, as previously assumed, simply a barrier to cohesin-mediated loop extrusion but is an active regulator of this process, where the permeability of TAD boundaries can be modulated by DNA tension. These results reveal mechanistic principles of how CTCF controls loop extrusion and genome architecture.",

    "abstract": "Virus replication depends on a complex interplay between viral and host proteins. In the case of African swine fever virus (ASFV), a large DNA virus, only few virus-host protein-protein interactions have been identified to date. In this study, we demonstrate that the ASFV protein CP204L directly interacts with the cellular homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) protein VPS39, blocking its association with the lysosomal HOPS complex, that modulates endolysosomal trafficking and promotes lysosome clustering. Instead, VPS39 is targeted to the sites of virus replication termed virus factories. Furthermore, we show that loss of VPS39 reduces the levels of virus proteins synthesized in the early phase of infection and delays ASFV replication but does not completely inhibit it. Collectively, these results identify a novel virus-host protein interaction that modulates host membrane rearrangement during infection and provide evidence that CP204L is a multifunctional protein engaged in distinct steps of the ASFV life cycle.\n\nImportanceAfrican swine fever virus (ASFV) was first identified over a hundred years ago. Since then, much effort has been made to understand the pathogenesis of ASFV. Yet, the specific roles of many individual ASFV proteins during the infection remain enigmatic. This study provides evidence that CP204L, one of the most abundant ASFV proteins, modulates endosomal trafficking during virus infection. Through direct protein-protein interaction, CP204L prevents the recruitment of VPS39 to the endosomal and lysosomal membranes, resulting in their accumulation. Consequently, CP204L and VPS39 become sequestered to the ASFV replication site. These results uncover a novel function of viral protein CP204L and extend our understanding of complex interaction between virus and host.",

We report here that ADGRF1 is the first class B GPCR shown to signal through all major G-protein classes and identify the structural basis for its Gq preference by cryo-EM. Our structure shows that Gq over Gs preference in ADGRF1 derives from tighter packing at the conserved F569 of the TA, altering contacts between TM helix I and VII, with a concurrent rearrangement of TM helices VII and VIII at the site of G recruitment. Gs signalling is also more sensitive to mutation of TA or binding site residues than Gq. Our work advances the understanding of aGPCR TA activation in molecular detail, identifying structural features that potentially explain preferential signal modulation.",

    "abstract": "Barriers to reproduction are often how progress in speciation is measured. Nonetheless, a key unresolved question is the extent to which reproductive barriers diminish gene flow in incipient species in nature. The Sierra Nevada foothill endemic Mimulus glaucescens and the widespread M. guttatus are considered to be distinct species based on contrasting vegetative traits, but barriers to reproduction are not readily apparent, although these species are not known to hybridize in nature. To explore boundaries between taxa, we examined 15 potential reproductive barriers between species in a Northern California area of broad sympatry. Most barriers, with the exception of ecogeographic isolation, were weak, and total isolation for each species was estimated to be incomplete. Population genomic analyses of range-wide and broadly sympatric accessions revealed that gene flow between these taxa is common across the range, and rampant within areas of sympatry. Thus, despite fairly strong ecological differentiation - which may be involved in maintenance of vegetative differences - ecological isolation is a weak barrier to gene flow in this system. This work underscores the value of combining classical measures of reproductive isolation with estimates of natural gene flow for studies of speciation in natural communities.",

    "abstract": "Pseudokinases, so named because they lack one or more conserved canonical amino acids that define their catalytically-active relatives, have evolved a variety of biological functions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Human PSKH2 is closely related to the canonical kinase PSKH1, which maps to the CAMK family of protein kinases. Primates encode PSKH2 in the form of a pseudokinase, which is predicted to be catalytically inactive due to loss of the invariant catalytic Asp residue. Although the biological role(s) of vertebrate PSKH2s remains unclear, we previously identified species-level adaptions in PSKH2 that have led to the appearance of kinase or pseudokinase variants in vertebrate genomes alongside a canonical PSKH1 paralog. In this paper we confirm that, as predicted, PSKH2 lacks detectable protein phosphotransferase activity, and exploit structural informatics, biochemistry and cellular proteomics to begin to characterise vertebrate PSKH2 orthologues. AlphaFold 2-based structural analysis predicts functional roles for both the PSKH2 N- and C-regions that flank the pseudokinase domain core, and cellular truncation analysis confirms that the N-terminal domain, which contains a conserved myristoylation site, is required for both stable human PSKH2 expression and localisation to a membrane-rich subcellular fraction containing mitochondrial proteins. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we confirm that human PSKH2 is part of a cellular mitochondrial protein network, and that its expression is regulated through client-status within the HSP90/Cdc37 molecular chaperone system. HSP90 interactions are mediated through binding to the PSKH2 C-terminal tail, leading us to predict that this region might act as both a cis and trans regulatory element, driving outputs linked to the PSKH2 pseudokinase domain that are important for functional signalling.",

    "abstract": "The first mitotic division of the initial cell is a key event in all multicellular organisms and is usually concomitant with the establishment of major developmental axes and cell fates. The brown alga Ectocarpus has a haploid-diploid life cycle that involves the development of two multicellular and independent generations, the sporophyte and the gametophyte. Each generation deploys a distinct developmental program autonomously from an initial cell, whose first cell division sets up the future body pattern. Here, we show that mutations in the BASELESS (BAS) gene result in multiple cellular defects during the first division of the initial cell and subsequently failure to produce basal structures (rhizoids and prostrate filaments) during both generations of the life cycle. Cloning-by-sequencing revealed that BAS encodes a type B\" regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, and transcriptomic analysis of early developmental stages uncovered potential effector genes involved in setting up basal cell fate in this organism. The bas mutant phenotype is very similar to that observed in the distag (dis) mutants, which lack a functional TBCCd1 protein, at both the cellular and morphological levels. The high level of similarity of the dis and bas mutant phenotypes indicate that TBCCd1 and PP2A are two critical components of the cellular machinery that regulates the division of the initial cell and mediates the establishment of basal cell fate in the developing thallus.",

This approach allows rapidly assessing sgRNA design for plant genome targeting, as well as the recovery of progeny with heritable mutations at targeted loci.\n\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Uranga et al.1 and Aragones et al.2.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=195 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/507055v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a214corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d008d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f3b476org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ccc792_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Plants sense and respond to environmental cues during 24 h fluctuations in their environment. This requires the integration of internal cues such as circadian timing with environmental cues such as light and temperature to elicit cellular responses through signal transduction. The integration and transduction of circadian and environmental signals within plants growing in natural environments remain poorly understood. To gain insights into the 24 h dynamics of environmental signalling in nature, we performed a field study of cell signalling in a natural population of Arabidopsis halleri. As a representative model signalling pathway, we exploited the transduction of circadian and environmental signals from the nucleus to chloroplasts, by a sigma factor, to study diel cycles of environmental signalling under natural conditions. Using dynamic linear models to interpret the data, we identified that circadian regulation and temperature are key regulators of this pathway under natural conditions. We identified potential time-delay steps between pathway components, and diel fluctuations in the response of the pathway to temperature cues that are reminiscent of the process of circadian gating. This approach allowed us to identify dynamic integration and transduction of environmental cues, in the cells of plants, under naturally fluctuating diel cycles.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoids are vital photosynthetic pigments for plants and provide essential nutrients for humans. However, our knowledge of the regulatory control of carotenoid biosynthesis remains limited. Golden2-like transcription factors (GLKs) are widely recognized as essential and conserved factors for chloroplast development and the major regulators of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Yet the molecular mechanisms by which GLKs transcriptionally activate their target genes are unclear. Here, we report that GLKs directly regulate carotenoid biosynthesis in a G-box Binding Factor (GBF)-dependent manner. Both in vitro and in vivo studies reveal that GLKs physically interact with GBFs. Through the direct binding of GBFs to the G-box motif, the GLK-GBF regulatory module transcriptionally activates phytoene synthase (PSY), the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for carotenoid biosynthesis. The ability of GLKs to promote carotenoid and chlorophyll biosynthesis is greatly diminished in the Arabidopsis gbf1/2/3 triple knockout mutants, showing the requirement of GBFs for GLK function. GLKs and GBFs form liquid-liquid phase separation-mediated nuclear condensates as the compartmented and concentrated transcriptional complexes. Our findings uncover a novel and conserved regulatory module for photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis through formation of GLK-GBF transcriptional complexes and nuclear biomolecular condensates in plants.\n\nOne-sentence summaryGLKs transcriptionally regulate photosynthetic pigment synthesis in a GBF-dependent manner and are associated with the formation of phase separation-mediated nuclear condensates.",

    "abstract": "The conversion of supplemental greenhouse light energy into biomass is not always optimal. Recent trends in global energy prices and discussions on climate change highlight the need to reduce our energy footprint associated with the use of supplemental light in greenhouse crop production. This can be achieved by implementing \"smart\" lighting regimens which in turn rely on a good understanding of how fluctuating light influences photosynthetic physiology.\n\nHere, a simple fit-for-purpose dynamic model is presented. It accurately predicts net leaf photosynthesis under natural fluctuating light. It comprises two ordinary differential equations predicting: 1) the total stomatal conductance to CO2 diffusion and 2) the CO2 concentration inside a leaf. It contains elements of the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model and the successful incorporation of this model suggests that for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), it is sufficient to assume that Rubisco remains activated despite rapid fluctuations in irradiance. Furthermore, predictions of the net photosynthetic rate under both 400ppm and enriched 800ppm ambient CO2 concentrations indicate a strong correlation between the dynamic rate of photosynthesis and the rate of electron transport. Finally, we are able to indicate whether dynamic photosynthesis is Rubisco or electron transport rate limited.\n\nAuthor summaryThe cultivation of greenhouse crops under optimised conditions will become increasingly important, with supplemental lighting playing a vital role. However, converting light energy into plant photosynthesis is not always optimal. A potential venue that may lead to the efficient conversion of light energy involves a model-based implementation of \"smart\" lighting control strategy. This approach does however necessitate a good understanding of how plants harness light energy under natural fluctuating irradiance. Accordingly, as a first step, we have developed a small leaf-level model that predicts dynamic photosynthesis in natural fluctuating light. It may potentially be used in future supplemental light control applications.",

    "abstract": "Cold injury limits distribution of perennial agricultural crops, though replacement of plants and other management practices may allow for some damage tolerance. However, winter damage to crops such as grapevines (Vitis spp.) can result in losses in yield the following year if buds are damaged, but over many years when vines must be replaced and reach maturity before fruiting. Despite risks, grapevines are cultivated at the edge of permissible climate and rely on cold hardiness monitoring programs to determine when cold damage mitigation and management practices are required. These monitoring programs represent a critical, but laborious process for tracking cold hardiness. To reduce the need for continuous monitoring, a model (WAUS.2) using cold hardiness data collected over many years from Washington state, USA, growers was published in 2014. Although the WAUS.2 model works well regionally, it underperforms in other regions. Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop a new model (NYUS.1) that incorporates recent knowledge of cold hardiness dynamics for better prediction outcomes. Cold hardiness data from V. labruscana  Concord, and V. vinifera  Cabernet Sauvignon and  Riesling from Geneva, NY, USA were used. Data were separated in calibration (~2/3) and validation (~1/3) datasets. The proposed model uses three functions to describe acclimation, and two functions to describe deacclimation, with a total of nine optimized parameters. A shared chill response between acclimation and deacclimation provides a phased integration where acclimation responses decrease over the course of winter and are overcome by deacclimation. The NYUS.1 model outperforms the WAUS.2 model, reducing RMSE by up to 37% depending on cultivar. The NYUS.1 model also tends to be more conservative in its prediction, slightly underpredicting cold hardiness, as opposed to the overprediction from the WAUS.2 model. Some optimized parameters were shared between cultivars, suggesting conserved physiology was captured by the new model.\n\nHighlights- Multi-year cold hardiness data from three grapevine cultivars were used for modeling\n- Cold hardiness was modeled based on daily temperature and accumulated chill\n- Phased acclimation and deacclimation processes result in cold hardiness predictions\n- The new model was compared to the currently available model for grapevines\n- The model proposed here outperforms the currently available model",

    "abstract": "Morphological studies were carried out on collections of Andropogon gayanus-Andropogon tectorum complex from Southwestern Nigeria. This is with the view to providing full characterization of the accession of the two species of Andropogon and elucidating their population dynamics.\n\nMorphological data from selected accessions of A. gayanus and A. tectorum from different parts of Southwestern Nigeria were collected and characterized using an adaptation of the Descriptors for Wild and Cultivated Rice (Oryza spp), Biodiversity International. Preliminary morphological description of the accessions were carried out at the point of collection. Garden populations were raised from the vegetative parts of some accessions and maintained in Botanical Garden of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. The data obtained were subjected to inferential tests and Duncans multiple range test.\n\nThe results revealed a distinct distribution pattern of the two species of Andropogon in the area of study which suggests a south-ward migration of Andropogon gayanus, that is from the northern vegetational zones of Nigeria to the southern ecological zones. The migration of A. gayanus around Igbeti with occasional occurrence of A. tectorum along the roadsides without any distinct phenotypic hybrid, and Budo-Ode in Oyo State is established as the southern limit of the spread of A. gayanus. This migration of A. gayanus to the South is not an invasion but a slow process. There was no A. gayanus encountered in Osun, Ondo, Ekiti and Ogun States. Andropogon gayanus and Andropogon tectorum do not only emerge from the rootstocks rapidly but can also produce independent propagules by rooting at some nodes. The plants can spread by means of these propagules even if it does not produce sexual or apomictic seeds. This potential for vegetative propagation in addition to the perennial habit confer considerable advantage for colonization by the Andropogon gayanus-Andropogon tectorum complex.",

    "abstract": "Anti-thymocyte/lymphocyte globulins (ATGs/ALGs) are immunosuppressive drugs used in induction therapies to prevent acute rejection in solid organ transplantation. Because of animal origin, ATGs/ALGs contain highly immunogenic carbohydrate xenoantigens eliciting antibodies that are associated with subclinical inflammatory events possibly impacting long-term graft survival. Their strong and long-lasting lymphodepleting activity also increases the risk for infections. To circumvent these drawbacks, LIS1 has been engineered as a glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody obtained by immunizing genetically modified pigs knocked out for major xeno-antigens Gal and Neu5Gc. It is Fc-silenced in humans and differs from other ATGs/ALGs by its mechanism of action excluding antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and being restricted to complement and phagocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, apoptosis and antigen masking, resulting in profound inhibition of T-cell alloreactivity in mixed-leucocyte-reactions. Preclinical evaluation in macaques showed that LIS1 impacted CD4+, CD8+ effector T cells but not T-reg, B cells or myeloid cells. Compared with rabbit ATG, LIS1 induced transient depletion of target T cells in the peripheral blood but was equivalent in preventing allograft rejection in a skin allograft model. The novel therapeutic modality of LIS1 might present advantages in induction treatment after organ transplantation by shortening the T-cell depletion period while maintaining adequate immunosuppression and reducing immunogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Reliable and high-throughput genotyping platforms are of immense importance for identifying and dissecting genomic regions controlling important phenotypes, supporting selection processes in breeding programmes, and managing wild populations and germplasm collections. Amongst available genotyping tools, SNP arrays have been shown to be comparatively easy to use and generate highly accurate genotypic data. Single species arrays are the most commonly used type so far; however, some multi-species arrays have been developed for closely related species that share SNP markers, exploiting inter-species cross-amplification. In this study, the suitability of a multiplexed plant-animal SNP array, including both closely and distantly related species, was explored. The performance of the SNP array across species for diverse applications, ranging from intra-species diversity assessments to parentage analysis, was assessed. Moreover, the value of genotyping pooled DNA of distantly related species on the SNP array as a technique to further reduce costs was evaluated. SNP performance was generally high, and species-specific SNPs proved suitable for diverse applications. The multi-species SNP-array approach reported here could be transferred to other species to achieve cost savings resulting from the increased throughput when several projects use the same array, and the pooling technique adds another highly promising advancement to additionally decrease genotyping costs by half.",

    "abstract": "Activated sludge (AS) of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is one of the worlds largest artificial microbial ecosystems and the microbial community of the AS system is closely related to WWTP performance. However, how to predict its community structure is still unclear. Here, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the microbial compositions of AS systems collected from WWTPs located worldwide. We demonstrated that the microbial compositions of AS systems are predictable using our approach. The predictive accuracy R21:1 of Shannon-Wiener index reached 60.42%, and the average R21:1 of ASVs appearing in at least 10% of samples (ASVs>10%) and core taxa were 35.09% and 42.99%, respectively. We also found that the predictability of ASVs>10% was significantly positively correlated with their relative abundance and occurrence frequency, but significantly negatively correlated with potential migration rate. The typical functional groups such as nitrifiers, denitrifiers, polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) and glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs), and filamentous organisms in AS systems could also be well recovered using an ANN model, with the R21:1 ranging from 32.62% to 56.81%. Furthermore, we found that industry wastewater source (IndConInf) had good predictive abilities, although its correlation with ASVs>10% in the Mantel test analysis was weak, which suggested important factors that cannot be identified using traditional methods may be highlight by the ANN model. Our results provide a better understanding of the factors affecting AS communities through the prediction of the microbial community of AS systems, which could lead to insights for improved operating parameters and control of community structure.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionDance-based therapies are an emerging form of movement therapy aiming to improve motor and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairments (MCIs). Despite promising effects of dance-based therapies on function, it remains unclear how age-related declines in motor and cognitive function affect movement capacity and influence which movements and rhythms maximize dance therapy efficacy. Here, we evaluated the effects of age and MCI on the ability to accurately modulate spatial (i.e., joint kinematics), temporal (i.e., step timing), and spatiotemporal features of gait to achieve spatial and temporal targets during walking.\n\nMethodsWe developed novel rhythmic movement sequences - nine spatial, nine temporal, and four spatiotemporal - that deviated from typical spatial and temporal features of walking. Healthy young adults (HYA), healthy older adults (HOA), and adults with MCI were trained on each gait modification before performing the modification overground, with kinematic data recorded using wearable sensors.\n\nResultsHOA performed spatial (p = 0.010) and spatiotemporal (p = 0.048) gait modifications less accurately than HYA. Individuals with MCI performed spatiotemporal gait modifications less accurately than HOA (p = 0.017). Spatial modifications to the swing phase of gait (p = 0.006, Cohens d = -1.3), and four- and six-step Duple rhythms during temporal modifications (p < 0.030, Cohens d > 0.9) elicited the largest differences in gait performance in HYA vs. HOA and HOA vs. MCI, respectively.\n\nDiscussionThese findings suggest that age-related declines in strength and balance reduce the ability to accurately modulate spatial gait features, while declines in working memory in individuals with MCI may reduce the ability to perform longer temporal gait modification sequences.\n\nDifferences in rhythmic movement sequence performance highlight motor and cognitive factors potentially underlying deficits in gait modulation capacity, which may guide therapy personalization and provide more sensitive indices to track intervention efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Genomics analyses often use a large sequence collection as a reference, like a pangenome or taxonomic database. We previously described SPUMONI, which performs binary classification of nanopore reads using pangenomic matching statistics. Here we describe SPUMONI 2, an improved version that is faster, more memory efficient, works effectively for both short and long reads, and can solve multi-class classification problems with the aid of a novel sampled document array structure. By incorporating minimizers, SPUMONI 2 reduces index size by a factor of 2 compared to SPUMONI, yielding an index more than 65 times smaller than minimap2s for a mock community pangenome. SPUMONI 2 also achieves a speed improvement of 3-fold compared to SPUMONI and 15-fold compared to minimap2. We show SPUMONI 2 achieves an advantageous mix of accuracy and efficiency for short and long reads, including in an adaptive sampling scenario. We further demonstrate that SPUMONI 2 can detect contaminated contigs in genome assemblies, and can perform multi-class metagenomic read classification.",

    "abstract": "The cancer driver genes are involved in transforming healthy cells into cancerous cells. The molecular aberrations which lead to cancer involve gain and loss of function mutations in various cancer driver genes. Here, we examine the genome sequences of 20,066 primary tumours representing 43 distinct human cancers to identify and catalogue driver mutations in 729 known cancer genes. We show that the frequency of driver mutations in these genes varies significantly between cancer types. We find that the class of cancer driver genes most frequently mutated are the tumour suppressor genes (94%), followed by oncogenes (93%), transcription factors (72%), kinases (64%), cell surface receptors (63%), and phosphatases (22%). Furthermore, we identify the subset of these genes within which mutations exhibit a co-occurrence or mutually exclusive pattern. Interestingly, we find that patients with tumours with different combinations of driver gene mutation patterns tend to exhibit variable survival outcomes. Here, among the well-studied cancer genes, we showed that patients with tumours with KRAS and TP53 mutations are associated with the worst disease outcomes, and those with PI3KCA and BRAF mutations are associated with favourable survival outcomes. Besides providing new insights into cancer driver mutations, we unearth mutation patterns associated with disease outcomes and various hallmarks of cancer that bring us closer to fully understanding various forms of cancer.",

    "abstract": "During zygotic mitosis, forces generated at the cell cortex are required for the separation and migration of paternally provided centrosomes, pronuclear migration, proper segregation of genetic material, and successful cell division. Identification of individual cortical force generating units in vivo is necessary to study the regulation of microtubule dependent force generation throughout the cell cycle, to further understanding of asymmetric cell division, and to identify the molecular mechanism of force generation. Here we present a method to determine both the location and relative number of microtubule dependent cortical force generating units using single molecule imaging of fluorescently labelled dynein. Dynein behavior is modeled to differentiate and categorize trajectories that correspond to that which is cortically bound and interacting with a microtubule, and is cortically bound and not interacting with a microtubule. The categorization strategy recapitulates well known force asymmetries in the first mitosis of the C. elegans embryo. To evaluate the robustness of categorization, we RNAi depleted the microtubule subunit TBA-2 resulting in reduction of the number of trajectories categorized as engaged with a microtubule. This technique will be a valuable tool to provide new insight to the molecular mechanisms of dynein cortical force generation and its regulation as well as other instances wherein anchored motors interact with biopolymers (eg. Actin, tubulin, DNA).",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic forces play an important role in vascular network development and homeostasis. In physiological condition, shear stress generated by laminar flow promotes endothelial cells (EC) health and induces their alignment in the direction of flow. In contrast, altered hemodynamic forces induce endothelial dysfunction and lead to the development of vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and aneurysms. Following mechano-sensor activation, Rho protein-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement is one of the first steps in transforming flow-induced forces into intracellular signals in EC via guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) that mediate the spatio-temporal activation of these Rho proteins. Here we identified ARHGEF18 as a flow-sensitive RhoGEF specifically activating RhoA. Both ARHGEF18 expression and activity were controlled by shear stress level. ARHGEF18 promotes EC adhesion, focal adhesion formation and migration. ARHGEF18 localized to the tight junction by interacting with ZO-1 and participated to shear stress-induced EC elongation and alignment via its nucleotide exchange activity and the activation of p38 MAPK. Our study therefore characterized ARHGEF18 as the first flow-sensitive RhoA GEF in ECs, whose activity is essential for the maintenance of intercellular junctions and a properly organized endothelial monolayer under physiological flow conditions.",

    "abstract": "Although DNA amplifications in cancers frequently harbor passenger genes alongside oncogenes, the functional consequence of such co-amplifications and their impact for therapy remains ill-defined. We discovered that passenger co-amplifications can create amplicon structure-specific collateral vulnerabilities. We present the DEAD-box helicase 1 (DDX1) gene as a bona fide passenger co-amplified with MYCN in cancers. Survival of cancer cells with DDX1 co-amplifications strongly depends on the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Mechanistically, aberrant DDX1 expression inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle through a previously unrecognized interaction with dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase, a component of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Cells expressing aberrant DDX1 levels compensate for the metabolic shift by enhancing mTORC1 activity. Consequently, pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition triggered cell death specifically in cells harboring the DDX1 co-amplification. This work highlights a significant contribution of passenger gene alterations to the therapeutic susceptibility of cancers.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=130 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/506647v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58b27dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12e2fccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1440f33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@141e933_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, there is no 3D registration tool easily accessible for experimental biologists. Here we developed an ImageJ-based tool which achieves 3D registration accompanying both quantitative evaluation of the accuracy and reconstruction of 3D rotated images. In this tool, several landmarks are manually provided in two images to be aligned, and 3D rotation is computed so that the distances between the paired landmarks from the two images are minimized. By simultaneously providing multiple points (e.g. all nuclei in the regions of interest) other than the landmarks in the two images, the correspondence of each point between the two images is quantitatively explored: a certain nucleus in one image corresponds to which nucleus in another image. Furthermore, the 3D rotation is applied to one of the two images, resulting in reconstruction of 3D rotated images. We demonstrated that this tool successfully achieved 3D registration and reconstruction of images in mouse pre-implantation embryos, where one image was obtained during live imaging and another image from fixed embryos after live imaging. This approach provides a versatile tool applicable for various tissues and species.",

    "abstract": "Co2+ induces the increase of the labile-Fe pool (LIP) by Fe-S cluster damage, heme synthesis inhibition and \"free\" iron import, which affects cell viability. The N2-fixing bacteria, Sinorhizobium meliloti, is a suitable model to determine the roles of Co2+-transporting Cation diffusion facilitator exporters (Co-eCDF) in Fe2+ homeostasis because it has a putative member of this sub-family, AitP, and two specific Fe2+-export systems. An insertional mutant of AitP showed Co2+ sensitivity and accumulation, Fe accumulation and hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, but not Fe2+ sensitivity, despite AitP being a bona fide low affinity Fe2+ exporter as demonstrated by the kinetic analyses of Fe2+ uptake into everted membrane vesicles. Suggesting concomitant Fe2+-dependent induced stress, Co2+ sensitivity was increased in strains carrying mutations in AitP and Fe2+ exporters which did not correlate with the Co2+ accumulation. Growth in the presence of sub-lethal Fe2+ and Co2+ concentrations suggested that free Fe-import might contribute to Co2+ toxicity. Supporting this, Co2+ induced transcription of Fe-import system and genes associated with Fe homeostasis. Analyses of total protoporphyrin content indicates Fe-S cluster attack as the major source for LIP. AitP-mediated Fe2+-export is likely counterbalanced via a non-futile Fe2+-import pathway. Two lines of evidence support this: i) an increased hemin uptake in presence of Co2+ was observed in WT vs. AitP mutant, and ii) hemin reversed the Co2+ sensitivity in the AitP mutant. Thus, the simultaneous detoxification mediated by AitP aids cells to orchestrate an Fe-S cluster salvage response, avoiding the increase in the LIP caused by the disassembly of Fe-S clusters or free iron uptake.\n\nImportanceCross-talk between iron and cobalt has been long recognized in biological systems. This is due to the capacity of cobalt to interfere with proper iron utilization. Cells can detoxify cobalt by exporting mechanisms involving membrane proteins known as exporters. Highlighting the cross-talk, the capacity of several cobalt exporters to also export iron is emerging. Although biologically less important than Fe2+, Co2+ induces toxicity by promoting intracellular Fe release, which ultimately causes additional toxic effects. In this work, we describe how the N2-fixating rhizobial cells solve this perturbation by clearing Fe through a Co2+-exporter, in order to reestablish intracellular Fe-levels by importing non-free Fe, heme. This piggyback-ride type of transport may aid bacterial cells to survive in free-living conditions where high anthropogenic Co2+ content may be encountered.",

    "abstract": "Tissue health is regulated by a myriad of exogenous or endogenous factors. Here we investigated the role of the conserved Kynurenine pathway (KP) in maintaining retinal homeostasis in the context of light stress in Drosophila melanogaster. cinnabar, cardinal and, scarlet, are fly genes that encode different steps in the KP. Along with white, these genes are known regulators of brown pigment (ommochrome) biosynthesis. Using white as a sensitized genetic background, we showed that mutations in cinnabar, cardinal, and scarlet differentially modulate light-induced retinal damage. Mass Spectrometric measurements of KP metabolites in flies with different genetic combinations support the notion that increased levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OH-K) and Xanthurenic acid (XA) enhance retinal damage, whereas Kynurenic Acid (KYNA) and Kynurenine (K) are neuro-protective. This conclusion was corroborated by showing that feeding 3OH-K results in enhanced retinal damage, whereas feeding KYNA protects the retina in sensitized genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, the harmful effects of free 3OH-K are diminished by its sub-cellular compartmentalization within the cell. Sequestering of 3OH-K enables the quenching of its toxicity through conversion to brown pigment or conjugation to proteins. This work enabled us to decouple the role of these KP genes in ommochrome formation from their role in retinal homeostasis. Additionally, it puts forward new hypotheses on the importance of the balance of KP metabolites and their compartmentalization in disease alleviation.",

Results have shown that out of 16,507 samples that have no detailed biome annotations, 96.65% could be correctly classified, largely solving the missing biome labeling problem.

While some lincRNAs have been characterized as important regulators in different biological processes, little is known about the transcriptional regulation for most plant lincRNAs. Through the integration of eight annotation resources, we defined 6,599 high-confidence lincRNA loci in Arabidopsis thaliana. For lincRNAs belonging to different evolutionary age categories, we identified major differences in sequence and chromatin features, as well as in the level of conservation and purifying selection acting during evolution. Spatiotemporal gene expression profiles combined with transcription factor (TF) chromatin immunoprecipitation data were used to construct a TF- lincRNA regulatory network containing 2,659 lincRNAs and 15,686 interactions. We found that properties characterizing lincRNA expression, conservation and regulation differ between plants and animals. Experimental validation confirmed the role of three TFs, KAN1, MYB44, and PIF4, as key regulators controlling root- specific lincRNA expression, demonstrating the predictive power of our network. Furthermore, we identified 58 lincRNAs, regulated by these TFs, showing strong root cell-type specific expression or chromatin accessibility, which are linked with GWAS genetic associations related to root system development and growth. The multi-level genome-wide characterization covering chromatin state information, promoter conservation, and ChIP-based TF binding, for all detectable lincRNAs across 769 expression samples, permits to rapidly define the biological context and relevance of lincRNAs in Arabidopsis regulatory networks.\n\nOne-line sentenceA multi-level Arabidopsis gene regulatory network identifies novel regulators controlling root-specific lincRNA expression, offering a promising strategy to identify lincRNAs involved in plant biology.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate that primate-specific Camk2{beta} alternative splicing is achieved through branch point weakening during evolution. We show that reducing branch point and splice site strengths during evolution globally renders constitutive exons alternative, thus providing a paradigm for cis-directed species-specific alternative splicing regulation. Using CRISPR/Cas9 we introduced a weaker human branch point into the mouse genome, resulting in human-like CAMK2B splicing in the brain of mutant mice.

Previous studies have identified conformational dynamics of Cas9 as a key regulatory element for its enzymatic activity. The molecular basis for how conformations influence the catalytic processes at both nuclease domains, however, remains elusive. Here we present well-resolved cryo-EM structures of the active Acidothermus cellulolyticus Cas9 (AceCas9) complexes representing pre-cleavage (2.9 [A]), two reaction intermediate (2.2 [A] and 2.4 [A]) and two post-cleavage (2.6 [A] and 2.7 [A]) states that reveal active site rearrangement during DNA binding and phosphodiester bond breakage by Cas9. Strikingly, large domain rearrangements in Cas9 triggered by the cognate DNA result in subtle changes in active sites that facilitate coordination of metal ions required for catalysis. The two reaction intermediate structures further reveal small oscillations in domain conformations, which alternates the reactive states of the two catalytic centers, thereby coupling cleavage of the two DNA strands. Consistent with the roles of conformations in organizing the active sites, adjustments of metal coordination ligands lead to altered metal specificity.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional pausing underpins regulation of cellular RNA synthesis but its mechanism remains incompletely understood. Sequence-specific interactions of DNA and RNA with the dynamic, multidomain RNA polymerase (RNAP) trigger reversible conformational changes at pause sites that temporarily interrupt the nucleotide addition cycle. These interactions initially rearrange the elongation complex (EC) into an elemental paused EC (ePEC). ePECs can form longer-lived PECs by further rearrangements or interactions of diffusible regulators. For both bacterial and mammalian RNAPs, a half-translocated state in which the next DNA template base fails to load into the active site appears central to the ePEC. Some RNAPs also swivel interconnected modules that may stabilize the ePEC. However, it is unclear if swiveling and half-translocation are requisite features of a single ePEC state or if multiple ePEC states exist. Here we use cryo-EM analysis of ePECs with different RNA-DNA sequences combined with biochemical probes of ePEC structure to define an interconverting ensemble of ePEC states. ePECs occupy either pre- or half-translocated states but do not always swivel, indicating that difficulty in forming the post-translocated state at certain RNA-DNA sequences may be the essence of the ePEC. The existence of multiple ePEC conformations has broad implications for transcriptional regulation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCETranscriptional pausing provides a hub for gene regulation. Pausing provides a timing mechanism to coordinate regulatory interactions, co-transcriptional RNA folding and protein synthesis, and stop signals for transcriptional termination. Cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are complex, with multiple mobile modules shifting positions to control its catalytic activity and pause RNAP in response to DNA-encoded pause signals. Understanding how these modules move to enable pausing is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation. Our results clarify the picture significantly by defining multiple states among which paused RNAP partitions in response to different pause signals. This work contributes to an emerging theme wherein multiple interconverting states of the RNAP proceed through a pathway (e.g., initiation or pausing), providing multiple opportunities for regulation.",

    "abstract": "The organization of cortical microtubule arrays play an important role in the development of plant cells. Until recently, the direct mechanical influence of cell geometry on the constrained microtubule (MT) trajectories have been largely ignored in computational models. Modelling MTs as thin elastic rods constrained on a surface, a previous study examined the deflection of MTs using a fixed number of segments and uniform segment lengths between MT anchors. It is known that the resulting MT curves converge to geodesics as the anchor spacing approaches zero. In the case of long MTs on a cylinder, buckling was found for transverse trajectories. There is a clear interplay between two factors in the problem of deflection: curvature of the membrane and the lengths of MT segments. We examine the latter in detail, in the backdrop of a circular cylinder. In reality, the number of segments are not predetermined and their lengths are not uniform. We present a minimal, realistic model treating the anchor spacing as a stochastic process and examine the net effect on deflection. We find that, by tuning the ratio of growth speed to anchoring rate, it is possible to mitigate MT deflection and even prevent buckling for lengths significantly larger than the previously derived critical buckling length. We suggest that this mediation of deflection by anchoring might provide cells with a means of preventing arrays from deflecting away from the transverse orientation.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are complex and dynamic entities, and their structure arises from the interplay of a multitude of factors, including the interactions of microorganisms with each other and with the environment. Since each extant community has a unique eco-evolutionary history, it might appear that contingency rather than general rules govern their assembly. In spite of this, there is evidence that some general assembly principles exist, at least to a certain extent. In this work, we sought to identify those principles by performing a cross-study, cross-biome meta-analysis of microbial occurrence data in more than 5,000 samples from ten different environmental groups. We adopted a novel algorithm that allows the same taxa to aggregate with different partners in different habitats, capturing the complexity of interactions inherent to natural microbial communities. We tried to decouple function from phylogeny, the environment, and genome size, in order to provide an unbiased characterization of phylogenetic and functional redundancy in environmental microbial assemblages. We then examined the phylogenetic and functional composition of the resulting inferred communities, and searched for global patterns of assembly both at the community level and in individual metabolic pathways.\n\nOur analysis of the resulting microbial assemblages highlighted that environmental communities are more functionally redundant than expected by chance. This effect is greater for communities appearing in more than one environment, suggesting a link between functional redundancy and environmental adaptation. In spite of this, certain pathways are observed in fewer taxa than expected by chance, suggesting the presence of auxotrophy, and presumably cooperation among community members, which is supported by our analysis of amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, this hypothetical cooperation may play a role in genome reduction, since we observed a negative relationship between the size of bacterial genomes and the number of taxa of the community they belong to.\n\nOverall, our results provide a global characterization of environmental microbial communities, and offer design principles for engineering robust bacterial communities.",

Treatment with PEGSerp-1 in two distinct mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 models in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice reduced lung and heart inflammation, with improved clinical outcomes. PEGSerp-1 significantly reduced M1 macrophage invasion in the lung and heart by modifying urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and complement membrane attack complex (MAC). Sequential changes in urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and serpin gene expression were observed in lung and heart with PEGSerp-1 treatment.

Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the virulence mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and the host response to develop therapeutic agents. Here, we show host Neu1 regulates coronavirus replication by controlling sialylation on coronavirus nucleocapsid protein. Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins in COVID-19 patients and in coronavirus HCoV-OC43-infected cells were heavily sialylated; this sialylation controlled the RNA binding activity and replication of coronavirus. Neu1 overexpression increased HCoV-OC43 replication, whereas Neu1 knockdown reduced HCoV-OC43 replication. Moreover, a newly developed Neu1 inhibitor, Neu5Ac2en-OAcOMe, selectively targeted intracellular sialidase, which dramatically reduced HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and rescued mice from HCoV-OC43 infection-induced death. Our findings suggest that Neu1 inhibitors could be used to limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in patients with COVID-19, making Neu1 a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and future coronavirus pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium parasites caused 241 million cases of malaria and over 600,000 deaths in 2020. Both P. falciparum and P. ovale are endemic to Mali and cause malaria illness, with P. falciparum infections typically being more severe. Here, we sequenced RNA from nine pediatric blood samples collected during uncomplicated, symptomatic infections with either P. falciparum or P. ovale and characterized the host and parasite gene expression profiles. We found that human gene expression varies more between individuals than according to the parasite species causing the infection, while parasite gene expression profiles cluster by species. Additionally, we characterized DNA polymorphisms of the parasites directly from the RNA-seq reads and found comparable levels of genetic diversity in both species despite dramatic differences in prevalence. Our results provide unique insights into host-pathogen interactions during malaria infections and their variations according to the infecting Plasmodium species, which will be critical to develop better elimination strategies against all human Plasmodium parasites.\n\nAuthor SummaryMultiple species of Plasmodium parasites can cause human malaria. Most studies and elimination efforts target P. falciparum, the most common cause of malaria worldwide and the species responsible for the vast majority of the mortality. Other Plasmodium species, such as P. ovale, typically lead to less severe forms of the disease but little is known about the molecular mechanisms at play during malaria infections with different parasites. We analyzed host and parasite gene expression from children successively infected with P. ovale and P. falciparum and found that, while the parasite gene expression differed significantly, the transcriptional profiles of the host immune cells were similar in P. ovale or P. falciparum infections. This suggests that infected individuals respond to uncomplicated malaria infections similarly, regardless of the Plasmodium species causing the infection, and that alternative immune processes may become important during the progression to severe P. falciparum malaria (rather than being inherent features of P. falciparum infections). Additionally, we observed similar levels of genetic diversity among P. ovale and P. falciparum parasites, suggesting that the P. ovale population might be larger than currently thought, possibly due to extensive misdiagnosis or the existence of hidden reservoirs of parasites.",

    "abstract": "Photolyases (PLs) reverse UV-induced DNA damage using blue light as an energy source. Of these photolyases, (6-4) PLs repair (6-4)-lesioned photoproducts. We recently identified a gene from Vibrio cholerae (Vc) encoding a (6-4) PL, but structural characterization is needed to elucidate specific interactions with the chromophore cofactors. Here, we determined the crystal structure of Vc(6-4) PL at 2.5 [A] resolution. Our high-resolution structure revealed that the two well-known cofactors, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the photoantenna 6,7-dimethyl 8-ribityl-lumazin (DMRL), stably interact with an -helical and an /{beta} domain, respectively. Additionally, the structure has a third cofactor with distinct electron clouds corresponding to a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Moreover, we identified that Asp106 makes a hydrogen bond with the water and DMRL, which indicates further stabilization of the photoantenna DMRL within Vc(6-4) PL. Further analysis of the Vc(6-4) PL structure revealed a possible region responsible for DNA binding. The region located between residues 478-484 may bind the lesioned DNA, with Arg483 potentially forming a salt bridge with DNA to stabilize further the interaction of Vc(6-4) PL with its substrate. Our comparative analysis revealed that the DNA lesion could not bind to the Vc(6-4) PL in a similar fashion to the Drosophila melanogaster Dm(6-4) PL without a significant conformational change of the protein. The 23rd helix of the bacterial (6-4) PLs seems to have remarkable plasticity, and conformational changes facilitate DNA binding. In conclusion, our structure provides further insight into DNA repair by a (6-4) PL containing three cofactors.",

Here, through in vitro protein folding experiments, we discover that G4s can accelerate protein folding by rescuing kinetically trapped intermediates to both native and near-native folded states. Time-course folding experiments in E. coli further demonstrate that these G4s primarily improve protein folding quality in E. coli as opposed to preventing protein aggregation. The ability for a short nucleic acid to rescue protein folding opens up the possibility of nucleic acids and ATP-independent chaperones to play considerable roles in dictating the ultimate folding fate of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Cellular distributions of the sphingolipid ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) impact essential biological processes. C1P levels are spatiotemporally regulated by ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP), which efficiently shuttles C1P between organelle membranes. Yet, how CPTP rapidly extracts and inserts C1P into a membrane remains unknown. Here, we devise a multiscale simulation approach to elucidate biophysical details of CPTP-mediated C1P transport. We find that CPTP binds a membrane poised to extract and insert C1P and that membrane binding promotes conformational changes in CPTP that facilitate C1P uptake and release. By significantly disrupting a lipids local hydrophobic environment in the membrane, CPTP lowers the activation free energy barrier for passive C1P desorption and enhances C1P extraction from the membrane. Upon uptake of C1P, further conformational changes may aid membrane unbinding in a manner reminiscent of the electrostatic switching mechanism used by other lipid transfer proteins. Insertion of C1P into an acceptor membrane, eased by a decrease in membrane order by CPTP, restarts the transfer cycle. Most notably, we provide molecular evidence for CPTPs ability to catalyze C1P extraction by breaking hydrophobic C1P-membrane contacts with compensatory hydrophobic lipid-protein contacts. Our work, thus, provides biophysical insights into how CPTP efficiently traffics C1P between membranes to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis and, additionally, presents a simulation method aptly suited for uncovering the catalytic mechanisms of other lipid transfer proteins.\n\nAuthor summaryCritical cellular processes require spatiotemporal regulation of sphingolipid levels among organelle membranes. Programmed cell death and inflammation, for example, are impacted by the distribution of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). C1P levels are specifically altered by ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP), which mediates C1P intermembrane transport. Using a multiscale simulation approach tailored to studying lipid transport, we elucidate key steps in the molecular mechanism used by CPTP to rapidly transport C1P between membranes: Through conformational changes that are coupled to membrane binding, CPTP significantly disrupts C1Ps local hydrophobic environment in a membrane and catalyzes its extraction. Since this catalytic mechanism is biophysically related to that of passive lipid transport, it may be ubiquitously used by lipid transport proteins to rapidly traffic lipids between membranes and ensure membrane homeostasis. Our multiscale simulation approach offers a framework to test this hypothesis and, thus, further our molecular knowledge of how lipid transfer proteins function to regulate cellular lipid distributions.",

However, recent studies have shown that platinum drugs may also act on some important functional proteins in the human body and have complicate effects on their efficacy. E-cadherin is newly discovered glycoproteins which have been regarded as the important signs of the occurrence and development of some tumors. In this study, the interactions between cisplatin and E-cadherin were explored by fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that cisplatin can efficiently quench the fluorescence of E-cadherin, and the calculated binding constant Kb was 3.20x106 (25{degrees}C), 1.36 x106(31{degrees}C) and 8.22x105 L mol-1 (37{degrees}C). The thermodynamic parameters {Delta}H <0, {Delta}S <0, {Delta}G <0, reveal that the fluorescence quenching effect of cisplatin on E-cadherin is static quenching, which is dominated by hydrogen bond and van der Waals interaction. The AFM results revealed that there was a staggered interaction between the intermolecular domains of E-cadherin to form a long spherical chain structure. The addition of cisplatin could significantly affect the staggered effect of the E-cadherin molecules. All these results confirmed that there are strong interactions between cisplatin and cadherin.",

    "abstract": "Martini 3, the latest version of the widely used Martini force field for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, is a promising tool to investigate proteins in phospholipid bilayers. However, simulating other lipid environments, such as detergent micelles, presents challenges due to the absence of validated parameters for their constituent molecules. Here, we propose parameters for the micelle-forming surfactant, dodecylphosphocholine (DPC). These result in micelle assembly with aggregation numbers in agreement with experimental values. However, we identified a lack of hydrophobic interactions between transmembrane helix protein dimers and the tails of DPC molecules, preventing insertion and stabilization of the protein in the micelles. This problem was also observed for protein insertion by self-assembling 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. We propose the reduction of the non-bonded interactions between protein and water beads by 10% as a simple and effective solution to this problem that enables protein encapsulation in phospholipid micelles and bilayers without altering protein dimerization or bilayer structure.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=129 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/506752v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105d651org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@398758org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4c045org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afdc1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer recalcitrant to treatment, arising predominantly from epithelial pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells. Intra-tumor heterogeneity plays critical roles in SCLC disease progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. At least five transcriptional SCLC NE and non-NE cell subtypes were recently defined by gene expression signatures. Transition from NE to non-NE cell states and cooperation between subtypes within a tumor likely contribute to SCLC progression by mechanisms of adaptation to perturbations. Therefore, gene regulatory programs distinguishing SCLC subtypes or promoting transitions are of great interest. Here, we systematically analyze the relationship between SCLC NE/non-NE transition and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)--a well-studied cellular process contributing to cancer invasiveness and resistance--using multiple transcriptome datasets from SCLC mouse tumor models, human cancer cell lines and tumor samples. The NE SCLC-A2 subtype maps to the epithelial state. In contrast, SCLC-A and SCLC-N (NE) map to a mesenchymal state (M1) that is distinct from the non-NE mesenchymal state (M2). The correspondence between SCLC subtypes and the EMT program paves the way for further work to understand gene regulatory mechanisms of SCLC tumor plasticity with applicability to other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "A combined host biomarker and pathogen diagnosis provides insight into disease progression risk and contributes to appropriate clinical decision-making regarding prevention and treatment. In preventive veterinary medicine, such combined diagnosis could improve risk-based livestock herd management. We developed a single-well based test for combined diagnosis of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and bovine MHC (BoLA)-DRB3 alleles. A fourplex droplet digital PCR method targeting the BLV pol gene, BLV-susceptible DRB3*016:01 allele, resistant DRB3*009:02 allele, and housekeeping RPP30 gene (IPATS-BLV) successfully measured the percentage of BLV-infected cells and determined allele types precisely. Furthermore, it discriminated homozygous from heterozygous carriers. Using this method to determine the impact of carrying these alleles on the BLV proviral load (PVL), we found DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle could suppress the PVL to a low or undetectable level, even with the presence of a susceptible allele. Although the population of DRB3*016:01-carrying cattle showed significantly higher PVLs when compared with cattle carrying other alleles, their individual PVLs were highly variable. Because of the simplicity and speed of this single-well assay, IPATS could be a suitable platform for the combined diagnosis of host biomarkers and pathogens in a wide range of other systems.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. Plasmids are principal vectors of antimicrobial resistance genes, greatly contributing to their spread and mobility across hosts. Nevertheless little is known about the dynamics of plasmid genetic exchange across animal hosts. The cow rumen ecosystem is an excellent model system because it hosts diverse plasmid communities which interact and exchange genes. Here, we use theory and methodology from network and disease ecology to investigate the potential of gene transmission between plasmids using a data-set of 21 plasmidomes from a single dairy cow population. We constructed a multilayer network based on pairwise genetic similarity between plasmids serving as a signature for past genetic exchange to identify potential routes and mechanisms of gene transmission within and between cows. The transmission network was dominated by links between cows. Modularity analysis unraveled a major cross-cow transmission pathway with additional small pathways. Plasmid functions influenced network structure: plasmids containing mobility genes were more connected; those with the same AMR genes formed their own modules. We find signatures of gene superspreading in which a few plasmids and cows are responsible for most gene exchange. An agent-based transmission model showed that a new gene invading the cow population is likely to reach all cows. Finally, we showed that link weights contain a non-random signature for the mechanisms of gene transmission allowing us to differentiate between dispersal and genetic exchange. These results provide insights into the mechanisms by which genes, including those providing AMR, spread across animal hosts.",

    "abstract": "De novo designed peptides that self-assemble into cross-{beta} rich fibrillar biomaterials have been pursued as an innovative platform for the development of adjuvant- and inflammation-free vaccines. However, they share structural properties similar to amyloid species implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, which has been a long-standing concern for their translation. Here, we comprehensively characterize the amyloidogenic character of the amphipathic self-assembling cross-{beta} peptide KFE8, compared to pathological amyloid and amyloid-like proteins -synuclein (-syn) and TDP-43. Further, we developed plasmid-based DNA vaccines with the KFE8 backbone serving as a fibrillizing scaffold for delivery of a GFP model antigen. We find that expression of tandem repeats of KFE8 is non-toxic and can be efficiently cleared by autophagy. We also demonstrate that synthetic KFE8 nanofibers do not cross-seed amyloid formation of -syn in mammalian cells compared to -syn preformed fibrils. In mice, vaccination with plasmids encoding the KFE32-GFP fusion protein elicited robust immune responses, inducing production of significantly higher levels of anti-GFP antibodies compared to soluble GFP or -syn tagged GFP. Antigen-specific CD8+T cells were also detected in the spleens of vaccinated mice and cytokine profiles from antigen recall assays indicate a balanced Th1/Th2 response. These findings illustrate that cross-{beta}-rich peptide nanofibers have distinct properties from those of pathological amyloidogenic proteins, and are an attractive platform for the development of DNA vaccines with self-adjuvanting properties and improved safety profiles.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system which play a crucial role in recognizing and killing emerging tumor cells. However, as the tumor evolves, it develops mechanisms to inactivate NK cells or hide from them. Here, we engineered a modular nanoplatform that acts as NK cells (NK cell-mimics), carrying the tumor-recognition and death ligand-mediated tumor-killing properties of an NK cell, yet without being subject to tumor-mediated inactivation. In particular, NK cell mimic nanoparticles (NK.NPs) incorporate two key features of activated NK cells: cytotoxic activity via the death ligand, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and an adjustable tumor cell recognition feature based on functionalization with the NK cell Fc-binding receptor (CD16, FCGR3A) peptide, enabling the NK.NPs to bind antibodies targeting tumor antigens. NK.NPs showed potent in vitro cytotoxicity against a broad panel of cancer cell lines. Upon functionalizing the NK.NPs with daratumumab, a clinically used antibody specific for the CD38 protein expressed by AML cells, NK.NPs effectively targeted and eliminated patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and leukemia-initiating cells as well as CD38-positive AML cells in vivo, in a disseminated AML xenograft system. Specifically, NK.NPs lead to a significant reduction of AML burden in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood compared to non-targeted TRAIL-functionalized liposomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that NK.NPs are effective in mimicking NK cells antitumorigenic function and thereby underline their use as therapeutic tools.",
