    "abstract": "Cuticular hydrocarbons of some Dolichoderinae species from France and various places like Spain, North Africa, and Italy were studied. The Tapinoma nigerrimum group was particularly analyzed and replaced in the genus Tapinoma. All species were correctly discriminated and a new hydrocarbons profile was found in Spanish mountains in the T. nigerrimum group, which was provisionally named T. sp. Spain. We added numerous unknown spots for the distribution of these ants. We also tested aggression between some T. magnum colonies and it appeared that this species forms supercolonies like other invasive species, but does not form giant supercolonies like the Argentine ant",

    "abstract": "Most defects causing retinal degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are rod-specific mutations, but the subsequent degeneration of cones, which produces loss of daylight vision and high-acuity perception, is the most debilitating feature of the disease. To understand better why cones degenerate and how cone vision might be restored, we have made the first single-cell recordings of light responses from degenerating cones and retinal interneurons after most rods have died and cones have lost their outer-segment disk membranes and synaptic pedicles. We show that degenerating cones have functional cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and can continue to give light responses, apparently produced by opsin localized either to small areas of organized membrane near the ciliary axoneme or distributed throughout the inner segment. Light responses of second-order horizontal and bipolar cells are smaller and less sensitive but surprisingly similar to those of normal retina. Furthermore, retinal output as reflected in responses of ganglion cells is largely intact at cone-mediated light levels. Together, these findings show that cones and their retinal pathways can remain functional even as degeneration is progressing, an encouraging result for future research aimed at enhancing the light sensitivity of residual cones to restore vision in patients with genetically inherited retinal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that travelling waves are functionally relevant for cognitive operations in the brain. Several electroencephalography (EEG) studies report on a perceptual alpha-echo, representing the brain response to a random visual flicker, propagating as a travelling wave across the cortical surface. In this study, we ask if the propagating activity of the alpha-echo is best explained by a set of discrete sources mixing at the sensor level rather than a cortical travelling wave. To this end, we presented participants with gratings modulated by random noise and simultaneously acquired the ongoing MEG. The perceptual alpha-echo was estimated using the temporal response function linking the visual input to the brain response. At the group level, we observed a spatial decay of the amplitude of the alpha-echo with respect to the sensor where the alpha-echo was the largest. Importantly, the propagation latencies consistently increased with the distance. Interestingly, the propagation of the alpha-echoes was predominantly centro-lateral, while EEG studies reported mainly posterior-frontal propagation. Moreover, the propagation speed of the alpha-echoes derived from the MEG data was around 10 m/s, which is higher compared to the 2 m/s reported in EEG studies. Using source modelling, we found an early component in the primary visual cortex and a phase-lagged late component in the parietal cortex, which may underlie the travelling alpha-echoes at the sensor level. We then simulated the alpha-echoes using realistic EEG and MEG forward models by placing two sources in the parietal and occipital cortices in accordance with our empirical findings. The two-source model could account for both the direction and speed of the observed alpha-echoes in the EEG and MEG data. Our results demonstrate that the propagation of the perceptual echoes observed in EEG and MEG data can be explained by two sources mixing at the scalp level equally well as by a cortical travelling wave. This conclusion however does not put into question continuous travelling waves reported in intracranial recordings.",

    "abstract": "Endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling gates many aspects of the stress response, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is controlled by corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Disruption of eCB signalling increases drive to the HPA axis, but the mechanisms subserving this process are poorly understood. Using an array of cellular, endocrine and behavioral readouts associated with activation of CRH neurons in the PVN, we evaluated the contributions of tonic eCB signaling to the generation of a stress response. The CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist AM251, neutral antagonist NESS243, and NAPE PLD inhibitor LEI401 all uniformly increased c-fos in the PVN, unmasked stress-linked behaviors, such as grooming, and increased circulating CORT, recapitulating the effects of stress. Similar effects were also seen after direct administration of AM251 into the PVN, while optogenetic inhibition of PVN CRH neurons ameliorated stress-like behavioral changes produced by disruption of eCB signaling. These data indicate that under resting conditions, constitutive eCB signaling restricts activation of the HPA axis through local regulation of CRH neurons in the PVN.",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanisms behind the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at a network level are still poorly understood, with most studies to date focusing on local (cortical) effects and changes in motor-evoked potentials or BOLD signal. Here, we explored stationary and dynamic effective connectivity across the motor network at rest in two experiments where we applied tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1-tDCS) or the cerebellum (cb-tDCS) respectively. Two cohorts of healthy volunteers (n = 21 and n = 22) received anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS sessions (counterbalanced) during 20 minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used spectral Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and hierarchical Parametrical Empirical Bayes (PEB) to analyse data after (compared to a pre-tDCS baseline) and during stimulation. We also implemented a novel dynamic (sliding windows) DCM/PEB approach to model the nature of network reorganisation across time. In both experiments we found widespread effects of tDCS that extended beyond the targeted area and modulated effective connectivity between cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. These changes were characterised by unique nonlinear temporal fingerprints across connections and polarities. Our results challenged the classic notion of anodal and cathodal tDCS as excitatory and inhibitory respectively, as well as the idea of a cumulative effect of tDCS over time. Instead, they described a rich set of changes with specific spatial and temporal patterns. Our work provides a starting point for advancing our understanding of network-level tDCS effects and optimise its cognitive and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Neural noise is an inherent property of all nervous systems. However, the mechanisms by which such random and fluctuating neural activity influences perception are still unclear. To elucidate the relationship between neural noise and perceptual performance we require techniques that can safely manipulate neural noise in humans. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a form of electrical brain stimulation, has been proposed to increase neural noise according to principles of stochastic resonance (SR); where small to moderate intensities of tRNS improve performance, while higher intensities are detrimental. To date, high intensity (i.e., >2mA) tRNS effects on neural noise levels have not been directly quantified, nor have the detrimental effects proposed by SR been demonstrated in early visual processing. For this purpose, we applied a maximum current intensity of 3mA high-frequency tRNS to the visual cortex (V1) during an orientation discrimination task across increasing external visual noise levels, and fit the perceptual template model to contrast thresholds to quantify intrinsic mechanisms related to noise underlying changes in perceptual performance. We found that tRNS generally worsened perceptual performance by increasing observers internal noise and reducing the ability to filter external noise compared to sham. While most observers experienced detrimental effects, others demonstrated improved perceptual performance (i.e., reduced internal noise and better noise filtering). Preliminary evidence suggests that individual baseline internal noise levels may drive the observed beneficial or detrimental observer responses to tRNS. These findings have important implications for the application of tRNS to investigate the impact of internal noise and noise filtering processes on perception.",

    "abstract": "1.0Different brain cell types play distinct roles in brain development and disease. Molecular characterization of cell-specific mechanisms using cell type-specific approaches at the protein (proteomic) level, can provide biological and therapeutic insights. To overcome the barriers of conventional isolation-based methods for cell type-specific proteomics, in vivo proteomic labeling with proximity dependent biotinylation of cytosolic proteins using biotin ligase TurboID, coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) of labeled proteins, has emerged as a powerful strategy for cell type-specific proteomics in the native state of cells without need for cellular isolation. To complement in vivo proximity labeling approaches, in vitro studies are needed to ensure that cellular proteomes using the TurboID approach are representative of the whole cell proteome, and capture cellular responses to stimuli without disruption of cellular processes. To address this, we generated murine neuroblastoma (N2A) and microglial (BV2) lines stably expressing cytosolic TurboID to biotinylate the cellular proteome for downstream purification and analysis using MS. TurboID-mediated biotinylation captured 59% of BV2 and 65% of N2A proteomes under homeostatic conditions. TurboID expression and biotinylation minimally impacted homeostatic cellular proteomes of BV2 and N2A cells, and did not affect cytokine production or mitochondrial respiration in BV2 cells under resting or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated conditions. These included endo-lysosome, translation, vesicle and signaling proteins in BV2 microglia, and synaptic, neuron projection and microtubule proteins in N2A neurons. The effect of LPS treatment on the microglial proteome was captured by MS analysis of biotinylated proteins (>500 differentially-abundant proteins) including increased canonical pro-inflammatory proteins (Il1a, Irg1, Oasl1) and decrease anti-inflammatory proteins (Arg1, Mgl2).",

    "abstract": "Commensal bacteria are critical regulators of both tissue homeostasis and the development and exacerbation of autoimmunity. However, it remains unclear how the intestinal microbiota contributes to inflammation in tissues such as the central nervous system (CNS) where these microbes are typically absent and whether T cell receptor (TCR) specificity for commensal-derived antigens is important to the development of tissue inflammation-related outcomes. Here, we found that ileum- and cecum-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB)-specific T cells (clone TCR7B8) can infiltrate the CNS wherein they can be reactivated and produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines including IFN{gamma}, IL-17A, TNF, and GM-CSF in the absence of regulatory T cells. In contrast, other SFB-specific T cells (clone TCR1A2) recognizing an epitope in which 8/9 amino acids overlap with those recognized by TCR7B8 failed to induce such neuroinflammation. Despite their similar SFB-derived peptide antigen targets, TCR7B8 was found to recognize peptides derived from host proteins including receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ErbB2, trophinin 1, and anaphase-promoting complex subunit 2 in vitro, whereas TCR1A2 did not, indicating that TCR7B8 induces CNS inflammation via molecular mimicry. Immune checkpoint blockade accelerated TCR7B8-mediated CNS inflammation, suggesting a potential cause of immune-related adverse events induced in cancer patients undergoing such treatment. Together, our findings reveal a potential mechanism whereby gut commensal-specific T cells are dysregulated and contribute to extraintestinal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are essential for homeostatic maintenance of the anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic intestinal environment, yet monocyte-derived macrophages can promote local inflammation. Pro-inflammatory macrophage accumulation within the intestines may contribute to the development of systemic chronic inflammation and immunometabolic dysfunction in obesity. Using a model of high fat diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6J female mice, we assessed intestinal permeability by in vitro and in vivo assays, and quantitated intestinal macrophages in ileum and colon tissues by multicolour flow cytometry after short (6 weeks), intermediate (12 weeks), and prolonged (18 weeks) diet allocation. We characterized monocyte-derived CD4-TIM4- and CD4+TIM4- macrophages, as well as tissue-resident CD4+TIM4+ macrophages. Diet-induced obesity had tissue and time-dependent effects on intestinal permeability, as well as monocyte and macrophage numbers, surface phenotype, and intracellular production of the cytokines IL-10 and TNF. We found that obese mice had increased paracellular permeability, in particular within the ileum, but this did not elicit recruitment of monocytes, nor a local pro-inflammatory response by monocyte-derived or tissue-resident macrophages, in either the ileum or colon. Proliferation of monocyte-derived and tissue-resident macrophages was also unchanged. Wildtype and TNF-/- littermate mice had similar intestinal permeability and macrophage population characteristics in response to diet-induced obesity. These data are unique from reported effects of diet-induced obesity on macrophages in metabolic tissues, as well as outcomes of acute inflammation within the intestines, and collectively indicate that TNF does not mediate effects of diet-induced obesity on intestinal monocyte-derived and tissue-resident intestinal macrophages in young female mice.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/509732v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140a3c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c0d887org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7c70dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd5404_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In the salivary glands of the fly, the pathogen adopts the metacyclic form and expresses a limited repertoire of VSG genes specific to that developmental stage. It has remained unknown whether the metacyclic VSGs possess distinct properties associated with this particular and discrete phase of the parasite life cycle.

    "abstract": "In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) there is excessive ECM deposition, increased stiffness and ultimately destruction of lung parenchyma. IPF presents mainly in the elderly, implying that senescence, a hallmark of ageing, contributes to disease progression. Several studies have reported that IPF is characterised by increased senescence and accumulating evidence suggests that structural changes, such as increased stiffness may contribute to senescence. This study therefore investigated if increased tissue stiffness could modulate markers of senescence and/or fibrosis in primary lung fibroblasts. Using hydrogels representing healthy and fibrotic stiffnesses, we cultured primary fibroblasts from non-diseased lung tissue on top of these hydrogels for up to seven days before assessing senescence and fibrosis markers. Fibroblasts cultured on stiff ({+/-}15kPa) hydrogels showed higher Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP) nuclear translocation compared to soft hydrogels. When looking at senescence-associated proteins we also found higher secretion of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) but no change in transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1) or connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and higher decorin protein deposition on stiff matrices. With respect to genes associated with fibrosis, fibroblasts on stiff hydrogels compared to soft had higher expression of smooth muscle alpha ()-2 actin (ACTA2), collagen (COL) 1A1 and fibulin-1 (Fbln1) and higher Fbln1 protein deposition after seven days. Our results show that exposure of lung fibroblasts to fibrotic stiffness activates genes and secreted factors that are part of fibrotic responses and part of the senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP). This overlap may contribute to the creation of a feedback loop whereby fibroblasts create a perpetuating cycle reinforcing disease progression in IPF.",

    "abstract": "Type I and III Interferons (IFN) constitute the host systems first line of defense against viral infections. Although the two families use distinct extracellular receptor complexes, an identical pair of Janus kinases (JAK) activates a similar set of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs) through a conserved pathway. Consequently, type I and III IFNs are presumed to activate a largely overlapping set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and elicit similar biological responses. Therapeutically, type III IFNs are attractive alternatives to type I IFNs due to their innate tissue specificity and lower systemic toxicity. However, a major limitation of type III IFNs is the significantly lower potency of their physiological activities compared to type I IFNs. To evaluate the role of receptor geometry in IFN signaling, we engineered cell lines that express wild-type and mutant IFN{lambda} receptors (IFN{lambda}R1) with rotated intracellular registers with respect to the associated JAK1. Evaluation of downstream signaling and biological activity of type III IFNs in cells with varied JAK-JAK geometries uncovered variant receptors that result in potentiation of type III IFN signaling and all downstream activities. With the combined use of a high-affinity ligand to stabilize the extracellular receptor complex, we found that the optimization of the intracellular JAK-JAK geometry enhances the type III IFN antiviral and anti-proliferative activities by 2- and 3-logs, respectively. In addition to providing a molecular basis for the observed differences in potency between type I and III IFNs, this work provides deeper insights into broader cytokine signaling mechanisms and novel blueprints for modulating cytokine functions to develop next generation antiviral and anticancer therapeutics.",

Basal cells are known to be critical to airway epithelium homeostasis and repair, and altered basal cell phenotypes have been reported in cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, very little is known about how basal cells respond to stimuli in the cystic fibrosis airway environment. Cystic fibrosis patients experience chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and contain both high quantities of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as the filamentous bacteriophage Pf produced by biofilm-state P. aeruginosa in the airway. In this study, we sought to investigate the transcriptional responses of human basal cells from both healthy controls and patients with cystic fibrosis to LPS and Pf phage. Basal cells from wildtype and cystic fibrosis donors were cultured in vitro and exposed to LPS and/or Pf phage, followed by single-cell sequencing on the 10x platform. We report that basal cells show strong antiviral responses and neutrophil chemokine production in response to Pf phage. We validate these findings in additional donors by qRT-PCR and show that Pf phage is internalized by basal cells. We also show that Pf decreases basal cell migration and proliferation. We demonstrate that Pf phage, a bacteria-infecting virus which does not replicate in mammalian cells, is taken up by basal cells and activates immune responses. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of this antiviral response to bacterial clearance.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhen we experience a lung infection or injury, the stem cells of the airway--called basal epithelial cells--are crucial for healing the affected tissue. Basal cells proliferate and migrate to close gaps in the epithelium and replace injured and dead cells. We are also learning that basal cells can directly contribute to the immune response against lung pathogens, although little is understood about how basal cells sense viruses and bacteria, and what molecules they secrete in response. In our work, we sought to investigate the role that basal cells play in the course of an infection with the common human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We stimulated basal cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent immunogen produced by Pseudomonas, as well as the Pseudomonas-infecting virus Pf4. We have previously shown that Pf4, which is produced in high amounts by lung-infecting Pseudomonas, affects the immune response to this bacterium. In our work here, we show that Pf4 is recognized as a virus by basal cells and changes the transcriptional response to LPS, derailing the antibacterial immune response to Pseudomonas. These findings raise the question of whether other bacteria-infecting viruses alter immune responses, and how these viruses interact with other airway cells.",

    "abstract": "SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SWI/SNF) complexes are a family of chromatin remodellers that are conserved across eukaryotes. Mutations in subunits of SWI/SNF cause a multitude of different developmental disorders in humans, most of which have no current treatment options. Here we identify an alanine to valine causing mutation in the SWI/SNF subunit snfc-5 (SMARCB1 in humans) that prevents embryonic lethality in C. elegans nematodes harbouring a loss-of-function mutation in the SWI/SNF subunit swsn-1 (SMARCC1/2 in humans). Furthermore, we found that the combination of this specific mutation in snfc-5 and a loss-of-function mutation in either of the E3 ubiquitin ligases ubr-5 (UBR5 in humans) or hecd-1 (HECTD1 in humans) can restore development to adulthood in swsn-1 loss-of-function mutants that otherwise die as embryos. Using these mutant models, we established a set of 335 genes that are dysregulated in SWI/SNF mutants that arrest their development embryonically but exhibit near wild-type levels of expression in the presence of suppressor mutations that prevent embryonic lethality, suggesting that SWI/SNF promotes development by regulating this specific subset of genes. In addition, we show that SWI/SNF protein levels are reduced in swsn-1; snfc-5 double mutants and partly restored to wild-type levels in swsn-1; snfc-5; ubr-5 triple mutants, consistent with a model in which UBR-5 regulates SWI/SNF levels by tagging the complex for proteasomal degradation. Our findings establish a link between two E3 ubiquitin ligases and SWI/SNF function and suggest that UBR5 and HECTD1 might be viable therapeutic targets for the many developmental disorders caused by missense mutations in SWI/SNF subunits.",

    "abstract": "Morphogen gradients provide essential positional information to gene networks through their spatially heterogeneous distribution. Yet, how morphogen gradients form is still hotly contested, with multiple models proposed for different systems. Here, we focus on the transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd), a morphogen that forms an exponential gradient across the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the early Drosophila embryo. We utilise fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and perturbations to Bcd, to dissect Bcd dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal locations. In both the cytoplasm and nucleus, we find two dynamic modes for Bicoid diffusion dynamics, consisting of fast and slow populations of Bcd. Surprisingly, there are spatial differences in Bcd diffusivity along the AP-axis, with Bcd diffusing more rapidly in the posterior. We establish that such spatially varying differences in the Bcd dynamics are sufficient to explain how Bcd can have a steep exponential gradient in the anterior half of the embryo and yet still have an observable fraction of Bcd near the posterior pole. We subsequently investigated which binding elements of Bcd are playing a role in its dynamics. In the nucleus, we demonstrate that the slower mode of Bcd transport is due to Bcd DNA binding. Addition of the Bcd homeodomain to eGFP::NLS can qualitatively replicate the observed Bcd concentration profile, suggesting this domain is the primary region regulating Bcd dynamics. This study provides a detailed analysis of morphogen dynamics at different spatial and temporal locations, revealing multiple modes of transport. These results explain how a long-ranged gradient can form while retaining a steep profile through much of its range.",

    "abstract": "As environmental degradation progresses, economies and societies adapt to the loss of ecosystem services and public attention to degradation subsides. In systems experiencing such societal acclimation to degradation, net incentives for stakeholder mitigation peak during early degradation phases and subside over time. Using harmful algae blooms in western Lake Erie as a case study, we illustrate how declines in public attention and societal reliance on lake recreation (i.e., finding recreation alternatives) reduce the incentives for stakeholders to reduce pollution runoff (i.e., mitigation efforts throughout the watershed). We then analyze how acclimation can affect a broad array of conservation challenges by developing a general socio-ecological model of societal response to degradation. We find that delays in initiating stakeholder-driven mitigation efforts can exponentially prolong restoration projects. Furthermore, when alleviating intense degradation relies upon voluntary commitments by many individuals, windows of opportunity for mitigation can be very limited because feedback loops of societal adaptation doom late restoration efforts to failure and lock human-environment systems into degraded states. These windows of opportunity can be particularly narrow when a) stakeholder mitigation requires supportive public opinion or b) even modestly valuable alternative services are available in degraded ecosystems. In such cases, maintaining undegraded human-environment regimes may hinge on quickly initiating stakeholder mitigation movements and allocating limited government conservation funds soon after degradation begins instead of spreading mitigation efforts out over decades. Such initiatives, regardless of whether acclimation is slow or rapid in a given system, also greatly accelerate the pace of environmental restoration.\n\nSignificance StatementAs societies acclimate to degraded environments, mitigation efforts that hinge on action by many stakeholders can erode. Developing a socio-ecological model of acclimation, we reveal how social and environmental processes intertwine to create alternative stable socio-ecological regimes, with either: 1) undegraded ecosystem states sustained by widespread mitigation adoption, or 2) degraded states where societies neither maintain nor continue relying on traditional, local ecosystem services. This dynamic places a premium on prompt mitigation efforts, which may face narrow opportunity windows to get started and avert degraded regimes in systems that rely on stakeholder-driven mitigation. Moreover, in any system requiring stakeholder action, societal acclimation will increase the importance of early action because decaying mitigation incentives exponentially lengthen restoration efforts.",

    "abstract": "For the conservation and community ecology of arthropods and pest controls on terrestrial plants, survey of arthropods is a crucial step. However, efficient surveys are hindered by challenges in collecting small arthropods, and identifying the species. Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based techniques, such as eDNA metabarcording, help overcome these difficulties in aquatic systems. To apply eDNA metabarcording to terrestrial arthropods, we developed a non-destructive eDNA collection method. In this method, termed \"plant flow collection,\" we spray distilled or tap water, or use rainfall, which eventually flows over the surface of the plant, and is collected in a container that is set at the plant base. DNA is extracted from the filtered water samples and a DNA barcode region, such as cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, of the extracted DNA is amplified and sequenced using a high-throughput sequencer. We identified more than 38 taxonomic groups of arthropods at the family level, of which 7 were visually observed or artificially introduced species, whereas the other 31 groups of arthropods, including 18 species, were not observed in the visual survey. Put together, these results show that the developed method is effective for detecting the presence of arthropods in plants.",

Simulated grazing reduced both percent cover and productivity of T. testudinum. High runoff and local pollution from industrial farming may limit light availability and reduce seagrass photosynthetic performance to replace biomass lost to simulated grazing. Other seagrass species and algae failed to colonize space opened by reductions in T. testudinum percent cover. Many plots subjected to simulated grazing were also bioturbated by stingrays.

In particular, reducing or reversing a prevailing bias can increase the probability that a de novo mutation is beneficial. It has also been shown that mutator bacteria are more likely to emerge if the beneficial mutations they generate have a larger effect size than observed in the wildtype. Here, we connect these two results, demonstrating that mutator strains that reduce or reverse a prevailing bias have a positively-shifted DFE, which in turn can dramatically increase their emergence probability. Since changes in mutation rate and bias are often coupled through the gain and loss of DNA repair enzymes, our results predict that the invasion of mutator strains will be facilitated by shifts in mutation bias that offer improved access to previously under-sampled beneficial mutations.",

    "abstract": "The cosmopolitan Botrychium lunaria group belong to the most species rich genus of the family Ophioglossaceae and was considered to consist of two species until molecular studies in North America and northern Europe led to the recognition of multiple new taxa. Recently, additional genetic lineages were found scattered in Europe, emphasizing our poor understanding of the global diversity of the B. lunaria group, while the processes involved in the diversification of the group remain unexplored. We conducted the first global phylogenetic study of the group including 513 ingroup accessions sequenced for four non-coding plastid loci. We recovered ten well-supported clades, although relationships between clades were inconsistent between Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses. We treated each clade at the species level, except for one clade including two ploidy levels, resulting in the recognition of 11 species, 5 of which are unnamed. In contrast to previous studies, we found species diversity to be equally distributed across the northern hemisphere, with 7-8 species per continent. We estimated the stem age of the B. lunaria group at 2.4-5.1 million years, with most species 1.8-2.6 million years old, and subspecies 0.5-1.0 million years old. Diversification thus coincided with Pleistocene climatic fluctuations that strongly affected the areas inhabited by the group, suggesting that diversification was driven by climatically induced cycles of extinction, dispersal, and migration. Furthermore, ecological differentiation between species suggests these complex population dynamics were associated with adaptations to specific environmental conditions. We found limited evidence that speciation is driven by polyploidization and hybridization. We show that the B. lunaria group has greater species level diversity than previously assumed and suspect that further cryptic species may await discovery, especially in the B. neolunaria clade.",

    "abstract": "The success of vector management programs relies on knowledge of the biology and genetic make-up of mosquitoes so that they can be interlaced with modern tools for developing suitable intervention strategies. There are many reports available for rearing varied species of mosquito vectors. However, there are limited studies addressing the development of isofemale lines among mosquitoes to homogenize the population to obtain both high-quality genome assemblies and enrichment of phenotype. Anopheles stephensi, an urban malaria vector, is one of the major invasive vectors of malaria distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent, Middle East, and has recently been expanding its range in Africa. With the existence of three biological forms, distinctly identifiable based on the number of ridges on eggs with varying vectorial competence, An. stephensi is a perfect species for developing a method for the successful establishment of isofemale lines, which can be tested for retention of the expected vectorial competence for the various forms. We describe the key steps in the establishment and validation of isofemale lines, which include monitoring the transgenerational fitness traits, morphometrics of eggs, and adult wing size during every generation. After the initial inbreeding depression, as proof of the tedious selection process, no significant morphometric differences were observed in the wings and egg size between the parental and their respective isofemale lines. We observed a significant change in the vectorial competence between the respective isofemale and parental lines enriching expected differential susceptibility towards malaria parasites by the type and intermediate forms. Interestingly, IndCh and IndInt strains showed variations in resistance to different insecticides belonging to all the four major classes. These variant lines have been characterized for their levels of homozygosity both at the phenotype and genotype levels and can be used as a standard reference or as a biological resource for other studies related to urban malaria research.\n\nAuthor summaryIsofemale lines can be a valuable resource for characterizing and enhancing several genotypic and phenotypic traits. This is the first detailed report of the establishment of two isofemale lines of type and intermediate biological forms in Anopheles stephensi. The work encompasses the characterization of fitness traits among the two lines through a transgenerational study. Further, isofemale colonies were established and used to characterize insecticide susceptibility and vector competence. The study provides valuable insights into the differential susceptibility status of the parental and isofemale to different insecticides belonging to the same class. Corroborating with the earlier hypothesis we exemplify the high vector competence in type form than the intermediate from using homozygous isofemale lines. Using these isofemale lines it is now possible to study host-parasite interactions and identify factors that might be responsible for altered susceptibility and increased vector competence in An. stephensi biological forms that would also pave way for developing better vector management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Hyper-secretion and/or hyper-concentration of mucus is a defining feature of multiple obstructive lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mucus itself is composed of a mixture of water, ions, salt and proteins, of which the gel-forming mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are the most abundant. Recent studies have linked the concentrations of these proteins in sputum to COPD phenotypes, including chronic bronchitis (CB) and acute exacerbations (AE). We sought to determine whether common genetic variants influence sputum mucin concentrations and whether these variants are also associated with COPD phenotypes, specifically CB and AE. We performed a GWAS to identify quantitative trait loci for sputum mucin protein concentration (pQTL) in the Sub-Populations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS, n=708 for total mucin, n=215 for MUC5AC, MUC5B). Subsequently, we tested for associations of mucin pQTL with CB and AE using regression modeling (n=822-1300). Replication analysis was conducted using data from COPDGene (n =5740) and by examining results from the UK Biobank. We identified one genome-wide significant pQTL for MUC5AC (rs75401036) and two for MUC5B (rs140324259, rs10001928). The strongest association for MUC5B, with rs140324259 on chromosome 11, explained 14% of variation in sputum MUC5B. Despite being associated with lower MUC5B, the C allele of rs140324259 conferred increased risk of CB (odds ratio (OR) = 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.80) as well as AE ascertained over three years of follow up (OR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.02-1.94). Associations between rs140324259 and CB or AE did not replicate in COPDGene. However, in the UK Biobank, rs140324259 was associated with phenotypes that define CB, namely chronic mucus production and cough, again with the C allele conferring increased risk. We conclude that sputum MUC5AC and MUC5B concentrations are associated with common genetic variants, and the top locus for MUC5B may influence COPD phenotypes, in particular CB.\n\nAuthor SummaryChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by presence of emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis. Excessive mucus production is a defining phenotype of chronic bronchitis, and is associated with several important features of COPD, including exacerbations and loss of lung function. Recent studies have demonstrated that the amount of mucus produced in COPD patients is an important marker of disease state. We investigated whether common genetic variants are associated with the concentration of two key proteins in mucus, MUC5AC and MUC5B, and whether the variants we identified are also associated with COPD outcomes. We identified multiple genetic variants that were associated with MUC5AC or MUC5B concentration. The strongest association we detected, for MUC5B on chromosome 11, was also associated with features of COPD, including chronic bronchitis and acute exacerbations, in one COPD study population but not another. Results from a much larger study, the UK Biobank, indicate that this variant is associated with chronic mucus production and chronic cough, which are key features of chronic bronchitis. Thus, we conclude that the concentration of key proteins in mucus are influenced by genetic variation, and that a variant on chromosome 11 that affects MUC5B may in turn alter COPD outcomes.",

We found that sharers get on average ~75% more citations, independently of journal of publication and impact factor, and that this effect is sustained over time. This work provides further incentivises authors to share their GWAS summary statistics in standard repositories, such as the GWAS catalog.",

    "abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common ocular malignancy in adults. Nearly 95% of UM patients carry the mutually exclusive mutations in the homologous genes GNAQ (aminoacid change Q209L/Q209P) and GNA11 (aminoacid change Q209L). UM is located in an immunosuppressed organ and do not suffer immunoediting. Therefore, we hypothesize that driver mutations in GNAQ/11 genes could be recognized by the immune system. Genomic and transcriptomic data for primary uveal tumors was collected from TCGA-UM dataset (n=80). The immunogenic potential for GNAQ/GNA11 Q209L/Q209P mutations was assessed using a variety of tools and HLA types information. The immune microenvironment was characterized using gene expression data. All prediction tools showed stronger GNAQ/11 Q209L binding to HLA. The immunogenicity analysis revealed that Q209L is likely to be presented by more than 73% of individuals in 1000G database whereas Q209P is only predicted to be presented in 24% of individuals. GNAQ/11 Q209L showed higher likelihood to be presented by HLA-I molecules than almost all driver mutations analyzed. Samples carrying Q209L had a higher immune-reactive phenotype: (i) expression of antigen presenting genes HLA-A (p=0.009) and B2M (p=0.043); (ii) immunophenoscore (p=0.008); (iii) infiltration of immune system cells NK (p=0.002) and CD8+ T lymphocytes (p=0.02). Results suggest a high potential immunogenicity of the GNAQ/11 Q209L variant that could allow the generation of novel therapeutic tools to treat UM like neoantigen vaccinations.",

We hypothesized that upon the Ca2+-dependent assembly of PTP complex, F-ATP synthase (subunits) recruits mitochondrial proteins that do not interact or weakly interact with F-ATP synthase under normal conditions. Therefore, we examined whether the PTP opening in mitochondria before the separation of supercomplexes by BN-PAGE will increases the channel stability and channel-forming capacity of isolated F-ATP synthase dimers and monomers in planar lipid membranes. Besides, we studied the specific activity and protein composition of F-ATP synthase dimers and monomers from rat liver and heart mitochondria before and after PTP opening. By contrast to our expectations, preliminary PTP opening dramatically suppressed the high-conductance channel activity of F-ATP synthase dimers and monomers and decreased their specific \"in gel\" activity. The decline in the channel-forming activity correlated with the reduced levels of as few as two proteins in the bands: methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and prohibitin 2. These data indicate that proteins accompanying F-ATP synthase may be important players in the PTP formation and stabilization.",

These findings establish that the ubiquitin chains attached to components of myddosomes are initiated by both ester and isopeptide bonds. Ester bond formation takes place within the proline, serine, threonine-rich (PST) domains of IRAK2 and IRAK4 and the intermediate domain of MyD88.

Experimental results demonstrate that both ovarian cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models promote the infiltration of macrophages into a 3D collagen type I extracellular matrix. Additionally, blocking CSF1 signaling reduced the number of recruited macrophages as well as migration speed, while macrophage recruitment was enhanced by addition of recombinant CSF1. We further demonstrated that results obtained with our microfluidic model are consistent with the recruitment of macrophages in vivo by patient-derived xenograft models, and that a xenograft model with high CSF1 expression showed an enhanced ability to recruit macrophages both in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "Current methods for evaluating the accuracy of germline variant calls are restricted to easy-to-detect high-confidence regions, thus ignoring a substantial portion of difficult variants beyond the benchmark regions. We established four DNA reference materials from immortalized cell lines derived from a Chinese Quartet including parents and monozygotic twins. We integrated benchmark calls of 4.2 million small variants and 15,000 structural variants from multiple platforms and bioinformatic pipelines for evaluating the reliability of germline variant calls inside the benchmark regions. The genetic built-in-truth of the Quartet family design not only improved sensitivity of benchmark calls by removing additional false positive variants with apparently high quality, but also enabled estimation of the precision of variants calls outside the benchmark regions. Batch effects of variant calling in large-scale DNA sequencing efforts can be effectively identified with the concurrent use of the Quartet DNA reference materials along with study samples, and can be alleviated by training a machine learning model with the Quartet reference datasets to remove potential artifact calls. Matched RNA and protein reference materials were also established in the Quartet project, thereby enabling benchmark calls constructed from DNA reference materials for evaluation of variants calling performance on RNA and protein data. The Quartet DNA reference materials from this study are a resource for objective and comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of germline variant calls throughout the whole-genome regions.",

    "abstract": "In this study we used coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) simulations to study protein-cholesterol interactions for different activation states of the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) and A1 adenosine receptor (A1R). Three different membranes were used, of which a plasma mimetic membrane best matched cholesterol binding sites previously detected in X-ray structures and computationally for the inactive state of A2AR. Here, cholesterol binds stably between TM5 and TM6 in the intracellular leaf and between the extracellular part of TM6 and TM7. The stability of the identified binding sites to A1R with CG MD simulations were further investigated using potential of mean force calculations combined with umbrella sampling.\n\nCholesterol binding to certain cavities in active or inactive state can stabilize a conformation of active or inactive state respectively and is important to identify these cavities. For the active state the cholesterol binding sites have much longer residence times compared to the inactive state for both A2AR and A1R.\n\nWe observed for the active A1R two cholesterol binding sites in the extracellular membrane leaf in a cavity between TM2/TM3 and along TM3 in the intracellular leaf. We found a partially overlapped binding area between TM6 and TM7 in the extracellular membrane leaf for active state and inactive A1R state which can be antagonized by cholesterol molecules although the site has a much longer residence time for active A1R. For the active A2AR we predicted a high residence time cholesterol position between TM1 and TM7 in the middle region of TMD which is different from the binding sites calculated in active or inactive A1R and for the inactive A2AR. For the inactive A2AR cholesterol binds to the same extracellular area between TM6 and TM7 as in the inactive A1R.\n\nThe differences in stable, long residence time cholesterol binding sites between active and inactive states of A1R and for A2AR can be important for functional activity and orthosteric agonist or antagonist affinity and can be used for the design of allosteric modulators which can bind through lipid pathways.",

    "abstract": "Cell motility represents one of the most fundamental function in mechanobiology. Cell motility is directly implicated in development, cancer or tissue regeneration, but it also plays a key role in the future of tissue and biomedical engineering. Here, we derived a computational model of cell motility that incorporates the most important mechanisms toward cell motility: cell protrusion, polarization and retrograde flow. We first validate our model to explain two important types of cell migration, i.e. confined and ameboid cell migration, as well as all phases of the latter cell migration type, i.e. symmetric cell spreading, cell polarization and latter migration. Then, we use our model to investigate durotaxis and chemotaxis. The model predicts that chemotaxis alone induces larger migration velocities than durotaxis and that durotaxis is activated in soft matrices but not in stiff ones. More importantly, we analyze the competition between chemical and mechanical signals. We show that chemotaxis rules over durotaxis in most situations although durotaxis diminishes chemotaxis. Moreover, we show that inhibiting the effect of GTPases in actin polymerization at the cell front may allow durotaxis to take control over chemotaxis in soft substrates. Understanding how the main forces in cell motility cooperate, and how a precise manipulation of external cues may control directed cell migration is not only key for a fundamental comprehension of cell biology but also to engineer better biomimetic tissues. To this end, we provide a freely-available platform to predict all phases and modes of cell motility analyzed in this work.",

Underpinning this was the creation of a labelled training set which came from a consortium of several different laboratories. The MARCO classification model does not have the same accuracy on local data as it does on images from the original test set; this can be somewhat mitigated by retraining the ML model and including local images.

These cylinders have several features matching experimental observations. For instance, the axial condensin backbone breaks up into clusters as found by microscopy, and cylinder elasticity qualitatively matches that seen in chromosome pulling experiments.

PRR agonists, such as dsRNA oncolytic Reovirus type 3 Dearing (Rt3D), potently activate RNA sensors. We used an unbiased cytotoxicity screen to reveal synergistic drug-virotherapy combinations and found potent effects of Rt3D combined with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib. The combination augmented oncolytic virus-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) and the expression and activation/signaling of RNA sensors. Combined Rt3D-palbociclib treatment potently increased interferon production and signaling, and knockdown studies implicated key UPR proteins and the RNA sensor, RIG-I, as essential to the phenotype observed. Further experiments, using canonical RIG-I agonists and an ER stress inducer, thapsigargin, confirmed cross-talk between RNA sensing and ER stress pathways that augmented cancer cell death and interferon production. Combined Rt3D-palbociclib also increased innate immune activation within tumour cells and IFN-induced HLA expression. Analysis of the immunopeptidome revealed changes to HLA-captured peptides with Rt3D-palbociclib, including altered expression of peptides from cancer/testis antigens (CTA) and endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs). Our findings highlight cross-talk between UPR signaling and RNA-mediated PRR activation as a means of enhancing anti-cancer efficacy with potential pro-immunogenic consequences. This has implications for future clinical development of PRR agonists and oncolytic viruses, and broadens the therapeutic remit of CDK4/6 inhibitors to include roles as both ER stress and dsRNA PRR sensitizers.",

One potential mechanism is that Pb poisoning may impair thyroid hormone (TH)- mediated changes in brain development To address this issue, we performed experiments to assess the effects of Pb poisoning on (TH) -dependent changes in cellular and molecular mechanisms in the developing Xenopus laevis tadpole brain. We treated stage 48 tadpoles to combinations of 1000 ppb Pb bath for seven days and added one of three different concentrations of thyroxine (T4) for the final two days of treatment. We found that lead exposure decreased body length, including in T4-treated tadpoles. We also performed immuno-staining for proliferative marker pH3 and found that Pb disrupts T4-induced increases in neuronal proliferation. Finally, we used syGlass VR data visualization software to measure volume of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain in 3D and found that Pb exposure impaired T4-mediated changes in brain volume. Last, we found that Pb poisoning reduced the T4-mediated increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a TH-sensitive gene.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEnrichment of home cages in laboratory experiments offers clear advantages, but has been criticized in some respects. First, there is a lack of definition, which makes methodological uniformity difficult. Second, there is concern that the enrichment of home cages may increase the variance of results in experiments. Here, the influence of more natural housing conditions on physiological parameters of female C57BL/6J mice was investigated from an animal welfare point of view. For this purpose, the animals were kept in three different housing conditions: conventional cage housing, enriched housing and the semi-naturalistic environment. The focus was on musculoskeletal changes after long-term environmental enrichment.\n\nResultsThe housing conditions had a long-term effect on the body weight of the test animals. The more complex and natural the home cage, the heavier the animals. This was associated with increased adipose deposits in the animals. There were no significant changes in muscle and bone characteristics except for single clues (femur diameter, bone resorption marker CTX-1). Additionally, the animals in the semi naturalistic environment (SNE) were found to have the fewest bone anomalies. Housing in the SNE appears to have the least effect on stress hormone concentrations. The lowest oxygen uptake was observed in enriched cage housing.\n\nConclusionsDespite increasing values, observed body weights were in the normal and strain-typical range. Overall, musculoskeletal parameters were slightly improved and age-related effects appear to have been attenuated. The variances in the results were not increased by more natural housing. This confirms the suitability of the applied housing conditions to ensure and increase animal welfare in laboratory experiments.",

Here, we identified two AGOs in rice anthers, AGO1b and AGO1d, that interact with phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) derived from numerous long non-coding RNAs. Moreover, 3D-immunoimaging and mutant analysis demonstrated that rice AGO1b and AGO1d redundantly and cell type-specifically regulate anther development by acting as mobile carriers of these phasiRNAs from the somatic cell layers to the germ cells in anthers. Our study also highlights a new mode of reproductive RNA silencing via the specific nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of three AGOs, AGO1b, AGO1d, and MEL1, in rice pollen mother cells.",

    "abstract": "Age-related changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) form the basis for the development of most robust predictors of age, epigenetic clocks, but a clear mechanistic basis for what exactly they quantify is lacking. Here, to clarify the nature of epigenetic aging, we analyzed the aging dynamics of bulk-tissue and single-cell DNAm, together with single-cell DNAm changes during early development. We show that aging DNAm changes are widespread, but are relatively slow and small in amplitude, with DNAm levels trending towards intermediate values and showing increased heterogeneity with age. By considering dominant types of DNAm changes, we find that aging manifests in the exponential decay-like loss or gain of methylation with a universal rate, independent of the initial level of DNAm. We further show that aging is dominated by the stochastic component, yet co-regulated changes are also present during both development and adulthood. We support the finding of stochastic epigenetic aging by direct single-cell DNAm analyses and modeling of aging DNAm trajectories with a stochastic process akin to radiocarbon decay. Finally, we describe a single-cell algorithm for the identification of co-regulated CpG clusters that may provide new opportunities for targeting aging and evaluating longevity interventions.",

    "abstract": "Attaining proficiency in meditation is difficult, especially without feedback since the mind may be easily distracted with thoughts and only long term efforts see any impact. Self-regulation would be much more effective if provided real time assessment and this can be achieved through EEG neurofeedback. Therefore, this work proposes a scheme for assessing meditation-like state in real time from short EEG segments, using low computational settings. Signal processing techniques are used to extract features from long term meditation practitioners multichannel EEG data. An autoencoder model is then trained on these features such that the model can be run in real time. Its reconstruction errors or its latent variables are used to provide non typical feedback parameters which are used to establish an objective measure of meditation ability. Our approach is optimised to have lightweight architectures handling small blocks of data and can be conveniently used on low density EEG acquisition systems as it requires only a few channels. However, our experimental results suggest that the meditation state has substantial overlap even in terms of multivariate EEG features and show prominent temporal dynamics, both of which are not captured using simple one class algorithms. Being an extremely flexible one-class model, we have described multiple improvements to the proposed autoencoder model to address the above issues and develop simple yet high precision neurofeedback protocols.",

    "abstract": "The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide impacts diverse cellular processes (e.g., apoptosis and cell proliferation) through its effects on membrane dynamics and intracellular signalling pathways. The dysregulation of ceramide metabolism has been implicated in cancer evasion of apoptosis and targeting ceramide metabolism has potential therapeutic benefits as a strategy to kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth. However, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to ceramide-mediated cell death are vastly intertwined and incompletely understood. To shed light on this mystery, we performed a genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to systematically identify regulators of cancer resistance to the soluble short chain ceramide, C6 ceramide (C6-Cer). Our results reveal a complex landscape of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity, including genes associated with ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking, and membrane biology. Furthermore, we find that loss of the phospholipid flippase subunit TMEM30A impairs the plasma membrane trafficking of its binding partner the P4-type ATPase ATP11B, and depletion of TMEM30A or ATP11B disrupts plasma membrane asymmetry and promotes resistance to C6-Cer toxicity independent of alterations in C6-Cer uptake. Together, our findings provide a resource of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity and reveal an unexpected role of plasma membrane asymmetry in C6-Cer induced cell death.",

    "abstract": "The BlueFlux field campaign is supported by NASAs Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) and will develop prototype blue carbon products to inform coastal carbon management. Blue carbon is included in carbon-dioxide removal actions proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations to mitigate climate change. Due to their high productivity and carbon storage, combined with historic losses and a wide-range of beneficial ecosystem services, the restoration and conservation of mangrove ecosystems features prominently in blue-carbon planning. The goal of BlueFlux is to carry out multi-scale measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes using chambers, flux towers, and aircraft and scale these to gridded products using space-based observations of forest structure and surface reflectance. The measurements cover gradients in disturbance, mainly from the history of hurricanes in the region that drive the dieback of mangroves and the formation of  ghost forests. The fluxes of CH4 emissions will be contrasted with CO2 uptake to provide a more complete budget of radiative forcing and to understand the net climate benefits of blue carbon. BlueFlux demonstrates that quantifying the removals of CO2 and emissions of CH4 using a multi-scale approach can provide increased confidence in regional greenhouse-gas accounting, contribute to process-understanding, and help inform restoration and conservation efforts in the context of climate mitigation.",

Abiotic factors (e.g., maximum phosphate, dissolved oxygen and water temperature) were significantly correlated with candidate loci associated with the myo-inositol synthesis, a pathway linked to osmoregulation, and to other genomic regions involved in organismal homeostasis. The identification of adaptive seascapes in this ancient species, especially if linked to primitive adaptive immune responses, could be relevant to understand the evolutionary pathways early in vertebrate evolution.",

However, the extent to which vision-associated trait complexity and water column usage is coupled remains unclear. Here we investigate the relationship between depth niche, eye size, and the molecular basis of light detection across the Antarctic notothenioid adaptive radiation. Using a phylogenetic comparative framework, we integrate sequence analyses of opsin tuning sites with data on eye size and depth occupancy from over two decades of NOAA trawl-based surveys. We find a consistent signature of changes in tuning sites suggestive of shifts in their ability to detect lower wavelengths of light. These represent repeated instances of independent tuning site changes across the notothenioid phylogeny that are generally not associated with habitat depth or species eye size. We further reveal an acceleration in the rate of eye size diversification nearly 20 million years after the initial radiation that has manifested in high levels of eye size divergence among closely related taxa. Collectively, our results strongly support a decoupling of the diversification dynamics between opsin tuning sites, eye size and depth, providing a new perspective of the evolution of the visual system in this iconic adaptive radiation.",

    "abstract": "Aphids are common crop pests. These insects reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis involving several rounds of clonal reproduction interspersed with an occasional sexual cycle. Furthermore, clonal aphids give birth to live apterous or winged young that are already pregnant. Together, these qualities enable rapid population growth and have facilitated the colonisation of crops globally. In several cases so-called \"super clones\" have come to dominate agricultural systems. However, the extent to which the sexual stage of the aphid life cycle has shaped global pest populations has remained largely unclear, as have the origins of successful lineages. Here, we used chromosome-scale genome assemblies to disentangle the evolution of two of the most significant global pests of cereals - the English (Sitobion avenae) and Indian (Sitobion miscanthi) grain aphids. We found that genome-wide divergence between S. avenae and S. miscanthi is low and that S. avenae sensu stricto is part of a larger cryptic species complex that includes multiple diverged S. miscanthi lineages. Moreover, comparison of haplotype-resolved assemblies reveals that the S. miscanthi isolate used for genome sequencing is likely a hybrid, with one of its diploid genome copies being closely related to S. avenae ([~]0.5% divergence) and the second being substantially more divergent (> 1%). Analyses of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data of grain aphids from the UK and China revealed that S. avenae and S. miscanthi are part of a species complex with many highly differentiated lineages that predate the origins of agriculture. The complex consists of hybrid lineages that display a tangled history of hybridisation and genetic introgression. These data demonstrate that hybridisation has substantially contributed to grain aphid diversity, and hence, to the evolutionary potential of this important pest species.",

    "abstract": "The divergence of reproductive traits frequently underpins the evolution of reproductive isolation. Here we investigated the hypothesis that tinamou (Tinamidae) egg coloration functions as a mating signal and its diversification was driven by reinforcement. For many tinamou species, the male guards the nest that is sequentially visited and laid eggs in by multiple females. The colorations of the existing eggs in the nest could signal mate quality and species identities to both the incubating male and the upcoming females, preventing costly hybridization, thus were selected to diverge among species (Mating Signal Character Displacement Hypothesis). If so, two predictions should follow: (1) egg colors should coevolve with known mating signals as the tinamou lineages diverged; (2) species that partition similar eco-geography should display different egg colors. The tinamou songs are important mating signals and are highly divergent among species. We found that the egg color was significantly associated with the first principal component of the song variables. In addition, tinamou species with similar eco-geography tend to display different egg colors, while controlling for song variation among species. Mating signal evolution could be opportunistic and even exploit post-mating trait as premating signals that undergo character displacement in sympatry.",

We identify thousands of expression STRs (eSTRs) showing regulatory effects and demonstrate that they explain missing heritability beyond SNV-based expression quantitative trait loci. We illustrate specific regulatory mechanisms such as how eSTRs affect splicing sites and alternative splicing efficiency. We also show that differential expression of antioxidant genes might affect STR variation systematically.

The m6A mark regulates the fate of RNAs in various ways, which in turn, drives changes in cell physiology, development, and disease pathology. Over the last decade, numerous methods have been developed to map and quantify m6A sites genomewide through deep sequencing. Alternatively, m6A levels can be quantified from a population of RNAs using techniques such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or thin layer chromatography. However, many methods for quantifying m6A levels involve extensive protocols and specialized data analysis, and often only a few samples can be handled in a single experiment. Here, we developed a simple method for determining m6A levels in mRNA populations from various sources based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay (m6A-ELISA). We have optimized various steps of m6A-ELISA such as sample preparation and the background signal resulting from the primary antibody. We validated the method using mRNA populations from budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells. The full protocol takes less than a day, requiring only 25 ng of mRNA. The m6A-ELISA protocol is therefore quick, cost-effective, and scalable, making it a valuable tool for determining relative m6A levels in samples from various sources that could be adapted to detect other mRNA modifications.",

Our simulation results are in good qualitative agreement with experimental microscopy images. We show that for cells flowing in the center of the nozzle extensional stresses can be significant, while for cells flowing off-center their deformation is dominated by the shear flow inside the nozzle. From the results of these simulations, we develop two simple methods that only require the printing parameters (nozzle diameter, flow rate, bioink rheology) to (i) accurately predict the maximum cell stress occurring during the 3D bioprinting process and (ii) approximately predict the cell strains caused by the elongational flow at the nozzle exit.",

    "abstract": "Changes in glycosylation patterns have been associated with malignant transformation and clinical outcome in several types of cancer, although no comprehensive analysis has been performed in a pan-cancer setting. Here, we performed an extensive transcriptomic analysis of glycosylation related genes (such as enzymes involved in synthesis and degradation of glycoconjugates, transporters, mucins and galectins), using publicly available bulk and single cell transcriptomic data sets from tumor samples and cancer cell lines. We identified genes and pathways associated with different tumor types, which may represent novel diagnostic biomarkers as 2-3 sialylation for Melanoma, MUC21 for Lung adenocarcinoma and Galectin-7 for Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Accordingly, serum levels of Galectin-7 in patients with lung cancer were elevated in SCC respect to adenocarcinomas, supporting its biomarker potential. Moreover, we characterized the contribution of different cell types to the overall glycosylation profiles observed by performing the integration and analysis of 14 single cell RNA-seq datasets. This led us to identify that cancer cells are responsible for the specific tumor glyco-codes identified in bulk transcriptomics, while stromal and immune cells contribute in a conserved manner across various malignancies. Furthermore, our results suggest that the glycosylation-related genes and pathways expressed by cancer cells are influenced by the cell of origin and the oncogenic pathways that led to malignant transformation. Lastly, we described the association of different glycosylation-related genes and pathways with the clinical outcome of patients. Interestingly, while the expression of genes associated to some pathways (as proteoglycan biosynthesis) are consistently associated with a more aggressive disease, the correlation of others pathways with the survival of patients depends on the particular tumor type. Remarkably, the expression of genes associated with the synthesis of CMP-sialic acid was correlated with lower survival of patients in Uveal Melanoma and PDAC, while the opposite was observed for colorectal cancer. The extensive transcriptomic analysis of glycosylation pathways in cancer that we report here can serve as a resource for future research aimed to unravel the glyco-code in cancer related to clinical outcome or biomarker development.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT), a nine amino acid peptide produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary, has well-known actions in parturition, lactation, and social behavior1, and has become an intriguing therapeutic target for diseases like autism and schizophrenia2. Exogenous OXT has also been shown to promote weight loss, among other beneficial metabolic effects1,3, suggesting that its therapeutic potential may extend to diabetes and obesity1,4. It is unclear, however, whether endogenous OXT participates in metabolic homeostasis. Here we show that OXT is a critical regulator of adipose tissue lipolysis in both mice and humans. In addition, OXT serves to license the ability of {beta}- adrenergic agonists to fully promote lipolysis. Most surprisingly, the relevant source of OXT in these metabolic actions is a previously unidentified subpopulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive sympathetic neurons. Our data reveal that OXT from the peripheral nervous system is an endogenous regulator of adipose and systemic metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining normal potassium (K+) concentrations in the extra- and intracellular fluid is critical for cell function. K+ homeostasis is achieved by ensuring proper distribution between extra- and intracellular fluid compartments and by matching K+ excretion with intake. The Na+-K+-ATPase pump facilitates K+ uptake into the skeletal muscle, where most K+ is stored. Na+-K+-ATPase activity is stimulated by insulin and aldosterone. The kidneys regulate long term K+ regulation by controlling the amount of K+ excreted through urine. Renal handling of K+ is mediated by a number of regulatory mechanisms, including an aldosterone-mediated feedback control, in which high extracellular K+ concentration stimulates aldosterone secretion which enhances urine K+ excretion, and a gastrointestinal feedforward control mechanism, in which dietary K+ intake increases K+ excretion. Recently, a muscle-kidney cross talk signal has been hypothesized, where the K+ concentration in skeletal muscle cells directly affects urine K+ excretion without changes in extracellular K+ concentration. To understand how these mechanisms coordinate under different K+ challenges, we have developed a compartmental model of whole-body K+ regulation. The model represents the intra- and extracellular fluid compartments in a human (male) as well as a detailed kidney compartment. We included (i) the gastrointestinal feedforward control mechanism, (ii) the effect of insulin and (iii) aldosterone on Na+-K+-ATPase K+ uptake, and (iv) aldosterone stimulation of renal K+ secretion. We used this model to investigate the impact of regulatory mechanisms on K+ homeostasis. Model predictions showed how the regulatory mechanisms synthesize to ensure that the extra- and intracelluller fluid K+ concentrations remain in normal range in times of K+ loading and fasting. Additionally, we predict that without the hypothesized muscle-kidney cross talk signal, the model was unable to predict a return to normal extracellular K+ concentration after a period of high K+ loading or depletion.\n\nAuthor summaryPotassium (K+) homeostasis is crucial for normal cell function. Dysregulation of K+ can have dangerous consequences and is a common side effect of pathologies, medications, or changes in hormone levels. Due to its complexities, how the body maintains extra- and intracellular K+ concentrations each day is not fully understood. Of particular interest is capturing how regulatory mechanisms synthesize to be able to keep extracellullar K+ concentration within a tight range of 3.5-5.0 mEq/L. There are a multitude of physiological processes involved in K+ balance, making its study well suited for investigation using mathematical modeling. In this study, we developed a compartment model of extra- and intracellular K+ regulation including the various regulatory mechanisms and a detailed kidney model. The significance of our research is to quantify the effect of individual regulatory mechanisms on K+ regulation as well as predict the potential impact of a hypothesized signal: muscle-kidney cross talk.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of QT interval variation have identified common noncoding variants at the NOS1AP gene as the most common genetic regulators of trait variation in the general population. Invoking a cis-regulatory mechanistic hypothesis, we have reported identification of a functional enhancer variant underlying the GWAS signal that influenced human cardiac NOS1AP expression. Functional studies based on in vitro overexpression in murine cardiomyocytes and ex vivo knockdown in zebrafish embryonic hearts, by us and others, have demonstrated that NOS1AP expression levels can alter cellular electrophysiology. Here, to explore the role of NOS1AP in cardiac electrophysiology at an organismal level, we generated and characterized constitutive and heart muscle-restricted Nos1ap knockout mice to assess whether NOS1AP disruption alters the QT interval in vivo. Constitutive loss of Nos1ap led to genetic background-dependent variable lethality at or right before birth. Heart muscle-restricted Nos1ap knockouts generated using cardiac specific alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter-driven tamoxifen-inducible Cre resulted in tissue-level Nos1ap expression reduced by half. This partial loss of expression had no detectable effect on the QT interval, but led to a small yet significant reduction in the QRS interval. Given that challenges associated with defining the end of T wave on murine electrocardiogram can limit identification of subtle effects on QT interval, and that common noncoding NOS1AP variants are also associated with QRS interval, our findings support the role of NOS1AP in regulation of the cardiac electrical cycle.",

    "abstract": "To survive, insects must effectively navigate odors plumes to their source. In natural plumes, turbulent winds break up smooth odor regions into disconnected patches, so navigators encounter brief bursts of odor interrupted by bouts of clean air. The timing of these encounters plays a critical role in navigation, determining the direction, rate, and magnitude of insects orientation and speed dynamics. Still, disambiguating the specific role of odor timing from other cues, such as spatial structure, is challenging due to natural correlations between plumes temporal and spatial features. Here, we use optogenetics to isolate temporal features of odor signals, examining how the frequency and duration of odor encounters shape the navigational decisions of freely-walking Drosophila. We find that fly angular velocity depends on signal frequency and intermittency - fraction of time signal can be detected - but not directly on durations. Rather than switching strategies when signal statistics change, flies smoothly transition between signal regimes, by combining an odor offset response with a frequency-dependent novelty-like response. In the latter, flies are more likely to turn in response to each odor hit only when the hits are sparse. Finally, the upwind bias of individual turns relies on a filtering scheme with two distinct timescales, allowing rapid and sustained responses in a variety of signal statistics. A quantitative model incorporating these ingredients recapitulates fly orientation dynamics across a wide range of environments.",

Following glucose administration, mice demonstrate increased circulating ATP concentrations, which are prevented by metformin.

In addition, metformin-dependent improvement in glucose tolerance is abolished in P2Y2R-null mice.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSurgical insertion of a ventricular shunt initiates a cytokine response shown to play a role in shunt failure caused by obstruction. These pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines cause astrocytes, amongst others, to enter an activated state which causes an increase in attachment. 4,5-Dihydro-3-phenyl-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (GIT 27) is a reagent with immunomodulatory properties which acts by blocking the main signaling protein on astrocytes and microglia called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4).\n\nMethodsIn this experiment, we tested the effect of GIT 27 on astrocytes when used as a pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post-treatment relative to shunt insertion represented by the introduction of IL-1{beta} or IL-10. Control, DMSO vehicle control, and GIT 27 treated sample groups were assayed for cell counts and cytokine concentration data.\n\nResultsExposure of astrocytes to suspended GIT 27 in a DMSO vehicle caused a decrease in cell attachment and a significant decrease in the concentration of the majority of cytokines. Comparisons of GIT 27 exposure times, represented by pre-, simultaneous, and post-treatment groups, showed that pre-treatment with GIT 27 is most effective at decreasing cellular attachment where post-treatment was generally the most effective at decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. In future practice, this could be embodied by pharmacologic dosing prior to shunting and/or slow release from the shunt surface.\n\nConclusionsGIT 27 is most effective at decreasing cell counts and cytokines when in-suspension compared to when attached to the shunt surface. Our data show that GIT 27 has the potential to be used as an effective way to modulate the cytokine response associated with shunt insertion.",

To build upon prior research, we investigated how sample preservation and storage choices impact observed absolute microbial load and relative metagenomic and metatranscriptomic measurements. Specifically, we studied how two common stool preservatives (OMNIgene GUT OMR200 and Zymo DNA/RNA PowerShield) perform across a range of storage temperatures (-80{degrees}C, 23{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C). For immediately frozen samples with no preservatives, we observed a mean colonic load of [~]100 trillion (1.2 x 1014) prokaryotes across ten donors, revising the gut prokaryote:human cell ratio of [~]1:1 to [~]4:1. We found that both preservatives introduce significant bias in the metagenomics results; and, while OMNIgene results were robust to storage temperature, samples stored in Zymo preservative had further bias with increasing storage temperatures. In terms of measured composition, we observed a [~]1.9x and [~]1.5x difference in the metagenomic Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio in OMNIgene and Zymo preservatives, respectively. Absolute abundance measurements revealed that these differences are driven by higher measured Bacteroidetes in OMNIgene-preserved samples and lower measured Firmicutes in Zymo-preserved samples. For metatranscriptomic measurements, we also found that both preservatives introduced bias, but that RNA likely degraded in samples stored in OMNIgene preservative at high temperature. In summary, we recommend the OMNIgene preservative for studies that include significant field components. For metatranscriptomics studies, we recommend kits rated for RNA preservation such as the Zymo kit; however, existing samples collected in non-RNA rated kits might also be viable for limited metatranscriptomic studies. This study demonstrates how sample collection and storage choices can affect measured microbiome research outcomes, makes additional concrete suggestions for sample handling best practices, and demonstrates the importance of including absolute abundance measurements in microbiome studies.",

    "abstract": "A. fumigatus is the main etiological agent of a group of heterogeneous diseases called aspergillosis of which the most lethal form is the invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Fungicidal azoles and amphotericin B are the first line defense against A. fumigatus, but fungistatic echinocandins, such as caspofungin (CAS), can be used as salvage therapy for IPA. Here, we screened repurposing libraries and identified several compounds that potentiate CAS activity against A. fumigatus, including the host defense peptide mimetic, brilacidin (BRI). BRI converts CAS into a fungicidal drug and potentiates voriconazole (VOR) against A. fumigatus. BRI increases the ability of both CAS and VOR to control A. fumigatus biofilm growth. BRI depolarizes the A. fumigatus cell membrane leading to disruption of membrane potential. By using a combination of protein kinase inhibitors and screening of a catalytic subunit null mutant library, we identified the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) MpkA and the phosphatase calcineurin as mediators of the synergistic action of BRI. These results suggest the most likely BRI mechanism of action for CAS potentiation is the inhibition of A. fumigatus cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. BRI potentiates CAS activity against C. albicans, C. auris, and C. neoformans. Interestingly, BRI overcomes the CAS-acquired resistance in both A. fumigatus and C. albicans and the CAS-intrinsic resistance in C. neoformans. BRI also has an additive effect on the activity of posaconazole (POSA) against several Mucorales fungi. Cell toxicity assays and fungal burden studies in an immunosuppressed murine model of IPA showed that BRI combined with CAS is not toxic to the cells and significantly clears A. fumigatus lung infection, respectively. Our results indicate that combinations of BRI and antifungal drugs in clinical use are likely to improve the treatment outcome of IPA and other fungal infections.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection exerts a profound shut-off of host gene expression at multiple levels. Recently, HSV-1 infection was reported to also impact promoter-proximal RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) pausing, a key step in the eukaryotic transcription cycle, with decreased and increased Pol II pausing observed for activated and repressed genes, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that HSV-1 infection induces more complex alterations in promoter-proximal pausing than previously suspected for the vast majority of cellular genes. While pausing is generally retained, it is shifted to more downstream and less well-positioned sites for most host genes. We exclude that this is an artefact of alternative de novo transcription initiation at downstream sites or read-in transcription originating from disruption of transcription termination for upstream genes. Use of downstream 2nd pause sites associated with +1 nucleosomes was previously observed upon NELF depletion. However, downstream shifts of Pol II pausing upon HSV-1 infection are much more pronounced than observed upon NELF depletion. Thus, our study reveals a novel aspect in which HSV-1 infection fundamentally reshapes host transcriptional processes with implications for our understanding of maintenance of promoter-proximal Pol II pausing in eukaryotic cells.",

    "abstract": "As stem cells divide, they acquire mutations that can be passed on to daughter cells. To limit the possibility of propagating mutations, cells activate the DNA damage response (DDR) network, which dictates whether cells repair DNA or undergo apoptosis. At the helm of the DDR are three PI3-like kinases including Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM). We report here that knockdown of ATM in planarian flatworms enables stem cells, which normally undergo apoptosis after radiation exposure, to survive lethal doses of radiation. In this context, stem cells circumvent apoptosis, replicate their DNA, and recover function using homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. Despite radiation exposure, atm knockdown animals survive long-term and regenerate new tissues. These effects occur independently of ATMs canonical downstream effector p53. Together, our results demonstrate that ATMs primary function is to drive apoptosis, and suggest that inhibition of ATM could therefore potentially favor cell survival after radiation without adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous activity of neural cells is a hallmark of the developing nervous system. It is widely accepted that chemical signals, like neurotransmitters, contribute to spontaneous activity in the nervous system. Here we reveal an additional mechanism of spontaneous activity that is mechanosensitive in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) using intravital imaging of growing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in zebrafish embryos. GCaMP6s imaging shows that developing DRG satellite glia contain distinct spontaneous Ca2+ transients, classified into simultaneous, isolated and microdomains. Longitudinal analysis over days in development demonstrates that as DRG satellite glia become more synchronized, isolated Ca2+ transients remain constant. Using a chemical screen, we identify that Ca2+ transients in DRG glia are dependent on mechanical properties, which we confirmed using an experimental application of mechanical force. We find that isolated spontaneous Ca2+ transients of the glia during development is altered by manipulation of mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, which is expressed in the developing ganglia. In contrast, simultaneous Ca2+ transients of DRG satellite glia is not Piezo1-mediated, thus demonstrating that distinct mechanisms mediate subtypes of spontaneous Ca2+ transients. Activating Piezo1 eventually impacts the cell abundance of DRG cells and behaviors that are driven by DRG neurons. Together, our results reveal mechanistically distinct subtypes of Ca2+ transients in satellite glia and introduce mechanobiology as a critical component of spontaneous activity in the developing peripheral nervous system.",

We previously proposed chromosomal aneuploidy and missense mutations as two potential modes of adaptation to histone humanization. Here we show that aneuploidy in histone-humanized yeasts is specific to a subset of chromosomes, defined by their centromeric evolutionary origins, however, they are not adaptive. Instead we show that a set of missense mutations in outer kineto-chore proteins drive adaptation to human histones. Further, we characterize the molecular mechanism of two mutants of the outer kinetochore DASH/Dam1 complex, which reduce aneuploidy by suppression of chromosome instability. Molecular modeling and biochemical experiments show that these two mutants likely disrupt a conserved oligomerization interface thereby weakening microtubule attachments. Lastly, we show that one mutant, DAD1E50D, while suppressing chromosome instability in mitosis, leads to gross defects in meiosis. In sum, our data show how a set of point mutations evolved in the histone-humanized yeasts to counterbalance human histone induced chromosomal instability through weakening microtubule interactions, eventually promoting a return to euploidy.",

    "abstract": "The conformational stability of the proteome has tremendous implications for the health of the cell and its capacity to determine longevity or susceptibility to age-associated degenerative diseases. For humans, this question of proteome conformational stability has the additional complexity from non-synonymous mutations in thousands of protein coding genes challenging the capacity of the proteostasis network to properly fold, transport, assemble and degrade proteins. Here, we quantify the proteome-wide capacity to such challenges using the isogenic organism Caenorhabditis elegans by examining the dynamics of global proteome conformational stability in animals expressing different temperature-sensitive (ts) proteins or short polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions in the context of biological aging. Using limited proteolysis of native extracts together with tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics, we identify proteins that become metastable under these conditions and monitor the effects on proteome solubility and abundance. Expression of different mutant proteins in the same tissue identifies hundreds to a thousand proteins that become metastable affecting multiple compartments and processes in a cell autonomous and non-autonomous manner. Comparison of the network of metastable proteins, however, reveals only a small number of common proteins. The most dramatic effects on global proteome dynamics occur in aging with one-third of the proteome undergoing conformational changes in early adulthood. These age-dependent metastable proteins overlap substantially with ts proteins and polyQ; moreover, expression of polyQ accelerates the aging phenotype. Together, these results reveal that the proteome responds to misfolding one-at-a-time to generate a metastable sub-proteome network with features of a fingerprint for which aging is the dominant determinant of proteome metastability.",

    "abstract": "The single alpha helix (SAH) is a recurring motif in biology. The consensus sequence has a di-block architecture that includes repeats of four consecutive glutamate residues followed by four consecutive lysine residues. Measurements show that the overall helicity of sequences with consensus E4K4 repeats is insensitive to a wide range of pH values. Here, we use the recently introduced q-canonical ensemble, which allows us to decouple measurements of charge state and conformation, to explain the observed insensitivity of SAH helicity to pH. We couple the outputs from separate measurements of charge and conformation with atomistic simulations to derive residue-specific quantifications of preferences for being in an alpha helix and for the ionizable residues to be charged vs. uncharged. We find a clear preference for accommodating uncharged Glu residues within internal positions of SAH-forming sequences. The stabilities of alpha helical conformations increase with the number of E4K4 repeats and so do the numbers of accessible charge states that are compatible with forming conformations of high helical content. There is conformational buffering whereby charge state heterogeneity buffers against large-scale conformational changes thus making the overall helicity insensitive to large changes in pH. Further, the results clearly argue against a single, rod-like alpha helical conformation being the only or even dominant conformation in the ensembles of so-called SAH sequences.",

However, the low overall response rate and high incidence of drug resistance largely damage the clinical benefits of existing immune checkpoint therapies. Recent studies correlate the response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with PD-L1 expression levels in tumor cells. Hence, identifying molecular targets and pathways controlling PD-L1 protein expression and stability in tumor cells is a major priority.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we first performed a Stress and Proteostasis CRISPR interference library-based screening to identify PD-L1 positive modulators. We then used in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the biological function and mechanism of TRAF6 and its downstream YAP1/TFCP2 signaling in malignant melanoma.\n\nResultsHere, we identified TRAF6 as a critical regulator of PD-L1 in melanoma cells. Suppression of TRAF6 expression down-regulates PD-L1 expression on the membrane surface of melanoma cells. We also found that PD-L1 protein abundance is regulated by YAP1/TFCP2 transcriptional complex. TRAF6 stabilizes YAP1 by K63 poly-ubiquitination modification, subsequently promoting the formation of YAP1/TFCP2 and PD-L1 transcription. Furthermore, inhibition of TRAF6 by Bortezomib enhanced cytolytic activity of CD8+ T cells by reduction of endogenous PD-L1. Notably, Bortezomib enhances anti-tumor immunity to an extent that is comparable to anti-PD-1 mAb therapies with no obvious toxicity.\n\nConclusionsThese findings uncover a novel molecular mechanism for regulating PD-L1 protein abundance by a E3 ligase in cancer cells and reveal the potential of using TRAF6 inhibitors to stimulate internal anti-tumor immunological effect for TRAF6-PD-L1 overexpressing cancers.",

Through mutational spectrum analysis, we found a significant reduction in G>T mutations in Omicron, which replicates in the upper respiratory tract (URT), compared to other lineages, which replicate in both upper and lower respiratory tracts (LRT). Mutational analysis of other viruses and bacteria indicates a robust, generalisable association of high G>T mutations with replication within the LRT. Monitoring G>T mutation rates over time, we found early separation of Omicron from Beta, Gamma and Delta, while the mutational burden in Alpha varied consistent with changes in transmission source as social restrictions were lifted.

Serine proteases, such as TMPRSS2 and trypsin, promote viral entry.\n\nIn this study, we investigated whether proteases increased SARS-CoV-2 infectivity using pseudotyped viruses and clinical specimens from patients with COVID-19. First, we investigated how trypsin increased infectivity using the pseudotyped virus. Our findings revealed that trypsin increased infectivity after the virus was adsorbed on the cells, but no increase in infectivity was observed when the virus was treated with trypsin. We examined the effect of trypsin on SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical specimens and found that the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant increased 36,000-fold after trypsin treatment. By contrast, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant increased to less than 20-fold in the clinical specimens. Finally, infectivity of clinical specimens containing culture supernatants of Fusobacterium necrophorum was increased from several- to 10-fold.

    "abstract": "The constant domains of antibodies are important for effector functions, but less is known about how they can affect binding and neutralization of viruses. Here we evaluated a panel of human influenza virus monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) expressed as IgG1, IgG2 or IgG3. We found that many influenza virus-specific mAbs have altered binding and neutralization capacity depending on the IgG subclass encoded, and that these differences result from unique bivalency capacities of the subclasses. Importantly, subclass differences in antibody binding and neutralization were greatest when the affinity for the target antigen was reduced through antigenic mismatch. We found that antibodies expressed as IgG3 bound and neutralized antigenically drifted influenza viruses more effectively. We obtained similar results using a panel of SARS-CoV-2-specific mAbs and the antigenically advanced B.1.351 strain of SARS-CoV-2. We found that a licensed therapeutic mAb retained neutralization breadth against SARS-CoV-2 variants when expressed as IgG3, but not IgG1. These data highlight that IgG subclasses are not only important for fine-tuning effector functionality, but also for binding and neutralization of antigenically drifted viruses.\n\nSignificanceInfluenza viruses and coronaviruses undergo continuous change, successfully evading human antibodies elicited from prior infections or vaccinations. It is important to identify features that allow antibodies to bind with increased breadth. Here we examined the effect that different IgG subclasses have on monoclonal antibody binding and neutralization. We show that IgG subclass is a determinant of antibody breadth, with IgG3 affording increased neutralization of antigenically drifted variants of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Future studies should evaluate IgG3 therapeutic antibodies and vaccination strategies or adjuvants that may skew antibody responses toward broadly reactive isotypes.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) is one of the promising therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. Nirmatrelvir is the only the 3CLpro inhibitor authorized for treatment of COVID-19 patients at high risk of hospitalization; other 3Lpro inhibitors are in development. We recently repored on the in vitro selection of a SARS-CoV2 3CLpro (L50F-E166A-L167F; short 3CLprores) virus that is cross-resistant with nirmatrelvir and yet other 3CLpro inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that the resistant virus replicates efficiently in the lungs of intranassaly infected hamsters and that it causes a lung pathology that is comparable to that caused by the WT virus. Moreover, 3CLprores infected hamsters transmit the virus efficiently to co-housed non-infected contact hamsters. Fortunately, resistance to Nirmatrelvir does not readily develop (in the clinical setting) since the drug has a relatively high barrier to resistance. Yet, as we demonstrate, in case resistant viruses emerge, they may easily spread and impact therapeutic options for others. Therefore, the use of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protease inhibitors in combinations with drugs that have a different mechanism of action, may be considered to avoid the development of drug-resistant viruses in the future.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbial communities protect the host against a variety of major human gastrointestinal pathogens. Bacteriophages (phages) are ubiquitous in nature and frequently ingested via food and drinking water. Moreover, they are an attractive tool for microbiome engineering due to the lack of known serious adverse effects on the host. However, the functional role of phages within the gastrointestinal microbiome remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of microbiota-directed phages on infection with the human enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm), using a gnotobiotic mouse model (OMM12) for colonization resistance (CR). We show that phage cocktails targeting Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis acted in a strain-specific manner. They transiently reduced the population density of their respective target before establishing coexistence for up to 9 days. Infection susceptibility to S. Tm was markedly increased at an early time point after phage challenge. Surprisingly, OMM12 mice were more susceptible 7 days after a single phage inoculation, when the targeted bacterial populations were back to pre-phage administration density. The presence of phages that dynamically modulates the density of protective members of the gut microbiota provides opportunities for invasion of bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The lowland Amazon rainforest houses some of the greatest tree diversity on earth. While the vast majority of these species are rare, a small number are common and widespread and thus considered to play a disproportionate role in many of the global ecosystem services provided by the Amazon. However, the extent to which dominant Amazonian tree species actually include multiple clades, each on their own unique evolutionary trajectory, is unknown. Here we investigate the extent to which lineage divergence may be occurring within Protium subserratum (Burseraceae), a common and widespread tree species that is monophyletic with populations exhibiting genotypic and phenotypic differences associated with soil and geography. Utilizing a combination of phylogenomic and population genomic methods with sampling from across the range, we found that P. subserratum contains at least eight distinct clades. Specialization onto white-sand soils has evolved independently at least two times within the species; however, phenotype is not correlated with soil type. Finally, cryptic diversity at the base of the Andes is associated with elevational shifts. Together these results lend support to the hypothesis that common and widespread Amazon tree species may not represent evolutionary cohesive units. Instead, these dominant species may more commonly represent species complexes, undergoing evolutionary transitions on a trajectory to become multiple range restricted, specialist species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) still has limited treatment options partially due to our incomplete understanding of the molecular dysregulations of the COVID-19 patients. We aimed to generate a repository and data analysis tools to examine the modulated proteins underlying COVID-19 patients for the discovery of potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers.\n\nMethodsWe built a web server containing proteomic expression data from COVID-19 patients with a toolset for user-friendly data analysis and visualization. The web resource covers expert-curated proteomic data from COVID-19 patients published before May 2022. The data were collected from ProteomeXchange and from select publications via PubMed searches and aggregated into a comprehensive dataset. Protein expression by disease subgroups across projects was compared by examining differentially expressed proteins. We also visualize differentially expressed pathways and proteins. Moreover, circulating proteins that differentiated severe cases were nominated as predictive biomarkers.\n\nFindingsWe built and maintain a web server COVIDpro (https://www.guomics.com/covidPro/) containing proteomics data generated by 41 original studies from 32 hospitals worldwide, with data from 3077 patients covering 19 types of clinical specimens, the majority from plasma and sera. 53 protein expression matrices were collected, for a total of 5434 samples and 14,403 unique proteins. Our analyses showed that the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, as identified in the majority of the studies, was highly expressed in the blood samples of patients with severe disease. A panel of significantly dysregulated proteins was identified to separate patients with severe disease from non-severe disease. Classification of severe disease based on these proteomic signatures on five test sets reached a mean AUC of 0.87 and ACC of 0.80.\n\nInterpretationCOVIDpro is an online database with an integrated analysis toolkit. It is a unique and valuable resource for testing hypotheses and identifying proteins or pathways that could be targeted by new treatments of COVID-19 patients.\n\nFundingNational Key R&D Program of China: Key PDPM technologies (2021YFA1301602, 2021YFA1301601, 2021YFA1301603), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (LR19C050001), Hangzhou Agriculture and Society Advancement Program (20190101A04), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81972492) and National Science Fund for Young Scholars (21904107), National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS-P41 GM103504)\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAlthough an increasing number of therapies against COVID-19 are being developed, they are still insufficient, especially with the rise of new variants of concern. This is partially due to our incomplete understanding of the diseases mechanisms. As data have been collected worldwide, several questions are now worth addressing via meta-analyses. Most COVID-19 drugs function by targeting or affecting proteins. Effectiveness and resistance to therapeutics can be effectively assessed via protein measurements. Empowered by mass spectrometry-based proteomics, protein expression has been characterized in a variety of patient specimens, including body fluids (e.g., serum, plasma, urea) and tissue (i.e., formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)). We expert-curated proteomic expression data from COVID-19 patients published before May 2022, from the largest proteomic data repository ProteomeXhange as well as from literature search engines. Using this resource, a COVID-19 proteome meta-analysis could provide useful insights into the mechanisms of the disease and identify new potential drug targets.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe integrated many published datasets from patients with COVID-19 from 11 nations, with over 3000 patients and more than 5434 proteome measurements. We collected these datasets in an online database, and generated a toolbox to easily explore, analyze, and visualize the data. Next, we used the database and its associated toolbox to identify new proteins of diagnostic and therapeutic value for COVID-19 treatment. In particular, we identified a set of significantly dysregulated proteins for distinguishing severe from non-severe patients using serum samples.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceCOVIDpro will support the navigation and analysis of patterns of dysregulated proteins in various COVID-19 clinical specimens for identification and verification of protein biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "PurposeFibulin-3 (F3) or EFEMP1 is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein implicated in several ocular diseases. Little is known about the native biology of this protein. Thus, our study aims to determine expression and localization characteristics of F3 utilizing a range of mammalian species as well as F3-associated changes with age.\n\nMethodsGene expression analyses for fibulins as well as immunohistochemistry for F3 were conducted in ocular tissue from mice, pigs, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans (n = 3-5). Age-based F3 expression study along with changes in ECM remodeling enzymes was also evaluated in mice.\n\nResultsWithin the mouse retina, F3 staining was consistent throughout the entirety of the retina (far-periphery, mid-periphery, and central), being enriched in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer (INL). However, in humans, the F3 staining pattern was quite unique; enriched in the RPE, INL, and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the peripheral retina, but then shifting to predominantly outer plexiform layer (OPL) staining in the central retina and macula with waning RPE immunoreactivity approaching the fovea. We demonstrate that F3 expression in the mouse retina significantly increases with age, and the levels of extracellular F3 degrading enzymes produced by the RPE and retina (e.g., Mmp2 and Htra1) decrease with age.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that F3 has distinct species-dependent as well as ocular region-specific expression and localization patterns. We also show that F3 and ECM enzyme dynamics favor F3 accumulation in the retina and RPE with increasing age.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of the role of sex in studies of genetic architecture for complex traits and diseases will help translate genetic data into improved precision-based medicine and clinical care. Towards this end, we explored the use of sex-stratified versus sex-combined analyses for several metabolic and blood traits in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP). Traits such as body weight and glucose levels exhibited a high degree of genetic correlation between males and females whereas other traits such as HDL levels and white blood count did not. Nonetheless, even with the high genetic correlation between males and females for body weight, the use of sex-stratified analyses enabled the identification of dozens of loci regulating adiposity not identified in sex-combined analyses or sex-stratified analyses in the opposite sex. In addition, comparisons of the direction of allelic effects in males and females detected in the sex-stratified analyses demonstrated a high concordance, even among loci that were not statistically significant using a conventional p-value threshold. Simulation studies indicated that these elevated concordance rates were consistent with a genetic architecture consisting of hundreds of additive loci regulating every trait analyzed, including those for which no statistically significant loci were identified. These findings demonstrate the importance of stratifying by sex and suggest a method for identifying biologically rather than statistically significant associations. Applying these methods to GWAS data broadly may result in the identification of many additional loci contributing to the genetic architecture of complex traits that were missed using conventional sex-adjusted GWAS methods.",

    "abstract": "Applications of graph theory to the connectome have inspired several models of how neural signaling unfolds atop its structure. Analytic measures derived from these communication models have mainly been used to extract global characteristics of brain networks, obscuring potentially informative interregional relationships. Here we develop a simple standardization method to investigate polysynaptic communication pathways between pairs of cortical regions. This procedure allows us to determine which pairs of nodes are topologically closer and which are further than expected on the basis of their degree. We find that communication pathways delineate canonical functional systems. Relating nodal communication capacity to meta-analytic probabilistic patterns of functional specialization, we also show that areas that are most closely integrated within the network are associated with higher-order cognitive functions. We find that these regions proclivity towards functional integration could naturally arise from the brains anatomical configuration through evenly distributed connections among multiple specialized communities. Throughout, we consider two increasingly constrained null models to disentangle the effects of the networks topology from those passively endowed by spatial embedding. Altogether, the present findings uncover relationships between polysynaptic communication pathways and the brains functional organization across multiple topological levels of analysis and demonstrate that network integration facilitates cognitive integration.",
