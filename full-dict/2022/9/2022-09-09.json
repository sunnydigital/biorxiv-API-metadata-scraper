    "abstract": "Lactobacilli are gram-positive bacteria that are growing in importance for the healthcare industry and genetically engineering them as living therapeutics is highly sought after. However, progress in this field is hindered since most strains are difficult to genetically manipulate, partly due since their complex and thick cell walls limit our capability to transform them with exogenous DNA. To overcome this, large amounts of DNA (>1 g) are normally required to successfully transform these bacteria. An intermediate host, like E. coli, is often used to amplify recombinant DNA to such amounts although this approach poses unwanted drawbacks such as increase in plasmid size, different methylation patterns and limitation of introducing only genes compatible with the intermediate host. In this work, we have developed a direct cloning method based on Gibson assembly and PCR to amplify the DNA to sufficient quantities for successful transformation in L. plantarum WCFS1. This advantage of this method is demonstrated in terms of shorter experimental duration and the possibility to introduce a gene incompatible with E. coli into L. plantarum WCFS1.",

    "abstract": "Computational T-cell epitope prediction is essential in many immunological projects, including the development of vaccines. T-cells of immunocompetent vertebrate hosts can recognize as non-self only peptides which are present in the parasites proteins and absent in the hosts proteins. This basic principle allows us to predict which peptides can elicit T-cells response. We built on the fact that the specificity of T-cells reacting to SARS-CoV-2 antigens has been recently mapped in detail. Using Monte Carlo tests, we found that empirically confirmed peptides that stimulate T-cells contain an increased fraction of pentapeptides, hexapeptides, and heptapeptides which are not found in the human proteome (p < 0.0001). Similarly, hexapeptides absent in human proteins were overrepresented in peptides that elicited T-cell response in a published empirical study (p = 0.027). The new theory-based method predicted T-cell immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides four times more effectively than current empirically based methods.",

    "abstract": "Petroleum reservoirs within the deep biosphere are extreme environments inhabited by diverse microbial communities creating biogeochemical hotspots in the subsurface. Despite their ecological and industrial importance, systematic studies of core microbial taxa and associated genomic attributes of the oil reservoir microbiome are limited. This study compiles and compares 343 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries and 25 shotgun metagenomic libraries from oil reservoirs in different parts of the world. Taxonomic composition varies among reservoirs with different physicochemical characteristics, and with geographic distance. Despite oil reservoirs lacking a taxonomic core microbiome in these datasets, gene-centric metagenomic analysis reveals a functional core featuring carbon acquisition and energy conservation strategies consistent with other deep biosphere environments. Genes for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation are observed in a subset of the samples and are therefore not considered to represent core biogeochemical functions in oil reservoirs. Metabolic redundancy within the petroleum reservoir microbiome reveals these to be deep biosphere systems poised to respond to changes in redox biogeochemistry. This highlights the potential to use microbial genomics for predicting microbial responses to (bio)engineering perturbations to these subsurface habitats.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread apicomplexan parasite that can cause severe disease in its human hosts. The ability of T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites to invade into, egress from, and move between cells of the hosts they infect is critical to parasite virulence and disease progression. An unusual and highly conserved parasite myosin motor (TgMyoA) plays a central role in T. gondii motility. The goal of this work was to test whether pharmacological inhibition of TgMyoA can alter disease progression in an animal model of infection. To this end, we sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of TgMyoA by screening a collection of 50,000 structurally diverse small molecules for inhibitors of the recombinant motors actin-activated ATPase activity. The top hit to emerge from the screen, KNX-002, inhibited TgMyoA with little to no effect on any of the vertebrate myosins tested. KNX-002 was also active against parasites, inhibiting parasite motility and growth in culture in a dose-dependent manner. We used chemical mutagenesis, selection in KNX-002, and targeted sequencing to identify a mutation in TgMyoA (T130A) that renders the recombinant motor less sensitive to compound. Compared to wild-type parasites, parasites expressing the T130A mutation showed reduced sensitivity to KNX-002 in motility and growth assays, confirming TgMyoA as a biologically relevant target of KNX-002. Finally, KNX-002 was shown to slow disease progression in mice infected with wild-type parasites, but not parasites expressing the resistance-conferring TgMyoA T130A mutation. These data demonstrate the specificity of KNX-002 for TgMyoA, both in vitro and in vivo, and validate TgMyoA as a druggable target for toxoplasmosis. Since TgMyoA is essential for virulence, conserved in apicomplexan parasites, and distinctly different from the myosins found in humans, pharmacological inhibition of MyoA offers a promising new approach to treating the devastating diseases caused by T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites.",

    "abstract": "Members of the family Lactobacillaceae, which now includes species formerly belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, but also Leuconostocaceae, are of foremost importance in food fermentations and spoilage, but also as components of animal and human microbiota and as potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Knowledge of the ecological distribution of a given species and genus is important, among other things, for the inclusion in lists of microorganisms with a Qualified Presumption of Safety or with beneficial use. The objective of this work is to use the data in FoodMicrobionet database to obtain quantitative insights (in terms of both abundance and prevalence) on the distribution of these bacteria in foods and food environments.\n\nWe first explored the reliability of taxonomic assignments using the SILVA v138.1 reference database with full length and partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene for type strain sequences. Full length 16S rRNA gene sequences allow a reasonably good classification at the genus and species level in phylogenetic trees but shorter sequences (V1-V3, V3-V4, V4) perform much worse, with type strains of many species sharing identical V4 and V3-V4 sequences. Taxonomic assignment at the genus level of 16S rRNA genes sequences and the SILVA v138.1 reference database can be done for almost all genera of the family Lactobacillaceae with a high degree of confidence for full length sequences, and with a satisfactory level of accuracy for the V1-V3 regions. Results for the V3-V4 and V4 region are still acceptable but significantly worse. Taxonomic assignment at the species level for sequences for the V1-V3, V3-V4, V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of members of the family Lactobacillaceae is hardly possible and, even for full length sequences, and only 49.9% of the type strain sequences can be unambiguously assigned to species.\n\nWe then used the FoodMicrobionet database to evaluate the prevalence and abundance of Lactobacillaceae in food samples and in food related environments. Generalist and specialist genera were clearly evident. The ecological distribution of several genera was confirmed and insights on the distribution and potential origin of rare genera (Dellaglioa, Holzapfelia, Schleiferilactobacillus) were obtained.\n\nWe also found that combining Amplicon Sequence Variants from different studies is indeed possible, but provides little additional information, even when strict criteria are used for the filtering of sequences.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a serious complication of diabetes mellitus that burden patients and health care systems. Staphylococcus aureus is prevalent and abundant in the DFU microbiome, and strain-level differences in S. aureus may drive clinical outcomes. To identify mechanisms underlying strain-specific outcomes in DFU with S. aureus, we performed high-throughput phenotyping screens on a collection of 221 S. aureus cultured isolates from clinically uninfected DFU. Of the 4 phenotypes examined (in vitro biofilm formation and production of staphylokinase, staphyloxanthin, and siderophores), we discovered that isolates from non-healing wounds produced more staphyloxanthin, a carotenoid cell membrane pigment. In a murine diabetic wound healing model, staphyloxanthin-producing isolates delayed wound closure significantly compared to staphyloxanthin-deficient isolates. Staphyloxanthin promoted resistance to oxidative stress in vitro and enhanced bacterial survival in human neutrophils. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of genetically similar clinical isolates with disparate staphyloxanthin phenotypes revealed a mutation in the Sigma B regulatory pathway that resulted in marked differences in stress response gene expression. Our findings suggest that staphyloxanthin production delays wound healing by protecting S. aureus from neutrophil-mediated oxidative stress, and may provide a target for therapeutic intervention in S. aureus-positive wounds.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria catalyze the formation and destruction of soil organic matter, but the bacterial dynamics in soil that govern carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. Life history strategies explain the complex dynamics of bacterial populations and activities based on tradeoffs in energy allocation to growth, resource acquisition, and survival. Such tradeoffs influence the fate of soil C, but their genomic basis remains poorly characterized. We used multi-substrate metagenomic DNA stable isotope probing to link genomic features of bacteria to their C acquisition and growth dynamics. We identify several genomic features associated with patterns of bacterial C acquisition and growth, notably genomic investment in resource acquisition and regulatory flexibility. Moreover, we identify genomic tradeoffs defined by numbers of transcription factors, membrane transporters, and secreted products, which match predictions from life history theory. We further show that genomic investment in resource acquisition and regulatory flexibility can predict bacterial ecological strategies in soil.",

    "abstract": "piRNAs play pivotal roles in suppressing transposons, maintaining genome stability, regulating gene expression, and modulating development and immunity. However, there are few piRNA-associated studies on honey bee, and the regulatory role of piRNAs in the development of bee guts is largely unknown. In this current work, the differential expression pattern of piRNAs during the developmental process of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) was analyzed, and target prediction of differentially expressed piRNAs (DEpiRNAs) was then conducted, followed by investigation of regulatory networks and the potential function of DEpiRNAs in regulating larval gut development. Here, a total of 843 piRNAs were identified in the larval guts of A. mellifera; among these, 764 piRNAs were shared by 4- (Am4 group), 5- (Am5 group), and 6-day-old (Am6 group) larval guts, while 11, 67, and 1, respectively, were unique. The first base of piRNAs in each group had a cytosine (C) bias. Additionally, 61 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated piR-NAs were identified in the Am4 vs. Am5 comparison group, further targeting 9, 983 genes, which were involved in 50 GO terms and 142 pathways, while two up-regulated and five down-regulated piRNAs were detected in the Am5 vs. Am6 comparison group, further targeting 1, 936 genes, which were engaged in 41 functional terms and 101 pathways. piR-ame-742536 and piR-ame-856650 in the Am4 vs. Am5 comparison group as well as piR-ame-592661 and piR-ame-31653 in the Am5 vs. Am6 comparison group were found to link to the highest number of targets. Further analysis indicated that targets of DEpiRNAs in these two comparison groups were seven development-associated signaling pathways such as Hippo and Notch signaling pathways, seven immune-associated pathways including endocytosis and the Jak/STAT signaling pathway, and three energy metabolism pathways, namely sulfur metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, the expression trends of five randomly selected DEpiRNAs were verified based on stem-loop RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. These results were suggestive of the overall alteration of piRNAs during the larval developmental process and demonstrated that DEpiRNAs potentially modulate development-, immune-, and energy metabolism-associated pathways by regulating expression of corresponding genes via target binding, further affecting the development of A. mellifera larval guts. Our data offer novel insights into the development of bee guts and lay a basis for clarifying the developmental mechanism underlying the larval guts of European honey bee.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is responsible for more than a half million deaths per year. The Plasmodium parasites responsible continue to develop resistance to all known agents, despite treatment with different antimalarial combinations. The atypical Myosin A motor (PfMyoA) is part of a core macromolecular complex called the glideosome, essential for Plasmodium parasite mobility and therefore an attractive drug target. Here, we characterize the interaction of a small molecule (KNX-002) with PfMyoA. KNX-002 inhibits PfMyoA ATPase activity in vitro and blocks asexual blood stage growth of merozoites, one of three motile Plasmodium life-cycle stages. Combining biochemical assays, X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that KNX-002 targets a novel pocket in PfMyoA, sequestering it in a post-rigor state detached from actin. KNX-002 binding affects Mg2+ coordination near ATP, preventing ATP hydrolysis and thus inhibiting motor activity. This first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor of PfMyoA paves the way for developing a new generation of antimalarial treatments.",
