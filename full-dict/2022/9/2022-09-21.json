    "abstract": "With its rising fatality rates, oral cancer is one of the most concerning public health issues. To reduce disease-related mortality and morbidity, advancements in screening and detection are critical. Finding specific biomarkers is one of the most successful approaches for screening, diagnosing, and staging this dreadful disease. In this study differentially expressed genes associated with oral cancer were analyzed using RNASeq to find the potential biomarkers. Functional enrichment of upregulated genes found that 253 genes were present in the plasma membrane. Three clusters were formed using KMean Clustering from the PPI networks, and highly connected hub genes were identified from each cluster. Eventually, expression and survival analyses of hub genes were performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database targeting Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Among those genes, expression levels of eight genes SLC2A1, ITGA6, LAMC2, COL1A2, COL1A1, TNC, THY1, and CD276 have significantly changed in Head and Neck Squamous cell carcinoma. There are reports that suggest these genes were significantly dysregulated in Oral Squamous cell carcinoma and can be explored further as potential biomarkers for margin clearance.",

    "abstract": "Zearalenone (ZEA), a secondary metabolite of Fusarium fungi found in cereal-based foods, promotes the growth of colon, breast, and prostate cancer cells in vitro. However, the lack of animal studies hinders a deeper mechanistic understanding of the cancer-promoting effects of ZEA. This study aimed to determine the effect of ZEA on colon cancer progression and its underlying mechanisms. Through integrative analyses of transcriptomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and host phenotypes, we investigated the impact of a 4-week ZEA intervention on colorectal cancer in xenograft mice. Our results showed a twofold increase in tumor weight with the 4-week ZEA intervention. ZEA exposure significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of BEST4, DGKB, and Ki67 and the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and AKT. Serum metabolomic analysis revealed that the levels of amino acids, including histidine, arginine, citrulline, and glycine, decreased significantly in the ZEA group. Furthermore, ZEA lowered the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota and reduced the abundance of nine genera, including Tuzzerella and Rikenella. Further association analysis indicated that Tuzzerella was negatively associated with the expression of BEST4 and DGKB genes, serum uric acid levels, and tumor weight. Additionally, circulatory hippuric acid levels positively correlated with tumor weight and the expression of oncogenic genes, including ROBO3, JAK3, and BEST4. Altogether, our results indicated that ZEA promotes colon cancer progression by enhancing the BEST4/AKT/ERK1/2 pathway, lowering circulatory amino acid concentrations, altering gut microbiota composition, and suppressing short chain fatty acids production.",
