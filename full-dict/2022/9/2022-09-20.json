    "abstract": "The rise in infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has necessitated a variety of clinical approaches, including the use of antibiotic combinations. Antibiotic susceptibility is affected in part by the growth state of bacteria within various tissues. Here we tested the hypothesis that drug-drug interactions vary in different media, and hence, using a medium that reflects tissue environments will better predict in vivo outcomes. We systematically studied pair-wise antibiotic interactions in three different media (CAMHB, a urine mimetic, and a lung mimetic) using three Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). There were pronounced differences in responses to antibiotic combinations between the three bacterial species grown in the same medium. However, within species, Pa responded to drug combinations similarly when grown in all three different media, whereas Ab responded similarly when grown in CAMHB and a lung mimetic medium. By contrast, drug interactions in Kp were poorly correlated across three different media. To assess whether distinct media were predictive of antibiotic interactions in Kp in the lungs of mice, we developed a treatment strategy and tested three antibiotic combination pairs. Measurements obtained in vitro from lung mimetic medium, but not rich medium, predicted in vivo outcomes. This work demonstrates that antibiotic interactions are highly variable when comparing across three gram-negative pathogens and highlights the importance of growth medium by showing a superior correlation between in vitro interactions in a growth medium that resembles the tissue environment and in vivo outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The structural genes expressing type 1 fimbriae in Escherichia coli alternate between expressed (phase ON) and non-expressed (phase OFF) states due to inversion of the 314-bp fimS genetic switch. The FimB tyrosine integrase inverts fimS by site-specific recombination, alternately connecting and disconnecting the fim operon, encoding the fimbrial subunit protein and its associated secretion and adhesin factors, to and from its transcriptional promoter within fimS. Site-specific recombination by the FimB recombinase becomes biased towards phase ON as DNA supercoiling is relaxed, a condition that occurs when bacteria approach the stationary phase of the growth cycle. This effect can be mimicked in exponential phase cultures by inhibiting the negative DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase. We report that this bias towards phase ON depends on the presence of the Fis nucleoid-associated protein. We mapped the Fis binding to a site within the invertible fimS switch by DNase I footprinting. Disruption of this binding site by base substitution mutagenesis abolishes both Fis binding and the ability of the mutated switch to sustain its phase ON bias when DNA is relaxed, even in bacteria that produce the Fis protein. In addition, the Fis binding site overlaps one of the sites used by the Lrp protein, a known directionality determinant of fimS inversion that also contributes to phase ON bias. The Fis-Lrp relationship at fimS is reminiscent of that between Fis and Xis when promoting DNA-relaxation-dependent excision of bacteriophage {lambda} from the E. coli chromosome. However, unlike the co-binding mechanism used by Fis and Xis at {lambda} attR, the Fis-Lrp relationship at fimS involves competitive binding. We discuss these findings in the context of the link between fimS inversion biasing and the physiological state of the bacterium.",

    "abstract": "A multitude of histone chaperones are required to protect histones after their biosynthesis until DNA deposition. They cooperate through the formation of co-chaperone complexes, but the crosstalk between nucleosome assembly pathways remains enigmatic. Using explorative interactomics approaches, we characterize the organization of the histone H3-H4 chaperones network and define the interplay between histone chaperone systems. We identify and validate several novel histone dependent complexes and predict the structure of the ASF1 and SPT2 co-chaperone complex, expanding the role of ASF1 in histone dynamics. We show that DAXX acts separately from the rest of the network, recruiting heterochromatin factors and promoting lysine 9 tri-methylation of new histone H3.3 prior to deposition onto DNA. With its functionality, DAXX provides a molecular mechanism for de novo heterochromatin assembly. Collectively, our findings provide a new framework for understanding how cells orchestrate histone supply and comply with chromatin dynamics throughout the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Relatively little is known about the first step of insulin synthesis: the translation of the mRNA. Here we show that the translation of D. melanogaster insulin 2 mRNA (dilp2) is controlled by methylation of N6-adenosine (m6A) in the 3 UTR. Mutations in the m6A writer Mettl3 and methylated-residues in the dilp2 3UTR decreased the levels of dilp2 mRNA associated with the polysomes, and the total amount of dilp2 protein produced. This resulted in aberrant energy homeostasis and diabetic-like phenotypes, consistent with the specific function of dilp2 in adult metabolism. Conserved m6A signatures were also identified in the 3 UTRs of vertebrate insulin mRNAs. These data identify m6A as a key regulator of insulin protein synthesis and energy homeostasis in metazoans and demonstrate an essential role for m6A in translation, with important implications for diabetes and metabolic disease.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe most abundant modification in eukaryotic mRNAs controls the synthesis of insulin protein in D. melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) release in the ventral and dorsal striatum has been linked to reward processing and motivation, but there are longstanding controversies about whether DA release in these key target structures primarily reflects costs or benefits, and how these signals vary with motivation. Here we apply behavioral economic principles to generate demand curves for rewards while directly measuring DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) via a genetically-encoded sensor. By independently varying costs and benefits, we reveal that DA release in both structures incorporates reward magnitude and sunk cost. Surprisingly, motivation was inversely correlated with reward-evoked DA release; the higher the motivation for rewards the lower the reward-evoked DA release. These relationships between DA release, cost and motivation remained identical when we used optogenetic activation of striatal DA inputs as a reward. Our results reconcile previous disparate findings by demonstrating that during operant tasks, striatal DA release simultaneously encodes cost, benefit and motivation but in distinct manners over different time scales.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive Reserve (CR) refers to the preservation of cognitive function in the face of age-or disease-related neuroanatomical decline. While bilingualism is known to contribute to CR, the extent to which, and what particular aspect of, second language experience contributes to CR are debated, and the underlying neural mechanism(s) unknown. Intrinsic functional connectivity reflects experience-dependent neuroplasticity that occurs across timescales ranging from minutes to decades, and may be a neural mechanism underlying CR. To test this hypothesis, we used voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity analyses of MRI data to compare structural and functional brain integrity between bilingual and monolingual older adults, matched on cognitive performance using a rigorous propensity score matching technique, and across levels of second language proficiency measured as a continuous variable. Bilingualism, and degree of second language proficiency in particular, were associated with lower grey matter integrity in a hub of the default mode network - a region that is particularly vulnerable to decline in aging and dementia - but preserved functional network organization that resembled the young adult brain. Our findings confirm that lifelong bilingualism contributes to CR through experience-dependent maintenance of optimal functional network structure of the domain-general attentional control network across the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "The X chromosome in non-African human populations shows less diversity and less Neanderthal introgression than expected under the standard neutral model. We analyzed 162 X chromosomes from human males worldwide and discovered 14 chromosomal regions where haplotypes of several hundred kilobases rapidly rose to high frequencies in non-Africans. These observations cannot be explained by neutral genetic drift in realistic demographic scenarios and are only consistent with partial selective sweeps produced by strong selection. Using an approach for inferring individual Neanderthal-derived haplotypes, which do not rely on an archaic reference genome, we further discover that the swept haplotypes are devoid of the archaic ancestry otherwise typical of the affected chromosomal regions. The ancient Ust-Ishim male carries its expected proportion of these haplotypes, implying that the sweeps must have occurred between 45,000 and 55,000 years ago. Finally, we find that the chromosomal positions of sweeps overlap previously reported hotspots of selection in great ape evolution. We propose that this puzzling combination of observations points to a general mechanism of positive selection unique to the X chromosome.",
