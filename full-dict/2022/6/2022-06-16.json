    "abstract": "Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in an upregulation of cAMP signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a molecular adaptation thought to be critically involved in the development of drug dependence. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) is a major cAMP effector abundantly expressed in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether Epac2 contributes to cocaine reinforcement. Here, we report that Epac2 in the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes cocaine reinforcement via enhancement of dopamine release. Conditional knockout of Epac2 from midbrain dopamine neurons (Epac2-cKO) and the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 decreased cocaine self-administration in mice under both fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio reinforcement schedules and across a broad range of cocaine doses. In addition, Epac2-cKO led to reduced evoked dopamine release, whereas Epac2 agonism robustly enhanced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in vitro. This mechanism is central to the behavioral effects of Epac2 disruption, as chemogenetic activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons increased dopamine release and reversed the impairment of cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release and cocaine self-administration in wild-type mice. Epac2-mediated enhancement of dopamine release may therefore represent a novel and powerful mechanism that contributes to cocaine reinforcement.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between defense and counter-defense systems of bacteria and phages is a major driver of evolution of both organisms, leading to their greatest genetic diversity. Bacterial restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas are two well-known defense systems that target phage DNAs through their nuclease activities, whereas phages have developed counter-defense systems through covalent modifications of their genomes. Recent studies have revealed many novel nuclease-containing antiphage systems, which leads to the question of whats the role of phage genome modifications in countering these systems. Here, we scanned Escherichia coli genome sequences available in the NCBI databases and found abundant nuclease-containing defense systems, indicating that phage genomic DNA could be a major target for E. coli to restrict infection. From a collection of 816 E. coli strains, we cloned and validated 14 systems. Particularly, Gabija and type III Druantia systems have broad antiphage activities. Using wild-type phage T4 and its mutants, T4 (hmC) and T4 (C), which contain glucosyl-5-hydroxymethylcytosines, 5-hydroxymethylcytosines, and unmodified cytosines in the genomic DNA respectively, we revealed the complex roles of genomic modification of phage T4 in countering the nuclease-containing defense systems other than simply blocking the degradation of genomic DNA by nuclease.",

    "abstract": "Proteins from some unrelated pathogens, including viruses and bacteria can recruit and activate cellular p90-ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) through a common linear motif. Our data suggested that such pathogens proteins might act as adapters to dock the kinase toward specific substrates. We explored this hypothesis using the Cardiovirus leader protein (L) as a paradigm. L is known to trigger phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG-NUPs) hyperphosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking perturbation. Using a biotin ligase fused to either RSK or to L, we identified FG-NUPs as primary partners of the L-RSK complex in infected cells. Mutant analysis shows that L uses distinct motifs to recruit RSK and to dock the L-RSK complex toward the FG-NUPs. Using an analog-sensitive RSK2 mutant kinase, we show that, in infected cells, L can trigger RSK to use NUP98 and NUP214 as direct substrates. Our data illustrate a novel virulence mechanism where pathogens proteins retarget cellular protein kinases toward specific substrates.",

    "abstract": "Fecal pollution is one of the most prevalent forms of pollution affecting waterbodies worldwide, threatening public health, and negatively impacting aquatic environments. Microbial source tracking (MST) applies polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to help identify the source of fecal pollution. In this study, we combine spatial data for two watersheds with general and host-specific MST markers to target human, bovine, and general ruminant sources. Two different PCR technologies were applied for quantifying the targets: quantitative PCR (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We found that ddPCR had a higher detection rate (75%) of quantifiable samples compared to qPCR (27%), indicating that ddPCR is more sensitive than qPCR. The three host-specific markers were detected at all sites (n=25), suggesting that humans, cows, and ruminants are contributing to fecal contamination in these watersheds. MST results, combined with watershed characteristics, suggest that streams draining areas with low-infiltration soil groups, high septic system prevalence, and high agricultural land use are at an increased risk for fecal contamination. Microbial source tracking has been applied in numerous studies to aid in identifying the sources of fecal contamination, however these studies usually lack information on the involvement of watershed characteristics. Our study combined watershed characteristics with MST results, applying more sensitive PCR techniques, in addition to watershed characteristics to provide more comprehensive insight into the factors that influence fecal contamination in order to implement the most effective best management practices.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496426v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13ca50forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78a781org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d0664org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ec950_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIddPCR provided higher sensitivity over qPCR when analyzing environmental samples\nC_LIO_LIHuman markers had an association with the number of septic systems in a watershed\nC_LIO_LIEvery site had positive detections for all FIB markers\nC_LIO_LIBoth ruminant markers were associated with low infiltration hydrologic soil groups\nC_LIO_LICombining watershed characteristics with MST testing improved source identification\nC_LI",

Our results indicate that radial expansion of colony biofilms results from division of bacteria at the biofilm periphery rather than being driven by swelling due to fluid intake. Moreover, we show that lack of exopolysaccharide production has a negative impact on cell division rate, and the extracellular matrix components act synergistically to give the biomass the structural strength to produce aerial protrusions and agar substrate-deforming ability.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionExtracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling has been associated with chronic lung diseases. However, information about specific age-associated differences in lung ECM is currently limited. In this study we aimed to identify and localize age-associated ECM differences in human lung using comprehensive transcriptomic, proteomic and immunohistochemical analyses.\n\nMethodsOur previously identified age-associated gene expression signature of the lung was re-analysed limiting it to an aging signature based on 270 control patients (37-80 years) and focused on the Matrisome core geneset using geneset enrichment analysis. To validate the age-associated transcriptomic differences on protein level, we compared the age-associated ECM genes (F <0.05) with a profile of age-associated proteins identified from a lung tissue proteomics dataset from 9 control patients (49-76 years) (FDR<0.05). Extensive immunohistochemical analysis was used to localize the age-associated ECM differences in lung tissues from control patients (9-82 years).\n\nResultsComparative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data identified 7 ECM proteins with higher expression with age at both gene and protein level: COL1A1, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL14A1, FBLN2, LTBP4 and LUM. With immunohistochemistry we demonstrated higher protein expression with age for COL6A2 in whole tissue, parenchyma, airway wall and blood vessel, for COL14A1 in bronchial epithelium and blood vessel, and for FBLN2 and COL1A1 in lung parenchyma.\n\nConclusionOur study revealed that higher age is associated with lung ECM remodelling, with specific differences occurring in defined regions within the lung. These differences may affect lung structure and physiology with aging and as such may increase susceptibility for developing chronic lung diseases.\n\nKey messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSsummarise the state of scientific knowledge on this subject before you did your study and why this study needed to be done.\n\nIn animal models, it has been demonstrated that aging alters the composition of the lung ECM, with more deposition of collagen and degradation of elastin. Similar ECM differences have been observed in age-associated chronic lung diseases, including COPD; moreover, we observed in lung tissue that several ECM genes associate differently with age in COPD patients compared to non-COPD controls(1). Detailed knowledge on age-associated changes in specific ECM proteins as well as regional differences within the lung is lacking.\n\nWhat this study addssummarise what we now know as a result of this study that we did not know before.\n\nWe identified 7 age-associated ECM proteins i.e. COL1A1, COL6A1, COL6A2 COL14A1, FBLN2, LTBP4 and LUM with higher transcript and protein levels in human lung tissue with age. Extensive immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant age-associated differences for 3 of these ECM proteins in specific compartments of the lung, with the most notable differences in the blood vessels and parenchyma.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice, or policysummarise the implications of this study.\n\nThe identification of age-associated differences in specific human lung ECM proteins lays a new foundation for the investigation of ECM differences in age-associated chronic lung diseases. Additionally, examining the function of these age-associated ECM proteins and their cellular interactions in lung injury and repair responses may provide novel insight in mechanisms underlying chronic lung diseases.",

    "abstract": "Encephalic vascular accident, or stroke, is the most common pathology of the central nervous system in humans. It is the second leading cause of death, as well as physical and cognitive disabilities, in developing countries. It is a vascular disorder that may present in an ischemic (more common) or hemorrhagic form. Ozone is a gas capable of oxidizing double bonds of organic molecules, thereby producing lipoperoxides and aldehydes. Stimulation of the immune and antioxidant system, and improvement in tissue vascularization and oxygenation, are few among several effects exerted by ozone. Ozone therapy has previously been shown to be effective in neuromodulation, neuroprotection, and nerve regeneration. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of targeted mild ozone after inducing cerebral ischemia in vitro. The experiment was divided into two steps; in the first step, neuroblastoma lineage cells (SH-SY5Y) were subjected to 24 hours of hypoxia in an incubator culture chamber. Treatment with different concentrations of ozone (2-10 {micro}g/mL), followed by an 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay, indicated a possible neuroregenerative effect at low concentrations. The same protocol was applied to canine amniotic membrane stem cells that were evaluated via colorimetric assay spectrophotometry, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. The metabolic conditions and cellular regeneration in cells at low ozone concentrations (3-8 {micro}g/mL) correlated with lower levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress compared to cells not subjected to hypoxia. High concentrations of ozone (18-30 {micro}g/mL) promoted an increase in rate of apoptosis and cell death. Therefore, we developed a novel protocol that mimics ozone therapy for ischemic stroke, using ozonized culture medium after hypoxia induction. Although more studies are needed to open new avenues for translational medicine, we conclude that ozone has a dose-dependent hormetic effect and can reverse the effect of ischemia in vitro at low concentrations.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveClosed-loop prosthesis interfaces, combining electromyography (EMG)-based control with non-invasive supplementary feedback, represent a promising direction to develop the next generation of user prosthesis interfaces. However, we still lack an understanding of how users make use of these interfaces, and how to evaluate competing interfaces. In this study we use the framework of speed accuracy trade-off functions (SAF) to understand, evaluate and compare the performance afforded by two closed-loop user-prosthesis interfaces.\n\nApproachTen able-bodied participants and one amputee performed a force matching task in a functional box-and-blocks setup at 3 different speeds. All participants were subject to both interfaces in a crossover fashion with a one-week washout period. Importantly, both interfaces used (identical) direct proportional control but differed in the feedback provided to the participant - EMG feedback vs force feedback. We thereby estimated the SAFs afforded by the two interfaces, and additionally sought to understand how participants planned and executed the task in the various conditions.\n\nMain resultsWe found that execution speed significantly influenced the performance, and that EMG feedback afforded better performance overall. Notably, we found that there was a difference in SAF between the two interfaces, with EMG feedback enabling participants to attain higher accuracies faster than Force feedback. Further, both interfaces enabled participants to develop flexible control policies, while EMG feedback also afforded participants to generate smoother more repeatable EMG commands.\n\nSignificanceOverall, the results indicate that closed-loop prosthesis interfaces afford subjects to exhibit a wide range of performance, which is affected both by the interface and the execution speed. Thereby, we argue that it is important to consider the speed accuracy trade-offs to rigorously evaluate and compare (closed-loop) user-prosthesis interfaces.",

    "abstract": "This discourse attempts to capture a few important dimensions of gut physiology like microbial homeostasis, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, occludin expression and gut permeability in post-natal life of mice those received arsenic only during pre-natal life (pAs-mice). The pAs-mice showed a striking reduction in Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio coupled with decrease in tight junction protein, occludin resulting in increase in gut permeability, increased infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colon and decrease in common SCFAs in which butyrate reduction was quite prominent in fecal samples as compared to normal control. The above phenotypes of pAs-mice were mostly reversed by supplementing butyrate with food. The talismanic ability of butyrate in enhancing occludin expression, in particular, was dissected further. As miR122 causes degradation of Occludin mRNA, we transiently overexpressed miR122 by injecting appropriate plasmids and showed reversal of butyrate effects in pAs-mice. Thus, pre-natal arsenic exposure orchestrates variety of effects by decreasing in butyrate in pAs-mice leading to increased permeability due to reduced occludin expression. Our research adds a new dimension to our understanding that pre-natal arsenic exposure imprints in post-natal life while there was no further arsenic exposure.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPrenatal Arsenic exposure decreases prevalence of butyrate producing bacteria and butyrate production in gut.\nC_LIO_LILack of butyrate production in the gut is responsible for increased permeability and decreased occludin expression.\nC_LIO_LIOral supplementation with butyrate reverses the prenatal arsenic induced changes in the gut.\nC_LIO_LIButyrate increases Occludin gene expression by downregulating miR122 in the gut.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) is steadily increasing. Weight loss can lead to improvement in NAFL in patients and in model organisms. Weight loss can be achieved through either dietary and lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Some interventions, such as intermittent fasting, have been purported to have benefits beyond those conferred by weight loss alone.\n\nIn this study, rats were provided a high-fat, high-sucrose diet for 7 weeks and then were assigned to strict caloric restriction with intermittent fasting (IF-CR) or to sleeve gastrectomy (SG) bariatric surgery, achieving equivalent weight loss. The two interventions were compared to ad-libitum fed controls. The metabolome of the blood entering the liver was analyzed in the three experimental groups, as well as the metabolome and transcriptome of the liver under fasting conditions, to test how different means of weight loss affect the input of the liver and hepatic metabolism.\n\nSurprisingly, the two interventions had different and often opposite effects on the composition of portal blood and liver metabolites. IF-CR resulted in sweeping changes across multiple central metabolic pathways, including an increase in de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride export, and upregulation of glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway, as well as an increase in glycogen storage. Meanwhile, the effects of SG concentrated on one-carbon metabolic pathways, with changes in metabolite and transcript levels pointing to decreased transmethylation and methionine cycle activity, with downstream effects on levels of glutathione and the hepatic oxidative state.\n\nIn conclusion, our study highlights how different means of weight loss affect distinct metabolic pathways and demonstrates a unique effect of bariatric surgery on hepatic one-carbon and redox pathways.",

    "abstract": "Protein nanocages have emerged as an important engineering platform for biotechnological and biomedical applications. Among naturally occurring protein cages, encapsulin nanocompartments have recently gained prominence due to their favorable physico-chemical properties, ease of shell modification, and highly efficient and selective intrinsic protein packaging capabilities. Here, we expand encapsulin function by designing and characterizing encapsulins for concurrent RNA and protein encapsulation in vivo. Our strategy is based on modifying encapsulin shells with nucleic acid binding peptides without disrupting the native protein packaging mechanism. We show that our engineered encapsulins reliably self-assemble in vivo, are capable of efficient size-selective in vivo RNA packaging, can simultaneously load multiple functional RNAs, and can be used for concurrent in vivo packaging of RNA and protein. Our engineered encapsulation platform has potential for co-delivery of therapeutic RNAs and proteins to elicit synergistic effects, and as a modular tool for other biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "In the remodeling of axonal arbor, the growth and retraction of branches are differentially regulated within a single axon. Although cell-autonomously generated differences in microtubule (MT) turnover are thought to be involved in selective branch regulation, the cellular system whereby neurons generate differences of MTs between axonal branches has not been clarified. Because MT turnover tends to be slower in longer branches compared with neighboring shorter branches, feedback regulation depending on branch length is thought to be involved. In the present study, we generated a model of MT lifetime in axonal terminal branches by adapting a length-dependent model in which parameters for MT dynamics were constant in the arbor. The model predicted that differences in MT lifetime between neighboring branches could be generated depending on the distance from terminals. In addition, the following points were predicted. Firstly, destabilization of MTs throughout the arbor decreased the differences in MT lifetime between branches. Secondly, differences of MT lifetime existed even before MTs entered the branch point. In axonal MTs in primary neurons, treatment with a low concentration of nocodazole significantly decreased the differences of detyrosination (deTyr) and tyrosination (Tyr) of tubulins, indicators of MT turnover. Expansion microscopy of the axonal shaft before the branch point revealed differences in deTyr/Tyr modification on MTs. Our model recapitulates the differences in MT turnover between branches and provides a feedback mechanism for MT regulation that depends on the axonal arbor geometry.",

    "abstract": "The mouse caecum is a pouch-like structure that is anatomically similar to the human appendix and is hypothesised to serve as a reservoir for commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract is also home to the largest immunological organ of the body and the enteric nervous system (ENS), which regulates gut motility and secretion. The caecum is therefore an ideal location to study neuro-immune-microbe interactions in gut-brain communication. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; autism) frequently present with gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to core diagnostic behavioural features, implying a gut-brain link. More broadly, changes in gut-brain connectivity are now thought to play a critical role in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we employed a mouse model of autism expressing a missense mutation in the neuroligin-3 post-synaptic protein that affects brain and enteric neuronal activity (NL3R451C mice). We previously observed abnormal caecal ENS architecture and immune cell morphology in the caecal patch in this model, however it is unknown if caecal function is altered in NL3R451C mice. Using a tri-cannulation approach to record motility patterns in the mouse caecum, we identified novel caecal motor complexes in ex vivo preparations. Caecal permeability and neurally-evoked secretion levels were also studied. Key immune populations including gut macrophages and dendritic cells within the caecal patch were stained using immunofluorescence to investigate shifts in immune activity. Caecal motility patterns in NL3R451C mice differed from wildtype littermates. Specifically, caecal motor complexes occurred at a higher frequency and for a shorter duration in NL3R451C mice than in wildtype littermates. In NL3R451C mice, neurally-evoked caecal secretion was reduced in response to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (DMPP), but permeability was unchanged. Increased numbers of caecal patches were observed in NL3R451C mice compared to wildtype, with no alterations in morphology of selected immune populations. Future research is warranted to better understand caecal function and how neuro-immune interactions in the caecum affect health and influence GI function in neurodevelopmental disorders via the gut-brain axis.",

While clinical studies have demonstrated that sex mismatch, notably male recipients with female donor cells, results in increased risk of GVHD (likely due to male recipient minor histocompatibility antigens targeted by donor female T-cells 1), increased non-relapse mortality, and decreased overall survival, the mechanisms underlying sex-determinants on hematopoiesis and post-transplant recovery are not clear. In this manuscript we have identified: 1) unique expression of hematopoietic niche factors in the BM and spleens of male and female mice, 2) altered kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution following transplantation when male vs. female BM is used as the donor cell source, 3) a sex-specific role for the recipient niche in promoting post HST recovery, and 4) a dose-dependent role for exogenous sex hormones in maintaining hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Taken together, these data demonstrate that sex-specific cellular and molecular signaling occurs during hematopoietic regeneration. Further identifying novel sex-dependent determinants of regeneration following transplantation will not only enhance understanding of steady state versus regeneration hematopoiesis but may also reveal unique (and potentially sex-specific) therapeutic targets to accelerate hematologic recovery.\n\nKey PointsO_LIMale and female mice display altered kinetics of regeneration following HST due to unique niche factors in hematopoietic compartments.\nC_LIO_LIExogenous steroid sex hormones uniquely regulate the pool of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and may impact transplantation outcomes.\nC_LI",

Mechanistically, we show that GM-CSF producing T cells licence monocyte-derived cells to produce matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12), which cleaves components of the glomerular basement membrane and exacerbates renal pathology.

As the organ consists of a single convoluted duct, inflammation-associated tissue damage has a severe impact on fertility. In order to clarify the reasons for region-specific differences in the intensity of immune responses observed in a mouse model of acute bacterial epididymitis, we investigated the heterogeneity of resident immune cell populations within the epididymis under physiological conditions by scRNASeq analysis of extravascular CD45+ cells. 12 distinct immune cell subsets were identified, displaying substantial differences in distribution along the epididymis. Several distinct subsets of macrophages constituted the majority of these cells. Crucially, the proximal and distal regions showed striking differences in their immunological landscapes. These findings indicate that resident immune cells are strategically positioned along the epididymal duct, potentially providing different immunological environments required for sperm maturations and elimination of pathogens ascending the urogenital tract.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental microorganism, which is notorious for its resistance or tolerance to antibiotics due to the formation of biofilms. Cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger that plays critical roles in biofilm formation. P. aeruginosa contains 41 genes that encode enzymes to participate in the metabolism of c-di-GMP (biosynthesis or degradation), yet it lacks tools to investigate the systemic expression pattern of those genes. Here, we constructed a promoter-gfp transcriptional fusion reporters library that consists of 41 reporter plasmids. Each plasmid contains a promoter of corresponding c-di-GMP metabolism-related (CMR) genes from P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain, thus each promoter-Gfp fusion reporter can be used to detect the promotor activity as well as the transcription of corresponding gene. The promoters activity was tested in P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli respectively. Among the 41 genes, the promoter of 26 genes showed activity in both P. aeruginosa and E. coli. The library was applied to determine the influence of different temperatures, growth media, and sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on transcriptional profile of the 41 CMR genes in P. aeruginosa. The results showed different growth conditions did impact different genes transcription, while the promoter activity of a few genes kept at the same level under several different growth conditions. In summary, we provided a promoter-gfp fusion reporters library for systemic monitoring or study of the regulation of CMR genes in P. aeruginosa and the functional promoters can also be used as a bio-brick for synthetic biology studies.\n\nImportanceThe opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa can cause acute and chronic infections in humans and it is one of main pathogens in nosocomial infections. Biofilm formation is one of most important causes for P. aeruginosa to persist in hosts and evade immune and antibiotic attacks. c-di-GMP is an important second messenger to control biofilm formation. In P. aeruginosa, there are 41 genes that are predicted to participate in the making and breaking this dinucleotide. A major missing information in this field is the systemic expression profile of those genes in response to changing environment. Toward this goal, we constructed a promoter-gfp transcriptional fusion reporters library that consists of 41 reporter plasmids, each of which contains a promoter of corresponding c-di-GMP metabolism-related genes in P. aeruginosa. This library provides a helpful tool to understand the complex regulation network related to c-di-GMP and to discover potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax, one species parasite causing human malaria, forms a dormant liver stage, termed the hypnozoite, which activate weeks, months or years after the primary infection, causing relapse episodes. Relapses significantly contribute to the vivax malaria burden and are only killed with drugs of the 8-aminoquinolone class, which are contraindicated in many vulnerable populations. Development of new therapies targeting hypnozoites is hindered, in part, by the lack of robust methods to continuously culture and characterize this parasite. As a result, the determinants of relapse periodicity and the molecular processes that drive hypnozoite formation, persistence, and activation are largely unknown. While previous reports have described vastly different liver stage growth metrics attributable to which hepatocyte donor lot is used to initiate culture, a comprehensive assessment of how different P. vivax patient isolates behave in the same donors at the same time is logistically challenging. Using our primary human hepatocyte-based P. vivax liver stage culture platform, we aimed to simultaneously test the effects of how hepatocyte donor and P. vivax patient isolate influence the fate of sporozoites and growth of liver schizonts. We found that, while environmental factors such as hepatocyte donor can modulate hypnozoite formation rate, the P. vivax case is also an important determinant of the proportion of hypnozoites observed in culture. In addition, we found schizont growth to be mostly influenced by hepatocyte donor. These results suggest that, while host hepatocytes harbor characteristics making them more-or less-supportive of a quiescent versus growing intracellular parasite, sporozoite fating towards hypnozoites is isolate-specific. Future studies involving these host-parasite interactions, including characterization of individual P. vivax strains, should consider the impact of culture conditions on hypnozoite formation, in order to better understand this important part of the parasites lifecycle.\n\nAuthor summaryMalaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. One species, Plasmodium vivax, is more difficult to control in comparison to other species because infection results in dormant forms in the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites are considered an invaluable therapeutic target to control malaria, but how hypnozoites form and reactive to cause malaria relapses is unknown. Herein we describe that both nature and nurture influence the fate of newly-established parasites in the liver, resulting in either a quiescent hypnozoite or growing schizont. Using parasites generated from patient isolates, we show the hypnozoite formation is likely inherited but also modulated by environmental factors, including which lot of human hepatocytes the parasites infect. Additionally, we show schizont growth is strongly influenced by the host hepatocyte lot. As liver stage experiments include several dependent variables which are difficult to control, herein we present an experimental approach designed to remove many of these variables and provide a clearer picture of what factors influence the formation and growth of liver stage parasites. Our findings serve as a foundation for future work to understand hypnozoite biology, with the ultimate goal of identifying new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "For decades, investigators have studied the interaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with macrophages, which serve as a major cellular niche for the bacilli. Because Mtb are prone to aggregation, investigators rely on varied methods to disaggregate the bacteria for these studies. Here, we examined the impact of routinely used preparation methods on bacterial cell envelop integrity, macrophage inflammatory responses, and intracellular Mtb survival. We found that both gentle sonication and filtering damaged the mycobacterial cell envelope and markedly impacted the outcome of macrophage infections. Unexpectedly, sonicated bacilli were hyperinflammatory, eliciting dramatically higher TLR2-dependent gene expression and elevated secretion of IL-1{beta} and TNF-. Despite evoking enhanced inflammatory responses, sonicated bacilli replicated normally in macrophages. In contrast, Mtb that had been passed through a filter induced little inflammatory response, and they were attenuated in macrophages. Previous work suggests that the mycobacterial cell envelope lipid, phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), dampens macrophage inflammatory responses to Mtb. However, we found that the impact of PDIM depended on the method used to prepare Mtb. In conclusion, widely used methodologies to disaggregate Mtb may introduce experimental artifacts in Mtb-host interaction studies, including alteration of host inflammatory signaling, intracellular bacterial survival, and interpretation of bacterial mutants.",

Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation resistant bacterium, shows an arrest of growth in response to DNA damage, despite no change in the level of FtsZ. This bacterium does not deploy LexA/RecA type of DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation, and its genome does not encode homologs of E. colis SulA, which attenuate FtsZ functions in response to DNA damage in different bacteria. A radiation responsive Ser/Thr quinoprotein kinase (RqkA) characterized for its role in radiation resistance in this bacterium, could phosphorylate several cognate proteins including FtsZ (drFtsZ) at Serine 235 (S235) and Serine 335 (S335) residues. Here, we report the detailed characterization of S235 and S335 phosphorylation effect in the regulation of drFtsZ functions, and demonstrated that the phospho-mimetic replacements of these residues in drFtsZ had grossly affected its functions that could result in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in D. radiodurans. Interestingly, the phospho-ablative replacements were found to be nearly similar to drFtsZ while phospho-mimetic mutant showed the loss of signatures characteristics to wild type enzyme including the arrest in its dynamics under normal conditions. The post-bleaching recovery kinetics for drFtsZ and phospho-mimetic mutant was nearly similar at 2h post irradiation recovery but found to be different under normal conditions. These results highlighted the role of S/T phosphorylation in the regulation of drFtsZ functions and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage and is first time demonstrated in this prokaryote.",

There remains however considerable uncertainty regarding the feasibility and efficacy of gene drives in various species, based in particular on biological and ecological specificities of each target. In this paper we introduce DriverSEAT, a new spatial, modular modelling framework designed to assess the outcome of gene drives in a range of target species based on their specific ecological dynamics and genetics. In addition to the main structure and characteristics of the model, we present an example of its application on scenarios of genetic control of weeds, a potential candidate for gene drive control that presents significant challenges associated with plant population dynamics. We illustrate here how the results from DriverSEAT can inform on the potential value of gene drives in this specific context, and generally provide ecologically informed guidance for the development and feasibility of gene drives as a control method in new target species.",

    "abstract": "Five versions of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reference genome have been produced over the last two decades. Here we present version 6, bringing significant advances in assembly quality and structural annotations. PacBio-based chromosome-level assemblies for two laboratory strains, CC-503 and CC-4532, provide resources for the plus and minus mating type alleles. We corrected major misassemblies in previous versions and validated our assemblies via linkage analyses. Contiguity increased over ten-fold and >80% of filled gaps are within genes. We used Iso-Seq and deep RNA-seq datasets to improve structural annotations, and updated gene symbols and textual annotation of functionally characterized genes via extensive curation. We discovered that the cell wall-less classical reference strain CC-503 exhibits genomic instability potentially caused by deletion of RECQ3 helicase, with major structural mutations identified that affect >100 genes. We therefore present the CC-4532 assembly as the primary reference, although this strain also carries unique structural mutations and is experiencing rapid proliferation of a Gypsy retrotransposon. We expect all laboratory strains to harbor gene-disrupting mutations, which should be considered when interpreting and comparing experimental results across laboratories and over time. Collectively, the resources presented here herald a new era of Chlamydomonas genomics and will provide the foundation for continued research in this important reference.",

    "abstract": "Modern sequencing technologies are not error-free, and might have elevated error rates at some locations of the genome. A potential cause for such elevated error rates is the formation of alternative DNA structures (non-B DNA), such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), Z-DNA, or cruciform structures, during sequencing. Approximately 13% of the human genome has the potential to form such structures, which have been previously shown to affect the activity of DNA polymerases and helicases. Here we tested whether motifs with the potential to form non-B DNA (non-B motifs) influence the sequencing success of three major sequencing technologies--Illumina, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We estimated sequencing success by computing the rates of single-nucleotide, insertion, and deletion errors, as well as by evaluating mean read depth and mean base quality. Overall, all technologies exhibited altered sequencing success for most non-B motif types. Single-nucleotide error rates were generally increased for G-quadruplexes (G4s) and Z-DNA motifs in all three technologies. Illumina and PacBio HiFi deletion error rates were also increased for all non-B types except for Z-DNA motifs, while in ONT they were increased substantially only for G4 motifs. Insertion error rates for non-B motifs were highly elevated in Illumina, moderately elevated in PacBio HiFi, and only slightly elevated in ONT. Using Poisson regression modeling, we evaluated how non-B DNA motifs and other factors influence sequencing error profiles. Using the error rates at non-B motifs, we developed a probabilistic approach to determine the number of false-positive single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in different sample size and variant frequency cutoff scenarios, as well as in previously generated sequencing data sets (1000Genomes, Simons Genome Diversity Project, and gnomAD). Overall, the effect of non-B DNA on sequencing should be considered in downstream analyses, particularly in studies with limited read depth--e.g., single-cell and ancient DNA sequencing, as well as sequencing of pooled population samples--and when scoring variants with low frequency (e.g., singletons). Because each sequencing technology analyzed has a unique error profile at non-B motifs, a combination of different technologies should be considered in future sequencing studies of such motifs, to maximize accuracy.",

Although previous literature on humans shows a relationship between emotional circuits and gut microbiota, the evidence linking learning and microbiota is lacking. In a Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm, we show that patterns of gut microbiota composition in healthy humans relate to their patterns of threat learning, but not safety learning.

Universal chemistry is employed to link peptides to the PEG free-end. To manifest our platform, we use a SV40T large antigen-originating NLS peptide. Our modular design allows tuning the number of recruited motors, and to replace the NLS by a variety of other localization signal molecules.

    "abstract": "Cellular crowding plays a key role in regulating the enzymatic reactivity in physiological conditions, which is challenging to realize in the dilute phase. Enzymes drive a wide range of complex metabolic reactions with high efficiency and selectivity under extremely heterogeneous and crowded cellular environments. However, the molecular interpretation behind the enhanced enzymatic reactivity under a crowded milieu is poorly understood. Herein, using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and glucose oxidase (GOx) cascade pair, we demonstrate for the first time that macromolecular crowding induces liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) via the formation of liquid-like condensates/droplets and thereby increases the intrinsic catalytic efficiencies of HRP and GOx. Both these enzymes undergo crowding induced homotypic LLPS via enthalpically driven multivalent electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions. Using a set of kinetic and microscopic experiments, we show that precise synchronization of spontaneous LLPS and enzymatic transformations is key to realize the enhanced enzymatic activity under the crowded environments. Our findings reveal an unprecedented enhancement (91-205-fold) in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of HRP at pH 4.0 within the droplet phase relative to that in the bulk aqueous phase in the presence of different crowders. In addition, we have shown that other enzymes also undergo spontaneous LLPS under macromolecular crowding, signifying the generality of this phenomenon under the crowded environments. More importantly, coalescence driven highly regulated GOx/HRP cascade reactions within the fused droplets have been demonstrated with enhanced activity and specificity under the crowded environments. The present discovery highlights the active role of membraneless condensates in regulating the enzymatic efficacy for complex metabolic reactions under the crowded cellular environments and may find significant importance in the field of biocatalysis.",

Studies addressing genome-wide transcriptional responses to changing TF concentration at high resolution are lacking. Here, we create a dataset containing the entire E.coli transcriptome as it responds to 10 different cAMP concentrations spanning the biological range. We use the Hills model to accurately summarise individual gene responses into 3 intuitively understandable parameters - k, n and Emax reflecting the midpoint of dynamic range, non-linearity and sensitivity of a gene. cAMP-regulated genes show a small dynamic range with midpoints centred around wild-type cAMP concentrations, with genes activating in a switch-like fashion. Using this approach we show that cAMP-CRP affinity at promoters is well correlated to the sensitivity(Emax) of genes but not to the midpoints of dynamic range(k). Finally, genes belonging to different functional classes are tuned to different k, n and Emax. We show phenomenological models to be a better alternative for studying gene expression trends compared to classical clustering methods with the phenomenological constants providing greater insights into how genes are tuned in a regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "The invasion of a merozoite into an erythrocyte by membrane wrapping is a hallmark of malaria pathogenesis. The invasion involves biomechanical interactions whereby the merozoite exerts actomyosin-based forces to push itself into and through the erythrocyte membrane while concurrently inducing biochemical damage to the erythrocyte membrane. Whereas the biochemical damage process has been investigated, the detailed mechanistic understanding of the invasion mechanics remains limited. Thus, the current study aimed to develop a mathematical model describing the mechanical factors involved in the merozoite invasion into an erythrocyte and explore the invasion mechanics.\n\nA shell theory model was developed comprising constitutive, equilibrium and governing equations of the deformable erythrocyte membrane to predict membrane mechanics during the wrapping of an entire non-deformable ellipsoidal merozoite. Predicted parameters include principal erythrocyte membrane deformations and stresses, wrapping and indentation forces, and indentation work. The numerical investigations considered two limits for the erythrocyte membrane deformation during wrapping (4% and 51% areal strain) and erythrocyte membrane phosphorylation (decrease of membrane elastic modulus from 1 to 0.5 kPa).\n\nFor an intact erythrocyte, the maximum indentation force was 1 and 8.5 pN, and the indentation work was 1.92 x10-18 and 1.40 x10-17 J for 4% and 51% areal membrane strain. Phosphorylation damage in the erythrocyte membrane reduced the required indentation work by 50% to 0.97 x10-18 and 0.70 x10-17 J for 4% and 51% areal strain.\n\nThe current study demonstrated the developed models feasibility to provide new knowledge on the physical mechanisms of the merozoite invasion process that contribute to the invasion efficiency towards the discovery of new invasion-blocking anti-malaria drugs.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is marked by inflammation mediated epithelial-mucosal damage. The intestinal epithelial forms a tight barrier displaying two contrasting functions: restricting the entry of potentially harmful substances while, on the other hand allowing the selective passage of nutrients. The damaged epithelial-mucosal barrier causes the exposure of mucosa layers to luminal inflammatory contents. This eventually leads to the leaky epithelium, exposing the immune cells, release of various cytokines, and results in loss of epithelial homeostasis. Therefore, maintenance of healthy epithelial-mucosal lining is critical during IBD recovery. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway crucial for the development and homeostasis of most tissues. Notably, the deregulation of Notch signaling is involved in IBD (Ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease). Notch signaling also plays a vital role in wound healing and tissue repair. Here, we investigated the role of Notch-1 signaling in wound healing and regeneration of colonic epithelium during colitis recovery phase by using conditional deletion of Notch-1 in colonic epithelium of mice. We used colonic carcinoma cell line HCT116 transiently transfected with Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) to support in vivo data. We observed that deletion of Notch1 among mice was associated with compromised healing after colitis. Therefore, targeting the Notch-1 pathway might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the patients recovering from colitis.",

Pharmacological TLR8 activation enhances killing of phylogenetically diverse clinical isolates of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mtb by macrophages and during in vivo infection in mice. TLR8 is activated by phagosomal mycobacterial RNA released by extracellular membrane vesicles, and enhances xenophagy-dependent Mtb killing. We find that the TLR8 variant, M1V, common in far eastern populations, enhances intracellular killing of Mtb through preferential signal-dependent trafficking to phagosomes.

Here, using cryo-EM, we present the first structure of a eukaryotic ADAT2/3 deaminase bound to a full-length tRNA, revealing that the enzyme distorts the anticodon loop, but in contrast to the bacterial enzymes, selects its substrate via sequence-independent contacts of eukaryote-acquired flexible or intrinsically unfolded motifs distal from the conserved catalytic core.

The key role of coordination between trophoblast migration and embryo growth is verified by experimentally manipulating the migration velocity and geometry of the engineered uterus. Modeling the implanting embryo as a wetting droplet links the tissue shape dynamics to underlying changes in trophoblast adhesion and suggests that the corresponding tension release facilitates egg cylinder formation. Together, this study provides mechanisms by which dynamic embryo-uterus interactions play an essential role in peri-implantation development.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium relictum is the most widespread avian malaria parasite in the world. It is listed as one of the 100 most dangerous invasive species, having been responsible for the extinction of several endemic bird species, and the near-demise of several others. Here we present the first transcriptomic study examining the effect of P. relictum on the immune system of its vector (the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus) at different times post-infection. We show that over 50% of immune genes identified as being part of the Toll pathway and 30-40% of the immune genes identified within the Imd pathway are overexpressed during the critical period spanning the parasites oocyst and sporozoite formation (8-12 days), revealing the crucial role played by both these pathways in this natural mosquito-Plasmodium combination. Comparison of infected mosquitoes with their uninfected counterparts also revealed some unexpected RNA expression patterns earlier and later in the infection: Significant differences in expression of several immune effectors were observed as early as 30 minutes after the ingestion of the infected blood meal. In addition, in the later stages of the infection (towards the end of the mosquito lifespan), we observed an unexpected increase in immune investment in uninfected, but not in infected, mosquitoes. In conclusion, our work extends the comparative transcriptomic analyses of malaria-infected mosquitoes beyond human and rodent parasites and provides insights into the degree of conservation of immune pathways and into the selective pressures exerted by Plasmodium parasites on their vectors.",

Structural variants mediated by transposons, which we call transposable element-mediated rearrangements (TEMRs), are less well studied, and the mechanisms leading to their formation as well as their broader impact on human diversity are poorly understood. Here, we identify 493 unique TEMRs across the genomes of three individuals. While homology directed repair is the dominant driver of TEMRs, our sequence-resolved TEMR resource allows us to identify complex inversion breakpoints, triplications or other high copy number polymorphisms, and additional complexities. TEMRs are enriched in genic loci and can create potentially important risk alleles such as a deletion in TRIM65, a known cancer biomarker and therapeutic target. These findings expand our understanding of this important class of structural variation, the mechanisms responsible for their formation, and establish them as an important driver of human diversity.",

    "abstract": "Multilevel genome typing (MGT) enables the genomic characterization of bacterial isolates and the relationships among them. The MGT system describes an isolate using multiple multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes, referred to as levels. Thus, for a new isolate, sequence types (STs) assigned at multiple precisely defined levels can be used to type isolates at multiple resolutions. The MGT designation for isolates is stable, and assignment is faster than existing approaches. MGTs utility has been demonstrated in multiple species.\n\nThis paper presents a publicly accessible web service called MGTdb, which enables the assignment of MGT sequence types to isolates, along with their storage, retrieval and analysis. The MGTdb web service enables upload of genome data as sequence reads or alleles, which are processed and assigned MGT identifiers. Additionally, any newly sequenced isolates deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive are also regularly retrieved (currently daily), processed, assigned MGT and made publicly available in MGTdb. Interactive visualisation tools are presented to assist analysis, along with capabilities to download publicly available isolates and assignments for use with external software.\n\nMGTdb is currently available for Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis, and Vibrio cholerae. We demonstrate the usability of MGTdb through three case studies to study the long-term national surveillance of S. Typhimurium, and the local epidemiology and outbreaks of S. Typhimurium, and the global epidemiology of V. cholerae. Thus, MGTdb enables epidemiological and microbiological investigations at multiple levels of resolution for all publicly available isolates of these pathogens.\n\nDatabase URLhttps://mgtdb.unsw.edu.au",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, reciprocal interactions between epidermal and mesenchymal layers trigger hair follicle morphogenesis. This study revealed that microenvironmental reprogramming via control over these interactions enabled hair follicle induction in vitro. A key approach is to modulate spatial distributions of epithelial and mesenchymal cells in their spontaneous organization. The de novo hair follicles with typical morphological features emerged in aggregates of the two cell types, termed hair follicloids, and hair shafts sprouted with near 100% efficiency in vitro. The hair shaft length reached [~]3 mm in culture. Typical trichogenic signaling pathways were upregulated in hair follicloids. Owing to replication of hair follicle morphogenesis in vitro, production and transportation of melanosomes were also monitored in the hair bulb region. This in vitro hair follicle model might be valuable for better understanding hair follicle induction, for evaluating hair growth as well as the inhibition of hair growth by drugs, and modeling gray hairs in a well-defined environment.\n\nTeaserIn tissue morphogenesis, different types of cells harmonize in a pre-programmed manner using messenger systems such as epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Organoids are a promising tool to elucidate such mechanisms on a molecular level. This work describes a strategy for reprograming three-dimensional microenvironments to trigger the initiation of in vitro regeneration of hair follicle organoids. Hair follicle organoids generated fully matured hair follicles, enabling the monitoring of hair follicle morphogenesis in vitro and determination of signaling pathways involved in early hair follicle morphogenesis. The principles uncovered herein may be relevant to other organ systems and will contribute to our understanding of developmental phenomena in physiological and pathological processes, eventually opening up new research avenues for the development of new treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Continuous long-term sensing of biopotential signals is vital to facilitate accurate diagnosis. The current state of the art in wearable health monitoring relies on radiative technology for communication. Due to their radiative nature, these systems result in lossy and inefficient transmission, limiting the devices life span. Human Body Communication has emerged as an energy-efficient secure communication modality, and literature has shown body communication to transmit biopotential signals at 100x lower power than traditional radiative technologies. Unlike radiative communication that uses airwaves, HBC, specifically Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic HBC (EQS-HBC), couple signals and confine them within the human body. In Capacitive EQS-HBC, the transmitter uses an electrode to modulate the body potential to transmit data. The modulation of body potential by HBC raises the following concerns. Will HBC transmissions affect the quality of biopotential signals sensed from the body? Additionally, since biopotential sensing systems commonly use Right Leg Drive (RLD) to bias body potential, there is also a concern if RLD can affect the quality of HBC transmissions.\n\nFor the first time, our work studies the interactions between EQS-HBC and biopotential sensing. Our work is important since understanding HBC-RLD interactions is integral to developing EQS-HBC-based biosensors for Body Area Networks (BANs). For the studies, we conducted lab experiments and developed circuit theoretic models to back the experimental outcomes. We show that due to their higher frequency content and common-mode nature, HBC transmissions do not affect the differential sensing of low-frequency biopotential signals. We show that biopotential sensing using RLD affects HBC. RLD deteriorates the signal strength of HBC transmissions. We thus propose not to use RLD with HBC. We demonstrate our proposed solution by transmitting ECG signals using HBC with 96% correlation compared to the traditional wireless system at a fraction of the power.",

    "abstract": "BUB1B (BUB1 Mitotic Checkpoint Serine/Threonine Kinase B) gene belongs to the spindle assembly checkpoint protein family, proven to be associated with many kinds of cancers. Protein kinases are crucial in metaphase to anaphase cellular transition. It is a primary element of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). This SAC is responsible for guarding the proper chromosomal segregation while any chromosomal instability hinders its normal functioning. The chromosomal instability may lead to cancer progression. And it occurs mainly due to overexpression of BUB1B in many cancer types especially in breast cancer metastasis. This could be controlled by designing proper inhibitor of this gene. For this purpose, there are proved existence of various mushroom compounds possessing some important medicinal properties with proven anti- cancerous effects. Proper screening and identification of molecules having these anti-cancerous effects and showing affinity against BUB1B with inhibition properties could be obtained from these compounds. So this study has incorporated 70 bioactive compounds (handpicked through literature mining) of distinct mushrooms that were considered and explored for identifying a suitable drug candidate. Their ADME/T properties were obtained to predict the drug-likeness of these 70 mushroom compounds based on Lipinskis rule of 5 (RO5). The screening of these bioactive compounds and subsequent molecular docking against BUB1B provided compounds with the best conformation-based binding affinity. The best 2 complexes, i.e., BUB1B- Lepiotaprocerin D and BUB1B-Peptidoglycan, were subjected to the molecular dynamics simulation. Both the complexes were observed for their affinity, stability, and flexibility in protein-ligand complex systems. The MD simulation study revealed that Lepiotaprocerin D has an energetically favorable binding affinity with BUB1B. Results showed that the formation of a hydrogen bond between ASN123, SER157 residue and Lepiotaprocerin D has strengthened the affinity of Lepiotaprocerin D with BUB1B. Hence, this study identified Lepiotaprocerin D as a potential and novel inhibitor for BUB1B that could be a plausible drug candidate for checking and controlling the spread of breast cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Finding cancer-driver genes - the genes whose mutations may transform normal cells into cancerous ones - remains a central theme of cancer research. We took a different perspective; instead of considering normal cells, we focused on cancerous cells and genes that maintained abnormal cell growth which we named cancer-keeping genes (CKGs). Intervention in CKGs may rectify aberrant cell growth so that they can be adopted as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. We developed a novel approach to identifying CKGs by extending the well-established theory of network structural controllability, which aims at finding a control scheme (i.e., a minimal set of non-overlapping control paths covering all nodes) and control nodes (driver genes) that can steer the cell from any state to the designated state. Going beyond driver genes defined by one control scheme, we introduced control-hub genes located in the middle of a control path of every control scheme. Control hubs are essential for maintaining cancerous states and thus can be taken as CKGs. We applied our CKG-based approach to bladder cancer (BLCA) as a case study. All the genes on the cell cycle and p53 pathways in BLCA were identified as CKGs, showing the importance of these genes in cancer and demonstrating the power of our new method. Furthermore, sensitive CKGs that could be easily changed by structural perturbation were better suited as therapeutic targets. Six sensitive CKGs (RPS6KA3, FGFR3, N-cadherin (CDH2), EP300, caspase-1, and FN1) were subjected to small-interferencing-RNA knockdown in two BLCA cell lines to validate their cancer-suppressing effects. Knocking down RPS6KA3 in a mouse model of BLCA significantly inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in mice. Combined, our results demonstrated the value of CKGs as therapeutic targets for cancer therapy.\n\nKey pointsO_LIFocus on genes that maintain aberrant cell growth, named cancer-keeping genes (CKGs).\nC_LIO_LIDevelop a novel approach for finding CKGs by extending the well-estabilished theory of network structural controllability to total network controllability.\nC_LIO_LIApply the new method to bladder cancer and experimentally validated the cancer-suppressing function of six CKGs in two bladder cancer cell lines and that of one CKG in bladder cancer mice.\nC_LI",

The end-to-end model utilizes a fine-tuned bidirectional encoder representations (BERT) architecture to extract structural/functional information from input peptides and accurately identify DPP-IV-Ips from input peptides. Experimental results in benchmark dataset showed BERT-DPPIV yielded state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.894, surpassing the 0.797 obtained by sequence-feature model. Furthermore, we leverage the attention mechanism to uncover that our model could recognize restriction enzyme cutting site and specific residues that contribute to the inhibition of DPP-IV. Moreover, guided by BERT-DPPIV, proposed design rules of DPP-IV inhibitory tripeptides and pentapeptides were validated and they can be used to screen potent DPP-IV-IPs.",

We first observe that deep learning models based only on whole slide images (WSIs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas accurately separate high risk (OS<3years, N=38) from low risk (OS>5years, N=25) patients (AUC=0.81{+/-}0.08, 5year survival p-value=2.13e-25, 5year relative risk=5.09{+/-}0.05) though such models are less effective at predicting OS for moderate risk (3years<OS<5years, N=45) patients (5year survival p-value=0.5, 5year relative risk=1.32{+/-}0.09). However, we find that novel integrative models combining whole slide images, clinical variables, and mutation signatures can improve patient stratification for moderate risk patients (5year survival p-value=6.69e-30, 5year relative risk=5.32{+/-}0.07). Our integrative model combining image and clinical variables is also effective on an independent pathology dataset generated by our team (3year survival p-value=1.14e-09, 5year survival p-value=2.15e-05, 3year relative risk=3.25{+/-}0.06, 5year relative-risk=3.07{+/-}0.08). The integrative model substantially outperforms models using only images or only clinical variables, indicating beneficial cross-talk between the data types. Pathologist review of image-based heatmaps suggests that nuclear shape, nuclear size pleomorphism, intense cellularity, and abnormal structures are associated with high risk, while low risk regions tend to have more regular and small cells. The improved stratification of colorectal cancer patients from our computational methods can be beneficial for preemptive development of management and treatment plans for individual patients, as well as for informed enrollment of patients in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "1)Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) are the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Their molecular origin is heterogeneous and therefore treatments aimed at DLBCL must be adapted in function of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving cellular transformation. Constitutive activation of the protein kinases ERK1/2 is a hallmark of many B-cell malignancies. ERK1/2 activation which can occur downstream of the classical MAPK cascade via RAF or, in response to TLR stimulation, via the Tumor Promoting Locus 2 (TPL2) protein kinase. This pathway also relays signals from the MYD88 oncogenic mutant L265P, frequently found in hematologic malignancies. We report here that TPL2 participate to ERK1/2 activation downstream of BCR in a DLBCL cell line (OCI-Ly2). Moreover, we showed that a ERK2[Y316F] mutant increased c-Myc-luciferase reporter expression. We then investigated the impact of ERK1/2 inhibition on the proliferation of OCI-Ly2 cells. We found that blocking ERK1/2 MAPK signaling cascade using either MKK1/2 inhibitors (PD184352 and MEK162) or TPL2 inhibitor (Compound 1) was mainly cytostatic. Finally, we showed that while TPL2-MKK1/2 inhibition leads to cytostatic effect, Compound 1 has cytocidal effect at high concentrations, that is mediated via additional targets. Taken together, this study demonstrates the involvement of TPL2 in oncogenic signaling of DLBCL and supports the idea that combination therapy targeting multiple molecular pathways linked to cellular transformation is a superior avenue for future therapies.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important signal transducers that are phosphorylated upon activation at intracellular serine and threonine residues. Although antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylation state of GPCRs have been available for many years, efficient immunolocalization of phosphorylated receptors in their tissues of origin has not been possible. Here, we show that phosphorylation of receptors is highly unstable during routine immunohistochemical procedures, requiring the use of appropriate phosphatase inhibitors particular during tissue perfusion, post-fixation, and cryoprotection but not during immunostaining of tissue sections. We provide proof of concept using -opioid receptor (MOP) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) antibodies. Indeed, three of four well-characterized phosphosite-specific MOP antibodies, including pS375-MOP, pT376-MOP, and pT379-MOP, showed robust neuronal immunostaining in brain and spinal cord sections of opioid-treated mice only after inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors. We then extended this approach to the CB1 receptor and demonstrated that one of three newly-generated phosphosite-specific CB1 antibodies, namely pS425-CB1, showed striking staining of fibers and varicosities in brain slices from cannabinoid-treated mice. Although subsequent experiments showed that phospho-CB1 immunostaining was less sensitive to phosphatases, we conclude that the use of phosphatase inhibitors should always be considered in the development of immunohistochemical procedures for new phosphosite-specific GPCR antibodies. In summary, we anticipate that this improved protocol will facilitate the widespread use of phosphorylation state-specific antibodies to monitor the activation of endogenous GPCRs under physiological and pharmacological conditions. Our approach may also prove useful to confirm target engagement of GPCR drug candidates in native tissues.",

    "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) is highly expressed on myeloid cells and is involved in cellular lipid homeostasis and inflammatory processes. Trem2 deletion in mice (Trem2-/-) has been implicated in evoking adipose tissue dysfunction, but its role in worsening obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction is not resolved. Here we aimed to determine the causal role of Trem2 in regulating glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in mice. Nine-week-old male and female littermate WT and Trem2-/- mice were fed low fat or high fat diet for 18 weeks and phenotyped for metabolic function. Diet-induced weight gain was similar between genotypes, irrespective of sex. Consistent with prior reports, we find that loss of Trem2 causes massive adipocyte hypertrophy and an attenuation in the lipid associated macrophage transcriptional response to obesity. In contrast to published data, we find that loss of Trem2 does not worsen metabolic function in obese mice. No differences in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance (ipGTT), oral GTT, or mixed meal substrate control, including postprandial glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, insulin, or triglycerides were found between WT and Trem2-/- animals. Similarly, no phenotypic differences existed when animals were challenged with stressors on metabolic demand (i.e., acute exercise or environmental temperature modulation) or when animals were challenged with a non-lethal dose of endotoxin. Collectively, we report a disassociation between adipose tissue remodeling caused by loss of Trem2 and whole-body metabolic homeostasis in obese mice. The complementary nature of experiments conducted gives credence to the conclusion that loss of Trem2 is unlikely to worsen glucose homeostasis in mice.",

Interactions between face and body perception, such as the influence of body posture on facial expression perception, also change with development. While the brain regions underpinning face and body processing are well-defined, little is known about how white-matter tracts linking these regions relate to perceptual development. Here, we obtained complementary diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures (fractional anisotropy FA, spherical mean [Formula]), and a quantitative MRI myelin-proxy measure (R1), within white-matter tracts of face- and body-selective networks in children and adolescents and related these to perceptual development. In tracts linking occipital and fusiform face areas, facial expression perception was predicted by age-related microstructural development, as measured by [Formula] and R1, as well as age-independent individual differences in microstructure, as measured by FA. Tract microstructure linking the body region in posterior superior temporal sulcus with anterior temporal lobe (ATL) was related to the influence of body on facial expression perception, supporting ATL as a site of face and body network convergence. Overall, our results highlight age-dependent and age-independent constraints that white-matter microstructure poses on perceptual abilities during development and the importance of complementary microstructural measures in linking brain structure and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Due to its high temporal resolution and non-invasive nature, electroencephalography (EEG) is considered a method of great value for the field of auditory cognitive neuroscience. In performing source space analyses, localization accuracy poses a bottleneck, which precise forward models based on individualized attributes such as subject anatomy or electrode locations aim to overcome. Yet acquiring anatomical images or localizing EEG electrodes requires significant additional funds and processing time, making it an oftentimes inaccessible asset. Neuroscientific software offers template solutions, on which analyses can be based. For localizing the source of auditory evoked responses, we here compared the results of employing such template anatomies and electrode positions versus the subject-specific ones, as well as combinations of the two. All considered cases represented approaches commonly used in electrophysiological studies. We considered differences between two commonly used inverse solutions (dSPM, sLORETA) and targeted the primary auditory cortex; a notoriously small cortical region that is located within the lateral sulcus, thus more prone to errors in localization. Through systematical comparison of the outcomes in terms of auditory activity attributes and leakage quantification, we assessed how the individualization steps impacted the analyses outcomes. Both electrode locations as well as subject anatomies were found to have an effect, which though varied based on the configuration considered. When comparing the inverse solutions, we moreover found that dSPM more consistently benefited from individualization of subject characteristics. Based on the scientific question considered, our results may be used to facilitate the planning of auditory neuroscientific experiments in terms of expected infrastructure, personnel and funds.",

    "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS), sometimes considered as a  second brain due to its large autonomy from central circuits is made of interconnected plexuses organized in a mesh-like network lining the gastrointestinal tract. Originally described as a leading actor of the regulation of digestion, bowel advance and intestinal secretion, its implication in various neuropathologies has recently been demonstrated. However, with few exceptions, its morphology and functions have been studied on thin sections of the intestinal wall or in dissected explants. Due to its intricate morphology, precious information on its three-dimensional (3-D) architecture and connectivity is often lost. In this context, we have developed a fast, label-free 3-D imaging method of the ENS, based on intrinsic signals of the tissue. We adapted a fast tissue-clearing protocol based on a high refractive-index aqueous solution, and then characterized the autofluorescence signals arising from the various cellular and sub-cellular components of the ENS. Immunofluorescence and spectral recordings complete this characterization. Finally, we demonstrate the fast acquisition of detailed 3-D image stacks of unlabeled mouse intestine, across the whole intestinal wall and including both the myenteric and submucosal enteric nervous plexuses using a new spinning-disk two-photon microscope. The combination of fast clearing (less than 15min for 73 % transparency), autofluorescence imaging and rapid volumetric imaging (less than a minute for the acquisition of s z-stack of 100 planes (150*150 {micro}m) at 300-nm spatial resolution) paves the way for new applications in fundamental and clinical research.",

    "abstract": "Stroke enhances proliferation of neural precursor cells within the subventricular zone (SVZ) and induces ectopic migration of newborn cells towards the site of injury. Here we characterize the identity of cells arising from the SVZ after stroke and provide insight into their function by uncovering a mechanism through which they facilitate neural repair and functional recovery. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that SVZ-derived cells that migrate towards stroke- induced cortical lesions in mice are predominantly undifferentiated precursors, suggesting that the main function of post-injury cytogenesis is not cell replacement. We find that SVZ-derived cells are a unique cellular source of trophic factors that instruct neural repair. Chemogenetic ablation of neural precursor cells or conditional knockout of VEGF in the adult neural stem cell lineage impairs neuronal and vascular reparative responses and worsens functional recovery after stroke. In addition, normal aging markedly diminishes the cytogenic response to stroke, resulting in worse functional recovery. Therapeutic replacement of VEGF in peri-infarct cortex is sufficient to induce neural repair and functional recovery in mice with arrested cytogenesis. These findings indicate that the SVZ cytogenic response following brain injury is a source of trophic support that drives neural repair and recovery.",

    "abstract": "Neural mass models (NMMs) are designed to reproduce the collective dynamics of neuronal populations. A common framework for NMMs assumes heuristically that the output firing rate of a neural population can be described by a static nonlinear transfer function (NMM1). However, a recent exact mean-field theory for quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons challenges this view by showing that the mean firing rate is not a static function of the neuronal state but follows two coupled non-linear differential equations (NMM2). Here we analyze and compare these two descriptions in the presence of second-order synaptic dynamics. First, we derive the mathematical equivalence between the two models in the infinitely slow synapse limit, i.e., we show that NMM1 is an approximation of NMM2 in this regime. Next, we evaluate the applicability of this limit in the context of realistic physiological parameter values by analyzing the dynamics of models with inhibitory or excitatory synapses. We show that NMM1 fails to reproduce important dynamical features of the exact model, such as the self-sustained oscillations of an inhibitory interneuron QIF network. Furthermore, in the exact model but not in the limit one, stimulation of a pyramidal cell population induces resonant oscillatory activity whose peak frequency and amplitude increase with the self-coupling gain and the external excitatory input. This may play a role in the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak uniform inputs, such as the electric fields produced by non-invasive brain stimulation.",

Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG).

While a growing number of studies use GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy, whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have helped elucidate previously inaccessible trajectories of early-life prenatal and neonatal brain development. To date, the interpretation of fetal-neonatal fMRI data has relied on linear analytic models, akin to adult neuroimaging data. However, unlike the adult brain, the fetal and newborn brain develops extraordinarily rapidly, far outpacing any other brain development period across the lifespan. Consequently, conventional linear computational models may not adequately capture these accelerated and complex neurodevelopmental trajectories during this critical period of brain development along the prenatal-neonatal continuum. To obtain a nuanced understanding of fetal-neonatal brain development, including non-linear growth, for the first time, we developed quantitative, systems-wide representations of neuronal circuitry in a large sample (>700) of fetuses, preterm, and full-term neonates using an unsupervised deep generative model called Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a model previously shown to be superior to linear models in representing complex resting state data in healthy adults. Here, we demonstrated that non-linear brain features, i.e., latent variables, derived with the VAE, carried important individual neural signatures, leading to improved representation of prenatal-neonatal brain maturational patterns and more accurate and stable age prediction compared to linear models. Using the VAE decoder, we also revealed distinct functional brain networks spanning the sensory and default mode networks. Using the VAE, we are able to reliably capture and quantify complex, non-linear fetal-neonatal functional neural connectivity. This will lay the critical foundation for detailed mapping of healthy and aberrant functional brain signatures that have their origins in fetal life.",

Cross-validated estimates revealed a statistically significant and clinically relevant predictive performance (Pearsons r = 0.36, p < 0.0005). The predictions were found to be specific to pain sensitivity and not biased towards potential confounding effects (e.g., anxiety, stress, depression, center-effects). Analysis of model coefficients suggests that the most robust cortical thickness predictors of pain sensitivity are the right rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus and left temporal pole. Cortical thickness in these regions was negatively correlated to pain sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Love is probably the most fascinating feeling that a person ever experiences. However, little is known about what is happening in the brains of a romantic couple -the central and most salient relationship during adult age- while they are particularly tender and exchanging loving words with one another.\n\nTo gain insight into nearly natural couple interaction, we collected data from N=84 individuals (including N=43 heterosexual couples) simultaneously in two functional magnetic resonance imaging scanners, while they sent and received compliments, i.e. short messages about what they liked about each other and their relationship. Activation patterns during compliment sharing in the individuals revealed a broad pattern of activated brain areas known to be involved in empathy and reward processing. Notably, the ventral striatum, including parts of the putamen, was activated particularly when selecting messages for the partner. This provides initial evidence that giving a verbal treat to a romantic partner seems to involve neural reward circuitry in the basal ganglia.\n\nThese results can have important implications for the neurobiological mechanisms protecting and stabilizing romantic relationships, which build a highly relevant aspect of human life and health.",

    "abstract": "The brain evolved to govern behavior in a dynamic world, in which pertinent information about choices is often in flux. Thus, the commitment to an action choice must reflect a balance between monitoring that information and the necessity to act before opportunities are lost. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of dynamic decision-making in humans using low dimensional space representation of brain wide magnetoencephalography recordings. We show that the principal components (PCs) of alpha (9-13 Hz) and beta power (16-24 Hz) are involved in tracking sensory information evolving over time in the sensorimotor and visual cortex. We also found that alpha PCs reflect the commitment to a particular choice, while beta PCs reflect motor execution. Finally, higher frequency components in subcortical areas reflect the adjustment of speed- accuracy tradeoff policies. These results provide a new detailed characterization of the distributed oscillatory brain processes underlying dynamic decision-making in humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThermal and tactile stimuli are transduced by different receptor classes. However, mechano- and thermo-sensitive afferents interact at spinal and supraspinal levels. Yet, most studies on responses to cooling stimuli are confounded by mechanical contact, making these interactions difficult to isolate. Methods for precise control of non-mechanical thermal stimulations remain challenging, particularly in the cold range.\n\nNew MethodWe developed a non-tactile, focal, temperature-controlled, multi-purpose cooling stimulator. This method controls the exposure of a target skin region to a dry-ice source. Using a thermal camera to monitor skin temperature, and adjusting the source-skin distance accordingly, we could deliver non-tactile cooling stimuli with customisable profiles, for studying different aspects of cold sensation.\n\nResultsTo validate our method, we measured absolute and relative thresholds for cold sensation without mechanical contact in 13 human volunteer participants, using the method of limits. We found that the absolute cold detection threshold was 32.71{degrees}C {+/-} 0.88 {degrees}C. This corresponded to a threshold relative to each participants baseline skin temperature of -1.08 {degrees}C {+/-} 0.37 {degrees}C.\n\nComparisons with Existing MethodOur method allows cooling stimulation without the confound of mechanical contact, in a controllable and focal manner.\n\nConclusionsWe report a non-contact cooling stimulator and accompanying control system. We used this to measure cold thresholds in the absence of confounding touch. Our method enables more targeted studies of both cold sensory pathways, and of cold-touch interactions.\n\nHighlightsMost studies on cold sensation fail to control for concomitant tactile input.\n\nA method to deliver non-tactile cooling stimuli was developed.\n\nThe method combines dry ice, a thermal camera, and motorised stages.\n\nThe method delivers rapid ramps and feedback-controlled pulses.\n\nThresholds for contactless cold perception were estimated in humans.",

    "abstract": "Accurate metacognitive judgements, such as forming a confidence judgement, are crucial for goaldirected behaviour but decline with older age. Besides changes in the sensory processing of stimulus features, there might also be changes in the motoric aspects of giving responses that account for age-related changes in confidence. In order to assess the association between confidence and response parameters across the adult lifespan, we measured response times and peak forces in a four-choice flanker task with subsequent confidence judgements. In 65 healthy adults from 20 to 76 years of age, we showed divergent associations of each measure with confidence, depending on decision accuracy. Participants indicated higher confidence after faster responses in correct but not incorrect trials. They also indicated higher confidence after less forceful responses in errors but not in correct trials. Notably, these associations were age-dependent as the relationship between confidence and response time was more pronounced in older participants, while the relationship between confidence and response force decayed with age. Our results add to the notion that confidence is related to response parameters and demonstrate noteworthy changes in the observed associations across the adult lifespan. These changes potentially constitute an expression of general age-related deficits in performance monitoring or, alternatively, index a failing mechanism in the computation of confidence in older adults.",

However, it is not clear which morphogenetic principles organize the stepwise assembly of the vasculature. We thus performed a longitudinal analysis of zebrafish tail fin vascular assembly, revealing the existence of temporally and spatially distinct morphogenetic processes. Initially, vein-derived endothelial cells (ECs) generated arteries in a reiterative process requiring Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Notch and cxcr4a signalling. Subsequently, veins produced veins in more proximal fin regions, transforming pre-existing artery-vein loops into a three-vessel pattern consisting of an artery and two veins. A distinct set of vascular plexuses formed at the base of the fin. They differed by virtue of diameter, flow magnitude and marker gene expression. At later stages, intussusceptive angiogenesis occurred from veins in distal fin regions. In proximal fin regions, we observed new vein sprouts crossing the inter-ray tissue through sprouting angiogenesis. Together, our results reveal a surprising diversity among the mechanisms generating the mature fin vasculature and suggest that these might be driven by separate local cues.",

Recent studies have implicated this structure as a possible site affected in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Interestingly, fetal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) has also been associated with an increased risk of ASD in humans and animal models. Therefore, we took the approach of determining the effects of VPA treatment on zebrafish OT development as a first step in identifying the mechanisms that allow its formation. We describe the normal OT development during the first 5 days of development and show that in VPA treated embryos, while proliferation of the OT neuroepithelium continued, neuronal specification stalled. This was followed by impairment of neurite extension and complexity, suggesting that in addition to neurogenesis, VPA treatment affects axonogenesis and dendritogenesis. VPA treatment was most detrimental during the first three days of development and did not appear to be linked to oxidative stress. In conclusion, our work provides a foundation for research into mechanisms driving OT development, as well as the relationship between the OT, VPA, and ASD.",

PAM produces large datasets which benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify the vocalisations of these animals. We present a deep learning approach for the classification of dolphins echolocation clicks into two species groups in an environment with high background noise. We compare the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), in which we feed the models the raw waveform data and spectrograms. We show that both models perform well, with the highest performance achieved by a CNN fed with spectrograms (F1 score 97 %) and an RNN fed with raw data (F1 score 96%) fitted with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). We recommend the use of such models to classify echolocation clicks in marine environments where background noise levels exhibit high spatial and temporal variance. In particular, the RNN showed excellent performance, while being fed with raw data, in terms of reduced processing time and storage. Deep learning automatically extracts effective features from the raw waveform in the training process through multiple layers of the model, without the need to rely on feature extraction in a separate pre-processing step.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe concept of cumulative impacts is widespread in policy documents, regulations, and ecological studies, but quantification methods are still evolving. Infrastructure development usually takes place in landscapes with preexisting anthropogenic features. Typically, their impact is determined by computing the distance to the nearest feature only, thus ignoring the potential cumulative impacts of multiple features. We propose the cumulative ZOI approach to assess whether and to what extent anthropogenic features lead to cumulative impacts.\nC_LIO_LIThe approach estimates both effect size and zone of influence (ZOI) of anthropogenic features and allows for estimation of cumulative effects of multiple features distributed in the landscape. First, we use simulations and an empirical study to understand under which circumstances cumulative impacts arise. Second, we demonstrate the approach by estimating the cumulative impacts of tourist infrastructure in Norway on the habitat of wild reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus), a nearly-threatened species highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance.\nC_LIO_LISimulations show that analyses based on the nearest feature and our cumulative approach are indistinguishable in two extreme cases: when features are few and scattered and their ZOI is small, and when features are clustered and their ZOI is large. Empirical analyses revealed cumulative impacts of private cabins and tourist resorts on reindeer, extending up to 10 and 20 km, with different decaying functions. Although the impact of an isolated private cabin was negligible, the cumulative impact of  cabin villages could be much larger than that of a single large tourist resort. Focusing on the nearest feature only underestimates the impact of  cabin villages on reindeer.\nC_LIO_LIThe suggested approach allows us to quantify the magnitude and spatial extent of cumulative impacts of point, linear, and polygon features in a computationally efficient and flexible way and is implemented in the oneimpact R package. The formal framework offers the possibility to avoid widespread underestimations of anthropogenic impacts in ecological and impact assessment studies and can be applied to a wide range of spatial response variables, including habitat selection, population abundance, species richness and diversity, community dynamics, and other ecological processes.\nC_LI",

Our model outputs include the number of secondarily infected animals and farms, spatial dissemination, the role of animal movement and between- farm distances as transmission pathways, and the effectiveness of countermeasures.

Furthermore, the median distance between seeded and secondary infections was 5.77 with the highest spatial dissemination reaching 695.40 kilometers.

    "abstract": "The ability to use small molecule alkaloids as defensive chemicals has evolved in many organisms, often via trophic interactions due to dietary specialization. Animals with diet-derived defenses must balance food choices to maintain their defense reservoirs along with other physiological needs. However, environmental availability of prey and dietary preferences of vertebrate animals with acquired defenses remains largely unexplored. Here, we test the hypothesis that poison frogs that sequester alkaloids from their arthropod prey display prey preference. We collected alkaloid-defended Diablito frogs (Oophaga sylvatica) and leaf litter samples in five localities in northwestern Ecuador. Additionally, we collected the undefended Chimbo rocket frogs (Hyloxalus infraguttatus) from one locality in which it is living in sympatry with O. sylvatica. We found that both diets and skin alkaloids of O. sylvatica frogs were distinct among localities, and that undefended and sympatric H. infraguttatus ate fewer ants and mites. Unexpectedly, across O. sylvatica populations, we found a negative correlation between their summed skin alkaloid content and number of ants and mites they consumed. Finally, we compared leaf litter ants to frog stomach contents, and found that frogs eat a small subset of the available ant genera found in surrounding leaf litter, as only 13% of all the ants recovered from leaf litter samples belong to the 16 ant genera consumed by the frogs. Our results suggest that the consumption of diet-acquired defenses depends on preference-informed food choices in addition to environmental availability. This impacts our understanding of chemical defenses as a whole, as behavioral reinforcement may be an understudied, yet important selection factor in the evolution of acquired defenses.\n\nResumenLa capacidad de usar moleculas pequenas alcaloides como productos quimicos defensivos ha evolucionado en muchos organismos, a menudo a traves de interacciones troficas debido a la especializacion dietetica. Los animales con defensas derivadas de la dieta deben equilibrar la seleccion de los alimentos para mantener sus reservorios de defensa junto con otras necesidades fisiologicas. Sin embargo, la disponibilidad ambiental de presas y las preferencias dieteticas de los animales vertebrados con defensas adquiridas son aspectos en gran parte desconocidos. Aqui, probamos la hipotesis de que las ranas venenosas que obtienen alcaloides de sus presas de artropodos muestran preferencia por las presas. Recolectamos especimenes de ranas diablito (Oophaga sylvatica), con alcaloides defensivos, y muestras de hojarasca en cinco localidades del noroeste de Ecuador. Adicionalmente, recolectamos la rana cohete de Chimbo (Hyloxalus infraguttatus), sin alcaloides defensivos, de una localidad en la que vive en simpatria con O. sylvatica. Encontramos que tanto las dietas como los alcaloides de la piel de las ranas O. sylvatica eran distintas entre localidades, y que la simpatrica y no venenosa H. infraguttatus comia menos hormigas y acaros. Inesperadamente, entre poblaciones de O. sylvatica, encontramos una correlacion negativa entre la sumatoria del contenido de alcaloides cutaneos y el numero de hormigas y acaros que consumieron. Finalmente, comparamos las hormigas de hojarasca con el contenido del estomago de las ranas y descubrimos que las ranas comen un pequeno subconjunto de los generos de hormigas disponibles que se encuentran en la hojarasca circundante, ya que solo el 13% de todas las hormigas obtenidas de las muestras de hojarasca pertenecen a los 16 generos de hormigas consumidos por las ranas. Nuestros resultados sugieren que el consumo de defensas adquiridas a traves de la dieta depende de la seleccion preferencial de alimentos, ademas de la disponibilidad ambiental. Esto influye en nuestra comprension de las defensas quimicas en su conjunto, ya que el refuerzo conductual puede ser un factor de seleccion poco estudiado, pero importante, en la evolucion de las defensas adquiridas.",

    "abstract": "The rate and accuracy of translation hinges upon multiple components - including transfer RNA (tRNA) pools, tRNA modifying enzymes, and rRNA molecules - many of which are redundant in terms of gene copy number or function. It has been hypothesized that the redundancy evolves under selection, driven by its impacts on growth rate. However, we lack empirical measurements of the fitness costs and benefits of redundancy, and we have poor understanding of how this redundancy is organized across components. We manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of Escherichia coli by deleting 28 tRNA genes, 3 tRNA modifying systems, and 4 rRNA operons in various combinations. We find that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful, and costly under nutrient limitation. This nutrient-dependent cost of redundant tRNA genes stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate, and therefore varies as a function of the maximum growth rate attainable in a given nutrient niche. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. Importantly, these effects are also contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and posttranscriptional modification. Overall, our results indicate both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species evolutionary history with feasts and famines.",

    "abstract": "The discrete steps of transcriptional rewiring have been proposed to occur neutrally to ensure steady gene expression under stabilizing selection over long time-scales, especially when a regulon is being transferred from one transcription factor (TF) to another. Cooperative DNA binding between redundant regulatory components at the intermediate transition stage is believed to mediate this process, enabling a conflict-free switch between two TFs without a disruptive change in gene expression. Here, we have performed an evolutionary repair experiment on the Lachancea kluyveri yeast sef1{Delta} mutant by means of a suppressor development strategy. Complete loss of SEF1 forced cells to activate a rewiring process to compensate for the pleiotropic defects arising from misexpression of multiple TCA cycle genes. Using different selective conditions, we identified one generalist and one specialist suppressive loss-of-function mutation of IRA1 and AZF1, respectively. Our subsequent analyses show that Azf1 is a weak transcriptional activator regulated by the Ras1-PKA pathway. Azf1 loss-of-function triggers extensive gene expression changes responsible for both the compensatory and trade-off phenotypes. Our results indicate that the pleiotropic effects of dual perturbation of transcriptional networks are a potential mechanism for rapid adaptive compensation, facilitating the process of incipient transcriptional rewiring, and formation of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Mountain biotas have considerable conservation and research importance, but the formation of montane communities remains incompletely understood. Study of Indo-Pacific island faunas has inspired two main hypotheses for the generation of montane diversity. The first posits that montane populations arise via direct colonization from other mountain areas, while the second invokes recruitment from adjacent lowland populations. We sought to reconcile these apparently conflicting hypotheses by asking whether a species ancestral geographic origin determines its mode of mountain colonization. To this end, island-dwelling passerine birds at the faunal crossroads between Eurasia and Australo-Papua provide an ideal study system. We recovered the phylogenetic relationships of the regions montane species, and used this information to reconstruct their ancestral geographic ranges, elevational ranges, and migratory behavior. We also performed genomic population studies of three super-dispersive montane species/clades with broad island distributions. Eurasian-origin species populated archipelagos via direct colonization between mountains. This mode of colonization appears related to ancestral adaptations to cold and seasonal Palearctic climates, specifically short-distance migration. Australo-Papuan-origin mountain populations, by contrast, evolved from lowland ancestors, and highland distribution mostly precludes their further colonization of island mountains. The patterns and processes revealed for this group are compatible with taxon cycles, a hypothesized process of lowland lineage expansion followed by montane relictualization. Collectively, our analyses explain much of the distributional variation within a complex biological system, and provide a synthesis of two seemingly discordant hypotheses for montane community formation.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation modification has been proved to play an important role in heart diseases. In this study, the role of Ten-Eleven Translocation-2 (TET2), which is a key demethylation enzyme, is investigated in cardiac remodeling. TET2 is abundant in endothelial cells but decreased in hypertrophic hearts. TET2 knockdown in endothelial cells triggers endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), while overexpression of TET2 inhibits the EndMT. In vivo, Cdh5-CreERT2/TET2flox/flox; Rosa26-mTmG+/- mice are developed and undergo transverse aortic constriction (TAC) subsequently to induce pathological cardiac hypertrophy model. Hearts of Cdh5-CreERT2/TET2flox/flox mice show more severe hypertrophy and fibrosis than controls in the TAC model. Furthermore, EGLN3 is identified to participate in EndMT as the downstream target of TET2 by using RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Finally, vitamin C, which can mimic TET2 restoration, is found to partially improve cardiac function and inhibit myocardial fibrosis. These insights into how TET2 alleviates cardiac fibrosis may open new avenues for treating cardiac remodeling in the future.",

    "abstract": "85% of Americans drink caffeinated beverages on a daily basis. Each individual responds differently to caffeine depending on age, gender, diet, and ethnicity. Caffeinated beverages cause insomnia in some people, but not in others due to differences in the rate of caffeine metabolism. This study examines the variation in the caffeine metabolism of Lake Superior State University (LSSU) students. My hypothesis was that LSSU student allele frequencies would match those of the general population: 47.5% fast, 41.0% medium, and 11.5% slow caffeine metabolism. 200 LSSU students were sampled via buccal swabs. DNA was successfully isolated from 164 samples. Participants filled out a demographic questionnaire entailing caffeine intake, ethnicity, and sex. The CYP1A2 gene was amplified via standard PCR prior to genotyping by restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. The APAI restriction enzyme was used to determine the genotype of the rs762551 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), while the SACI enzyme was used as a positive digestion control. Overall, results showed a total of 42.7% fast, 44.5% medium, and 12.8% slow metabolizers. Of special note is that 24 of the 164 students sampled were of Native American heritage, an important yet underrepresented group in human genomics. This study provides the first reported look at the CYP1A2 variation within this North American subpopulation with metabolism rates being 50% fast, 33.3% medium, and 16.7% slow. The results confirm my initial hypothesis that the variation of caffeine metabolism gene frequencies for the LSSU student population would be representative of published allele frequencies for the general population.",

    "abstract": "The nucleolus is the most prominent membraneless compartment within the nucleus1, 2 - dedicated to the metabolism of ribosomal RNA. Nucleoli are composed of hundreds of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeated genes that form large chromosomal clusters3-5, whose high recombination rates can cause nucleolar dysfunction and promote genome instability6-8 related to metabolic and genetic diseases9-13. Intriguingly, the evolving architecture of genomes appears to have favored two strategic rDNA locations in a broad range of species - where a single locus per chromosome is situated either near the centromere or the telomere14, 15. To delve into how organisms may benefit from these nuclear organizations, we used a fused-karyotype strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae16 to megabase-engineer a chromosome with twin chromosome-collinear rDNA loci. We showed that the twin-rDNA yeast readily adapts exhibiting wild-type growth and maintaining rRNA homeostasis. Using imaging and chromosome conformation capture, we found that the twin loci merge into a single subnuclear compartment throughout the cell cycle. Unexpectedly, we found that rDNA locus size is dependent on its position relative to the centromere, whereby the locus that is centromere-distal undergoes size reduction at a higher frequency compared to the centromere-proximal counterpart. In sum, our work sheds light on the structural evolution of rDNA loci and provides new tools to study the rDNA dosage effect on cellular metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether FABP1 and FAS regulate expression of collagen and its crosslinking via lysyl oxidase in Zongdihua pigs. We wished to identify processes affecting meat quality using molecular genetics to provide a basis for breeding improvement of these animals. We measured expression levels of FABP1 and related genes using qRT-PCR in longissimus dorsi muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissues. Primary adipocytes from fat tissues were isolated and FABP1 and FAS were overexpressed from recombinant plasmids. Our sequence analysis of the cloned genes indicated that FABP1 gene encodes a hydrophobic protein of 128 amino acids and contained 12 predicted phosphorylation sites and no transmembrane region. FAS encodes 333 amino acid hydrophobic protein containing with 26 phosphorylation sites and 0 transmembrane regions. The basal levels of FABP1 and FAS in pig tissues expression were 3 -3.5-fold higher in subcutaneous fat compared with muscle (P < 0.01). Recombinant expression plasmids were successfully transfected into the cloned preadipocytes and (a) overexpression of FAS resulted in significantly increased expression of COL3A1 gene (P < 0.05) and significantly inhibited lysyl oxidase LOX expression (P < 0.01); (b) overexpression of FABP1 significantly increased COL3A1 expression (P < 0.01) and significantly inhibited LOX expression (P < 0.05) and significantly reduced lysyl oxidase activity (P < 0.01). Therefore, enhancing FABP1 expression increases collagen accumulation and this preliminarily suggests that FAS and FABP1 can serve as fat-related candidate genes providing a theoretical basis for the study of fat deposition in Zongdihua pigs.",

    "abstract": "Phase-sensitive Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) enables label-free imaging of cellular movements in vivo with detection sensitivity down to the nanometer scale. Due to this high sensitivity, it is widely employed in various emerging functional imaging modalities such as optoretinography (ORG), optical coherence elastography (OCE), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). However, achieving shot-noise limited detection sensitivity remains a major challenge for in-vivo measurements where the sample is constantly affected by vascular pulsation, breathing, eye and head motion, and other involuntary movements. Here, we propose a phase-restoring subpixel motion correction (PRSMC) method for post-hoc image registration in FD-OCT. Based on a generalized FD-OCT model, this method enables translational shifts of OCT images by arbitrary displacements while accurately restoring physically meaningful phase components, both with subpixel precision. With the sample movements estimated from averaged Doppler shift or normalized cross-correlation, we reconstructed the OCT images by correcting the axial displacement in the spectrum (k) domain and the lateral displacement in the spatial frequency domain, respectively. We validated our method in simulations, phantom experiments, and in-vivo optoretinogram imaging, where the advantages over conventional approaches for both amplitude stability and phase accuracy were demonstrated. Our approach significantly reduces the motion-induced phase error (MIPE) when imaging moving samples, achieving systematic phase sensitivities close to the shot-noise regime.",

    "abstract": "Compact and interpretable structural feature representations are required for accurately predicting properties and the function of proteins. In this work, we construct and evaluate three-dimensional feature representations of protein structures based on space-filling curves. We focus on the problem of enzyme substrate prediction, using two ubiquitous enzyme families as case studies: the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs) and the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferases (SAM-MTases). Space-filling curves such as Hilbert curve and the Morton curve generate a reversible mapping from discretized three-dimensional to one-dimensional representations and thus help to encode three-dimensional molecular structures in a system-independent way and with a minimal number of parameters. Using three-dimensional structures of SDRs and SAM-MTases generated using AlphaFold2, we assess the performance of the SFC-based feature representations in predictions on a new benchmark database of enzyme classification tasks including their cofactor and substrate selectivity. Gradient-boosted tree classifiers yield binary prediction accuracy of 0.766-0.906 and AUC (area under curve) parameters of 0.828-0.922 for the classification tasks. We investigate the effects of amino acid encoding, spatial orientation, and (the few) parameters of SFC-based encodings on the accuracy of the predictions. Our results suggest that geometry-based approaches such as SFCs are promising for generating protein structural representations and are complementary to the highly parametric methods, for example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs).",

T cell receptor (TCR) convergence describes T cells that share identical TCRs with the same amino acid sequences but have different DNA sequences due to codon degeneracy. We conducted a systematic investigation of TCR convergence using single-cell immune profiling and bulk TCR{beta}-sequence (TCR-seq) data obtained from both mouse and human samples, and uncovered a strong link between antigen-specificity and convergence. This association was stronger than T cell expansion, a putative indicator of antigen-specific T cells. By using flow sorted tetramer+ single T cell data, we discovered that convergent T cells were enriched for a neoantigen-specific CD8+ effector phenotype in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, TCR convergence demonstrated better prediction accuracy for immunotherapy response than the existing TCR repertoire indexes. In conclusion, convergent T cells are likely to be antigen-specific and might be a novel prognostic biomarker for anti-cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with complex pathophysiology, and AD-dysregulated pathways are inconsistent across different brain regions and patients. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been performed in different regions of postmortem AD brains, the common and distinct molecular features among different regions remains largely unclear. This hinders the discovery of repurposable and personalized drugs for AD. We combined four scRNA-seq datasets and systematically investigated the common and distinct cellular responses, cell subpopulations, and transcription factors involved in AD. Moreover, we explored the transcriptional heterogeneity of different AD subtypes at the single-cell level. Finally, we conducted individual-based drug repurposing analysis to explore repurposable and personalized drugs. Six major brain cell types were detected after scRNA-seq batch-effect removal and noise cells filtering. Integration with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics demonstrated that AD-susceptible genes were mainly enriched with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in glial cells rather than neuronal cells. While most of DEGs were regulated in opposite directions among different cell types, cell-cell communication analysis revealed several common cellular interaction events involved in neurogenesis, as well as increased cell-cell adhesion. Our comprehensive drug repositioning analysis identified new candidates for AD treatment, including trichostatin, which was predicted to be broadly applicable to different identified AD subtypes, and vorinostat, which was specific for one subtype of AD. In summary, we delineated a cell-specific atlas of the AD transcriptome. Our work illustrated strong cellular heterogeneity in AD for defining AD subtypes. The cell-specific features are important for understanding AD etiology, progression, and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the spatial landscape of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in health and disease significantly impact the surrounding tissues. Quantifying the spatial variations in the fibrillar architecture of major ECM proteins could enable a profound understanding of the link between tissue structure and function. We propose a method to capture relevant ECM features using graph networks for fiber representation in normal and tumor-like states of 4 alternatively spliced isoforms of fibronectin (FN) associated with embryonic development and disease. Then, we construct graph-derived statistical parametric maps, to study the differences across variants in normal and tumor-like architectures. This novel statistical analysis approach, inspired from the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images, provides an appropriate framework for measuring and detecting local variations of meaningful matrix parameters. We show that parametric maps representing fiber length and pore orientation isotropy can be studied within the proposed framework to differentiate among various tissue states. Such tools can potentially lead to a better understanding of dynamic matrix networks within the tumor microenvironment and contribute to the development of better imaging modalities for monitoring their remodeling and normalization following therapeutic intervention.\n\nAuthor SummaryDue to the complex architectural diversity of biological networks, there is an increasing need to complement statistical analyses with a qualitative and local description. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is one such network for which fiber arrangement has a major impact on tissue structure and function. Thus, a flexible numerical representation of fibrillar networks is needed for accurate analysis and meaningful statistical comparison of ECM in healthy and diseased tissue. First, we propose a versatile computational pipeline to study fiber-specific features of the ECM with graph networks. Then, we introduce a novel framework for the statistical analysis of graph-derived parametric maps, inspired from the statistical analysis of fMRI parametric maps. This analysis is useful for the quantitative/qualitative comparison of ECM fiber networks observed in normal and tumor-like, or fibrotic states. These methods are applied to study networks of fibronectin (FN), a provisional ECM component that dictates the organization of matrix structure. From 2D confocal images we analyzed architectural variations among 4 alternatively spliced isoforms of FN, termed oncofetal FN, that are prevalent in diseased tissue. We show how our approach can be used for the computation and statistical comparison of heterogeneous parametric maps representing FN variant-specific topological/geometrical features. These methods may be further developed and implemented into tumor tissue ECM profiling to decipher the specific roles of ECM landscapes and their remodeling in disease.",

Given the emerging evidence indicating the role of oncometabolites in DNA damage repair and its routine use in breast cancer treatment, it is timely to fingerprint the impact of olaparib treatment in cellular metabolism. Here, we report the biomolecular response of breast cancer cell lines with DNA damage repair defects to olaparib exposure.\n\nFollowing evaluation of olaparib sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines, we immunoprobed DNA double strand break foci and evaluated changes in cellular metabolism at various olaparib treatment doses using untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis. Following identification of altered features, we performed pathway enrichment analysis to measure key metabolic changes occurring in response to olaparib treatment.\n\nWe show a cell-line dependent response to olaparib exposure, and an increased susceptibility to DNA damage foci accumulation in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Metabolic changes in response to olaparib treatment were cell-line and dose-dependent, where we predominantly observed metabolic reprogramming of glutamine-derived amino acids and lipids metabolism.\n\nOur work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining molecular biology and metabolomics studies for the comprehensive characterisation of cell lines with different genetic profiles. Follow-on studies are needed to map the baseline metabolism of breast cancer cells and their unique response to drug treatment. Fused with genomic and transcriptomics data, such readout can be used to identify key oncometabolites and inform the rationale for the design of novel drugs or chemotherapy combinations.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous and sensory-evoked neuronal activity plays a decisive role in network formation during postnatal development. The thalamus is a major gateway for sensory outputs to the cortex, so that thalamic neuronal activity in newborn animals might be crucial for maturation of the thalamocortical network. The sensory-evoked intracellular thalamic activity and signal propagation in newborn animals remain largely unknown. Here we performed local field potential (LFP), juxtacellular, and patch clamp recordings in the somatosensory thalamus of urethane anesthetized rats at postnatal days 6-7 (P6-7, both sexes) with one whisker stimulation. To reach the thalamus with the electrodes the majority of the overlying cortex and hippocampus were removed. Deflection of only one (the principal) whisker induced spikes in a particular thalamic cell. Sensory stimulation evoked excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic events in thalamocortical cells. Up to 5-10 sensory-evoked large-amplitude excitatory events followed with 100-200 ms inter-event intervals, while multiple inhibitory events tended to form 20-40 ms inter-event intervals. Large-amplitude excitatory events produced spike bursts with an intraburst frequency of 50-100 Hz and/or short plateau potentials in thalamocortical cells. Inhibitory events could down-modulate evoked spiking or prevented a depolarization block. Juxtacellular recordings confirmed the partial inactivation of spikes during short plateau potentials. Excitatory events evoked low-threshold spikes (LTS) in thalamocortical cells, but, in agreement with previously reported results, hyperpolarizing current pulses generated weak LTS without spike bursts. We conclude that thalamic neuronal activity in rat pups is determined by relatively weak and slow intrinsic membrane currents and relatively strong synapses that might underlay immature forms of thalamocortical synchrony and signal propagation.",
