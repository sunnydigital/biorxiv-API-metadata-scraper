    "abstract": "Marine viruses have thoroughly been studied in seawater, yet their dispersal from neuston ecosystems at the air-sea interface towards the atmosphere remains a knowledge gap. Here, we show that 6.2 % of the studied virus population were shared between air-sea interface ecosystems and rainwater. Virus enrichment in the 1-mm thin surface microlayer and sea foams happened selectively, and variant analysis proved virus transfer to aerosols and rain. Viruses detected in rain and aerosols showed a significantly higher percent G/C base content compared to marine viruses, and a genetically distinct rain virome supports that those viruses could inhabit higher air masses. CRISPR spacer matches of marine prokaryotes to \"foreign\" viruses from rainwater prove regular virus-host encounters at the air-sea interface. Our findings on aerosolization and long-range atmospheric dispersal implicate virus-mediated carbon turnover in remote areas, viral dispersal mechanisms relevant to human health, and involvement of viruses in atmospheric processes like ice-nucleation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the normal variation of the sugarcane rhizosphere fungal microbiota throughout its life cycle is essential for the development of agricultural practices for fungal diseases (e.g., sugarcane tip rot, sugarcane red rot, and sugarcane smut) and ecological health associated with the microbiota. Therefore, we performed high-throughput sequencing of 18S rDNA of soil samples using the Illumina sequencing platform for correlation analysis of sugarcane rhizosphere microbiota time series, covering information from 84 samples in four growth periods. The results revealed that the sugarcane rhizosphere fungi possessed the maximum fungal richness in July (Tillering). Rhizosphere fungi are closely associated with sugarcane growth, including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Ochrophyta showed high abundance in a stage-specific manner. Through the Manhattan plots, 11 fungal genera were found to show a decreasing trend throughout the sugarcane growth period, and two fungal genera were significantly enriched at three stages of sugarcane growth (p < 0.05) including Pseudallescheria and Nectriaceae. In addition, soil pH, soil temperature (Tem), total nitrogen (TN) and total potassium (TP) were important drivers of fungal community structure at different stages of sugarcane growth. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) found that sugarcane disease status showed a significant and strong negative effect with selected soil properties, suggesting that poor soil may increase the likelihood of sugarcane disease. In addition changes in sugarcane rhizosphere community structure over time were mainly influenced by stochastic factors, but the contribution decreased to the lowest value after the sugarcane root adaptation system was stabilized (Maturity).\n\nIMPORTANCERhizosphere microbes are closely related to plant growth, and more studies have shown that the rhizosphere fungal microbial community has an important influence on plant health and growth status. However, little is known about the response of the rhizosphere fungal community to plant growth during the critical plant reproductive period. In this study, we analyzed the important response of the rhizosphere fungal community of sugarcane through the pattern of abundance changes in its critical growth nodes by various methods to investigate the subtle changes in the assembly of the rhizosphere fungal community with the growth of sugarcane. Our work provides innovative ideas for the prevention of soil-borne diseases in plants and also provides a solid basis for the development of microbial models of crops rhizosphere soil.",

    "abstract": "Whether the human placenta is a sterile organ is under debate. Yet, infection of the amniotic cavity, including the placenta, is causally linked to preterm birth. This study compares the bacterial profiles of term and preterm placentas through culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the amnion, amnion-chorion interface, subchorion, villous tree, and basal plate, while accounting for patient identity, mode of delivery, presence/absence of labor, and potential background DNA contamination. As no evidence of a placental microbiota in term pregnancy was found, these placentas were considered as controls. Placentas from preterm birth cases were more likely to yield bacterial cultures, and their bacterial DNA profiles were less rich than those of term controls, suggesting the predominance of only a few bacteria. Nevertheless, the bacterial DNA profiles of placentas from preterm cases and term controls were not consistently different. The placentas from preterm cases may often have a microbiota but the bacteria constituting these communities varied among the women. Mode of delivery had a pronounced effect on the bacterial profiles of all sampled levels of the placenta. Specifically, the bacterial DNA profiles of vaginally delivered placentas had higher relative abundances of Finegoldia, Gardnerella, Peptoniphilus, and Prevotella (each a common resident of the vaginal microbiota) than the profiles of cesarean-delivered placentas. Collectively, these data indicate that there is a not a placental microbiota in normal term pregnancy, and that although the placentas of some preterm cases were populated by bacteria, the identities of these bacteria varied among women delivering preterm.\n\nIMPORTANCEIf a placental microbiota exists, then current understanding of the roles of microorganisms in pregnancy outcomes need to be reconsidered. For instance, we will need to determine if a placental microbiota is beneficial to pregnancy outcome by excluding potential pathogens from colonizing the placenta and/or effectively priming the fetal immune system, and furthermore which characteristics of the placental microbiota preclude versus promote placental infection, which can result in pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Our findings here are consistent with prior investigations that have reported that there is not a placental microbiota in typical human pregnancies. Yet, bacteria can be detected in placentas from preterm deliveries. The principal source of microorganisms invading the amniotic cavity, including the placenta, is the vaginal microbiota. Focus should be on elucidating the metabolic and/or virulence characteristics of the subset of bacteria within the vaginal microbiota that commonly invade the amniotic cavity, resulting in infection.",

    "abstract": "Hydrocarbons (HCs) are organic compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. They mainly accumulate in oil reservoirs, but aromatic HCs can also have other sources and are widely distributed in the biosphere. Our perception of pathways for biotic degradation of major HCs and genetic information of key enzymes in these bioconversion processes have mainly been based on cultured microbes and are biased by uneven taxonomic representation. Here we use Annotree to provide a gene-centric view of aerobic degradation of aliphatic and aromatic HCs in a total of 23446 genomes from 123 bacterial and 14 archaeal phyla. Apart from the widespread genetic potential for HC degradation in Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes, genomes from an additional 18 bacterial and 3 archaeal phyla also hosted key HC degrading enzymes. Among these, such degradation potential has not been previously reported for representatives in the phyla UBA8248, Tectomicrobia, SAR324, and Eremiobacterota. While genomes containing full pathways for complete degradation of HCs were only detected in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota, other lineages capable of mediating such key steps could partner with representatives with truncated HC degradation pathways and collaboratively drive the process. Phylogeny reconstruction shows that the reservoir of key aerobic hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes in Bacteria and Archaea undergoes extensive diversification via gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer. This diversification could potentially enable microbes to rapidly adapt to novel and manufactured HCs that reach the environment.",

    "abstract": "Microplastic (MP) pollution is an environmental burden. MP enters food webs via ingestion by macrofauna, including isopods (Porcellio scaber) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, MP-effects on the host and its gut microbiome are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that biodegradable (polylactic acid, PLA) and non-biodegradable (polyethylene terephthalate, PET; polystyrene, PS) MP have contrasting effects on P. scaber mediated by changes of the associated gut microbiome. Although the isopods avoided food containing PS, isopod fitness after eight-week MP-exposure was unaffected. Qualitative and quantitative 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA analyses of gut microbiomes indicated general MP effects, MP-type specific indicator taxa, and stimulation by PLA compared to MP-free controls. Isopods emitted hydrogen, and its production increased and decreased after PLA-food and PET- or PS-food ingestion, respectively, relative to controls as indicated by microsensor measurements. Gut pH was unaffected by MP. We identified the gut of P. scaber as significant mobile source of reductant for soil microbiomes likely due to Enterobacteriaceae related fermentation activities that were stimulated by lactate generated during PLA-degradation. The findings suggest negative effects of PET and PS on gut fermentation, modulation of isopod hydrogen emissions by MP pollution, and the potential of MP to affect terrestrial food webs.",

    "abstract": "The use of rotations is an effective strategy to control crop diseases and improve plant health. The soil bacterial communities in the rhizosphere are highly important for maintaining soil productivity. However, the composition and structure of soil bacterial communities in the rotations of vegetable crops remain unclear. In this study, we explored the bacterial diversity and community structure of the tomato rhizosphere, including enzyme activities, yield, and fruit quality, under three different cropping systems: tomato-tomato continuous cropping (TY1), eggplant-tomato (S. melongena) rotation (TY2) and arrowhead-tomato (Sagittaria trifolia-Solanum lycopersicum) rotation (TY3). The composition and diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial communities differed significantly. The diversity was more in the TY2 and TY3 treatments than those in the TY1 treatment. Chujaibacter and Rhodanobacter were two predominant and unique strains detected only in TY1, while the relative abundances of Curvibacter and Luteimonas were the highest in TY2 and TY3, respectively. Moreover, Lysobacterium was a relatively abundant type of biocontrol bacterium found only in the TY3 treatment, which could contribute to alleviating the obstacle of tomato continuous cropping. Compared with the TY1 treatment, the activities of catalase were significantly higher in the TY2 and TY3 treatments. In addition, compared with TY1, the TY2 and TY3 plots increased the following parameters: tomato yields by 24-46%, total soluble solids by 37-93%, total organic acid by 10-15.7% and soluble protein by 10-21%, while the content of nitrate was significantly reduced by 23%. Altogether, compared with the tomato monoculture, the rotations of tomato with eggplant and arrowhead shifted the rhizosphere bacterial communities and improved the yield and quality of the vegetables. Moreover, a tomato rotation, particularly with arrowhead, was an effective way to alleviate the obstacles of continuous cropping.",

Despite the apparent core role that protozoal species exert, their major biological and metabolic contributions to rumen function remain largely undescribed in vivo. Here, we have leveraged (meta)genome-centric metaproteomes from rumen fluid samples originating from both cattle and goats fed diets with varying inclusion levels of lipids and starch, to detail the specific metabolic niches that protozoa occupy in the context of their microbial co-habitants. Initial proteome estimations via total protein counts and label-free quantification highlight that entodiniomorph species Entodinium and Epidinium as well as the holotrichs Dasytricha and Isotricha comprise an extensive fraction of the total rumen metaproteome. Proteomic detection of protozoal metabolism such as hydrogenases (Dasytricha, Isotricha, Epidinium, Enoploplastron), carbohydrate-active enzymes (Epidinium, Diplodinium, Enoploplastron, Polyplastron), microbial predation (Entodinium) and volatile fatty acid production (Entodinium and Epidinium) was observed at increased levels in high methane-emitting animals. Despite certain protozoal species having well-established reputations for digesting starch, they were unexpectedly less detectable in low methane emitting-animals fed high starch diets, which were instead dominated by propionate/succinate-producing bacterial populations suspected of being resistant to predation irrespective of host. Finally, we reaffirmed our abovementioned observations in geographically independent datasets, thus illuminating the substantial metabolic influence that under-explored eukaryotic populations have in the rumen, with greater implications for both digestion and methane metabolism.",

To better understand the microbial communities and their functions when in vitro ruminal fermentation, the microbiome and SCFAs production were investigated using rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) system which was inoculated/co- inoculated with rumen contents from goat and cow. This study reconstructed 1677 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from metagenomic sequencing. The copresent microbiome containing 298 MAGs were found in metagenomic data of these contents and previous ruminal representative samples. These copresent MAGs were overrepresented in decomposing various substrates, especially pectin and xylan. Additionally, the SCFAs productions in RUSITEC were linked with copresent MAGs. Copresent MAGs obtained from this study shows promise to point out the direction for further research on in vitro ruminal fermentation, and enables a better understanding of rumen microbiotal structures and functions under in vitro condition.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/497131v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@310c66org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@251334org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fdfecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@363d8f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Overall, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidota dominated the general bacterial communities. Almost all individuals hosted bacteria of the genus Granulosicoccus, accounting for 12% of the total sequences, and eight additional core genera were identified.

    "abstract": "Gut microbial dysbiosis has been associated with hypertension. An extremely high incidence of essential hypertension was found in the Han and the Yugur who resided in Sunan county in East Asias nomadic steppes with little population movement. In attempt to investigate the gut microbial role in hypertension, we recruited a total of 1, 242 Yugur and Han people, who had resided in Sunan County for more than 15 years and accounted for 3% of the local population. The epidemiological survey of 1,089 individuals indicated their nearly 1.8 times higher prevalence of hypertension (38.2-43.3%) than the average in China (23.2%), under a special high-calorie diet based on wheat, cattle, mutton, and animal offal. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the fecal samples of 153 individuals revealed that certain Lachnospiraceae genera were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, P = 5.46 x 10-6), systolic blood pressure (SBP, P = 7.22 x 10-3), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, P = 1.8 x 10-3). HDL-C was positively correlated with SBP (P = 0.023). We further observed that serum butyrate content was lower in both Han (P = 1.99 x 10-3) and Yugur people (P = 0.031) with hypertension than those without hypertension. This study gives a novel insight into the role of gut microbial dysbiosis in hypertension modulation under a high-calorie diet, where the notable depletion of Lachnospiraceae genera might lead to less production of butyrate, contributing to the lower level of HDL-C, and elevating blood pressure in hypertension.\n\nIMPORTANCEDietary nutrients can be converted by gut microbiota into metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, which may serve as disease-preventing agents in hypertension. Due to limited population mobility and a unique high-calorie dietary habit, the recruited cohort in this study could be a representative for elucidating the associations between gut microbiota and hypertension under high-calorie diet. Moreover, low levels of HDL-C have previously been associated with an increased risk of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Our findings provide a new insight that low levels of HDL-C may be a potential medium between depletion of Lachnospiraceae genera and hypertension under high-calorie diet, which might also be a potential candidate for other CVDs.",

To explore which ERVs get co-opted and why, we tracked the epigenetic fate of murine IAPEz elements using an in vitro model of embryonic stem cell (ESC) to neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation. TRIM28-repression depended on a 190bp sequence, previously shown to confer IAPEzs with retrotransposition activity. A subset of IAPEzs ([~]15%) exhibit genetic divergence from this sequence, which we term escapees. While repressed IAPEzs succumb to a previously undocumented epigenetic handover from H3K9me3 in ESCs to H3K27me3 in NPCs, escapee IAPEzs evade repression, resulting in their transcriptional derepression in NPCs. Escapee IAPEzs enhance expression of nearby neural genes and contribute to gene expression differences between mouse strains, which we discern by employing IAPEz insertion polymorphisms. In sum, co-opted ERVs stem from genetic escapees that have lost vital sequences required for both TRIM28 restriction and autonomous retrotransposition.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LITracking the epigenetic fate of ERVs through neural differentiation reveals which ERVs are subject to co-option and why.\nC_LIO_LIMost ERVs succumb to H3K9me3 deposition in ESCs with H3K27me3 memory in NPCs.\nC_LIO_LIERVs that act as enhancers to nearby neural genes have undergone genetic escape from TRIM28 repression.\nC_LIO_LIEpigenetic evasion is an evolutionary trade-off that comes with loss of sequences necessary for retrotransposition.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=130 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/497016v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@175b6c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1313692org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f5e33forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5ad3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstract.C_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Up to 93% of the human genome may show evidence of transcription, yet annotated transcripts account for less than 5%. It is unclear what makes up this major discrepancy, and to what extent the excess transcription has a definable biological function, or is just a pervasive byproduct of non-specific RNA polymerase binding and transcription initiation. Understanding the default state of the genome would be informative in determining whether the observed pervasive activity has a definable function. The genome of any modern organism has undergone billions of years of evolution, making it unclear whether any observed genomic activity, or lack thereof, has been selected for. We sought to address this question by introducing a completely novel 100-kb locus into the genomes of two eukaryotic organisms, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus, and characterizing its genomic activity based on chromatin accessibility and transcription. The locus was designed by reversing (but not complementing) the sequence of the human HPRT1 locus, including [~]30-kb of both upstream and downstream regulatory regions, allowing retention of sequence features like repeat frequency and GC content but ablating coding information and transcription factor binding sites. We also compared this reversed locus with a synthetic version of the normal human HPRT1 locus in both organismal contexts. Despite neither the synthetic HPRT1 locus nor its reverse version coding for any promoters evolved for gene expression in yeast, we observed widespread transcriptional activity of both loci. This activity was observed both when the loci were present as episomes and when chromosomally integrated, although it did not correspond to any of the known HPRT1 functional regulatory elements. In contrast, when integrated in the mouse genome, the synthetic HPRT1 locus showed transcriptional activity corresponding precisely to the HPRT1 coding sequence, while the reverse locus displayed no activity at all. Together, these results show that genomic sequences with no coding information are active in yeast, but relatively inactive in mouse, indicating a potentially major difference in \"default genomic states\" between these two divergent eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis by the ribosome involves large-scale rearrangements of the \"small\" subunit (SSU; [~]1 MDa), which include inter- and intra-subunit rotational motions. With more than 1000 structures of ribosomes and ribosomal subunits now publicly available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to design precise experiments that are based on a comprehensive analysis of all known rotation states. To overcome this limitation, we present the Ribosome Angle Decomposition (RAD) method, where the orientation of each small subunit head and body is described in terms of three angular coordinates (rotation, tilt and tilt direction) and a single translation. To demonstrate the utility of the accompanying software (RADtool) we applied it to all published ribosome and mitoribosome structures. This identified and analyzed 1077 fully-assembled ribosome complexes, as well as 280 isolated small subunits from 48 organisms. The RAD approach quantitatively distinguishes between previously described qualitative rotational features, determines when rotation-only descriptions are insufficient, and shows that tilt-like rearrangements of the SSU head and body are pervasive in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. Together, the presented database and technique provide a robust platform for systematically analyzing, visualizing, and comparing subunit orientations of ribosomes from all kingdoms of life. Accordingly, the RAD resource establishes a common foundation with which structural, simulation, single-molecule and biochemical efforts can precisely interrogate the dynamics of this prototypical molecular machine.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen availability is critical for microbes as some are obligatorily dependent on oxygen for energy conservation. However, aerobic microbes that live in environments with varying oxygen concentrations experience pressures over evolutionary time, selecting alternative energy metabolisms that relax the dependence on oxygen. One such capacity is extracellular electron transfer (or EET), which is the ability to transfer electrons from central metabolism to extracellular oxidants such as iron and manganese oxides. We posit that the {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, highly specialized lineages heretofore recognized as strict aerobes, can be capable of EET as they have been constantly observed in oxygen-limiting and depleted environments. Here, we show that a strictly aerobic ammonia-oxidizer, Nitrosomonas communis, utilized a poised electrode to maintain metabolic activity in anoxic conditions. The presence and activity of multi-heme cytochromes suggested that direct electron transfer is the mechanism underlying EET. Molecular clock models suggest that the ancestors of {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers appeared after the oxygenation of Earth when the oxygen levels were >10-4 pO2 (PAL), suggesting their aerobic origins. Phylogenetic reconciliations of gene and species trees show that the multi-heme c-type EET proteins in Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira were acquired by gene transfer from {beta}-proteobacteria during oxygen scarcity. The preservation of EET metabolism over billions of years under fluctuating oxygen levels and aspects of EET physiology in {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers might explain how they have been coped with oxygen stress and survived under oxygen deprivation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMetabolic versatility can permit typically aerobic microbes to survive in anaerobic conditions when oxygen is deficient as a terminal electron acceptor. This article demonstrates a previously unidentified anaerobic extracellular electron transfer metabolism that operates in aerobic {beta}-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers and reconstructs the evolutionary history of this metabolism, linking it to the early history of Earths oxygenation. Our approach contributes to the understanding of metabolisms in the N-cycle and their evolution on Earth, as well as how aerobic microbes manage to retain energy generation under oxygen-limiting or depleted conditions.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAG designed the physiological research with PRG and the phylogenetic research with GF; AG performed the research, AG analyzed the data with PRG and GF.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSequence verification is essential for plasmids used as critical reagents or therapeutic products. Typically, high-quality plasmid sequence is achieved through capillary-based Sanger sequencing, requiring customized sets of primers for each plasmid. This process can become expensive, particularly for applications where the validated sequence needs to be produced within a regulated and quality-controlled environment for downstream clinical research applications.\n\nResultsHere, we describe a cost-effective and accurate plasmid sequencing and consensus generation procedure using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION device as an alternative to capillary-based plasmid sequencing options. This procedure can verify the identity of a pure population of plasmid, either confirming it matches the known and expected sequence, or identifying mutations present in the plasmid if any exist. We use a full MinION flow cell per plasmid, maximizing available data and allowing for stringent quality filters. Pseudopairing reads for consensus base calling reduces read error rates from 5.3 % to 0.53 %, and our pileup consensus approach provides per-base counts and confidence scores, allowing for interpretation of the certainty of the resulting consensus sequences. For pure plasmid samples, we demonstrate 100 % accuracy in the resulting consensus sequence, and the sensitivity to detect small mutations such as insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide variants. In test cases where the sequenced pool of plasmids contains subclonal templates, detection sensitivity is similar to that of traditional capillary sequencing.\n\nConclusionsOur pipeline can provide significant cost savings compared to outsourcing clinical-grade sequencing of plasmids, making generation of high-quality plasmid sequence for clinical sequence verification more accessible. While other long-read-based methods offer higher-throughput and less cost, our pipeline produces complete and accurate sequence verification for cases where absolute sequence accuracy is required.",

    "abstract": "Loss of oral tolerance (LOT) to gluten, characterized by a T helper 1 (Th1) gluten-specific immune response, is a hallmark of celiac disease (CeD) and can be triggered by enteric viral infections. We hypothesized that certain gut microbes have the capacity to protect against virus-mediated LOT. By using our previously defined reovirus-mediated LOT CeD model, we discovered that the gut colonizing protist Tritrichomonas (T.) arnold promotes oral tolerance and protects against reovirus-mediated LOT by suppressing the reovirus-induced proinflammatory program of dietary-antigen-presenting CD103+ dendritic cells. Importantly, T. arnold did not affect antiviral host immunity, suggesting that T. arnold-mediated protection against T1L-induced LOT is not attributable to differences in antiviral host responses. Additionally, using gnotobiotic mice, we found that Tritrichomonas arnold colonization is sufficient to protect against reovirus-mediated LOT in the absence of the microbiota. Mechanistically, we show that Tritrichomonas arnold colonization restrains reovirus-induced inflammatory responses in dendritic cells and thus limit their ability to promote Th1 immune responses ex vivo. Finally, our studies using human stool samples support a role for Tritrichomonas sp. colonization in protecting against development of CeD. This study will motivate the design of effective therapies to prevent LOT to gluten in at-risk individuals and to reinstate tolerance to gluten in CeD patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTritrichomonas arnold protects against virus-mediated loss of oral tolerance to gluten and is underrepresented in celiac disease patients.",

    "abstract": "The Bacillus cereus group is a species complex of the Bacillus genus that includes several closely related species. Within this group, bacteria indicated as B. cereus sensu stricto (B. cereus) are the causative agent of two different types of gastrointestinal diseases associated with food poisoning. Outbreaks of this opportunistic pathogen are generally due to the resistance of its spores to heat, pH and desiccation that makes hard their complete inactivation from food products. B. cereus is commonly isolated from a variety of environments, including intestinal samples of infected and healthy people. We report the genomic and physiological characterization of MV19, a human intestinal strain closely related (ANI value of 98.81%) to the reference strain B. cereus ATCC 14579. MV19 cells were able to grow in a range of temperatures between 20 and 44{degrees}C. At the optimal temperature the sporulation process was induced very rapidly and mature spores efficiently released, however these appeared structurally and morphologically defective. At the sub-optimal growth temperature of 25{degrees}C sporulation was slow and less efficient but a high total number of fully functional spores was produced. Altogether, results reported here indicate that the reduced rapidity and efficiency of sporulation at 25{degrees}C are compensated by a high quality and quantity of released spores, suggesting the relevance of different performances at different growth conditions for the adaptation of this bacterium to diverse environmental niches.",

    "abstract": "Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) is an essential but potentially toxic cellular cofactor. While most organisms are heme prototrophs, many microorganisms can utilize environmental heme as iron source. The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans can utilize host heme in the iron-poor host environment, using an extracellular cascade of soluble anchored hemophores, and plasma membrane ferric reductase-like proteins. To gain additional insight into the C. albicans heme uptake pathway, we performed an unbiased genetic selection for mutants resistant to the toxic heme analog Ga3+-protoporphyrin IX at neutral pH, and a secondary screen for inability to utilize heme as iron source. Among the mutants isolated were the genes of the pH-responsive RIM pathway, and a zinc finger transcription factor, HUF1. In the presence of hemin in the medium, HUF1 is induced, the Huf1 protein is stabilized and Huf1-GFP localizes to the nucleus. In the huf1 mutant, cytoplasmic heme levels are elevated, while influx of extracellular heme is lower. Gene expression analysis indicated that in the presence of extracellular hemin, Huf1 activates the heme oxygenase HMX1, which breaks down excess cytoplasmic heme, while at the same time it also activates all the known heme uptake genes. These results indicate that Huf1 is a heme-responsive transcription factor that plays a role both in cytoplasmic heme homeostasis and in utilization of extracellular heme. The induction of heme uptake genes by Huf1 under iron satiety indicates that preferential utilization of host heme can be a dietary strategy in a heme prototroph.",

We determined the arginine methylation and phosphorylation landscape of the Pumilio domain-containing RBP Puf4 from the basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. We found that methyl-deficient Puf4 mutants do not complement critical PUF4 deletion phenotypes, such as resistances to endoplasmic reticulum stress and antifungals, and cell wall remodeling. Methyl-deficient mutants also exhibit unique RNA and protein interactions. Lastly, we identified intra-protein cross talk between post-translationally modified methylated and phosphorylated residues.

    "abstract": "BackgroundS. aureus is a major pathogen in India, causing nosocomial infections, but little is known about its molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance in hospital settings. Here, we use WGS to characterize 508 S. aureus clinical isolates collected across India and analyze them in a global context.\n\nMethodsWhole-genome sequencing was performed on 508 clinical isolates of S. aureus collected from 17 sentinel sites across India between 2014 and 2019 with the Illumina platform. AMR genotypes were predicted using Staphopia. Isolates carrying novel SCCmec cassettes were further characterized using long-read sequencing. A temporal analysis of clonal complex (CC) 22 global isolates from 14 different studies was performed using BactDating.\n\nResultsSequencing results confirmed 478 isolates as S. aureus. ST22, ST772 & ST239 were the major clones identified. An in-depth analysis of the 175 CC22 Indian isolates identifies two novel ST22 MRSA clones, PVL+ and one harboring the tsst-1 gene. Temporal analysis showed that these two ST22 clusters shared a common ancestor in the 1980s and they became widespread after the year 2000 in India. Analyzing these in a global context, we found evidence of transmission of the two Indian clones to other parts of the world.\n\nConclusionOur study describes a large retrospective S. aureus sampled from India. By comparing the Indian isolates globally we show the evidence of the international transmission of ST22 Indian isolates. Even though the two of the major dominant clones (ST772 and ST239) using WGS have been reported, this is the first study that describes the third dominant clone (ST22) in India.\n\nImpact statementStaphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen listed as a high-priority pathogen by WHO. It is a leading cause of nosocomial infections in India and worldwide. Our study is the first study to describe the epidemiology of S. aureus in India with a large sample set of 478. Here we describe a collection of 478 S. aureus genomes, isolated from 17 sentinel sites in India, between 2014 and 2019. With the focus on understanding sequence types, AMR profiles, SCCmec types, and spa types and discuss these in the context of previous molecular studies on S. aureus conducted in India. We also conducted an in-depth analysis of the Clonal Complex 22 Indian isolates and we identified two novel ST22 MRSA clones, both PVL+ and one harboring the tsst-1 gene. Temporal analysis shows that these two ST22 clusters originated around 2010 in India. Analyzing these in a global context, we found evidence of transmission of the two Indian clones in other parts of the world. Analysis of a cluster of 33 isolates belonging to ST239 from a single hospital in Bangalore indicates an outbreak that persisted over the period of three years from a single contamination source. The novel SCCmec types identified in our study are characterized using long reads to understand their genetic structure.\n\nData SummaryO_LIIllumina read files of the strains used in the study have been deposited in European Nucleotide Archive, BioProject PRJEB29740 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB29740?show=reads).

    "abstract": "The lipid membrane is a fundamental part of life. However, the effects of different stresses on membranal integrity and physiology are less understood. Using novel 4-aminophthalimide-based membrane-specific dyes (4AP-Cn: n is carbon chain-length), aided with confocal microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and flow cytometry, we have studied stress-mediated changes in E. coli membranes. By exploiting the depth-dependent positioning and subsequent environmental sensitivity of the dyes, we have proposed a measure of antibiotic-induced membrane damage: the fluorescence Peak Maxima Difference (PMD) between 4AP-C9 and 4AP-C13. The ROS-influenced PMD quantifies cytoplasmic membrane thickness and measures sensitivity against most bactericidal antibiotics, depending upon the extent of lipid peroxidation. Importantly, we have verified this observation using antibiotic-sensitive and resistant clinical isolates of E. coli and ESKAPE pathogens like K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. This study underscores the role of antibiotic-induced membrane changes; a critical issue given the increasing global antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Macroendocytosis comprising phagocytosis and macropinocytosis are actin-driven processes regulated by small GTPases that depend on the dynamic reorganization of the membrane that protrudes and internalizes extracellular material by cup-shaped structures. To effectively capture, enwrap, and internalize their targets, these cups are arranged into a peripheral ring or ruffle of protruding actin sheets emerging from an actin-rich, non-protrusive zone at its base. Despite extensive knowledge of the mechanism driving actin assembly of the branched network at the protrusive cup edge, which is initiated by the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex downstream of Rac signaling, our understanding of actin assembly in the base is still incomplete. In the Dictyostelium model system, the Ras-regulated formin ForG was previously shown to specifically contribute to actin assembly at the cup base. Loss of ForG is associated with a strongly impaired macroendocytosis and a 50% reduction of F-actin content at the base of phagocytic cups, in turn indicating the presence of additional factors that specifically contribute to actin formation at the base. Here, we show that ForG synergizes with the Rac-regulated formin ForB to form the bulk of linear filaments at the cup base. Consistently, combined loss of both formins virtually abolishes cup formation and leads to severe defects of macroendocytosis, emphasizing the relevance of converging Ras- and Rac-regulated formin pathways in assembly of linear filaments in the cup base, which apparently provide mechanical support to the entire structure. Remarkably, we finally show that active ForB, unlike ForG, additionally drives phagosome rocketing to aid particle internalization.\n\nSignificance StatementCup formation in macroendocytosis is a decisive, actin-dependent process that relies on distinct actin assembly factors generating the necessary mechanical forces to drive rearrangements of the plasma membrane and engulfment of extracellular material. Hitherto, in Dictyostelium the Arp2/3 complex and VASP were shown to promote actin assembly at the protrusive rim of phagocytic cups, while the Ras-regulated formin ForG generates about half of the actin filament mass at the base. Here, we show that ForG synergizes with the Rac-regulated formin ForB to form the bulk of filaments at the cup base. Loss of both formins virtually abolishes cup formation and leads to dramatic defects in macroendocytosis, illustrating the relevance of converging Ras- and Rac-regulated signaling pathways in this process.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the main topic of naturalistic speech in a multi-speaker environment is demanding though the availability of visual speech can be beneficial for speech comprehension. Recent studies provided evidence that low-frequency brain rhythms play an important role in the processing of acoustic speech features. However, at present, the neural dynamics of brain rhythms implementing a higher-order semantic system during naturalistic audiovisual speech perception is unknown. Here we investigated information processing carried by low-frequency oscillations in delta and theta bands for audiovisual speech integration for high-level semantic gist processing using a representational interaction approach. By manipulating the degree of high-level semantic content (speech chunks with high versus low topic probability) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling algorithm and complexity of speaker environment (single versus multi-speaker), we first found that delta and theta phase exert distinctive roles in high-level semantic processing where delta phase represents auditory and visual inputs synergistically whereas theta band does so redundantly. Next, we show both forms of representational interaction are observed to be greater for speech with low semantic gist, supported by speech comprehension and white matter tractography. Furthermore, we show that the delta phase-specific synergistic interaction in the right auditory, temporal, and inferior frontal areas is sensitive to the speaker environment, whereas theta band activity showing redundant representations is sensitive to semantic content. Our results shed new light on dynamic neural mechanisms of implementing higher-order semantic systems through representational interactions between audiovisual speech information and differential roles of delta and theta bands depending on the speaker environment.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain and striatal dopamine signals have been extremely well characterized over the past several decades, yet novel dopamine signals and functions in reward learning and motivation continue to emerge. A similar characterization of real-time sub-second dopamine signals in areas outside of the striatum has been limited. Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit measurement of dopamine binding correlates, which can divulge basic functions of dopamine signaling in non-striatal dopamine terminal regions, like the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). Here, we record GRABDA signals in the dBNST during a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task. We observe greater Pavlovian cue-evoked dBNST GRABDA signals in sign-tracking (ST) compared to goal-tracking/intermediate (GT/INT) rats and the magnitude of cue-evoked dBNST GRABDA signals decrease immediately following reinforcer-specific satiety. When we deliver unexpected reward or omit expected reward, we find that dBNST dopamine signals encode bidirectional reward prediction errors in GT/INT rats, but only positive prediction errors in ST rats. Since sign- and goal-tracking approach strategies are associated with distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, we examined the effects of experimenter-administered fentanyl on dBNST dopamine associative encoding. Systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt dBNST cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. These results reveal multiple dBNST dopamine correlates of learning and motivation that depend on the Pavlovian approach strategy employed.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has identified cortical regions selectively responsive to specific categories of visual stimuli. However, this hypothesis-driven work cannot reveal how prominent these category selectivities are in the overall functional organization of visual cortex, or what others might exist that scientists have not thought to look for. Further, standard voxel-wise tests cannot detect distinct neural selectivities that coexist within voxels. To overcome these limitations, we used data-driven voxel decomposition methods to identify the main components underlying fMRI responses to thousands of complex photographic images (Allen et al 2021). Our hypothesis-neutral analysis rediscovered components selective for faces, places, bodies, and words, validating our method and showing that these selectivities are dominant features of the ventral visual pathway. The analysis also revealed an unexpected component with a distinct anatomical distribution that responded highly selectively to images of food. Alternative accounts based on low to mid-level visual features like color, shape or texture failed to account for the food selectivity of this component. High-throughput testing and control experiments with matched stimuli on a highly accurate computational model of this component confirm its selectivity for food. We registered our methods and hypotheses before replicating them on held-out participants and in a novel dataset. These findings demonstrate the power of data-driven methods, and show that the dominant neural responses of the ventral visual pathway include not only selectivities for faces, scenes, bodies, and words, but also the visually heterogeneous category of food, thus constraining accounts of when and why functional specialization arises in the cortex.",

However, whether alterations in mitochondrial structure and function plays an active role in regulating effector versus memory cell fate decisions during immune responses remains unclear. Our studies here characterize changes in mitochondrial dynamics in activated B cells and show that increased mitochondrial mass and activity is a distinct feature of memory B cell lineage commitment in vivo. Using a directed screen of mitochondrial modulators, we identify mitochondrial fission inhibitor, Mdivi-1 as an agent that could enhance mitochondrial mass and function leading to augmented memory B cell differentiation. The enhanced memory B cell responses mediated by Mdivi-1, translated to more robust recall responses upon secondary antigen exposures. Moreover, Mdivi-1 when used in combination with subunit (SARS-CoV2) and inactivated (H1N1 influenza) vaccines led to remarkably improved vaccine efficacies and protection from lethal viral (H1N1) challenge. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed enhanced commitment to memory lineage differentiation in B cells following Mdivi-1 treatment. We propose that mitochondrial modulators such as Mdivi-1 are a novel class of \"immune enhancers\" that specifically reinforces immunological memory and could be broadly applied to improve the fidelity of immune responses and vaccine efficacies.",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton is a three-dimensional scaffold of proteins that is a regulatory, energy-consuming network with dynamic properties to shape the structure and function of the cell. Proper actin function is required for many cellular pathways, including cell division, autophagy, chaperone function, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Deterioration of these processes manifests during aging and exposure to stress, which is in part due to the breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in preservation of cytoskeletal form and function are not well understood. Here, we performed a multi-pronged, cross-organismal screen combining a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human fibroblasts with in vivo C. elegans synthetic lethality screening. We identified the bromodomain protein, BET-1, as a key regulator of actin health and longevity. Overexpression of bet-1 preserves actin health at late age and promotes lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans. These beneficial effects are mediated through actin preservation by the transcriptional regulator function of BET-1. Together, our discovery assigns a key role for BET-1 in cytoskeletal health, highlighting regulatory cellular networks promoting cytoskeletal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the footprints of selection in coding sequences can inform about the importance and function of individual sites. Analyses of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous sub-stitutions (dN /dS) have been widely used to pinpoint changes in the intensity of selection, but cannot distinguish them from changes in the direction of selection, i.e., changes in the fitness of specific amino acids at a given position. A few methods that rely on amino acid profiles to detect changes in directional selection have been designed, but their performance have not been well characterized. In this paper, we investigate the performance of 6 of these methods. We evaluate them on simulations along empirical phylogenies in which transition events have been annotated, and compare their ability to detect sites that have undergone changes in the direction or intensity of selection to that of a widely used dN /dS approach, codemls branch-site model A. We show that all methods have reduced performance in the presence of biased gene conversion but not CpG hypermutability. The best profile method, Pelican, a new implementation of [Tamuri et al., 2009], performs as well as codeml in a range of conditions except for detecting relaxations of selection, and performs better when tree length increases, or in the presence of persistent positive selection. It is fast, enabling genome-scale searches for site-wise changes in the direction of selection associated with phenotypic changes.",

    "abstract": "Cooperativity between transcription factors is important to regulate target gene expression. In particular, the binding grammar of TFs in relation to each other, as well as in the context of other genomic elements, is crucial for TF functionality. However, tools to easily uncover co-occurrence between DNA-binding proteins, and investigate the regulatory modules of TFs, are limited. Here we present TF-COMB (Transcription Factor Co-Occurrence using Market Basket analysis) - a tool to investigate co-occurring TFs and binding grammar within regulatory regions. We found that TF-COMB can accurately identify known co-occurring TFs from ChIP-seq data, as well as uncover preferential localization to other genomic elements. With the use of ATAC-seq footprinting and TF motif locations, we found that TFs exhibit both preferred orientation and distance in relation to each other, and that these are biologically significant. Finally, we extended the analysis to not only investigate individual TF pairs, but also TF pairs in the context of networks, which enabled the investigation of TF complexes and TF hubs. In conclusion, TF-COMB is a flexible tool to investigate various aspects of TF binding grammar.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496953v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e37cccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1165241org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@725a2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e1893_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
