    "abstract": "The formation of {beta}-sheet rich amyloid fibrils in Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders is limited by a slow nucleation event. To understand the initial formation of {beta}-sheets from disordered peptides, we used all-atom simulations to parameterize a lattice model that treats each amino acid as a binary variable with {beta} and non-{beta} states. We show that translational and conformational entropy give the nascent {beta}-sheet an anisotropic surface tension which can be used to describe the nucleus with two-dimensional Classical Nucleation Theory. Since translational entropy depends on concentration, the aspect ratio of the critical {beta}-sheet changes with protein concentration. Our model explains the transition from the nucleation phase to elongation as the point where the {beta}-sheet core becomes large enough to overcome the conformational entropy cost to straighten the terminal molecule. At this point the {beta}-strands in the nucleus spontaneously elongate, which results in a larger binding surface to capture new molecules. These results suggest that nucleation is relatively insensitive to sequence differences in co-aggregation experiments because the nucleus only involves a small portion of the peptide.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe conversion of soluble proteins to amyloid aggregates is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Experiments have shown that this conversion occurs by a slow nucleation step followed by rapid growth. This work identifies the principle contributions to the free energy barrier that separates these two stages. It also shows how factors like protein concentration, sidechain interactions, and interactions with the environment can modify the barrier and affect nucleation times.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphThe clinical success of targeted cancer therapy is limited by drug resistance that renders cancers lethal in patients1-4. Human tumours can evolve therapy resistance by acquiring de novo genetic alterations and increased heterogeneity via mechanisms that remain incompletely understood1. Here, through parallel analysis of human clinical samples, tumour xenograft and cell line models and murine model systems, we uncover an unanticipated mechanism of therapy-induced adaptation that fuels the evolution of drug resistance. Targeted therapy directed against EGFR and ALK oncoproteins in lung cancer induced adaptations favoring apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)-mediated genome mutagenesis. In human oncogenic EGFR-driven and ALK-driven lung cancers and preclinical models, EGFR or ALK inhibitor treatment induced the expression and DNA mutagenic activity of APOBEC3B via therapy-mediated activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Moreover, targeted therapy also mediated downregulation of certain DNA repair enzymes such as UNG2, which normally counteracts APOBEC-catalyzed DNA deamination events. In mutant EGFR-driven lung cancer mouse models, APOBEC3B was detrimental to tumour initiation and yet advantageous to tumour progression during EGFR targeted therapy, consistent with TRACERx data demonstrating subclonal enrichment of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. This study reveals how cancers adapt and drive genetic diversity in response to targeted therapy and identifies APOBEC deaminases as future targets for eliciting more durable clinical benefit to targeted cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Aberrations in nuclear size and shape are commonly used to identify cancerous tissue. However, it remains unclear whether the disturbed nuclear structure directly contributes to the cancer pathology or is merely a consequence of other events occurring during tumorigenesis. Here, we show that highly invasive and proliferative breast cancer cells frequently exhibit Akt-driven lower expression of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C, leading to increased nuclear deformability that permits enhanced cell migration through confined environments that mimic interstitial spaces encountered during metastasis. Importantly, increasing lamin A/C expression in highly invasive breast cancer cells reflected gene expression changes characteristic of human breast tumors with higher LMNA expression, and specifically affected pathways related to cell-ECM interactions, cell metabolism, and PI3K/Akt signaling. Further supporting an important role of lamins in breast cancer metastasis, analysis of lamin levels in human breast tumors revealed a significant association between lower lamin A levels, Akt signaling, and decreased disease-free survival. These findings suggest that downregulation of lamin A/C in breast cancer cells may influence both cellular physical properties and biochemical signaling to promote metastatic progression.",

Yet, the mechanisms underlying intestinal regionalization and its dysregulation in disease are not well understood. Here, we used mouse models, transcriptomics, and immune profiling to show that regional epithelial expression of the transcription factor GATA4 prevented adherent bacterial colonization and inflammation in the proximal small intestine by regulating retinol metabolism and luminal IgA. Loss of epithelial GATA4 expression increased mortality in mice infected with Citrobacter rodentium. In active celiac patients with villous atrophy, low GATA4 expression was associated with metabolic alterations, mucosal Actinobacillus, and increased IL-17 immunity.

Here we study OFD in fresh-water metacommunities in England. We show that OFD are largely time invariant despite continuous turnover in community composition and well described by log-series distributions. Both shape and temporal robustness are readily explained by a simple patch occupancy model with intrinsic regulation of local richness. The model is mathematically analogous to classical neutral theory, but concerns numbers of patches occupied instead of individuals present. The precise shape of the models log-series OFD is determined by a parameter representing the rate of colonisation from adjacent sites, which we estimate for the data. Our results support the view that meta-community structure reflects a dynamic steady state controlled by local ecological constraints. Interspecific trait differences underlie these constraints, but are unlikely to determine macroecological structure.",

Participants viewed a driving video clip in the first-person perspective. During the video clip, participants were presented with a cue to indicate whether a subsequent crash could occur (attention condition) or not (safe condition). Enhanced activities in the anterior insula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and higher sympathetic nerve responses (pupil dilation and peripheral arterial stiffness) were triggered by the attention condition but not with the safe condition. Autonomic response-related functional connectivity was detected in the visual cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and MCC/PCC with the right anterior insula and its adjacent regions as seed regions. Thus, the right anterior insula and adjacent regions, in collaboration with other regions play a role in eliciting anxiety based on the prediction of negative events, by mediating anxiety-related autonomic responses according to interoceptive information.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomic time course analyses of biofluids are highly relevant for clinical diagnostics. However, many sampling methods suffer from unknown sample sizes commonly known as size effects. This prevents absolute quantification of biomarkers. Recently, several mathematical post acquisition normalization methods have been developed to overcome these problems either by exploiting already known pharmacokinetic information or by statistical means.\n\nHere we present an improved normalization method, MIX, that combines the advantages of both approaches. It couples two normalization terms, one based on a pharmacokinetic model (PKM) and the other representing a popular statistical approach, probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN), in a single model.\n\nTo test the performance of MIX, we generated synthetic data closely resembling real finger sweat metabolome measurements. We show that MIX normalization successfully tackles key weaknesses of the individual strategies: it (i) reduces the risk of overfitting with PKM, and (ii) contrary to PQN, it allows to compute sample volumes. Finally, we validate MIX by using real finger sweat as well as blood plasma metabolome data and demonstrate that MIX allows to better and more robustly correct for size effects.\n\nIn conclusion, the MIX method improves the reliability and robustness of quantitative biomarker detection in finger sweat and other biofluids, paving the way for biomarker discovery and hypothesis generation from metabolomic time course data.",

    "abstract": "During limb movement, spinal circuits facilitate the alternating activation of antagonistic flexor and extensor muscles. Yet antagonist cocontraction is often required to stabilize joints, like when loads are handled. Previous results suggest that these different muscle activation patterns are mediated by separate flexion- and extension-related motor cortical output populations, while others suggest recruitment of task-specific populations. To distinguish between hypotheses, we developed a paradigm in which mice toggle between forelimb tasks requiring antagonist alternation or cocontraction and measured activity in motor cortical layer 5b. Our results conformed to neither hypothesis: consistent flexion- and extension-related activity was not observed across tasks, and no task-specific populations were observed. Instead, activity covariation among motor cortical neurons dramatically changed between tasks, thereby altering the relation between neural and muscle activity. This was also observed specifically for corticospinal neurons. Collectively, our findings indicate that motor cortex drives different muscle activation patterns via task-specific activity covariation.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIMice perform two forelimb tasks involving distinct antagonist muscle activity in a novel paradigm\nC_LIO_LIL5b motor cortical neurons are not organized by task-specific activity\nC_LIO_LIL5b motor cortical neurons do not encode muscle activity consistently across tasks\nC_LIO_LITask-specific muscle activity is driven by a change in motor cortical activity covariation\nC_LI\n\neTOC BLURBWarriner et al. simultaneously measured muscle and motor cortical activity in mouse during antagonist forelimb muscle alternation and cocontraction, revealing that these distinct muscle activation patterns are not driven through consistent flexion and extension programs nor through the activity of discrete, task-specific neuronal subsets.

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing has revolutionized entomological study, rendering it possible to analyze the genomes and transcriptomes of non-model insects. However, use of this technology is often limited to obtaining nucleotide sequences of target or related genes, with many of the acquired sequences remaining unused because other available sequences are not sufficiently annotated. To address this issue, we have developed a functional annotation workflow for transcriptome-sequenced insects to determine transcript descriptions, which represents a significant improvement over the previous method (functional annotation pipeline for insects). The developed workflow attempts to annotate not only the protein sequences obtained from transcriptome analysis but also the ncRNA sequences obtained simultaneously. In addition, the workflow integrates the expression level information obtained from transcriptome sequencing for application as functional annotation information. Using the workflow, functional annotation was performed on the sequences obtained from transcriptome sequencing of stick insect (Entoria okinawaensis) and silkworm (Bombyx mori), yielding richer functional annotation information than that obtained in our previous study. The improved workflow allows more comprehensive exploitation of transcriptome data and is applicable to other insects because the workflow has been openly developed on GitHub.\n\nSimple SummaryThe function of all genes encoded in the genome should be studied for genome editing. The genome editing technology can speeds up insect research for functional analysis of genes. Our knowledge about the functional information of genes is still incomplete currently while genome sequencing of an organism can be completed. The functional information has been annotated based solely on the information that has been obtained from the result of previous biological research. However, this information will be important in determining the target genes for genome editing. In particular, it is very important that this information is in machine-readable form because computer programs mainly parse this information for the understanding of biological systems. In this paper, we describe a workflow-based method for annotating gene functions in insects that make use of transcribed sequence information as well as reference genome and protein sequence databases. Using the developed workflow, we annotated functional information of Japanese stick insect and silkworm, including gene expression as well as sequence analysis. The functional annotation information obtained by the workflow will greatly expand the possibilities of entomological research using genome editing.",

    "abstract": "Stability of timing and force production in repetitive movements characterizes skillful motor behaviors such as surgery and playing musical instruments. However, even trained individuals such as musicians undergo further extensive training for the improvement of these skills. Previous studies that investigated the lower extremity movements such as jumping and sprinting demonstrated enhancement of the maximum force and rate of force development immediately after the plyometric exercises. However, it remains unknown whether the plyometric exercises enhance the stability of timing and force production of the dexterous finger movements in trained individuals. Here we address this issue by examining the effects of plyometric-like training specialized for finger movements on piano performance by well-trained pianists. The training demonstrated a decrease of the variation in timing and velocity of successive keystrokes, along with a concomitant increase in the rate of force development of the four fingers, but not the thumb, although there was no change in the finger muscular activities through the training. By contrast, such a training effect was not evident following a conventional repetitive piano practice. In addition, a significant increase in the forearm muscle temperature was observed specifically through performing the plyometric exercise with the fingers, implying its association with improved performance. These results indicate effectiveness of the plyometric exercises for improvement of strength, precision, and physiological efficiency of the finger movements even in expert pianists, which implicates a role of ways of practicing in enhancing experts expertise.",

    "abstract": "Early adversity can change educational, cognitive, and mental health outcomes. However, the neural processes through which early adversity exerts these effects remain largely unknown. We used generative network modelling of the mouse connectome to test whether unpredictable postnatal stress shifts the constraints that govern the formation of the structural connectome. A model that trades off the wiring cost of long-distance connections with topological homophily (i.e. links between regions with shared neighbours) generated simulations that replicate the organisation of the rodent connectome. The imposition of early life adversity significantly shifted the best-performing parameter combinations toward zero, heightening the stochastic nature of the generative process. Put simply, unpredictable postnatal stress changes the economic constraints that shape network formation, introducing greater randomness into the structural development of the brain. While this change may constrain the development of cognitive abilities, it could also reflect an adaptive mechanism. In other words, neural development could harness heightened stochasticity to make networks more robust to perturbation, thereby facilitating effective responses to future threats and challenges.\n\nSignificance statementChildren who experience adversity early in life - such as chronic poverty or abuse - show numerous neural differences that are linked to poorer cognition and mental health later in life. To effectively mitigate the burden of adversity, it is critical to identify how these differences arise. In this paper, we use computational modelling to test whether growing up in an impoverished and unpredictable environment changes the development of structural connections in the mouse brain. We found that early adversity appears to introduce more stochasticity in the formation of neural architecture. Our findings point to a potential mechanism for how early adversity could change the course of child development.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that nutrient enrichment causes the loss of plant diversity in different grasslands across the globe. Thus far, three main hypotheses (niche dimension, competitive asymmetry, and soil acidification) have been proposed to account for this general phenomenon, but our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms remains rather vague. To reveal the cryptic mechanisms, we analyzed the famous long-term Park Grass Experiment (1856-) under modern coexistence theory by fitting Lotka-Volterra competition models with time-series data from the different treatments (15 different combinations of nutrient addition fully crossed with four levels of soil pH) to quantitatively test the three competing hypotheses. Supportive of the competitive asymmetry and soil acidification hypotheses, both nutrient addition and soil acidification overall decreased intrinsic population growth rates (r) and intensified competitive differences or asymmetries dramatically, which mostly favored grasses over forbs and legumes (and also forbs over legumes). These changes in r and competitive differences or asymmetries are generally consistent with the abundance changes of different functional groups following the various treatments. Moreover, the altered r (determining species existence) and competitive differences (affecting species coexistence) effectively explained the diversity loss and recovery (after nitrogen addition was withheld). However, while nutrient addition significantly decreased per-capita intra- and inter-specific competition (which indicates that belowground competition becomes less important when soil nutrients are more abundant), it did not decrease niche differences as predicted, poorly supporting the niche dimension hypothesis. These findings advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms driving the response of plant communities to nutrient deposition in nature.\n\nSignificance StatementAn unresolved fundamental scientific mystery with the crucial applied value in ecology is what causes the general loss of biodiversity following nutrient enrichment in the Anthropocene. In this study, we combined the recent advance in coexistence theory with the longest-running experiment existing in the world to wrestle with this conundrum. Our major results, which highlight the critical role of both existence and coexistence, are helpful in settling the debate between the three popular hypotheses and also, for the first time, provide quantitative explanations for the general findings in numerous nutrient-addition experiments. Our study shows the importance of applying modern coexistence theory to more quantitatively explain, predict and cope with the responses of ecological communities to global change factors in nature.",

    "abstract": "The primary step in tissue cytometry is the automated distinction of individual cells (segmentation). Since cell borders are seldom labeled, researchers generally segment cells by their nuclei. While effective tools have been developed for segmenting nuclei in two dimensions, segmentation of nuclei in three-dimensional volumes remains a challenging task for which few tools have been developed. The lack of effective methods for three-dimensional segmentation represents a bottleneck in the realization of the potential of tissue cytometry, particularly as methods of tissue clearing present researchers with the opportunity to characterize entire organs. Methods based upon deep-learning have shown enormous promise, but their implementation is hampered by the need for large amounts of manually annotated training data. In this paper we describe 3D Nuclei Instance Segmentation Network (NISNet3D), a deep learning-based approach in which training is accomplished using synthetic data, profoundly reducing the effort required for network training. We compare results obtained from NISNet3D with results obtained from eight existing techniques.",

    "abstract": "Cell entry of most alphaherpesviruses is mediated by the binding of glycoprotein D (gD) to different cell surface receptors. Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 gDs interact with equine major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) to initiate entry into equine cells. We have characterized the gD-MHC-I interaction by solving the crystal structures of EHV-1 and EHV-4 gDs (gD1, gD4), performing protein-protein docking simulations, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, and biological assays. The structures of gD1 and gD4 revealed the existence of a common V-set immunoglobulin-like (IgV-like) core comparable to those of other gD homologs. Molecular modeling yielded plausible binding hypotheses and identified key residues (F213 and D261) that are important for virus binding. Altering the key residues resulted in impaired virus growth in cells, which highlights the important role of these residues in the gD-MHC-I interaction. Taken together, our results add to our understanding of the initial herpesvirus-cell interactions and will contribute to the targeted design of antiviral drugs and vaccine development.\n\nAuthor summaryEquine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and type 4 (EHV-4) are endemic in horses and cause great suffering as well as substantial economic losses to the equine industry. Current vaccines do not prevent infections and treatment is difficult. A prerequisite for vaccine and drug development is an in-depth understanding of the virus replication cycle, especially the virus entry process in order to block the infection at early stages. Entry of alphaherpesviruses into the host cell is mediated by a set of virus envelope glycoproteins including glycoprotein D (gD) that triggers the internalization of the virus particle. The structure of gD and the interaction with the entry receptor equine major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) remains elusive. Here, we solved the crystal structures of gD1 and gD4 that allowed us to model virus-receptor interaction and to determine the key residues for virus entry. Alterations of these key residues impaired virus growth in cell culture. The overall structure of gD1 and gD4 shows classical features of other alphaherpesvirus gDs making it possible to gain further insights into human pathogens as well.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that the material properties of biomolecular condensates are crucial for their biological functions and pathogenicity. However, the phase maintenance of biomolecular condensates in cells remains elusive. Here, we show that sodium ion (Na+) influx regulates the condensate liquidity under hyperosmotic stress. The fluidity of ASK3 condensates increases at the high intracellular Na+ concentration derived from extracellular hyperosmotic solution. Moreover, we identified TRPM4 as a cation channel that allows Na+ influx under hyperosmotic stress. TRPM4 inhibition causes the liquid-to-solid phase transition of ASK3 condensates, leading to impairment of the ASK3 osmoresponse. In addition to ASK3 condensates, intracellular Na+ widely regulates the condensate liquidity and aggregate formation of biomolecules, including DCP1A, TAZ and polyQ-protein, under hyperosmotic stress. Our findings demonstrate that changes in Na+ contribute to the cellular stress response via liquidity maintenance of biomolecular condensates.",

In Escherichia coli, the 14-cistron phn operon encoding the carbon-phosphorus (C-P) lyase enzymatic machinery allows for extraction of phosphorus from a wide range of phosphonates characterised by the highly stable C-P bond.1, 2 As part of a complex, multi-step pathway, the PhnJ subunit was proposed to cleave the C-P bond via a radical reaction, however, the details of the mechanism were not immediately compatible with the structure of the 220 kDa PhnGHIJ C-P lyase core complex, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of phosphonate breakdown in bacteria.3, 4 Here we show using single-particle cryogenic-electron microscopy that PhnJ mediates binding of a unique double dimer of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, PhnK and PhnL to the core complex. ATP hydrolysis by PhnK induces drastic structural remodelling leading to opening of the core and reconfiguration of a metal-binding site located at the interface between the PhnI and PhnJ subunits.

Subsequently, the performance of the proposed method was tested by fitting bi- and triexponential IVIM model to in vivo renal DWI data acquired on a clinical 3 Tesla MRI scanner and compared to conventional approaches (Fixed D* and Segmented fitting).\n\nResultsThe numerical simulations demonstrated that the IDEAL algorithm provides robust estimates of the IVIM parameters in the presence of noise as indicated by relatively low absolute percentage bias (sMdPB [%]) and normalized root-mean-square error (RMSE [%]). The analysis of the in vivo data showed that the IDEAL-based IVIM parameter maps were less noisy and more visually appealing than those obtained using the Fixed D* and Segmented methods. Further, the use of IDEAL for the triexponential IVIM modelling resulted in reduced cortical and medullary coefficients of variation (CVs) for all IVIM parameters when compared with Fixed D*, reflecting greater accuracy of this method.\n\nConclusionThe proposed fitting algorithm yields more robust IVIM parameter estimates and is less susceptible to poor SNR than the conventional fitting approaches.

    "abstract": "Universal stress proteins (USPs) are ubiquitous amongst prokaryotes and have empirically determined roles in adaptation to stress, while their specific biochemical function in cellular processes is opaque. The most frequently encountered USP is a small ~15kDa protein comprised of a single domain (PF00582). In Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1636 is the sole single domain protein amongst its 10 USPs. We were unable to delete rv1636 from M. tuberculosis, supporting previous data that it is essential for growth. We deleted its orthologue, MS3811, from M. smegmatis, and in exponential phase competition experiments we observed that the advantage switched between wildtype and the mutant depending on the growth environment. In rich medium the wildtype had the competitive advantage, but in a defined medium with a single carbon source the competitive advantage switched, with the mutant rapidly taking over the culture. We hypothesised the USP is regulating metabolic flux, with its deletion leading to increased flux and more rapid turn-over of central-carbon metabolites. We tested this by performing 13C-stable isotope tracing, using [U-13C6] glucose as sole carbon source for growth of the parental and deletion strains. The findings were unequivocal; deletion of the USP led to an increase in label incorporation in central carbon metabolites and a profound change in the isotopologue distribution. Furthermore, in vivo protein-crosslinking provided evidence that Rv1636 interacts directly with key central metabolic enzymes, including the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate synthase. We propose the mycobacterial single domain USP acts as a metabolic rheostat to regulate central carbon metabolism.\n\nImportanceThere are more than 62,000 universal stress proteins (USPs) found mostly in prokaryotes, but very few examples where the role of a USP is unequivocally linked to a specific biological or biochemical function. For the first time we were able to assign a role in metabolic regulation to a bacterial single domain universal stress protein. We demonstrate a mycobacterial USP regulates flux through central catabolic pathways, and our evidence, based on 13C-stable isotope tracing, indicates that the USP acts as a brake on carbon flux, and we assign to it a role as a metabolic rheostat.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa. In May 2022, dozens of non-endemic countries reported hundreds of monkeypox cases, most with no epidemiological link to Africa. We identified two lineages of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) among nine 2021 and 2022 U.S. monkeypox cases. A 2021 case was highly similar to the 2022 MPXV outbreak variant, suggesting a common ancestor. Analysis of mutations among these two lineages revealed an extreme preference for GA-to-AA mutations indicative of APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity that was shared among West African MPXV since 2017 but absent from Congo Basin lineages. Poxviruses are not thought to be subject to APOBEC3 editing; however, these findings suggest APOBEC3 activity has been recurrent and dominant in recent West African MPXV evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methyltransferases (MTases) are enzymes that induce methylation, one of the representative epigenetic modifications of DNA, and are also useful tools for analyzing epigenomes. However, regarding DNA cytosine 5-methylation, MTases identified so far have drawbacks in that their recognition sequences overlap with those for intrinsic DNA methylation in mammalian cells and/or that the recognition sequence is too long for fine epigenetic mapping. To identify MTases with short recognition sequences that never overlap with the CG dinucleotide, we systematically investigated the 25 candidate enzymes identified using a database search, which showed high similarity to known cytosine 5-MTases recognizing short sequences.\n\nResultsWe identified MTases with six new recognition sequences, including TCTG, CC, CNG, TCG, GCY, and GGCA. Because the recognition sequence never overlapped with the CG dinucleotide, MTases recognizing the CC dinucleotide were promising.\n\nConclusionsIn the current study, we established a procedure for producing active CC-methylating MTases and applied it to nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing to prove the usefulness of the enzyme for fine epigenetic mapping. MTases that never overlap with CG dinucleotides would allow us to profile multiple epigenomes simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by attachment to its receptor - the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Regardless of the wealth of structural data, little is known about the physicochemical mechanism of interactions of the viral spike (S) protein with ACE2 and how this mechanism has evolved during the pandemic. Here, we applied experimental and computational approaches to characterize the molecular interaction of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). Data on kinetics, activation- and equilibrium thermodynamics of binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) from VOC with ACE2 as well as data from computational protein electrostatics revealed a profound remodeling of the physicochemical characteristics of the interaction during the evolution. Thus, as compared to RBDs from Wuhan strain and other VOC, Omicron RBD presented as a unique protein in terms of conformational dynamics and types of non-covalent forces driving the complex formation with ACE2. Viral evolution resulted in a restriction of the RBD structural dynamics, and a shift to a major role of polar forces for ACE2 binding. Further, we investigated how the reshaping of the physicochemical characteristics of interaction affect the binding specificity of S proteins. Data from various binding assays revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Omicron RBDs manifest capacity for promiscuous recognition of unrelated human proteins, but they harbor distinct reactivity patterns. These findings might contribute for mechanistic understanding of the viral tropism, and capacity to evade immune responses during evolution.",

    "abstract": "The Shieldin complex represses end resection at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and thereby serves as a pro-non homologous end joining (NHEJ) factor in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Its components SHLD1, SHLD2, SHLD3 and REV7 are recruited in a hierarchical fashion. SHLD3 and REV7 localize first to DSBs, while the subsequently recruited SHLD2 is the only known DNA binding protein in the complex. The molecular details of the initial recruitment of SHLD3 and REV7, and the subsequent assembly of Shieldin on DSBs are unclear. Here, we report the identification of a promiscuous DNA binding domain in the C-terminal half of SHLD3. At the N-terminus, SHLD3 interacts with a dimer of REV7 molecules. We show that the interaction between SHLD3 and the first REV7 is remarkably slow, which is likely due to the substantial activation energy required to remodel mobile structural elements within the REV7 molecule to allow for binding to SHLD3. In contrast, the interaction between SHLD3 and SHLD2 with a second REV7 molecule is fast and does not require structural remodelling. Overall, these results provide insights into the rate-limiting step of the molecular assembly and recruitment of Shieldin complex at DNA DSBs.",

    "abstract": "We present a method of producing bulk cell-cultured fat tissue for food applications. Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D fats using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The 3D fats were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical properties of cultured fat tissues were based on binder choice and concentration, and changes in the fatty acid compositions of cellular triacylglyceride and phospholipids were observed after lipid supplementation (soybean oil) during in vitro culture. This approach of aggregating individual adipocytes into a bulk 3D tissue provides a scalable and versatile strategy to produce cultured fat tissue for food-related applications, thereby addressing a key obstacle in cultivated meat production.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/495192v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@148ac5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c8f94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@186553aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@458c09_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Recently several machine learning methods have suggested knowledge based scoring functions for binding energy prediction. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, PandoraRL, where the RL agent helps the ligand traverse to the optimal binding pose. The underlying representation of molecules utilizes generalized graph convolution to represent the protein ligand complex with various atomic and spatial features. The representation consists of edges formed on the basis of inter molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, etc, and nodes representing atomic features. This study presents our initial model which can train on a protein-ligand pair and predict optimal binding pose for a different ligand with the same protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an RL based approach has been put forward for predicting optimized ligand pose.\n\nCCS CONCEPTSO_LIComputing methodologies [-&gt;] Reinforcement learning.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Besides genetic mutations, the metabolic state of bacterial cells represents another driving factor in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and in the actual efficacy of treatments. In this direction, studying how bacteria reprogram their metabolism when facing antimicrobial exposure is crucial to enhance our ability to limit the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. Here we have studied the metabolic consequences of antimicrobial exposure in bacteria using an integrated approach that exploits transcriptomics and computational modelling. Specifically, we asked whether common metabolic strategies emerge during the exposure to antimicrobials, regardless of the kind of antimicrobial used or, on the contrary, antimicrobial-specific pathways exist. To this purpose, we have used an heterogeneous dataset from six published studies on Escherichia coli exposed to different concentrations/types of compounds. We show that experimental condition, not antimicrobial exposure, is the factor that influences the most the resulting metabolic networks. However, despite condition-dependent metabolic signatures being evident, specific changes in flux distributions by antimicrobial exposed cells could be identified. In particular, purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, and cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis were commonly affected by all considered antimicrobials. This suggests the presence of general metabolic strategies to face the stress posed by antimicrobial exposure and that, in turn, may represent an untapped resource for the fight against microbial infections. Finally, our analysis predicted an overall metabolic rewiring following bacteriostatic vs. bactericidal drug exposure that is in line with the current knowledge about the effects of these two classes of compounds on microbial metabolic phenotypes.\n\nIMPORTANCEA mechanistic understanding of microbial metabolic reprogramming during antimicrobial exposure is key to facilitate the discovery of new resistance mechanisms and to identify novel areas of intervention to face microbial infections. This study shows how the integration of transcriptomic data and genome-scale metabolic modelling can be used to address this critical issue, and to trace general metabolic strategies exploited by bacteria to face the stress posed by antimicrobial drugs.",

In an effort to further study their diversity, DNA barcodes (DNA fragments of the 5 end of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, COI) have been used to complement morphological examination in identifying evolutionary lineages. Although divergent clusters of COI sequences were reported to generally match morphological species delineations, they also revealed some discrepancies, suggesting overlooked species, ecophenotypic variation or multiple COI lineages within one species. Here, we sequenced COI fragments of 312 shallow-water echinoderms of the East Coast of South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal Province) and compared morphological identifications with species delimitations obtained with four methods that are exclusively based on COI sequences. We identified a total of 103 morphospecies including 18 that did not exactly match described species. We also report 46 COI sequences that showed large divergences (>5% p-distances) with those available to date and publish the first COI sequences for 30 species. Our analyses also identified discordances between morphological identifications and COI-based species delimitations for a considerable proportion of the morphospecies studied here (49/103).

In this study, the transcriptomic changes of K. marxianus DMKU3-1042 resulted from acetic acid stress during high-temperature ethanol fermentation were investigated based on high-throughput RNA sequencing. We identified 611 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under acetic acid stress (fold change > 2 or < 0.5, P-adjust <0.05), with 166 up-regulated and 445 down-regulated. GO terms and pathways enriched in these DEGs were identified. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed based on the interactions between proteins coded by the DEGs, and hub genes and key modules in the PPI networks were identified. The results in this study indicated that during high-temperature fermentation, acetic acid stress promoted protein catabolism but repressed protein synthesis, which affected the growth and metabolism of K. marxianus and led to the decrease of ethanol production. The findings in this study provide a better understanding of the response mechanism of K. marxianus to acetic acid stress, and provide a basis for subsequent increase of ethanol production by K. marxianus.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens are major causes of crop diseases, leading to significant production losses. For instance, kiwifruit canker, caused by the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), has posed a global challenge to kiwifruit production. Treatment with copper and antibiotics, whilst initially effective, is leading to the rise of bacterial resistance, requiring new biocontrol approaches. Previously, we isolated a group of closely related Psa phages with biocontrol potential, which represent environmentally sustainable antimicrobials. However, their deployment as antimicrobials requires further insight into their properties and infection strategy. Here, we provide an in-depth examination of the genome of {Phi}Psa374-like phages and show that they use lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as their main receptor. Through proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy of {Phi}Psa374, we revealed the structural proteome and that this phage possess a T=9 capsid triangulation, unusual for myoviruses. Furthermore, we show that {Phi}Psa374 phage resistance arises in planta through mutations in a glycosyltransferase involved in LPS synthesis. Lastly, through in vitro evolution experiments we showed that phage-resistance is overcome by mutations in a tail fiber and structural protein of unknown function in {Phi}Psa374. This study provides new insight into the properties of {Phi}Psa374-like phages that informs their use as antimicrobials against Psa.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThe rise of phytopathogen resistance to agrichemicals poses a significant threat to crop production, and requires urgent attention. The work presented here examines a phage genus, members of which utilize LPS as a receptor, and show potential as biocontrol agents of Psa. Studies in planta showed the development of Psa resistance to the phage, whilst maintaining bacterial virulence. This finding underscores the importance of examining phages in their ecological context for the informed design of phage cocktails that are effective in phytopathogen control.",

    "abstract": "The initiation of asymmetric karyokinesis of intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) begins without dismantling the nuclear envelope showing the hallmark feature of closed mitosis (1-10). In Pf, karyokinesis precedes cytokinesis and cell body formation (6, 8-10). Regulation at the beginning of nuclear division either through checkpoints or by importing serum components was largely unknown. At the trophozoite stage, PfP2 tetramer trafficked to the infected erythrocyte (IE) surface and the inaccessibility of IE surface PfP2 to its bonafide ligand led to the arrest of nuclear division (11-13). Here we show that PfP2 tetramer localization on the IE surface and the beginning of nuclear division are concomitant in nature. Synthetically induced denaturation resistant PfP2 tetramer interacts with human serum fatty acids and phospholipids for its import into IEs at the beginning of karyokinesis. In the natively folded denaturation resistant PfP2 tetramer cage, the Cys-Cys redox switch regulates the binding and subsequent release of fatty acids on the IE surface. This mechanistic insight of fatty acids import inside IEs using synthetically induced denaturation resistant PfP2 tetramer provides an unique drug screening platform for novel small molecule screening against malaria.",

    "abstract": "The genomic sequences segregating in experimental populations are often highly divergent from the community reference and from one another. Such divergence is problematic under various short-read-based genotyping strategies. In addition, large structural differences are often invisible despite being strong candidates for causal variation. These issues are exacerbated in specialty crop breeding programs with fewer, lower-quality sequence resources. We examined the benefits of complete genomic information, based on long-read assemblies, in a biparental mapping experiment segregating at numerous disease resistance loci in the non-model crop, melon (Cucumis melo). We find that a graph-based approach, which uses both parental genomes, results in 19% more variants callable across the population and raw allele calls with a 2 to 3-fold error-rate reduction, even relative to single reference approaches using a parent genome. We show that structural variation has played a substantial role in shaping two Fusarium wilt resistance loci with known causal genes. We also report on the genetics of powdery mildew resistance, where copy number variation and local recombination suppression are directly interpretable via parental genome alignments. Benefits observed, even in this low-resolution biparental experiment, will inevitably be amplified in more complex populations.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) and remains one of the leading causes of mortality due to an infectious pathogen. Host immune responses have been implicated in driving the progression from infection to severe lung disease. We analyzed longitudinal RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from the whole blood of 74 TB progressors whose samples were grouped into four six-month intervals preceding diagnosis (the GC6-74 study). We additionally analyzed RNAseq data from an independent cohort of 90 TB patients with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan results which were used to categorize them into groups with high and low levels of lung damage (the Catalysis TB Biomarker study). These groups were compared to non-TB controls to obtain a complete whole blood transcriptional profile for individuals spanning from early stages of M.tb infection to TB diagnosis. The results revealed a steady increase in the number of genes that were differentially expressed in progressors at time points closer to diagnosis with 278 genes at 13-18 months, 742 at 7-12 months and 5,131 detected 1-6 months before diagnosis and 9,205 detected in TB patients. A total of 2,144 differentially expressed genes were detected when comparing TB patients with high and low levels of lung damage. There was a large overlap in the genes upregulated in progressors 1-6 months before diagnosis (86%) with those in TB patients. A comprehensive pathway analysis revealed a potent activation of neutrophil and platelet mediated defenses including neutrophil and platelet degranulation, and NET formation at both time points. These pathways were also enriched in TB patients with high levels of lung damage compared to those with low. These findings suggest that neutrophils and platelets play a critical role in TB pathogenesis, and provide details of the timing of specific effector mechanisms that may contribute to TB lung pathology.\n\nAuthor summaryMycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) and remains one of the leading causes of mortality due to an infectious pathogen. Human immune responses must be balanced to inhibit disease progression while limiting self-damage, however in defense against M.tb host responses have been implicated in lung damage and in driving progression of M.tb infection to severe lung disease. The identification of immune responses that are activated during the development of TB could provide potential targets for interventions that might suppress disease progression, and possibly limit tissue damage. Here we identify a subset of genes that function in several biological processes that are strongly activated in the late stages of TB development and in TB patients. The proteins encoded by these genes are known to degrade lung tissue and contribute to severe lung disease.",

    "abstract": "The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and its homologs p107 and p130 are critical regulators of gene expression during the cell cycle. Functional inactivation of Rb family proteins leads to loss of cell-cycle control and promotes genome instability and proliferation, which are hallmarks of cancer. Rb proteins share a structural domain, known as the \"pocket domain\", which mediates association with a large number of cellular proteins. A cleft in the pocket domain binds an LxCxE sequence motif in these proteins, many of which function with Rb proteins to co-regulate transcription during quiescence and G1. Proteins from oncogenic DNA viruses also bind this cleft to inactivate Rb family proteins, and the E7 protein from the human papillomavirus has been used as the primary model for understanding LxCxE motif interactions. Evidence presented previously and here demonstrates that the E7 sequence binds tighter and competes with cellular proteins for the LxCxE site, but the molecular basis for the relatively weak affinities of the cellular proteins has been poorly understood. Here, we present binding data and a series of crystal structures of the p107 pocket domain in complex with LxCxE peptides derived from the transcriptional co-repressor proteins HDAC1, ARI4DA, and EID1. The structures reveal determinants of protein binding beyond the L-C-E core that include the N and C-terminal sides of the LxCxE motif and the x (wild card) residues. Our results explain how differences in these interactions outside the L-C-E core result in weaker affinities of pocket protein for cellular LxCxE proteins compared to E7 and result in differences in Rb and p107 affinities for some LxCxE-containing sequences. Our study provides new insights into how Rb proteins bind their myriad of cell partners and lays the foundation for structure-based design of peptides that inhibit oncogenic viral protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidences have revealed that benzidine, a known human carcinogen, is a pivotal risk factor for bladder cancer (BC). Dysregulated cell proliferation serves as a pivotal pathophysiological step in BC development. The potential mechanisms of MAPK pathways, particularly extracellular regulated protein kinases 5 (ERK5), regarding the modulation of benzidine-elicited cell proliferation are still elusive. Herein, human BC cells UMUC-3 were exposed to indicated levels of benzidine for 5 days. Cell growth, cell cycle progression, cell cycle-related, MAPK genetic expression, and related protein contents were investigated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting (WB), respectively. XMD8-92 (a specific suppressor of ERK5) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were utilized to identify the roles of ERK5. Our results illustrated that benzidine elevated the proliferative ability of UMUC3 cells and accelerated the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase, and it increased the expressions of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and reduced the expression of p21. Meanwhile, benzidine treatment resulted in the activation of ERK5 pathway and activator protein 1 (AP-1) proteins. In addition, benzidine-elicited cell proliferation and ERK5 stimulation were fully inhibited by XMD8-92 and siRNAs specific to ERK5. Taken together, these results demonstrated that ERK5-mediated cell proliferation was tightly related to benzidine-assoicated BC development, which established the foundation for targeting the ERK5 pathway in BC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Daptomycin (DAP), a cyclic anionic lipopeptide antibiotic, is among the last resorts to treat multidrug resistant (vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) Gram-positive bacterial infections. DAP is administered intravenously and biliary excretion results in the introduction of DAP ([~]5-10 % of the intravenous DAP dose) arriving in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where it drives resistance evolution in off-target populations of Enterococcus faecium bacteria. Previously, we have shown that the oral administration of cholestyramine, an ion exchange biomaterial (IXB) sorbent, prevents DAP treatment from enriching DAP-resistance in populations of E. faecium shed from mice. Here, we engineer the biomaterial-DAP interfacial interactions to uncover the antibiotic removal mechanisms. The IXB-mediated DAP capture from aqueous media was measured in both controlled pH/electrolyte solutions and in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) to uncover the molecular and colloidal mechanisms of DAP removal from the GI tract. Our findings show that the IXB electrostatically adsorbs the anionic antibiotic via a time-dependent diffusion-controlled process. Unsteady-state diffusion-adsorption mass balance describes the dynamics of adsorption well, and the maximum removal capacity is beyond the electric charge stoichiometric ratio because of DAP self-assembly. This study may open new opportunities for optimizing cholestyramine adjuvant therapy to prevent DAP resistance, as well as designing novel biomaterials to remove off-target antibiotics from the GI tract.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/495716v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ec034eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cd1106org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@118dbcborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@106287c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "By simultaneously transducing and amplifying, transistors offer advantages over simpler, electrode-based transducers in electrochemical biosensors. However, transistor-based biosensors typically use static (i.e., DC) operation modes that are poorly suited for sensor architectures relying on the modulation of charge transfer kinetics to signal analyte binding. Thus motivated, here we translate the AC \"pulsed potential\" approach typically used with electrochemical aptamer-based sensor to an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Specifically, by applying a linearly sweeping square-wave potential to an aptamer-functionalized gate electrode, we produce current modulation across the transistor channel two orders of magnitude larger than seen for the equivalent, electrode-based biosensor. Critically, the resulting amplification is scalable, such that there is no signal loss with OECT miniaturization. The pulsed transistor operation demonstrated here could be applied generally to sensors relying on kinetics-based signaling, expanding opportunities for non-invasive and high spatial resolution biosensing.",

    "abstract": "During progression of prostate cancer, sustained oxidative overload in cancer cells potentiates the overall tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting the TME using colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibition is a promising therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the therapeutic response to sustained CSF1R blockade therapy (CSF1Ri) is limited as a monotherapy. We postulated that one of the causative agents for reduced efficacy of CSF1Ri and increased oxidation in CRPC is endothelial nitric oxide syntheses (eNOS). Results showed that in high grade PCa human specimens, eNOS is positively correlated with CSF1-CSF1R signaling and remains in an un-coupled state. The uncoupling disables eNOS to generate sufficient Nitric oxide (NO) that are required for inducing effective S-nitrosylation of CSF1R molecule at specific cysteine sites (Cys 224, Cys 278 and Cys 830). Importantly, we found that S-nitrosylation of CSF1R molecule at Cys 224, Cys 278 and Cys 830 sites is necessary for effective inhibition of tumor promoting cytokines (which are downstream of CSF1-CSF1R signaling) by CSF1R blockade. In this context, we studied if exogenous NO treatment could rescue the side effects of eNOS uncoupling. Results showed that exogenous NO treatment (using S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)) is effective in not only inducing S-Nitrosylation of CSF1R molecule, but it helps in rescuing the excess oxidation in tumor regions, reducing overall tumor burden, suppresses the tumor promoting cytokines which are ineffectively suppressed by CSF1R blockade. Together these results postulated that NO therapy could act as an effective combinatorial partner with CSF1R blockade against CRPC. In this context, results demonstrated that exogenous NO treatment successfully augment the anti-tumor ability of CSF1Ri in murine models of CRPC. Importantly, the overall tumor reduction was most effective in NO-CSF1Ri therapy compared to NO or CSF1Ri mono therapies. Moreover, Immunophenotyping of tumor grafts showed that the NO-CSF1Ri combination significantly decreased intratumoral percentage of anti-inflammatory macrophages, myeloid derived progenitor cells and increased the percentage of pro-inflammatory macrophages, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and effector T cells respectively. Together, our study suggests that the NO-CSF1Ri combination has the potential to act as a therapeutic agent that restore control over TME and improve the outcomes of PCa patients.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression and relapse is fueled by self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs) whose molecular determinants have been difficult to discern from normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or to uncover in screening approaches focused on general AML cell properties. We have identified a unique set of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are enriched in human AML LSCs but repressed in HSCs. Using an in vivo two step CRISPR-Cas9-mediated screening approach to specifically score for cancer stem cell functionality, we found 32 RBPs essential for LSC propagation and self-renewal in MLL-AF9 translocated AML. Using knockdown or small molecule approaches we show that targeting key hit RBP ELAVL1 impaired LSC-driven in vivo leukemic reconstitution and selectively depleted primitive AML cells vs. normal hematopoietic stem and progenitors. Importantly, knockdown of Elavl1 spared HSCs while significantly reducing LSC numbers across genetically diverse leukemias. Integrative RNA-seq and eCLIP-seq profiling revealed hematopoietic differentiation, RNA splicing and mitochondrial metabolism as key features defining the leukemic ELAVL1-mRNA interactome with the mitochondrial import protein TOMM34 being a direct ELAVL1-stabilized target whose inhibition impairs AML propagation. Altogether, through the use of a stem cell-adapted in vivo CRISPR dropout screening strategy, this work demonstrates that a wide variety of post-transcriptionally acting RBPs are important regulators of LSC-survival and self-renewal and, as exemplified by ELAVL1, highlights their potential as therapeutic targets in AML.",

    "abstract": "The paralogous oncogenic transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ are the distal effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway, which play a critical role in cell proliferation, survival and cell fate specification. The core kinase cascade of the Hippo signaling pathway phosphorylates YAP/TAZ and restrict its activity by promoting cytoplasmic sequestration and degradation. Unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocates into the nucleus and associates with the TEA domain (TEAD1-4) transcription factors to regulate their target genes. They are frequently misregulated in most human cancers, where they contribute to multiple aspects of tumorigenesis including growth, metabolism, metastasis and chemo/immunotherapy resistance. Thus, they provide a critical point for therapeutic intervention. However, due to their intrinsically disordered structure, they are challenging to target directly. Since YAP/TAZ exerts oncogenic activity by associating with the TEAD1-4 transcription factors, to regulate target gene expression, YAP activity can be controlled indirectly by regulating TEAD1-4. Interestingly, TEADs undergo autopalmitoylation, which is essential for their stability and function. The palmitic acid occupies a hydrophobic pocket in TEAD1-4, and small-molecule inhibitors that bind to this site can render them unstable, and allosterically inhibit their interaction with YAP/TAZ and chromatin. Here we combined structure-based virtual ligand screening with biochemical and cell biological studies and identified a novel small-molecule that inhibits TEAD palmitoylation and stability. Further, it affects YAP-TEAD interaction and inhibits YAP transcriptional activity and impairs proliferation, colony formation and migration of breast and ovarian cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Computational tools addressing various components of design-build-test-learn loops (DBTL) for the construction of synthetic genetic networks exist, but do not generally cover the entire DBTL loop. This manuscript introduces an end-to-end sequence of tools that together form a DBTL loop called DART (Design Assemble Round Trip). DART provides rational selection and refinement of genetic parts to construct and test a circuit. Computational support for experimental process, metadata management, standardized data collection, and reproducible data analysis is provided via the previously published Round Trip (RT) test-learn loop. The primary focus of this work is on the Design Assemble (DA) part of the tool chain, which improves on previous techniques by screening up to thousands of network topologies for robust performance using a novel robustness score derived from dynamical behavior based on circuit topology only. In addition, novel experimental support software is introduced for the assembly of genetic circuits. A complete design-through-analysis sequence is presented using several OR and NOR circuit designs, with and without structural redundancy, that are implemented in budding yeast. The execution of DART tested the predictions of the design tools, specifically with regard to robust and reproducible performance under different experimental conditions. The data analysis depended on a novel application of machine learning techniques to segment bimodal flow cytometry distributions. Evidence is presented that, in some cases, a more complex build may impart more robustness and reproducibility across experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "A dopamine D2 receptor mutation was recently identified in a family with a novel hyperkinetic movement disorder (Mov Disord 36: 729-739, 2021). That allelic variant D2-I212F is a constitutively active and G protein-biased receptor. We now describe mice engineered to carry the D2-I212F variant, Drd2I212F. The mice exhibited gait abnormalities resembling those in other mouse models of chorea and/or dystonia, and had decreased striatal D2 receptor expression. Electrically evoked IPSCs in midbrain dopamine neurons and striatum from Drd2I212F mice exhibited slow onset and decay compared to wild type mice. In the presence of dopamine, current decay initiated by photolytic release of sulpiride from CyHQ-sulpiride was slower in midbrain slices from Drd2I212F mice than Drd2+/+ mice. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type mice in which dopamine is more potent at neurons in the nucleus accumbens than in the dorsal striatum, reflecting activation of Go vs. Gi1, dopamine had similar potencies in those two brain regions of Drd2I212F mice. Repeated cocaine treatment, which decreases dopamine potency in the nucleus accumbens of wild type mice, had no effect on dopamine potency in Drd2I212F mice. The results demonstrate the utility of this mouse model for investigating the role of pathogenic DRD2 variants in early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders.",

Utilizing direct complement recruitment for complement-mediated elimination of HIV-1-infected cells is underexplored. We developed a novel therapeutic modality to direct complement activity to the surface of HIV-1-infected cells. This bispecific complement engager (BiCE) is comprised of a nanobody recruiting the complement-initiating protein C1q, and single-chain variable fragments of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein. Here, we show that two anti-HIV BiCEs targeting the V3 loop and the CD4 binding site, respectively, increase C3 deposition and mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of HIV-1 Env expressing Raji cells. Furthermore, anti-HIV BiCEs trigger complement activation on primary CD4 T cells infected with laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain and facilitates elimination of HIV-1-infected cells over time. In summary, we present a novel approach to direct complement deposition to the surface of HIV-1-infected cells leading to complement-mediated killing of these cells.",

Neuroimmune circuits of the inflammatory reflex control innate immune overactivation and can be stimulated to treat disease using the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine. Here, we tested the efficacy of galantamine in a rodent model of the prototypical autoinflammatory disease familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Long-term treatment with galantamine attenuated the associated splenomegaly, amyloidosis, and anemia that are characteristic features of this disease. Further, treatment reduced inflammatory cell infiltration into affected organs and a subcutaneous air pouch.

    "abstract": "Lack of proper nutrition (malnutrition) or the complete absence of all food (starvation) have important consequences on the physiology of all organisms. In many cases, nutritional status affects immunity, but, for the most part, the relationship between nutrition and immunity has been limited to studies in vertebrates and terrestrial invertebrates. Herein, we describe a positive correlation between nutrition and immunity in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Gene expression profiling of adult fed and starved anemones showed downregulation of many genes involved in nutrient metabolism and cellular respiration, as well as immune-related genes, in starved animals. Starved adult anemones also had reduced protein levels and DNA-binding activity of immunity-related transcription factor NF-{kappa}B. Starved juvenile anemones had increased sensitivity to bacterial infection and also had lower NF-{kappa}B protein levels, as compared to fed controls. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed significantly correlated gene networks that were inversely associated with starvation. Based on the WGCNA and a reporter gene assay, we identified TRAF3 as a likely NF-{kappa}B target gene in N. vectensis. Overall, these experiments demonstrate a correlation between nutrition and immunity in a basal marine metazoan, and the results have implications for the survival of marine organisms as they encounter changing environments.\n\nSignificance StatementAdequate nutrition is required to sustain proper biological function. One factor threatening many marine organisms, as a result of modern day anthropogenic environmental changes, is nutrient availability. Here, we characterize transcriptional changes following food deprivation in the cnidarian model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We show that starvation is correlated with decreased expression of genes associated with nutrient metabolism and immunity, among others. Moreover, starvation reduces the level of expression and activity of immune regulatory transcription factor NF-{kappa}B and causes anemones to have increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. These results demonstrate that this basal organism responds at the transcriptional level to the absence of food, and that, in addition to changes in metabolic factors, starvation leads to a reduction in immunity.",

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) generally suppresses HIV replication to undetectable levels in peripheral blood, but immune activation associated with increased morbidity and mortality is sustained during ART, and infection rebounds when treatment is interrupted. To identify drivers of immune activation and potential sources of viral rebound, we modified RNAscope in situ hybridization to visualize HIV-virus producing cells as a standard to compare the following assays of potential sources of immune activation and virus rebound following treatment interruption: 1) EDITS (envelope detection by induced transcription-based sequencing) assay; 2) HIV-Flow; and 3) Flow-FISH assays that can scan tissues and cell suspensions to detect rare cells expressing env mRNA, gag mRNA/Gag protein and p24 respectively; and 4) an ultrasensitive immunoassay that detects p24 in cell/tissue lysates at subfemtomolar levels. We show that the sensitivity of these assays is sufficient to detect a rare HIV-producing/env mRNA+/p24+ cell in a million uninfected cells. These high-throughput technologies thus provide contemporary tools to detect and characterize rare cells producing virus and viral antigens as potential sources of immune activation and viral rebound.\n\nImportanceAnti-retroviral therapy (ART) has greatly improved the quality and length of life for people living with HIV, but immune activation does not normalize during ART, and persistent immune activation has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. We report a comparison of assays of two potential sources of immune activation during ART: rare cells producing HIV virus or the virus major viral protein, p24, benchmarked on a cell model of active and latent infections and a method to visualize HIV-producing cells. We show that assays of HIV Envelope mRNA (EDITS assay) and gag mRNA and p24 (Flow-FISH, HIV-Flow and ultrasensitive p24 immunoassay) detect HIV-producing cells and p24 at sensitivities of one infected cell in a million uninfected cells, thus providing validated tools to explore sources of immune activation during ART in the lymphoid and other tissue reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "Studies have found Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa-like bacteria to be the principal or sole comammox bacteria in nitrogen removal systems for wastewater treatment. In contrast, multiple populations of strict ammonia and nitrite oxidizers co-exist in similar systems. This apparent lack of diversity is surprising and could impact the feasibility of leveraging comammox bacteria for nitrogen removal. We used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing and genome-resolved metagenomics to compare population-level (i.e., species) diversity of comammox bacteria with that of strict nitrifiers in full-scale wastewater treatment systems and assess whether these observations were consistent or diverged at the strain-level. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that while Nitrosomonas-like bacteria exhibited higher population-level diversity, the effective microdiversity of most Nitrospira-like bacteria were comparatively higher except for one Nitrospira Lineage II population. Comammox bacterial metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were associated with Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa. The average amino acid identity between comammox bacterial MAGs (93% {+/-} 3) across systems was significantly higher than that of the Nitrosomonas-like ammonia oxidizers (73%{+/-}8) and the Nitrospira-like nitrite oxidizer MAGs (75%{+/-}13), suggesting that the same comammox population was detected in all systems. Comammox bacteria and some ammonia oxidizers MAGs were significantly less microdiverse than most ammonia and nitrite oxidizers. Interestingly, strain-resolved analysis also indicates that different nitrogen removal systems harbor different comammox bacterial strains within the Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa cluster. These results suggest that comammox bacteria associated with Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa have low species- and strain-level diversity in nitrogen removal systems and may thus harbor specific adaptations to the wastewater ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a common cause of human mucosal yeast infections, and invasive candidiasis can be fatal. Antifungal medications are limited, but those targeting the pathogen cell wall or plasma membrane have been effective. Therefore, virulence factors controlling membrane biogenesis are potential targets for drug development. P4-ATPases contribute to membrane biogenesis by selecting and transporting specific lipids from the extracellular leaflet to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer to generate lipid asymmetry. A subset of heterodimeric P4-ATPases, including Dnf1-Lem3 and Dnf2-Lem3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transport phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and the sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer). GlcCer is a critical lipid for Candida albicans polarized growth and virulence, but the role of GlcCer transporters in virulence has not been explored. Here we show that the Candida albicans Dnf2 (CaDnf2) requires association with CaLem3 to form a functional transporter and flip fluorescent derivatives of GlcCer, PC and PE across the plasma membrane. Mutation of conserved substrate-selective residues in the membrane domain strongly abrogates GlcCer transport and partially disrupts PC transport by CaDnf2. Candida strains harboring dnf2 null alleles (dnf2{Delta}{Delta}) or point mutations that disrupt substrate recognition exhibit defects in the yeast to hyphal growth transition, filamentous growth and virulence in systemically infected mice. The influence of CaDNF1 deletion on the morphological phenotypes is negligible although the dnf1{Delta}{Delta} dnf2{Delta}{Delta} strain was less virulent than the dnf2{Delta}{Delta} strain. These results indicate that the transport of GlcCer and/or PC by plasma membrane P4-ATPases is important for pathogenicity of Candida albicans.",

TGF{beta} treatment promoted tendon-like structure in the peripheral layer of the constructs with decreased cell density, decreased cell proliferation, increased thickness, and more elongated cells within highly aligned extracellular matrix.

Datasets reflecting population allele frequencies of different types of variants have been demonstrated as powerful filtering tools, especially in the context of rare disease analysis. While such population-scale allele frequency datasets now exist for structural variants (SVs), it remains a challenge to match SV calls between multiple datasets and thereby correctly estimate the population allele frequency of a putative SV.\n\nResultsWe introduce SVAFotate, a software tool for SV matching that enables the annotation of SVs with variant allele frequency and related information. These annotations are derived from known SV datasets which are incorporated by SVAFotate. As a result, VCF files annotated by SVAFotate offer a variety of annotations to aid in the stratification of SVs as common or rare in the broader human population.\n\nConclusionsHere we demonstrate the use of SVAFotate in the classification of SVs with regards to their population frequency and illustrate how annotations provided by SVAFotate can be used to filter and prioritize SVs. Lastly, we detail how best to utilize these SV annotations in the analysis of genetic variation in studies of rare disease.",

    "abstract": "How protein translation evolved from a simple beginning to its complex and accurate contemporary state is unknown. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) define the genetic code by activating amino acids and loading them onto cognate tRNAs. As such, their evolutionary history can shed light on early translation. Using structure-based alignments of the conserved core of Class I AARSs, we reconstructed their phylogenetic tree and ancestral states. Unexpectedly, AARSs charging amino acids that are assumed to have emerged later - such as TrpRS and TyrRS or LysRS and CysRS - appear as the earliest splits in the tree; conversely, those AARSs charging abiotic, early-emerging amino acids, e.g. ValRS, seem to have diverged most recently. Furthermore, the inferred Class I ancestor (excluding TrpRS and TyrRS) lacks the residues that mediate selectivity in contemporary AARSs, and appears to be a generalist that could charge a wide range of amino acids. This ancestor subsequently diverged to two clades: \"charged\" (which gave rise to ArgRS, GluRS, and GlnRS) and \"hydrophobics\", which includes CysRS and LysRS as its outgroups. The ancestors of both clades maintain a wide-accepting pocket that could readily diverge to the contemporary, specialized families. Overall, our findings suggest a \"generalist-maintaining\" model of class I AARS evolution, in which early statistical translation was kept active by a generalist AARS while the evolution of a specialized, accurate translation system took place.\n\nSignificanceAminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) define the genetic code by linking amino acids with their cognate tRNAs. While contemporary AARSs leverage exquisite molecular recognition and proofreading to ensure translational fidelity, early translation was likely less stringent and operated on a different pool of amino acids. The co-emergence of translational fidelity and the amino acid alphabet, however, is poorly understood. By inferring the evolutionary history of Class I AARSs we found seemingly conflicting signals: Namely, the oldest AARSs apparently operate on the youngest amino acids. We also observed that the early ancestors had broad amino acid specificities, consistent with a model of statistical translation. Our data suggests that a generalist AARS was actively maintained until complete specialization, thereby resolving the age paradox.",

By using two mutator proteins in which two efficient deaminases, PmCDA1 and TadA-8e, are separately fused to T7 RNA polymerase, we obtained similar numbers of C:G[-&gt;]T:A and A:T[-&gt;]G:C mutations at a sufficiently high rate ([~]3.4 x 10-5 mutations per base per generation or [~]1.3 mutations per 1 kb per day). Through eMutaT7transition-mediated TEM-1 evolution for antibiotic resistance, we generated many mutations also found in clinical isolates. Overall, with a fast mutation rate and wider mutational spectrum, eMutaT7transition is a potential first-line method for gene-specific in vivo hypermutation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the robust immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, emerging data reveal enhanced neutralizing antibody and T cell cross-reactivity among individuals that previously experienced COVID-19, pointing to a hybrid immune advantage with infection-associated immune priming. Beyond neutralizing antibodies and T cell immunity, mounting data point to a potential role for additional antibody effector functions, including opsinophagocytic activity, in the resolution of symptomatic COVID-19. Whether hybrid immunity modifies the Fc-effector profile of the mRNA vaccine-induced immune response remains incompletely understood. Thus, here we profiled the SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immune response in a group of individuals with and without prior COVID-19. As expected, hybrid Spike-specific antibody titers were enhanced following the primary dose of the mRNA vaccine, but were similar to those achieved by naive vaccinees after the second mRNA vaccine dose. Conversely, Spike-specific vaccine-induced Fc-receptor binding antibody levels were higher after the primary immunization in individuals with prior COVID-19, and remained higher following the second dose compared to naive individuals, suggestive of a selective improvement in the quality, rather than the quantity, of the hybrid humoral immune response. Thus, while the magnitude of antibody titers alone may suggest that any two antigen exposures - either hybrid immunity or two doses of vaccine alone - represent a comparable prime/boost immunologic education, we find that hybrid immunity offers a qualitatively improved antibody response able to better leverage Fc effector functions against conserved regions of the virus.",
