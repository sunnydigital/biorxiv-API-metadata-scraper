    "abstract": "Darunavir (DRV) is exceptional among potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) in the high drug concentrations that are achived in vivo. Little is known about the de novo resistance pathway for DRV. We have selected for resistance to high drug concentrations against ten PIs and their structural precursor DRV. Mutations accumulated through two pathways (anchored by protease mutations I50V or I84V). Small chemical changes in the inhibitor P1 side chain led to preferential use of one pathway over the other. Changes in the inhbitor P2 side chain determined differences in potency that were retained in the resistant viruses. Viral variants from the two pathways showed differential selection of compensatory mutations in Gag cleavage sites. These results reveal the high level of selective pressure that is attainable with fourth generation PIs, and how features of the inhibitor affect both the resistance pathway and the residual potency in the face of resistance.",

    "abstract": "Getting older affects both the structure of the brain and some cognitive capabilities. Until now, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches have been unable to give a coherent reflection of the cognitive declines. It shows the limitation of the contrast mechanisms used in most MRI investigations, which are indirect measures of brain activities depending on multiple physiological and cognitive variables. However, MRI signals may contain information of brain activity beyond these commonly used signals caused by the neurovascular response. Here, we apply a zero-spin echo (ZSE) weighted MRI sequence, which can detect heartbeat evoked signals (HES). Remarkably, these MRI signals have properties only known from electrophysiology. We investigated the complexity of the HES arising from this sequence in two age groups; young (18-29 years) and old (over 65 years). While comparing young and old participants, we show that the complexity of the HES decreases with age, where the stability and chaoticity of these HES are particularly sensitive to age. However, we also found individual differences which were independent of age. Complexity measures were related to scores from different cognitive batteries and showed that higher complexity may be related to better cognitive performance. These findings underpin the affinity of the HES to electrophysiological signals. The profound sensitivity of these changes in complexity shows the potential of HES for understanding brain dynamics that need to be tested in more extensive and diverse populations with clinical relevance for all neurovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "In binocular animals that exhibit stereoscopic visual responses, the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) connect to brain areas bilaterally by forming a commissure called the optic chiasm (OC). Ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) contributes to formation of the OC, acting endogenously in optic pathway cells and exogenously in growing RGC axons. Here, we generated Vax1AA/AA mice expressing the Vax1AA mutant, which is incapable of intercellular transfer. We found that RGC axons cannot take up Vax1AA protein from Vax1AA/AA mouse optic stalk (OS) cells, of which maturation is delayed, and fail to access the midline. Consequently, RGC axons of Vax1AA/AA mice connect exclusively to ipsilateral brain areas, resulting in the reduced visual acuity and the abnormal oculomotor responses. Together, our study provides physiological evidences for the necessity of intercellular transfer of Vax1 and the importance of the bilateral RGC axon projection in visuomotor responses.",

    "abstract": "In most eukaryotic cells, actin filaments assemble into a shell-like actin cortex under the plasma membrane, controlling cellular morphology, mechanics, and signaling. The actin cortex is highly polymorphic, adopting diverse forms such as the ring-like structures found in podosomes, axonal rings, and immune synapses. The biophysical principles that underlie the formation of actin rings and cortices remain unknown. Using a molecular simulation platform, called MEDYAN, we discovered that varying the filament treadmilling rate and myosin concentration induces a finite size phase transition in actomyosin network structures. We found that actomyosin networks condense into clusters at low treadmilling rates or high myosin concentration but form ring-like or cortex-like structures at high treadmilling rates and low myosin concentration. This mechanism is supported by our corroborating experiments on live T cells, which exhibit ring-like actin networks upon activation by stimulatory antibody. Upon disruption of filament treadmilling or enhancement of myosin activity, the pre-existing actin rings are disrupted into actin clusters or collapse towards the network center respectively. Our analyses suggest that the ring-like actin structure is a preferred state of low mechanical energy, which is, importantly, only reachable at sufficiently high treadmilling rates.",

    "abstract": "While traditional theories of sensorimotor processing have often assumed a serial decision-making pipeline, more recent approaches have suggested that multiple actions may be planned concurrently and vie for execution. Evidence for the latter almost exclusively stems from electrophysiological studies in posterior parietal and premotor cortex of monkeys. Here we study concurrent prospective motor planning in humans by recording functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a delayed response task engaging movement sequences towards multiple potential targets. We find that also in human posterior parietal and premotor cortex delay activity modulates both with sequence complexity and the number of potential targets. We tested the hypothesis that this modulation is best explained by concurrent prospective planning as opposed to the mere maintenance of potential targets in memory. We devise a bounded rationality model with information constraints that optimally assigns information resources for planning and memory for this task and determine predicted information profiles according to the two hypotheses. When regressing delay activity on these model predictions, we find that the concurrent prospective planning strategy provides a significantly better explanation of the fMRI-signal modulations. Moreover, we find that concurrent prospective planning is more costly and thus limited for most subjects, as expressed by the best fitting information capacities. We conclude that bounded rational decision-making models allow relating both behavior and neural representations to utilitarian task descriptions based on bounded optimal information-processing assumptions.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen the future is uncertain, it can be beneficial to concurrently plan several action possibilities in advance. Electrophysiological research found evidence in monkeys that brain regions in posterior parietal and promotor cortex are indeed capable of planning several actions in parallel. We now used fMRI to study brain activity in these brain regions in humans. For our analyses we applied bounded rationality models that optimally assign information resources to fMRI activity in a complex motor planning task. We find that theoretical information costs of concurrent prospective planning explained fMRI activity profiles significantly better than assuming alternative memory-based strategies. Moreover, exploiting the model allowed us to quantify the individual capacity limit for concurrent planning and to relate these individual limits to both subjects behavior and to their neural representations of planning.",

    "abstract": "Upstream ORFs (uORFs) are common regulatory elements in the 5 untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs. In addition to repressing main ORF translation, uORF translation in animals also reduces mRNA stability through nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). In contrast, the roles of uORFs in plants are less understood. Here, we identified actively translated uORFs (TuORFs) in Arabidopsis through ribosome profiling and systematically examined their roles in gene expression. Like animal systems, Arabidopsis TuORFs are associated with 38%, 14%, and 43% reductions in translation efficiency, mRNA half-lives, and protein levels, respectively. However, we found TuORF-containing mRNAs have 51% higher transcript levels, and this phenomenon is persistent in diverse tissues and developmental stages across plants. We present multiple lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that uORF translation generally does not trigger NMD in Arabidopsis. First, TuORF-containing mRNAs are not increased in NMD mutants. Second, TuORF-containing mRNAs and known NMD targets have distinct expression patterns, and they are translationally repressed via different mechanisms. Finally, TuORF-containing mRNAs and NMD targets are degraded through separate pathways. Our results suggest that Arabidopsis TuORFs reduce mRNA stability and translation through mechanisms different from NMD and highlight a fundamental difference in gene regulation mediated by TuORFs in plants and animals.",

Notably, neuronal cell bodies exist in deeper white matter tissue, neurotransmitter vesicles are released directly in white matter, and white matter blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals are detectable across a range of different tasks--all appearing to reflect a dynamic, active tissue from which recorded signals can reveal meaningful information about the brain. Yet, the signals within white matter have largely been ignored. Here, we elucidate the properties of white matter signals using intracranial EEG in a bipolar montage. We show that such signals capture the communication between brain regions and differentiate pathophysiologies of epilepsy. In direct contradiction to past assumptions that white matter functional signals provide little value, we show that white matter recordings can elucidate brain function and pathophysiology.

    "abstract": "Although it is well established that motivational factors such as earning more money for performing well improve motor performance, how the motor system implements this improvement remains unclear. For instance, feedback-based control, which uses sensory feedback from the body to correct for errors in movement, improves with greater reward. But feedback control encompasses many feedback loops with diverse characteristics such as the brain regions involved and their response time. Which specific loops drive these performance improvements with reward is unknown, even though their diversity makes it unlikely that they are contributing uniformly. We systematically tested the effect of reward on the latency (how long for a corrective response to arise?) and gain (how large is the corrective response?) of seven distinct sensorimotor feedback loops in humans. Only the fastest feedback loops were insensitive to reward, and the earliest reward-driven changes were consistently an increase in feedback gains, not a reduction in latency. Rather, a reduction of response latencies only tended to occur in slower feedback loops. These observations were similar across sensory modalities (vision and proprioception). Our results may have implications regarding feedback control performance in athletic coaching. For instance, coaching methodologies that rely on reinforcement or \"reward shaping\" may need to specifically target aspects of movement that rely on reward-sensitive feedback responses.",

    "abstract": "We asked what peptide features govern targeting to the mitochondria versus the chloroplast using antimicrobial peptides as a starting point. This approach was inspired by the endosymbiotic hypothesis that organelle-targeting peptides derive from antimicrobial amphipathic peptides delivered by the host cell, to which organelle progenitors became resistant. To explore the molecular changes required to convert antimicrobial into targeting peptides, we expressed a set of 13 antimicrobial peptides in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Peptides were systematically modified to test distinctive features of mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting peptides, and we assessed their targeting potential by following the intracellular localization and maturation of a Venus fluorescent reporter used as cargo protein. Mitochondrial targeting can be achieved by some unmodified antimicrobial peptide sequences. Targeting to both organelles is improved by replacing Lysines with Arginines. Chloroplast targeting is enabled by the presence of flanking unstructured sequences, additional constraints consistent with chloroplast endosymbiosis having occurred in a cell that already contained mitochondria. If indeed targeting peptides evolved from antimicrobial peptides, required modifications imply a temporal evolutionary scenario with an early exchange of cationic residues, and a late acquisition of chloroplast specific motifs.",

While mitochondrial fission is known to coordinate cellular metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis, the physiological relevance of peroxisome dynamics and the implications for cell fate are not fully understood. DRP1 (dynamin-related protein 1) is an essential GTPase that executes both mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission. Patients with de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the gene that encodes DRP1, DNM1L (Dynamin 1 Like), present with encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission (EMPF1). EMPF1 is a devastating neurodevelopmental disease with no effective treatment. To interrogate the mechanisms by which DRP1 mutations cause cellular dysfunction, we used human-derived fibroblasts from patients with mutations in DRP1 who present with EMPF1. As expected, patient cells display elongated mitochondrial morphology and lack of fission. Patient cells display a lower coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain, increased proton leak, and upregulation of glycolysis. In addition to these metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial hyperfusion results in aberrant cristae structure and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, both of which are tightly linked to the changes in metabolism. Peroxisome structure is also severely elongated in patient cells and results in a potential functional compensation of fatty acid oxidation. Understanding the mechanism by which DRP1 mutations cause these metabolic changes will give insight into the role of mitochondrial dynamics in cristae maintenance and the metabolic capacity of the cell, as well as the disease mechanism underlying EMPF1.",

    "abstract": "Indoor surfaces are paradoxically presumed to be both colonized by pathogens, necessitating disinfection, and \"microbial wastelands.\" In these resource-poor, dry environments, competition and decay are thought to be important drivers of microbial community composition. However, the relative contributions of these two processes have not been specifically evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, we used microcosms to specifically evaluate whether interspecies interactions occur on surfaces. We combined transcriptomics and traditional microbiology techniques to investigate whether competition occurred between two clinically important pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and a probiotic cleaner containing a consortium of Bacillus species. Probiotic cleaning seeks to take advantage of ecological principles such as competitive exclusion, thus using benign microorganisms to inhibit viable pathogens, but there is limited evidence that competitive exclusion in fact occurs in environments of interest (i.e., indoor surfaces). Our results indicate that competition in this setting has a negligible impact on community composition but may influence the functions expressed by active organisms. Although Bacillus spp. remained viable on surfaces for an extended period of time after application, viable colony forming units (CFUs) of A. baumannii recovered following exposure to a chemical-based detergent with and without Bacillus spp. showed no statistical difference. Similarly, for K. pneumoniae, there were small statistical differences in CFUs between cleaning scenarios with or without Bacillus spp. in the chemical-based detergent. The transcriptome of A. baumannii with and without Bacillus spp. exposure shared a high degree of similarity in overall gene expression, but the transcriptome of K. pneumoniae differed in overall gene expression, including reduced response in genes related to antimicrobial resistance. Together, these results highlight the need to fully understand the underlying biological and ecological mechanisms for community assembly and function on indoor surfaces, as well as having practical implications for cleaning and disinfection strategies for infection prevention.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks are 24-hour endogenous oscillators in physiological and behavioral processes. Though recent transcriptomic studies have been successful in revealing the circadian rhythmicity in gene expression, the power calculation for omics circadian analysis have not been fully explored. In this paper, we develop a statistical method, namely CircaPower, to perform power calculation for circadian pattern detection. Our theoretical framework is determined by three key factors in circadian gene detection: sample size, intrinsic effect size and sampling design. Via simulations, we systematically investigate the impact of these key factors on circadian power calculation. We not only demonstrate that CircaPower is fast and accurate, but also show its underlying cosinor model is robust against variety of violations of model assumptions. In real applications, we demonstrate the performance of CircaPower using mouse pan-tissue data and human post-mortem brain data, and illustrate how to perform circadian power calculation using mouse skeleton muscle RNA-Seq pilot as case study. Our method CircaPower has been implemented in an R package, which is made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/circaPower/circaPower).",

    "abstract": "The high temperature requirement A (HtrA) serine protease family presents an attractive target class for antibacterial therapeutics development. These proteins possess dual protease and chaperone functions and contain numerous binding sites and regulatory loops, displaying diverse oligomerization patterns dependent on substrate type and occupancy. HtrA proteins that are natively purified coelute with contaminating peptides and activating species, shifting oligomerization and protein structure to differently activated populations. Here, a redesigned HtrA production results in cleaner preparations with high yields by overexpressing and purifying target protein from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions, followed by a high-throughput screen for optimal refolding buffer composition using function-agnostic biophysical techniques that do not rely on target-specific measurements. We use the Borrelia burgdorferi HtrA to demonstrate the effectiveness of our function-agnostic approach, while characterization with both new and established biophysical methods shows the retention of proteolytic and chaperone activity of the refolded protein. This systematic workflow and toolset will translate to the production of HtrA-family proteins in higher quantities of pure and monodisperse composition than the current literature standard, with applicability to a broad array of protein purification strategies.\n\nStatementThe production of a therapeutically-relevant protein family sensitive to coeluting contaminants is greatly improved by optimized expression and refolding workflow. A miniaturized, high-throughput system supported by a function-agnostic biophysics assay and modified data analysis scripts results in a refolded protein that is highly pure, monodisperse, and retains proteolytic and chaperone activity. This approach has broad applicability towards hard-to-express proteins and proteins sensitive to coeluting species. Additionally, novel methods are presented to characterize protein chaperone activity.",

    "abstract": "PremiseParasitic plants and their hosts are model systems for studying genetic variation in species interactions across environments. The parasitic plant Striga hermonthica (witchweed) attacks a range of cereal crop hosts in Africa and exhibits substantial variation in performance on different host species. Some of this variation is due to local adaptation, but the genetic basis of specialization on certain hosts is unknown.\n\nMethodsTo identify genomic regions that are strongly differentiated between parasites attacking different host species, we present an alignment-free analysis of S. hermonthica population diversity using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for 68 individuals from western Kenya. We validate our findings with germination experiments and analyses based on a de novo assembled draft genome.\n\nResultsReference-free and reference-based analyses suggest that only a small portion of the S. hermonthica genome is strongly differentiated by host species in populations from western Kenya. Analysis of host-associated k-mers implicated genes involved in development of the parasite haustorium (a specialized structure used to establish vascular connections with host roots) and a potential role of chemocyanins in molecular host-parasitic plant interactions. Conversely, no phenotypic or genomic evidence was observed suggesting host-specific selection on parasite response to strigolactones, hormones exuded by host roots and required for parasite germination.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the utility of WGS for plant species with large, complex genomes and no available reference. Contrasting with theory emphasizing the role of early recognition loci for host specificity, our findings support host-specific selection on later interaction stages, recurring each generation after homogenizing gene flow.",

Herein, we show that the mitochondrial antioxidant mitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate (Mito-MES), a dietary supplement, has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern in vitro and in vivo. Mito-MES had nanomolar in vitro antiviral potency against the Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Mito-MES given in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice through oral gavage reduced viral titer by nearly 4 log units relative to the vehicle group. We found in vitro that the antiviral effect of Mito-MES is attributable to its hydrophobic dTPP+ moiety and its combined effects scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating Nrf2 and increasing the host defense proteins TOM70 and MX1. Mito-MES was efficacious reducing increase in cleaved caspase-3 and inflammation induced by SARS-CoV2 infection both in lung epithelial cells and a transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Mito-MES reduced production of IL-6 by SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells through its antioxidant properties (Nrf2 agonist, coenzyme Q10 moiety) and the dTPP moiety. Given established safety of Mito-MES in humans, our results suggest that Mito-MES may represent a rapidly applicable therapeutic strategy that can be added in the therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19. Its potential long-term use by humans as diet supplement could help control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially in the setting of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that may compromise vaccine efficacy.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryMitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate has potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a need to investigate mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates as negative effects of climate change, like ocean acidification, are experienced by coastal ecosystems. Environmentally-induced changes to the methylome may regulate gene expression, but methylome responses can be species- and tissue-specific. Tissue-specificity has implications for gonad tissue, as gonad-specific methylation patterns may be inherited by offspring. We used the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) -- a model for understanding pH impacts on bivalve molecular physiology due to its genomic resources and importance in global aquaculture-- to assess how low pH could impact the gonad methylome. Oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 {+/-} 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 {+/-} 0.02) conditions for seven weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions in female oyster gonad samples. C->T single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and removed to ensure accurate methylation characterization.\n\nResultsAnalysis of gonad methylomes revealed a total of 1,284 differentially methylated loci (DML) found primarily in genes, with several genes containing multiple DML. Gene ontologies for genes containing DML were involved in development and stress response, suggesting methylation may promote gonad growth homeostasis in low pH conditions. Additionally, several of these genes were associated with cytoskeletal structure regulation, metabolism, and protein ubiquitination -- commonly-observed responses to ocean acidification. Comparison of these DML with other Crassostrea spp. exposed to ocean acidification demonstrates that similar pathways, but not identical genes, are impacted by methylation.\n\nConclusionsOur work suggests DNA methylation may have a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, which would shape adult and offspring responses to low pH stress. Combined with existing molluscan methylome research, our work further supports the need for tissue- and species-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation.",

DISCERN outperforms competing algorithms in expression inference resulting in greatly improved cell clustering, cell type and activity detection, and insights into the cellular regulation of disease. We used DISCERN to detect two unseen COVID-19-associated T cell types, cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ Tc2 T helper cells, with a potential role in adverse disease outcome. We utilized T cell fraction information of patient blood to classify mild or severe COVID-19 with an AUROC of 81% that can serve as a biomarker of disease stage.

    "abstract": "Understanding how genotypic variation results in phenotypic variation, a major challenge in biology, is especially difficult for collective behaviour because collective group phenotypes arise from complex interactions between group members1. Honeybees aggressively defend their colony from attacks with highly integrated collective behaviour in which different groups of bees play specific roles, giving rise to distinct colony-level differences in aggression. A previous genome-wide association study of a population of Africanized honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) from Puerto Rico that recently evolved decreased aggression identified hundreds of genes with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associated with colony-level variation in aggression2. Many of these SNPs also showed strong signals of selection for decreased aggression2,3, but their influence on brain function was unknown. Using brain single-cell (sc) transcriptomics and sc gene regulatory network analysis, we show here that variants of these genes give rise to genetic differences in transcription factor-target gene relationships. These differences involved the activity of several TFs, some that have been previously associated with aggression, like single stranded-binding protein c31A, and some that have been associated with tissue morphogenesis but not behaviour, like apontic. The activity of these and other TFs was located in specific brain cell populations related to olfaction and vision, the two sensory modalities that bees use in colony defence. They also implicate metabolism of serotonin, a neurochemical already known to influence honeybee aggression, but not from a genetic perspective. Surprisingly, genetic differences were more pronounced in the brains of forager bees than in similarly aged but more aggressive soldier bees, pointing to an evolutionary change in division of labour for colony defence. Our results demonstrate how group genetics can shape a collective phenotype by modulating individual brain gene regulatory network architecture.",

    "abstract": "Sterol lipids are required by most eukaryotes and are readily preserved as sterane molecular fossils. These geologic steranes are broadly interpreted as biomarkers for ancient eukaryotes1,2 although diverse bacteria also produce sterols3. Steranes with side-chain methylations can act as more specific biomarkers4 if their sterol precursors are limited to particular extant eukaryotes and are absent in bacteria. An abundance of one such sterane, 24-isopropylcholestane, in late Neoproterozoic rocks has been attributed to marine demosponges and potentially represents the earliest evidence for animals on Earth5. However, debates over this interpretation6-14 continue given the potential for alternative sources of 24-isopropylcholestane and the lack of experimental evidence demonstrating the function of enzymes that methylate sterols to give the 24-isopropyl side-chain. Here we show that sterol methyltransferases from both sponges and bacteria are functional and identify three bacterial methyltransferases each capable of sequential methylations resulting in the 24-isopropyl sterol side-chain. We identified two of these propylating enzymes in a demosponge metagenome suggesting bacterial symbionts contribute to 24-isopropyl sterol biosynthesis in demosponges. Our results demonstrate yet-uncultured bacteria have the genomic capacity to synthesize side-chain alkylated sterols and should therefore be considered when interpreting side-chain alkylated sterane biomarkers in the rock record.",

    "abstract": "The brain systems of episodic memory and oculomotor control are tightly linked, suggesting a crucial role of eye movements in memory. But little is known about the neural mechanisms of memory formation across eye movements in unrestricted viewing behavior. Here, we leverage simultaneous eye tracking and EEG recording to examine episodic memory formation in free viewing. Participants memorized multi-element events while their EEG and eye movements were concurrently recorded. Each event comprised elements from three categories (face, object, place), with two exemplars from each category, in different locations on the screen. A subsequent associative memory test assessed participants memory for the between-category associations that specified each event. We used a deconvolution approach to overcome the problem of overlapping EEG responses to sequential saccades in free viewing. Brain activity was time-locked to the fixation onsets, and we examined EEG power in the theta and alpha frequency bands, the putative oscillatory correlates of episodic encoding mechanisms. Three modulations of fixation-related EEG predicted high subsequent memory performance: 1) theta increase at fixations after between-category gaze transitions, 2) theta and alpha increase at fixations after within-element gaze transitions, 3) alpha decrease at fixations after between-exemplar gaze transitions. Thus, event encoding with unrestricted viewing behavior was characterized by three neural mechanisms, manifested in fixation-locked theta and alpha EEG activity that rapidly turned on and off during the unfolding eye movement sequences. These three distinct neural mechanisms may be the essential building blocks that subserve the buildup of coherent episodic memories during unrestricted viewing behavior.",

    "abstract": "The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Valine 66 to Methionine human polymorphism results in impaired activity-dependent BDNF release and has been linked to psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. We previously showed that male knock-in mice carrying the mouse Methionine homolog (Met68BDNF) exhibit excessive and compulsive alcohol drinking behaviors as compared to the wild-type Val68BDNF mice. Here, we set out to determine the potential mechanism for the heightened and compulsive alcohol drinking phenotypes detected in Met68BDNF mice. We found that male, but not female Met68BDNF mice exhibit social anxiety-like behaviors. We further show that male Met68BDNF mice exhibit a preference for alcohol over social interaction. In contrast, alcohol place preference without an alternative social reward, is similar in male Met68BDNF and Val68BDNF mice. Since the Met68BDNF mice show social anxiety phenotypes, we tested whether alcohol reliefs anxiety similarly in Met68BDNF and Val68BDNF mice and found that male, but not female Met68BDNF mice are insensitive to the acute anxiolytic action of alcohol. Finally, we show that this acute tolerance to alcohol-dependent anxiolysis can be restored by overexpressing wild-type Val68BDNF in the ventral hippocampus (vHC) of Met68BDNF mice. Together, our results suggest that excessive alcohol drinking in the Met68BDNF may be attributed, in part, to heighted social anxiety and a lack of alcohol-dependent anxiolysis, a phenotype that is associated with malfunction of BDNF signaling in the vHC of male Met68BDNF mice.",

    "abstract": "Position within the social group has consequences on individual lifespans in diverse taxa. This is especially obvious in eusocial insects, where workers differ in both the tasks they perform and their aging rates. However, in eusocial wasps, bees and ants, the performed task usually depends strongly on age. As such, untangling the effects of social role and age on worker physiology is a key step towards understanding the coevolution of sociality and aging. We performed an experimental protocol that allowed a separate analysis of these two factors using four groups of black garden ant (Lasius niger) workers: young foragers, old foragers, young nest workers, and old nest workers. We highlighted age-related differences in the proteome and metabolome of workers that were primarily related to worker subcaste and only secondarily to age. The relative abundance of proteins and metabolites suggests an improved xenobiotic detoxification, and a fuel metabolism based more on lipid use than carbohydrate use in young ants, regardless of their social role. Regardless of age, proteins related to the digestive function were more abundant in nest workers than in foragers. Old foragers were mostly characterized by weak abundances of molecules with an antibiotic activity or involved in chemical communication. Finally, our results suggest that even in tiny species, extended lifespan may require to mitigate cancer risks. This is consistent with results found in eusocial rodents and thus opens up the discussion of shared mechanisms among distant taxa and the influence of sociality on life history traits such as longevity.",

    "abstract": "Translatable circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as a crucial molecular format for transient protein expression, with high potential to be an alternative for linear mRNA to reshape the landscape of mRNA pharmaceutical industry. Canonical Anabaena permuted intron-exon (Ana PIE) format that developed by ORNA is an efficient method for RNA circularization, and the engineered circRNAs direct supreme protein expression in eukaryotic cells. However, recent studies revealed that this method may unavoidably result in a remain of immunogenicity in the circRNA products, albeit after thorough RNA purification. In the current study, we develop a novel strategy for efficient generation of circRNA, via the permuted T4Td introns mediated autocatalytically ribozymatic reaction mediated ligation of the flanking segment sequences that concealing in ORF or translation initiation sequence (normally equal to IRES). This strategy universally realizes around 90% circularization effectivity, and the circRNA products can be purified to around 90% purity by our new purification method, and presented thoroughly minimized immunogenicity, thus is termed \"Clean-PIE\". The purified circRNAs are found to direct potent and durable expression of various proteins in vitro and in vivo. The partly purified Fluc circRNA by HPLC-SEC was found to direct Fluc expression in muscle for no less than 20 days. The highly purified circRNA exhibits much stronger protein expression in vitro and in vivo, and presumed a longer duration. Additionally, the scale-up of RNA circularization with the RNA precursors from 1 L transcription revealed high circularization effectivity (around 90%) and a high productivity of the final circRNA products. Collectively, Clean-PIE is a novel circRNA platform that possesses high circularization effectivity, enabled high RNA purity and thoroughly minimized immunogenicity, as well as scaling-up accessibility and directing extreme durability of protein expression, thus has the potential to develop advanced RNA vaccines and therapeutics in pharmaceutical industrial scale.",

To characterize the within-host evolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, we deep sequenced saliva and nasal samples collected daily from immune and unvaccinated individuals early during infection. We show that longitudinal sampling facilitates high-confidence genetic variant detection and reveals evolutionary dynamics missed by less-frequent sampling strategies. Within-host dynamics in both naive and immune individuals appeared largely stochastic; however, we identified clear mutational hotspots within the viral genome, consistent with selection and differing between naive and immune individuals. In rare cases, minor genetic variants emerged to frequencies sufficient for forward transmission. Finally, we detected significant genetic compartmentalization of virus between saliva and nasal swab sample sites in many individuals. Altogether, these data provide a high-resolution profile of within-host SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Many studies demonstrated the influence of mitochondrial stress on cytosolic signaling pathways. Here, we found that in cells upon long-term mitochondrial stress, phosphorylation of S6K1 protein, which is the mTOR pathway component, was increased, like in brains of Alzheimers disease (AD) patients. We checked if increased S6K1 phosphorylation was involved in Tau protein aggregation, which is one of AD hallmarks. HEK239T NDUFA11-deficient cells treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, INK128, or with S6K1 inhibitor, PF-4708671, caused the elevation of Tau aggregation. In contrast, stable overactivation of the mTOR pathway caused a further increase of S6K1 phosphorylation and reduced Tau oligomerization in HEK239T NDUFA11-deficient cells. Thus, we conclude that the increase in S6K1 phosphorylation is protective against Tau aggregation under mitochondrial stress.",

    "abstract": "Alteration in the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network is an emerging feature of Alzheimers disease (AD), highlighting the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is the main adaptive pathway to cope with protein folding stress at the ER. Inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) is an ER-located kinase and endoribonuclease that operates as a central ER stress sensor, enabling the establishment of adaptive and repair programs through the control of the expression of the transcription factor X-Box binding protein 1 (XBP1). A polymorphism in the XBP1 promoter has been suggested as a risk factor for AD. To artificially enforce the adaptive capacity of the UPR in the AD brain, we developed strategies to express the active form of XBP1 in neurons using preclinical models. Overexpression of an active form of XBP1 in the nervous system using transgenic mice significantly reduced the load of amyloid deposits in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and preserved synaptic and cognitive function. Moreover, local delivery of XBP1 into the hippocampus of an AD mice using adeno-associated vectors improved long-term potentiation, memory performance, and dendritic spine density. Quantitative proteomics of the hippocampus revealed that XBP1 expression corrects a large proportion of the alterations observed in the 5xFAD model, restoring the levels of several synaptic proteins and factors involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and axonal growth. Our results illustrate the therapeutic potential of targeting UPR-dependent gene expression programs as a strategy to ameliorate AD features and sustain synaptic function.",

    "abstract": "The fine-tuning of pectins by polygalacturonases (PGs) plays a key role in modulating plant cell wall chemistry and mechanics, impacting plant development. In plants, the high number of PGs encoded in the genome questions the regulation of pectin depolymerization and the roles of distinct isozymes in the control of development. Here we report the first crystal structures of two PGs from Arabidopsis, PGLR and ADPG2 whose expression overlap in roots. Albeit having overall conserved folds and active sites, PGLR and ADPG2 differed in the structure of their binding grooves and in the amino-acids of the subsites. We determined the structural features that explain the absence of inhibition of the plant PGs by endogenous PG-Inhibiting Proteins (PGIPs). By combining molecular dynamic simulations, analysis of enzymes kinetics and hydrolysis products, we showed that subtle differences in PGLR and ADPG2 structures translated into distinct enzyme-substrate dynamics and enzymes processivities. Using the plant root as a developmental model, exogenous application of purified enzymes showed that these distinct PGLR/ADPG2 processivities ultimately translated into different impacts on development. The highly processive ADPG2 had major effects on both root cell elongation and cell adhesion. Our study suggests that, in plants, gene redundancy is unlikely to reflect redundant biochemical specificities. Isozymes of distinct specificities and processivities are likely to be of major importance for the fine spatial and temporal regulation of pectin structure.\n\nSignificance StatementPlant polygalacturonases (PG) are enzymes that play a key role in the regulation of cell wall pectin chemistry by controlling the degree of polymerization of the HG chains. The high number of genes encoding PG in Arabidopsis questions the rationale for such abundance. We solved the crystal structure of two PG (PGLR and ADPG2) whose expression overlap in roots and showed, using combined computational and experimental approaches, that they differ in their enzyme-substrate dynamics, leading to distinct processivities. The highly processive ADPG2 can generate digestion products of shorter degree of polymerization, and upon exogenous application on developing roots, induced drastic developmental defects. Our study suggests that gene redundancy is unlikely to reflect redundant biochemical specificities of isozymes.",

Here we present a method to obtain genome-size (megabasepair length) deproteinated DNA for in vitro studies, which provides DNA substrates that are two orders of magnitude longer than typically studied in single-molecule experiments. We isolated chromosomes from bacterial cells and enzymatically digested the native proteins. Mass spectrometry indicated that 97-100% of DNA-binding proteins are removed from the sample. Upon protein removal, we observed an increase in the radius of gyration of the DNA polymers, while quantification of the fluorescence intensities showed that the length of the DNA objects remained megabasepair sized. In first proof-of-concept experiments using these deproteinated long DNA molecules, we observed DNA compaction upon adding the DNA-binding protein Fis or PEG crowding agents and showed that it is possible to track the motion of a fluorescently labelled DNA locus.

Yet, MYC activation also endows cancer cells with a series of metabolic dependencies, which can provide strategic points for targeted pharmacological intervention. We recently reported that targeting the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I with the small molecule inhibitor IACS-010759 selectively killed MYC-overexpressing lymphoid cells. Here, we unravel the mechanistic basis for this synthetic-lethal interaction and exploit it to improve the anti-tumoral effects of ETC inhibition. In a mouse B-cell line, MYC hyperactivation and IACS-010759 treatment added up to induce oxidative stress, with consequent depletion of reduced glutathione and lethal disruption of redox homeostasis. This effect could be enhanced by targeted pharmacological intervention, with either inhibitors of NADPH production through the pentose phosphate pathway, or with ascorbate (vitamin C), known to contribute pro-oxidant effects when administered at high doses. In these conditions, ascorbate synergized with IACS-010759 to kill MYC-overexpressing cells in vitro and reinforced its therapeutic action against human B-cell lymphoma xenografts. Hence, ETC inhibition and high-dose ascorbate might improve the outcome of patients affected by high-grade lymphomas and other MYC-driven cancers.\n\nKey point #1MYC and the ETC complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 elicit different reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cooperate to disrupt redox homeostasis.\n\nKey point #2Further boosting of oxidative stress with high doses of ascorbate increases the killing of MYC-driven lymphoma xenografts by IACS-010759.",

A parameter estimation pipeline was developed, consisting of a divide and conquer approach, supplemented with regularization and global optimization. We show how this first mechanistic description of a growing yeast cell captures experimental dynamics at different growth rates and under a strong glucose perturbation, is robust to parametric uncertainty and explains the contribution of the different pathways in the network.

Brain AG decreases with age but the functional significance of this decrease with regard to the development of DAT symptomatology is poorly understood. Using PET measurements of regional blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose utilization--from which we derive AG--we find that cognitive impairment is strongly associated with loss of the typical youthful pattern of AG. In contrast, amyloid positivity without cognitive impairment was associated with preservation of youthful brain AG, which was even higher than that seen in typical, cognitively unimpaired, amyloid negative adults. Similar findings were not seen for blood flow nor oxygen consumption. Finally, in cognitively unimpaired adults, white matter hyperintensity burden was found to be specifically associated with decreased youthful brain AG. Our results implicate preserved AG as a factor in brain resilience to amyloid pathology and suggest that white matter disease may be a cause and/or consequence of this impaired resilience.",

Invadopodia disassembly starts when ARHGAP17 translocates from the invadopodia ring to the core, in a process that is mediated by its interaction with the Cdc42 effector CIP4. Once at the core, ARHGAP17 inactivates Cdc42 to promote invadopodia disassembly.

A recently discovered novel family of lipid transfer proteins, which includes the VPS13 proteins (VPS13A-D), adopt a rod-like bridge conformation with an extended hydrophobic groove that enables the bulk transfer of membrane lipids for membrane growth. Loss of function mutations in VPS13A and VPS13C cause chorea acanthocytosis and Parkinsons disease, respectively. VPS13A and VPS13C localize to multiple organelle contact sites, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - lipid droplet (LD) contact sites, but the functional roles of these proteins in LD regulation remains mostly unexplored. Here, we employ CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate VPS13A and VPS13C knockout cell lines in U-2 OS cells via deletion of exon 2 and introduction of an early frameshift. Analysis of LD content in these cell lines revealed that loss of either VPS13A or VPS13C results in reduced LD abundance under oleate-stimulated conditions. These data implicate VPS13A and VPS13C in LD regulation and raise the intriguing possibility that VPS13A and VPS13C-mediated lipid transfer facilitates LD biogenesis.",

Here, utilizing ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, we report that CDRs are expressed in glomerular podocytes ex vivo and in vivo. Biochemical and imaging analysis revealed that AKT phosphorylation is localized to CDRs upstream of mTORC1 activation in podocyte cell line and isolated glomeruli, indicating that CDRs function as signal platforms for AKT-mTORC1 pathway in podocytes to maintain the kidney function.

    "abstract": "Unravelling the mechanisms of action of disinfectants is essential to optimise dosing regimes and minimise the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. In this work, we examine the mechanisms of action of a commonly used disinfectant - benzalkonium chloride (BAC)-over a significant pathogen -L. monocytogenes- in the food industry. For that purpose, we use modelling at multiple scales, from the cell membrane to the cell population inactivation. Molecular modelling reveals that the integration of the BAC into the membrane requires three phases: (1) the BAC approaches the cellular membrane, (2) the BAC is adsorbed on its surface, and (3) it is rapidly integrated into the lipid bilayer, where it remains at least for several nanoseconds, probably destabilising the membrane. We hypothesise that the equilibrium of adsorption, although fast, is limiting for sufficiently large BAC concentrations, and a kinetic model is derived to describe time-kill curves of a large population of cells. The model is tested and validated with time series data of free BAC decay and time-kill curves of L. monocytogenes at different inocula and BAC dose concentrations. The knowledge gained from the molecular simulation plus the proposed kinetic model offers the means to design novel disinfection processes rationally.",

    "abstract": "In general, strategies for spatial navigation could employ one of two spatial reference frames: egocentric or allocentric. Notwithstanding intuitive explanations, it remains unclear however under what circumstances one strategy is chosen over another, and how neural representations should be related to the chosen strategy. Here, we first use a deep reinforcement learning model to investigate whether a particular type of navigation strategy arises spontaneously during spatial learning without imposing a bias onto the model. We then examine the spatial representations that emerge in the network to support navigation. To this end, we study two tasks that are ethologically valid for mammals - guidance, where the agent has to navigate to a goal location fixed in allocentric space, and aiming, where the agent navigates to a visible cue. We find that when both navigation strategies are available to the agent, the solutions it develops for guidance and aiming are heavily biased towards the allocentric or the egocentric strategy, respectively, as one might expect. Nevertheless, the agent can learn both tasks using either type of strategy. Furthermore, we find that place-cell-like allocentric representations emerge preferentially in guidance when using an allocentric strategy, whereas egocentric vector representations emerge when using an egocentric strategy in aiming. We thus find that alongside the type of navigational strategy, the nature of the task plays a pivotal role in the type of spatial representations that emerge.",

    "abstract": "Humans are born with very low contrast sensitivity, meaning that developing infants experience the world \"in a blur\". Is this solely a byproduct of maturational processes or is there some functional advantage for beginning life with poor vision? We explore whether reduced visual acuity as a consequence of low contrast sensitivity facilitates the acquisition of basic-level visual categories and, if so, whether this advantage also enhances subordinate-level category learning as visual acuity improves. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the ecoset dataset to simulate basic-level category learning, we manipulated model training curricula along three dimensions: presence of blurred inputs early in training, rate of blur removal over time, and grayscale versus color inputs. We found that a training regimen where blur starts high and is gradually reduced over time - as in human development - improves basic-level categorization performance relative to a regimen in which non-blurred inputs are used throughout. However, this pattern was observed only when grayscale images were used (analogous to the low sensitivity to color infants experience during early development). Importantly, the observed improvements in basic-level performance generalized to subordinate-level categorization as well: when models were fine-tuned on a dataset including subordinate-level categories (ImageNet), we found that models initially trained with blurred inputs showed a greater performance benefit than models trained solely on non-blurred inputs. Consistent with several other recent studies, we conclude that poor visual acuity in human newborns confers multiple advantages, including, as demonstrated here, more rapid and accurate acquisition of visual object categories at multiple hierarchical levels.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhy do humans start life with extremely poor vision? The common evolutionary story is that head size is small to accommodate the development of human-level intelligence. However, there is growing evidence that beginning life in a premature state confers short-term advantages. The \"starting small\" principle states that learning can be facilitated by restricted or impoverished inputs that reduce the learning complexity. We suggest that blurred vision during early development biases learning toward shape features, which organize objects naturally into \"basic-level\" categories that are the foundation of human cognition (e.g., birds, cars, etc.). Such categories are defined by their visual similarity in global object shape. Since blurring restricts visual inputs to emphasize shape information, it should enhance the learning of basic-level categories. We trained artificial neural-network models on basic-level categorization using either blurred or non-blurred color or grayscale images and found that models trained with blurred images outperformed models trained with non-blurred images, but only for grayscale. These same models performed better in subsequent \"subordinate-level\" tasks that required discriminating between objects within a basic-level category. Our simulations provide evidence that initially poor vision in infants has an important functional role in organizing knowledge about complex environments.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and spread of novel behaviours via social learning can lead to rapid population-level changes whereby the social connections between individuals shape information flow. However, behaviours can spread via different mechanisms and little is known about how information flow depends on the underlying learning rule individuals employ. Here, comparing four different learning mechanisms, we simulated behavioural spread on replicate empirical social networks of wild great tits and explored the relationship between individual sociality and the order of behavioural acquisition. Our results reveal that, for learning rules dependent on the sum and strength of social connections to informed individuals, social connectivity was related to the order of acquisition, with individuals with increased social connectivity and reduced social clustering adopting new behaviours faster. However, when behavioural adoption depends on the ratio of an individuals social connections to informed versus uninformed individuals, social connectivity was not related to the order of acquisition. Finally, we show how specific learning mechanisms may limit behavioural spread within networks. These findings have important implications for understanding whether and how behaviours are likely to spread across social systems, the relationship between individuals sociality and behavioural acquisition, and therefore for the costs and benefits of sociality.",

    "abstract": "A cluster of several newly occurring mutations on Omicron are found at the {beta}-core region of spike proteins receptor-binding domain (RBD), where mutation rarely happened before. Notably, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor ACE2 via RBD happens in a dynamic airway environment, where mechanical force caused by coughing or sneezing occurs and applies to the proteins. Thus, we used atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS) to measure the stability of RBDs and found that the mechanical stability of Omicron RBD increased by ~20% compared with the wild-type. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that Omicron RBD showed more hydrogen bonds in the {beta}-core region due to the closing of the -helical motif caused primarily by mutation S373P, which was further confirmed experimentally. Moreover, the binding ability of Omicron to ACE2 is promoted with a stabilized RBD. This work reveals the effect of the highly conserved mutation S373P which is present in most Omicron subvariants, including BA.1-5, BQ. 1, XBB, and CH.1.1.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining balance is thought to primarily occur sub-consciously. Occasionally, however, individuals will direct conscious attention towards balance, e.g., in response to a threat to balance. Such conscious movement processing (CMP) increases the reliance on attentional resources and may disrupt balance performance. However, the underlying changes in neuromuscular control remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of CMP (manipulated using verbal instructions) on neural control of posture in twenty-five adults (11 females, mean age = 23.9, range = 18-33). Participants performed 90-second, bipedal stance balance trials in high- and low-CMP conditions, during both stable (solid surface) and unstable (foam) task conditions. Postural sway amplitude, frequency and complexity were used to assess postural control. Surface EMG was recorded bilaterally from lower leg muscles (Soleus, Tibialis Anterior, Gastrocnemius Medialis, Peroneus Longus) and intermuscular coherence (IMC) was assessed for 12 muscle pairs across four frequency bands. We observed significantly increased sway amplitude, and decreased sway frequency and complexity in the high- compared to the low-CMP conditions. All sway variables increased in the unstable compared to the stable conditions. We observed reduced beta band IMC between several muscle pairs during high- compared to low-CMP, but these findings did not remain significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally, IMC significantly increased in the unstable conditions for most muscle combinations and frequency bands. In all, results tentatively suggest that CMP-induced changes in sway outcomes may be facilitated by reduced beta-band IMC, but these findings need to be replicated before they can be interpreted more conclusively.",

ASCs matured into two terminal clusters, with distinct secretion, antibody repertoire and metabolic profiles. MemBs contained FCRL5+ and CD23+ subsets, with different in vivo localization in the spleen.

    "abstract": "Eight percent of all land surface has been designated as \"Key Biodiversity Areas\" (KBAs). Since these areas were established based on only two percent of all terrestrial species estimated to exist, we ask what would happen if we used all species on Earth to identify additional KBAs. We explore this question at a global scale by using data from 64,110 species of animals and plants to identify how many areas could qualify as KBAs under current criteria. We find that between 26% and 68% of the worlds terrestrial areas can be classified as KBAs, depending on the spatial resolution. The total area from potential KBAs increases drastically as more species are assessed, suggesting that if all species were included, virtually all land surface could eventually meet the biological requirements for becoming a KBA. In addition, KBAs lack a data-driven ranking system, thus assuming that all KBAs are equally worthy protection. KBAs are intended to be areas which are both of biological importance and manageable but the current approach largely sidesteps the biological component. We make an urgent call for stricter criteria in the KBA methodology or alternative methodologies that allow for biologically robust area prioritization, help secure evidence-based investments, and support progress towards the targets under the new Global Biodiversity Framework.",

By analysing >500 PC transcriptomes, we reveal that HNRNPA2B1 over-expression is associated with poor patient prognosis and stress response pathways. These include the \"protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum\" (ER) pathway, which incorporates the unfolded protein response (UPR). By RNA-sequencing of HNRNPA2B1-depleted cells PC cells, we identified HNRNPA2B1-mediated down-regulation of UPR genes including the master ER-stress sensor IRE1, which induces ER proteostasis. Consistent with IRE1 down-regulation in HNRNPA2B1-depleted cells, we observed reduced splicing of the IRE1-target and key UPR effector XBP1s. Furthermore, HNRNPA2B1 depletion up-regulates expression of the IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) target gene BLOC1S1, which is degraded by activated IRE1. We identify a HNRNPA2B1-IRE1-XBP1-controlled four gene prognostic biomarker signature (HIX) which classifies a subgroup of primary PC patients at high risk of disease relapse. Pharmacological targeting of IRE1 attenuated HNRNAPA2-driven PC cell growth. Taken together, our data reveal a putative novel mechanism of UPR activation in PC by HNRNPA2B1, which may promote an IRE1-dependent yet potentially-targetable recurrent disease phenotype.",

Experimental proof of a dimensionality reduction requires an exhaustive mapping of all relevant combinations of several environmental parameters, which we performed for Caenorhabditis elegans foraging by covering all combinations of food density (across 4 orders of magnitude) and food type (across 12 bacterial strains). We found a one-dimensional rule: Worms respond to food density measured as number of bacteria per unit surface, disregarding other factors such as biomass content or bacterial strain. We also measured fitness experimentally, determining that the rule is near-optimal and therefore constitutes a rule of thumb that leverages the most informative environmental variable.",

Molecular tools used for investigating ONOO- reactivity in biological membranes remain underdeveloped, available probes lack the ability of subcellular localization, and the standard methods for detecting ONOO- in vivo are indirect. Here we investigated ONOO- in diverse lipid environments (biomimetic giant vesicles, live mammalian cells, and within the lung lining) using a biocompatible and membrane-localized phospholipid named DPPC-TC-ONOO-. This designer lipid and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine self-assemble to giant vesicles that respond to ONOO- by generating fluorescence. These vesicles remain intact after sensing ONOO- and exhibit excellent selectivity against other redox species. We delivered DPPC-TC-ONOO- into live HeLa and RAW cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Cytokine-induced nitrative stress led to enhanced fluorescence of the lipid clusters, primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum. These LNPs allowed the detection of ONOO- reactivity and nitrative stress around bronchioles within precision cut lung slices in response to acute lung injury (ALI). Furthermore, the use of the LNPs allowed for the detection of pulmonary macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage following ALI in C57BL6/J but not in Nos2-/- mice. These investigations revealed significant advantages of DPPC-TC-ONOO- over its non-amphiphilic analog. Our work presents (i) an unprecedented function for biomimetic membranes, (ii) the potential of LNPs for delivering designer lipids into cells and tissues, (iii) real-time imaging of endogenous ONOO- at the organelle level in mammalian cells, and (iv) a direct method of studying nitrative stress due to ALI ex vivo and in vivo.",

Laccases are attractive enzymes for green-chemistry applications due to their broad substrate range and low environmental impact. Since expression of functional recombinant HRPLs is challenging, however, iterative directed evolution protocols have been applied to improve their expression, activity and stability. We implement a rational, stabilize-and-diversify strategy to two HRPLs that we could not functionally express: first, we use the PROSS stability-design algorithm to allow functional expression in yeast. Second, we use the stabilized enzymes as starting points for FuncLib active-site design to improve their activity and substrate diversity. Four of the FuncLib designed HRPLs and their PROSS progenitor exhibit substantial diversity in reactivity profiles against high-redox potential substrates, including lignin monomers. Combinations of 3-4 subtle mutations that change the polarity, solvation and sterics of the substrate-oxidation site result in orders of magnitude changes in reactivity profiles. These stable and versatile HRPLs are a step towards the generation of an effective lignin-degrading consortium of enzymes that can be secreted from yeast. More broadly, the stabilize-and-diversify strategy can be applied to other challenging enzyme families to study and expand the utility of natural enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can interrogate changes in structure and/or concentration of the most abundant proteins in a biological sample via heat denaturation curves (HDCs). In blood serum for example, HDC changes are a result of either concentration or altered thermal stabilities for 7-10 proteins and has previously been shown capable of differentiating between sick and healthy human subjects. Here, we compare HDCs and proteomic profiles of 50 patients experiencing joint-inflammatory symptoms, 27 of which were clinically diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The HDC of all 50 subjects appeared significantly different from expected healthy curves, but comparison of additional differences between the RA the non-RA subjects allowed more specific understanding of RA samples. We used mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the reasons behind the additional HDC changes in RA patients. The HDC differences do not appear to be directly related to differences in the concentrations of abundant serum proteins. Rather, the differences can be attributed to modified thermal stability of the most abundant protein, human serum albumin (HSA). By quantifying differences in the frequency of artificially induced post translational modifications (PTMs), we found that HSA in RA subjects had a much lower surface accessibility, indicating potential ligand or protein binding partners in certain regions that could explain the shift in HSA melting temperature in the RA HDCs. Several low abundance proteins were found to have significant changes in concentration in RA subjects and could be involved in or related to binding of HSA. Certain amino acid sites clusters were found to be less accessible in RA subjects, suggesting changes in HSA structure that may be related to changes in protein-protein interactions. These results all support a change in behavior of HSA which may give insight into mechanisms of RA pathology.",

    "abstract": "Members from the Inoviridae family with striking features are widespread, highly diverse and ecologically pervasive across multiple hosts and environments; however, very small amount of inoviruses have been isolated and studied. Here, a filamentous phage infecting Alteromonas abrolhosensis, designated {phi}AFP1, was isolated from the South China Sea and represented as a novel genus of Inoviridae. {phi}AFP1 consisted of a single-stranded DNA genome (5986 bp), encoding eight putative ORFs. Comparative analyses revealed {phi}AFP1 could be regarded as genetic mosaics, which especially came from Ralstonia and Stenotrophomonas phages. The temporal transcriptome analysis of A. abrolhosensis to {phi}AFP1 infection reveals that 7.78% of the host genes were differentially expressed. The genes involved in translation processes, ribosome pathways and degradation of multiple amino acid pathways at plateau period were upregulated, while host material catabolic and bacterial motility-related genes were downregulated, indicating that {phi}AFP1 might hijack the energy of the host for the synthesis of phage proteins. {phi}AFP1 exerted the step-by-step control on host genes through the appropriate level of the utilizing host resources, affirming a new non-standard regulatory strategy of viral temperately control over the host transcriptional profile. Our study provides novel information for a better understanding of filamentous phage characteristics and phage-host interactions.",

    "abstract": "Disinfection is an important strategy to limit the spread of infections. Failure of disinfection may facilitate evolution of resistance against disinfectants and antibiotics through the processes of cross-resistance and co-resistance. The best possible outcome of disinfection minimizes the number of surviving bacteria and the chance for resistance evolution. Resistance describes the ability to grow in previously inhibitory concentrations of an antimicrobial, whereas tolerance is associated with enhanced survival of lethal doses. Individual bacteria from the same population can display considerable heterogeneity in their ability to survive treatment (i.e. tolerance) with antimicrobials, which can result in unexpected treatment failure. Here, we investigated how phenotypic heterogeneity affects the ability of E. coli to survive treatment with six different substances commonly used as active substances in disinfectants, preservatives and antiseptics. A mathematical model which assumes that phenotypic heterogeneity underlies the observed disinfection kinetics was used to infer whether time-kill kinetics were caused by a tolerant subpopulation. The analysis identified bimodal kill kinetics for benzalkonium chloride (BAC), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), and isopropanol (Iso). In contrast, kill kinetics by chlorhexidine (CHX), glutaraldehyde (GTA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were best explained by unimodal kill kinetics underpinned by a broad distribution of tolerance times for CHX as opposed to a narrow distribution of tolerance times for GTA and H2O2. These findings have implications for the risk of disinfection failure, with potential consequences for the evolution of antimicrobial resistance and tolerance.",

However, E3-to-target wiring is poorly understood. The limited number of SUMO E3s provides the unique opportunity to systematically study E3-substrate wiring. We developed SUMO Activated Target Traps (SATTs) and systematically identified substrates for eight different SUMO E3s, PIAS1, PIAS2, PIAS3, PIAS4, NSMCE2, ZNF451, LAZSUL(ZNF451-3) and ZMIZ2. SATTs enabled us to identify 590 SUMO1 and 1195 SUMO2/3 targets in an E3-specific manner. We found pronounced E3 substrate preference, even at the substrate isoform level. Quantitative proteomics enabled us to measure substrate specificity of E3s, quantified using the SATT index. Furthermore, we developed the Polar SATTs web-based tool (https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/PolaRVolcaNoseR/) to browse the dataset in an interactive manner, increasing the accessibility of this resource for the community.

    "abstract": "Herein, we developed a single and a duplex TaqMan quantitative qPCR for absolute quantification of copy numbers of integrated dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (mdhfr-ts) drug selectable marker for pyrimethamine resistance in Toxoplasma gondii knockouts (KOs). The single TaqMan qPCR amplifies a 174 bp DNA fragment of the inserted mdhfr-ts and of the wild-type (WT) dhfr-ts (wt-dhfr-ts) which is present as single copy gene in Toxoplasma and encodes a sensitive enzyme to pyrimethamine. Thus, the copy number of the dhfr-ts fragment in a given DNA quantity from KO parasites with a single site-specific integration should be twice the number of dhfr-ts copies recorded in the same DNA quantity from WT parasites. The duplex TaqMan qPCR allows simultaneous amplification of the 174 bp dhfr-ts fragment and the T. gondii 529-bp repeat element. Accordingly, for a WT DNA sample, the determined number of tachyzoites given by dhfr-ts amplification is equal to the number of tachyzoites determined by amplification of the Toxoplasma 529-bp, resulting thus in a ratio of 1. However, for a KO clone having a single site-specific integration of mdhfr-ts, the calculated ratio is 2. We then applied both approaches to test T. gondii RH mutants in which the major surface antigen (SAG1) was disrupted through insertion of mdhfr-ts using CRISPR-Cas9. Results from both assays were in correlation showing a high accuracy in detecting KOs with multiple integrated mdhfr-ts. Southern blot analyses using BsaBI and DraIII confirmed qPCRs results. Both TaqMan qPCRs are needed for reliable diagnostic of T. gondii KOs following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis, particularly with respect to off-target effects resulting from multiple insertions of mdhfr-ts. The principle of the duplex TaqMan qPCR is applicable for other selectable markers in Toxoplasma. TaqMan qPCR tools may contribute to more frequent use of WT Toxoplasma strains during functional genomics.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses including dengue and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), but in contrast to human hosts, arbovirus infected mosquitoes are able to efficiently control virus replication to sub-pathological levels. Yet, our knowledge about the molecular interactions of arboviruses with their mosquito hosts is largely incomplete. Here, we aimed to identify and characterize novel host genes that control arbovirus replication in Aedes mosquitoes. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are well known to regulate immune signaling pathways in all kingdoms of life. We therefore performed a knockdown screen targeting 461 genes encoding predicted RBPs in Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells and identified 15 genes with antiviral activity against a Sindbis reporter virus. Amongst these, three DEAD-box RNA helicases, AAEL004419/Dhx15, AAEL008728 and AAEL004859 also acted as antiviral factors in dengue and CHIKV infections. Here, we explore the mechanism of Dhx15 in regulating an antiviral transcriptional response in mosquitoes by silencing Dhx15 in Aag2 cells followed by deep-sequencing of poly-A enriched RNAs. Dhx15 knockdown in uninfected or CHIKV-infected cells resulted in differential expression of 856 and 372 genes, respectively. Interestingly, amongst the consistently downregulated genes, glycolytic process was the most strongly enriched GO term as the expression of all core enzymes of the glycolytic pathway was reduced, suggesting that Dhx15 regulates glycolytic function. A decrease in lactate production supported the observation that Dhx15 silencing functionally impaired glycolysis. Modified rates of glycolytic metabolism have been implicated in controlling the replication of several classes of viruses and strikingly, infection of Aag2 cells with CHIKV by itself also resulted in the decrease of several glycolysis genes. Our data suggests that Dhx15 regulates replication of CHIKV, and possibly other arboviruses, by controlling glycolysis in mosquito cells.",

We previously demonstrated that satellite cells efficiently and accurately repair radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via the DNA-dependent kinase DNA-PKcs. We show here that DNA-PKcs affects myogenesis independently of its role in DSB repair. Consequently, this process does not require the accumulation of DSBs and it is also independent of caspase-induced DNA damage. We report that in myogenic cells DNA-PKcs is essential for the expression of the differentiation factor Myogenin in an Akt2-dependent manner. DNA-PKcs interacts with the p300-containing complex that activates Myogenin transcription. We show also that SCID mice that are deficient in DNA-PKcs, and are used for transplantation and muscle regeneration studies, display altered myofiber composition and delayed myogenesis upon injury. These defects are exacerbated after repeated injury/regeneration events resulting in reduced muscle size. We thus identify a novel regulator of myogenic differentiation, and define a differentiation phase that does not involve the DNA damage/repair process.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces are prolific producers of specialized metabolites with applications in medicine and agriculture. These bacteria possess a large linear chromosome genetically compartmentalized: core genes are grouped in the central part, while terminal regions are populated by poorly conserved genes and define the chromosomal arms. In exponentially growing cells, chromosome conformation capture unveiled sharp boundaries formed by ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons that segment the chromosome into multiple domains. The first and last rrn operons delimit the highly expressed central compartment and the rather transcriptionally silent terminal compartments. Here we further explore the link between the genetic distribution of rrn operons and Streptomyces genomic compartmentalization. A large panel of genomes of species representative of the genus diversity revealed that rrn operons and core genes form a central skeleton, the former being identifiable from their core gene environment. We implemented a new nomenclature for Streptomyces genomes and trace their rrn-based evolutionary history. Remarkably, rrn operons are close to pericentric inversions. Moreover, the central compartment delimited by rrn operons has a very dense, nearly invariant core gene content. Finally, this compartment harbors genes with the highest expression levels, regardless of gene persistence and distance to the origin of replication. Our results highlight that rrn operons define the structural boundaries of a central functional compartment prone to transcription in Streptomyces.",

DNA and RNA-binding trans-acting factors regulating the extent of pausing have been identified. However, we lack a quantitative model of how interactions of these factors determine pausing, therefore the relative importance of implicated factors is unknown. Moreover, previously unknown regulators might exist. Here we address this gap with a machine learning model that accurately predicts the extent of promoter proximal Pol II pausing from large scale genome and transcriptome binding maps, as well as gene annotation and sequence composition features. We demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability of the model by validation on an independent cell line which reveals the models cell line agnostic character. Model interpretation in light of prior knowledge about molecular functions of regulatory factors confirms the interconnection of pausing with other RNA processing steps. Harnessing underlying feature contributions we assess the relative importance of each factor, quantify their predictive effects and systematically identify previously unknown regulators of pausing. We additionally identify 16 previously unknown 7SK ncRNA interacting RNA-binding proteins predictive of pausing.

Advances in genomics have highlighted the importance of non-coding regulatory genome sequences controlling spatiotemporal gene expression patterns and splicing to human diseases. It is thus apparent that including regulatory genomic regions during the engineering of GEMMs is highly preferable for disease modeling, with the prerequisite of large-scale genome engineering ability. Existing genome engineering methods have limits on the size and efficiency of DNA delivery, hampering routine creation of highly informative GEMMs. Here, we describe mSwAP-In (mammalian Switching Antibiotic resistance markers Progressively for Integration), a method for efficient genome rewriting in mouse embryonic stem cells. We first demonstrated the use of mSwAP-In for iterative genome rewriting of up to 115 kb of the Trp53 locus, as well as for genomic humanization of up to 180 kb ACE2 locus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we showed the hACE2 GEMM authentically recapitulated human ACE2 expression patterns and splicing, and importantly, presented milder symptoms without mortality when challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the K18-ACE2 model, thus representing a more authentic model of infection.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica is able to establish persistent infections, evading antibiotics and the host immune system and providing a reservoir for recrudescence and transmission to new hosts. Non-typhoidal serovars (NTS) of S. enterica can establish and maintain symptomatic and asymptomatic long term human infections that may predispose carriers to inflammatory bowel diseases and cancer. Defining the adaptations and host-pathogen interactions enabling these persistent infections is key to devising more effective strategies to combat and prevent persistent bacterial infections. Using comparative genomics of 639 Salmonella NTS isolates belonging to 49 serovars that were longitudinally obtained from 256 salmonelosis patients during different stages of infection, we identified numerous genetic variations accruing over time in strains isolated from the same patient. Many of these changes were found in the same gene across multiple patients and serovars. Among these variant loci, genes encoding global transcriptional regulators were found to be the most commonly mutated between early and late same-patient isolates. Genetic changes in the SirA/BarA two-component regulatory system were particularly frequent, with mutations identified in 24 independent patients. Comparative RNA-Seq analysis revealed that distinct mutations in sirA/barA that arose independently in late isolates of multiple patients lead to significantly diminished expression of virulence-associated genes encoded in the Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs) 1 and 4, many of which are known to be critical for host cell invasion and the production of enteritis. Using the salmonellosis mouse model we showed that these mutations in sirA/barA genes confer attenuated virulence in-vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that selection of mutations in the SirA/BarA pathway facilitates persistent Salmonella infection in humans, possibly by attenuating Salmonella virulence and its ability to cause inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Pseudocereals are best known for three crops derived from the Andes: quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa, Chenopods I), canihua (C. pallidicaule, Chenopods I), and kiwicha (Amaranthus caudatus). Their grains are recognized for their nutritional benefits; however, there is a higher level of polyphenism and the chemical foundation that would rely with such polyphenism has not been thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the chemical food safety of pseudocereals remains poorly documented. Here we applied untargeted and targeted metabolomics approach by LC-MS to achieve both: i) a comprehensive chemical mapping of pseudocereal samples collected in the Andes to classify them according to their chemotype; ii) a quantification of their contents in emerging mycotoxins. An inventory of the fungal community was also realized with the aims to better know the filamentous fungi present in these grains and try to parallel this information with the presence of the molecules produced, especially mycotoxins. Metabotyping permitted to add new insights into the chemotaxonomy of pseudocereals, confirming the previously established phylotranscriptomic clades: Chenopods I (clusters quinoa and canihua), and Amaranthaceae s.s. (cluster kiwicha). Moreover, we report for the first time the presence of mycotoxins in pseudocereals. Sixteen samples of Peru (out of 27) and one sample from France (out of one) were contaminated with Beauvericin, an emerging mycotoxin. There were several mycotoxigenic fungi detected, including Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., and Alternaria sp., but not Fusaria.\n\nHighlights{blacksquare} Twenty-seven grain samples of Andean pseudocereals were profiled by LC-HRMS.\n{blacksquare}Untargeted metabolomics was used to differentiate varieties from the whole metabolome dataset.\n{blacksquare}Five mycotoxins were quantify using targeted metabolomics.\n{blacksquare}Sixteen samples of Peru and one sample from France were contaminated with Beauvericin.\n{blacksquare}An inventory of the fungal community infesting the Andean pseudocereal samples was documented.",

    "abstract": "Though P-loop fold nucleoside triphosphatases (also known as Walker NTPases) are widespread, their catalytic mechanism remains unclear. Based on a comparative structure analysis of 3136 Mg-NTP-containing catalytic sites, we propose a common scheme of activated catalysis for P-loop NTPases. In this scheme, a hydrogen bond (H-bond) between the strictly conserved, Mg-coordinating Ser/Thr of the Walker A motif ([Ser/Thr]WA) and the conserved aspartate of the Walker B motif (AspWB) plays the key role. We found that this H-bond is very short in the structures with bound transition state analogs. Given that a short hydrogen bond (also known as a low-barrier hydrogen bond) implies parity of pK values of the H-bond partners, we suggest that the proton affinities of these two residues reverse upon activation so that the proton relocates from [Ser/Thr]WA to AspWB. The anionic [Ser/Thr]WA alkoxide withdraws then a proton from the would-be nucleophile (either a water molecule or a sugar moiety in some P-loop kinases), and the nascent anion attacks the gamma-phosphate group. When gamma-phosphate breaks away, the trapped proton relays from AspWB, via [Ser/Thr]WA, to beta-phosphate and compensates for its developing negative charge.",

    "abstract": "In ubiquitous P-loop fold nucleoside triphosphatases (also known as Walker NTPases), hydrolysis of ATP or GTP is initiated by interaction with an activating partner (usually another protein domain), which is accompanied by insertion of stimulatory moiety(ies) (usually arginine or lysine residues) into the catalytic site. After inspecting over 3600 Mg-NTP-containing structures of P-loop NTPases, we identified those with stimulator(s) inserted into catalytic sites and analysed the patterns of stimulatory interactions. In most cases, at least one stimulator twists gamma-phosphate counter-clockwise by linking the oxygen atoms of alpha- and gamma-phosphates; the twisted gamma-phosphate is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the backbone amino group of the fourth residue of the Walker A motif. In the remaining cases, the stimulators only interact with gamma-phosphate. The ubiquitous mechanistic interaction of diverse stimulators with the gamma phosphate group suggests its twist/rotation as the trigger for NTP hydrolysis.",

    "abstract": "Native molecular weight (MW) is one of the defining features of proteins. Denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a very popular technique for separating proteins and determining their MW. Coupled with antibody-based detection, SDS-PAGE is widely applied for protein identification and quantitation. Yet, electrophoresis is poorly reproducible and the MWs obtained are often inaccurate. This hampers antibody validation and negatively impacts the reliability of western blot data, resulting worldwide in a considerable waste of reagents and labour. To alleviate these problems there is a need to establish a database of reference MWs measured by SDS-PAGE. Using mass spectrometry as an orthogonal detection method, we acquired electrophoretic migration patterns for approximately 10000 human proteins in five commonly used cell lines. We applied a robust internal calibration of migration to determine accurate and reproducible molecular weights. This in turn allows merging replicates to increase accuracy, but also enables comparing different cell lines. Mining of the data obtained highlights structural factors that affect migration of distinct classes of proteins. We also show that the information produced recapitulates known post-translational modifications and differential splicing and can be used to formulate hypotheses on new or poorly known processing events. The full information is freely accessible as a web resource through a user friendly graphical interface (https://pumba.dcsr.unil.ch/). We anticipate that this database will be useful to investigators worldwide for troubleshooting western blot experiments, but could also contribute to the characterization of human proteoforms.",

    "abstract": "Cell culture at liquid-liquid interfaces, for example at the surface of oil microdroplets, is an attractive strategy to scale up adherent cell manufacturing whilst replacing the use of microplastics. Such process requires the adhesion of cells at interfaces stabilized and reinforced by protein nanosheets displaying high elasticity, but also presenting cell adhesive ligands able to bind integrin receptors. In this report, supercharged albumins are found to form strong elastic protein nanosheets and mediate extracellular matrix (ECM) protein adsorption and cell adhesion. The interfacial mechanical properties and elasticity of supercharged nanosheets is characterized by interfacial rheology and behaviors are compared to those of native bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin and -lactalbumin. ECM protein adsorption to resulting supercharged nanosheets is then quantified via surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating the dual role supercharged albumins are proposed to play, as scaffold proteins structuring liquid-liquid interfaces and substrates for the capture of ECM molecules. Finally, the adhesion and proliferation of primary human epidermal stem cells is investigated, at pinned droplets, as well as on bioemulsions stabilized by corresponding supercharged nanosheets. This study demonstrates the potential of supercharged proteins for the engineering of biointerfaces for stem cell manufacturing, and draws structure-property relationships that will guide further engineering of associated systems.",

    "abstract": "Malaria, spread by the female Anopheles mosquito, is a highly fatal disease widespread in many parts of the world, causing 0.4 million deaths globally. Vital gene expressions form the basis in the detection of malaria infection levels. Quantification of malaria parasite infected RBCs and classification of its life cycle stages are done at macroscopic level by experts, for making informed decisions. Off late multiple computational approaches have been proposed to circumvent the problem of dimensionality leading to accurate predicted results. In this work a dimensionality reduction technique based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied on P. falciparum single-cell transcriptomics to arrive at an optimized subset of features from the larger dataset. Features are chosen based on their class variants considering increased efficiency and accuracy, to separately transform the selected elements into a lower dimension. For the classification of the life cycle of malaria parasite based on single cell transcriptome data, a three-pronged approach employing the multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) techniques is used. Distribution of cells was visualised and mapped using the R-based Seurat package. Further, we constructed protein interaction networks of the genes identified by the feature selection method and elucidated the role of the proteins in progression of the parasite through its life cycle. Our approach presents a novel protocol to implement ML techniques on scRNA seq datasets and subsequently harnessing the extracted information for biomarker/drug target detection.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid protein fibrils and some antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) share biophysical and structural properties. This observation suggests that ordered self-assembly can act as an AMP-regulating mechanism, and, vice versa, that human amyloids play a role in host defense against pathogens, as opposed to their common association with neurodegenerative and systemic diseases. Based on previous structural information on toxic amyloid peptides, we developed a sequence-based bioinformatics platform and, led by its predictions, experimentally identified 14 fibril-forming AMPs (ffAMPs) from living organisms, which demonstrated cross-{beta} and cross- amyloid properties. The results support the amyloid-antimicrobial link. The high prevalence of ffAMPs produced by amphibians and marine creatures among other species suggests that they confer unique advantageous properties in distinctive environments, potentially providing stability and adherence properties. Most of the newly identified 14 ffAMPs showed lipid-induced and/or time-dependent secondary structure transitions in the fibril form, indicating structural and functional cross-/{beta} chameleons. Specifically, ffAMP cytotoxicity against human cells correlated with inherent or lipid-induced -helical fibril structure. The findings raise hypotheses about the role of fibril secondary structure switching in regulation of processes, such as the transition between a stable storage conformation and an active state with toxicity against specific cell types.",

Utilising the DNA origami technique, various DNA constructs can be designed, ranging from single tiles to the self-assembly of large-scale complex multi-tile arrays.

In this study, we demonstrate real-time, non-destructive and label-free fingerprinting of higher-order assemblies of DNA origami nanostructures using solid-state nanopores. Using this approach, we quantify the assembly yields for each DNA origami nanostructure with single-entity resolution using the nanostructure-induced charge introduced in the nanopore as a discriminant. We compare the assembly yield of the supramolecular DNA nanostructures obtained with the nanopore with agarose gel electrophoresis and AFM imaging and demonstrate that the nanopore system can provide enhanced information about the nanostructures. We envision that this nanopore detection platform can be applied to a range of nanomaterial designs and enable the analysis and manipulation of large DNA assemblies in real-time with single-molecule resolution.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe demonstrate a single molecule high-throughput approach for the analysis of higher-order DNA origami assemblies with a crowded nanopore.

We and others have demonstrated that induction of cellular senescence and its accompanying senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) can be an effective approach to activate not only T cell but also cytotoxic Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Here we found that the pancreas tumor microenvironment (TME) suppresses NK and T cell surveillance following therapy-induced senescence through EZH2-mediated repression of pro-inflammatory SASP genes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 or its methyltransferase activity stimulated the production of pro-inflammatory SASP chemokines CCL2 and CXCL9/10 that led to enhanced NK and T cell infiltration and tumor eradication in preclinical PDAC mouse models. EZH2 activity was also associated with suppression of SASP-associated inflammatory chemokines and cytotoxic lymphocyte immunity and reduced overall survival in a PDAC patient cohort. These results demonstrate that EZH2 mediates epigenetic repression of the pro-inflammatory SASP in the pancreas TME, and that EZH2 blockade in combination with senescence-inducing therapies could be a powerful means to potentiate NK and T cell surveillance in PDAC to achieve immune-mediated tumor control.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of T cell activity is an effective strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, immune-related disorders and cancer. This highlights a critical need for continued investigation of proteins that regulate T cell function. The kinase DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is emerging as a potent regulator of the immune system spurring interest in its use as a therapeutic target for immune-related diseases. In murine models of autoimmune disease including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with small molecule DNA-PKcs inhibitors, which are in clinical trials for cancer therapy, decreased disease severity. Additionally, DNA-PKcs inhibitors reduced T cell-mediated graft rejection and extended graft survival in a murine allogenic skin graft rejection model. These in vivo studies suggest the therapeutic use of DNA-PKcs inhibitors for autoimmune and T cell-mediated disorders. In this study, we sought to further characterize the effects of DNA-PKcs inhibitors on T cells to better understand their clinical potential. We determined that pharmacological inhibition of DNA-PKcs abrogated activation of murine and human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as evident by reduced expression of the activation markers CD69 and CD25. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA-PKcs impeded metabolic pathways and proliferation of anti-CD3/CD28 activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as peptide-stimulated OTI-CD8+ T cells. This reduced the ability of OTI-CD8+ T cells to kill cancer cells and the expression of IFN{gamma} and the cytotoxic genes eomes, perforin and granzyme B. These results suggest a novel role for DNA-PKcs in early T cell activation. Furthermore, our data support the therapeutic potential of DNA-PKcs inhibitors on diseases of immune dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome is the main microtubule organizing center of the cell and is crucial for mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Centrosome duplication is tightly controlled, yet several pathogens, most notably oncogenic viruses, perturb this process leading to increased centrosome numbers. Infection by the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis (C.t.) correlates with blocked cytokinesis, supernumerary centrosomes, and multipolar spindles; however, the mechanisms behind how C.t. induces these cellular abnormalities from the confines of its inclusion, remain largely unknown. Here we show that the type III secreted effector protein, CteG, binds to centrin-2 (CETN2), a key structural component of centrosomes and regulator of centriole duplication. This interaction requires a functional calcium binding EF hand 4 of CETN2, which is recognized via the C-terminus of CteG. Significantly, we show that deletion of CteG, or knockdown of CETN2, significantly impairs chlamydias ability to induce centrosome amplification. Uniquely, we have identified the first bacterial effector to target centrins, crucial regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle. These findings have not only allowed us to begin addressing how C.t. induces gross cellular abnormalities during infection, but also indicate that obligate intracellular bacteria may contribute to cellular transformation events that negatively impact host physiology even when the pathogen is long removed. Understanding the consequences of CteG-CETN2 interactions, its impact on centrosome amplification, and the long-term effect this has on host cells could explain why chlamydial infection leads to an increased risk of cervical or ovarian cancer.\n\nSignificance StatementThe presence of more than two centrosomes is a hallmark of many types of cancer, including cervical and ovarian cancers of which Chlamydia trachomatis (C.t.) infection is a significant risk factor. Despite the importance of this problem, how C.t. orchestrates these drastic changes in the host cell remains poorly understood. Here, we describe how C.t. uses a single effector protein, CteG, to drive centrosome amplification via manipulation of a key regulator of centriole duplication, centrin-2. This work begins to define how C.t. induces centrosome amplification to promote its replication while potentially contributing to devastating long-term negative consequences for normal host physiology. Further it may help elucidate why chlamydial infection leads to an increased cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "Precision oncology programs can rapidly identify oncogenic gene fusions in individual patients1-3. However, despite their established oncogenic status, the vast majority of gene fusions remain  undruggable due to the lack of specific inhibitory molecules4, 5. Here, we establish PspCas13b, a poorly characterized programmable RNA nuclease, as a versatile tool to silence various oncogenic fusion transcripts. Our Single-Base Tiled crRNA screens (SiBTil), unbiased computational analysis, and comprehensive spacer-target mutagenesis revealed key determinants of PspCas13b activity. De novo design of crRNAs harbouring basepaired or mismatched guanosine bases at key spacer positions greatly enhances the silencing efficacy of otherwise inefficient crRNAs, expanding the targeting spectrum of this enzyme. We also reveal the interface between mismatch tolerance and intolerance, which unlocks an unexpected single-base precision targeting capability of this RNA nuclease. Notably, our de novo design principles enable potent and selective silencing of various gene fusion transcripts and their downstream oncogenic networks, without off-targeting of non-translocated variants that share extensive sequence homology. We demonstrate that PspCas13b targeting the breakpoint of fusion transcripts enables efficient suppression of ancestral and single-nucleotide mutants (e.g. BCR-ABL1 T315I) that often drive clinical cancer relapse. Collectively, this study provides new design principles for PspCas13b programming to specifically recognise and degrade any  undruggable fusion oncogenic transcript, thus providing a new conceptual framework for personalized oncology.",

    "abstract": "Secreted proteins, which include cytokines, hormones and growth factors, are extracellular ligands that control key signaling pathways mediating cell-cell communication within and between tissues and organs. Many drugs target secreted ligands and their cell-surface receptors. Still, there are hundreds of secreted human proteins that either have no identified receptors (\"orphans\") and are likely to act through cell surface receptors that have not yet been characterized. Discovery of secreted ligand-receptor interactions by high-throughput screening has been problematic, because the most commonly used high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening do not work well for extracellular interactions. Cell-based screening is a promising technology for definition of new ligand-receptor interactions, because multimerized ligands can enrich for cells expressing low affinity cell-surface receptors, and such methods do not require purification of receptor extracellular domains. Here, we present a proteo-genomic cell-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) enrichment screening platform employing customized pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with a magnetic bead selection-based enrichment workflow for rapid, parallel ligand-receptor deorphanization. We curated 80 potentially high value orphan secreted proteins and ultimately screened 20 secreted ligands against two cell sgRNA libraries with targeted expression of all single-pass (TM1) or multi-pass (TM2+) receptors by CRISPRa. We identified previously unknown interactions in 12 of these screens, and validated several of them using surface plasmon resonance and/or cell binding. The newly deorphanized ligands include three receptor tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ligands and a chemokine like protein that binds to killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs). These new interactions provide a resource for future investigations of interactions between the human secreted and membrane proteomes.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous virus elements (EVEs) are viral-derived sequences integrated into their host genomes. EVEs of the Jingchuvirales order were detected in a wide range of insect genomes covering several distantly related families and Jingchuvirales-derived glycoproteins were recently associated by our group with the origin of a putative new retrovirus based on a glycoprotein captured by a mosquito retrotransposon. But, except for mosquitoes, there is a lack of a more detailed understanding of the endogenization mechanism, timing and frequency per viral lineages. Here we screened Jingchuvirales glycoprotein-derived EVEs (Jg-EVEs) in eukaryotic genomes. We found six distinct endogenization events of Jg-EVEs, that belong to two out of five known Jingchuvirales families (Chuviridae and Natareviridae). For seven arthropod families bearing Jg-EVEs there is no register of bona fide circulating chuvirus infection. Hence, our results show that Jingchuvirales viruses infected or still infect these host families, expanding their known host range. We estimated that two endogenization events occurred in the ancestors of the Myrmicinae-Ponerinae subfamilies (Pteromalidae - Hymenoptera order) around 155[~]54.8 MyA and Bombus genus (Hemiptera order) around (36[~]2 MyA). Although we found abundant evidence of LTR-Gypsy retrotransposons fragments associated with the glycoprotein in Hymenoptera and other insect orders, there is no evidence of potential functional glycoprotein capture. Our results show that the widespread distribution of Jingchuvirales glycoproteins in extant Arhtropods is a result of multiple ancient endogenization events and that these viruses fossils are being vertically inherited for millions of years through the Arthropods evolutionary tree.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/497255v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@194f47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a3dd24org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b77bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e21ffb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The history of Earths carbon cycle reflects trends in atmospheric composition convolved with the evolution of photosynthesis. Fortunately, key parts of the carbon cycle have been recorded in the carbon isotope ratios of sedimentary rocks. The dominant model used to interpret this record as a proxy for ancient atmospheric CO2 is based on carbon isotope fractionations of modern photoautotrophs, and longstanding questions remain about how their evolution might have impacted the record. We tested the intersection of environment and evolution by measuring both biomass ({varepsilon}p) and enzymatic ({varepsilon}Rubisco) carbon isotope fractionations of a cyanobacterial strain (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942) solely expressing a putative ancestral Form 1B rubisco dating to >>1 Ga. This strain, nicknamed ANC, grows in ambient pCO2 and displays larger {varepsilon}p values than WT, despite having a much smaller {varepsilon}Rubisco (17.23 {+/-} 0.61{per thousand} vs. 25.18 {+/-} 0.31{per thousand} respectively). Measuring both enzymatic and biomass fractionation revealed a surprising result--ANC {varepsilon}p exceeded ANC {varepsilon}Rubisco in all conditions tested, contradicting prevailing models of cyanobacterial carbon isotope fractionation. However, these models were corrected by accounting for cyanobacterial physiology, notably the CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM). Our model suggested that additional fractionating processes like powered inorganic carbon uptake systems contribute to {varepsilon}p, and this effect is exacerbated in ANC. Understanding the evolution of rubisco and the CCM is therefore critical for interpreting the carbon isotope record. Large fluctuations in that record may reflect the evolving efficiency of carbon fixing metabolisms in addition to changes in atmospheric CO2.\n\nSignificance StatementEarth scientists rely on chemical fossils like the carbon isotope record to derive ancient atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but interpretation of this record is calibrated using modern organisms. We tested this assumption by measuring the carbon isotope fractionation of a reconstructed ancestral rubisco enzyme (>1 billion years old) in vivo and in vitro. Our results contradicted prevailing models of carbon flow in Cyanobacteria, but our data could be rationalized if light-driven uptake of CO2 is taken into account. Our study showed that the carbon isotope record tracks both the evolution of photosynthesis physiology as well as changes in atmospheric CO2, highlighting the value of considering both evolution and physiology for comparative biological approaches to understanding Earths history.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodelers are essential for the maintenance of chromatin structure and gene regulation. In this study, we examined the role of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) Gcn5 and Esa1 in regulating RSC and histone occupancies and their effects on transcription genome-wide. We identified contrasting roles of HATs in modulating RSC occupancies in promoters and ORFs. In HAT mutants, RSC accumulated in nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) with \"fragile nucleosomes (FNs)\" more than those with stable -1 nucleosomes. Moreover, the accumulation was more significant in the Esa1 mutant than in the Gcn5 mutant. However, RSC NDR accumulation was not observed in cells lacking H3 or H4 tails. Furthermore, we observed marked increases in histone occupancies in NDRs in the HAT mutants genome-wide. Overall, these data suggest that FNs use hypoacetylated tails to recruit RSC to NDRs, and subsequent acetylation of the tails promote histone eviction. In contrast to the promoters, RSC occupancies were significantly reduced in transcribed ORFs in the HAT mutants. Additionally, the HAT mutants showed reduced TBP and Pol II binding at promoters. Thus, our data implicate HATs and RSC in maintaining NDRs, regulating chromatin structure, and promoting transcription.",

    "abstract": "The type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (R2B RPTPs) are cell surface transmembrane proteins that engage in cell adhesion via their extracellular domains (ECDs) and cell signaling via their cytoplasmic phosphatase domains. The ECDs of R2B RPTPs form stable, homophilic, trans interactions between adjacent cell membranes. Previous work has demonstrated how one family member, PTPRM, forms homodimers; however, the determinants of homophilic specificity remain unknown. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the membrane-distal, N-terminal domains of PTPRK that form a head-to-tail dimer consistent with intermembrane adhesion. Comparison with the PTPRM structure demonstrates inter-domain conformational differences that may define homophilic specificity. Using small-angle X-ray scattering we determined the solution structures of the full-length ECDs of PTPRM and PTPRK, identifying that both are rigid, extended molecules that differ in their overall long-range conformation. Furthermore, we identify one residue, W351, within the interaction interface that differs between PTPRM and PTPRK and show that mutation to glycine, the equivalent residue in PTPRM, abolishes PTPRK dimer formation in vitro. This comparison of two members of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase family suggest that homophilic specificity is driven by a combination of shape complementarity and specific but limited sequence differences.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCell-cell contacts are dynamically regulated, in part, by the actions of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The R2B family of receptor tyrosine phosphatases combine an adhesive extracellular domain with intracellular catalytic domains that bind and dephosphorylate key cell adhesion and polarity proteins. Previous work demonstrated that the extracellular domains form head-to-tail homodimers but, as the interface was composed of residues conserved across the family, homophilic specificity determinants remained unclear. We have used a range of structural techniques including X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering and AlphaFold modelling to demonstrate that, despite their similarity, two members of the R2B family possess significant differences in their overall shape. Our results support that a combination of subtle shape and sequence variations may determine homophilic binding.",

    "abstract": "Cas7-11 is a Type III-E CRISPR Cas effector that confers programmable RNA cleavage and has potential applications in RNA interference. Cas7-11 encodes a single polypeptide containing four Cas7- and one Cas11-like segments that obscures the distinction between the multi-subunit Class 1 and the single-subunit Class-2 CRISPR-Cas systems. We report a cryo-EM structure of the active Cas7-11 from Desulfonema ishimotonii (DiCas7-11) that reveals the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form that resembles the backbone made up by four Cas7 and one Cas11 subunits in the multi-subunit enzymes. Unlike the multi-subunit enzymes, however, the backbone of DiCas7-11 contains evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains, giving rise to their unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides and is responsible for processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA. Whereas both the second and the third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage, they differ in metal requirement for catalysis. The long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7-like domain has little impact to RNA processing or targeting, suggesting the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryStructures of Cas7-11 reveal the molecular basis for processing CRISPR RNA and for cleaving target RNA.",

NLRP3 is a component of the inflammasome involved in the initiation, development, and progression of multiple cancers. We examined whether adding an NLRP3 agonist to dual PD-1/VEGFR inhibitors is feasible and can address treatment resistance in orthotopic HCC in mice with underlying liver damage. Mice with established tumors were treated with an NLRP3 agonist alone, combination of anti-VEGFR2 or the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib with anti-PD1 antibodies, or their combination. In all models tested, NLRP3 agonist therapy showed acceptable toxicity but no effect on tumor growth delay, disease morbidity, or survival. Pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed the effects of NLRP3 agonist therapy on inflammasome, evidenced by a significant elevation in plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1{beta}. However, these changes were not detectable in tumor tissues, where we detected increased expression of immunosuppressive markers IL-6, KC/GRO, CCL9, and IL-18, and immune checkpoint molecules (PD1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) after NLRP3 agonist therapy. Thus, modulation of the inflammasome with a novel NLRP3 agonist was feasible in mice with orthotopic HCC and liver damage but did not enhance efficacy when combined with anti-PD1/VEGFR therapies.",
