    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication stalling is considered an initial step in the formation of mtDNA deletions that associate with genetic inherited disorders and aging. However, the molecular details of how stalled replication forks lead to mtDNA deletions accumulation are still unclear. Mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints preferentially occur at sequence motifs predicted to form G-quadruplexes (G4s), four-stranded nucleic acid structures that can fold in guanine-rich regions. Whether mtDNA G4s form in vivo and their potential implication for mtDNA instability is still under debate.\n\nIn here, we developed new tools to map G4s in the mtDNA of living cells. We engineered a G4-binding protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix of a human cell line and established the mtG4-ChIP method, enabling the determination of mtDNA G4s under different cellular conditions. Our results are indicative of transient mtDNA G4 formation in human cells. We demonstrated that mtDNA-specific replication stalling increases formation of G4s, particularly in the major arc. Moreover, elevated levels of G4 block the progression of the mtDNA replication fork and cause mtDNA loss. We conclude that stalling of the mtDNA replisome enhances mtDNA G4 occurrence, and that G4s not resolved in a timely manner can have a negative impact on mtDNA integrity.",

    "abstract": "The mutations introduced into the ancestors of modern humans from interbreeding with Neanderthals have been suggested to contribute an unexpected extent to complex human traits. However, testing this hypothesis has been challenging due to the idiosyncratic population genetic properties of introgressed mutations. We developed rigorous methods to assess the contribution of introgressed Neanderthal mutations to heritable trait variation relative to that of modern human variants. We applied these methods to analyze 235,592 introgressed Neanderthal mutations and 96 distinct phenotypes measured in about 300,000 unrelated white British individuals in the UK Biobank. Introgressed Neanderthal mutations have a significant contribution to trait variation consistent with the polygenic architecture of complex phenotypes (contributing 0.1% of heritable variation averaged across phenotypes; p = 9.59x10-9). However, the contribution of introgressed mutations tends to be significantly depleted relative to modern human mutations matched for allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium (about 57% depletion on average), consistent with purifying selection on introgressed mutations. Different from previous studies (McArthur 2021), we find no evidence for elevated heritability across the phenotypes examined. We identified 348 independent significant associations of introgressed Neanderthal mutations with 64 phenotypes (p < 1 x10-10). Previous work (Skov 2021) has suggested that a majority of such associations are likely driven by statistical association with nearby modern human variants that are the true causal variants. We therefore developed a customized statistical fine-mapping methodology for introgressed mutations that led us to identify 112 regions (at a false discovery proportion of 16%) across 47 phenotypes containing 4,303 unique genetic variants where introgressed mutations are highly likely to have a phenotypic effect. Examination of these mutations reveal their substantial impact on genes that are important for the immune system, development, and metabolism. Our results provide the first rigorous basis for understanding how Neanderthal introgression modulates complex trait variation in present-day humans.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based approaches are revolutionizing imaging-driven scientific research. However, the accessibility and reproducibility of deep learning-based workflows for imaging scientists remain far from sufficient. Several tools have recently risen to the challenge of democratizing deep learning by providing user-friendly interfaces to analyze new data with pre-trained or fine-tuned models. Still, few of the existing pre-trained models are interoperable between these tools, critically restricting a models overall utility and the possibility of validating and reproducing scientific analyses. Here, we present the BioImage Model Zoo (https://bioimage.io): a community-driven, fully open resource where standardized pre-trained models can be shared, explored, tested, and downloaded for further adaptation or direct deployment in multiple end user-facing tools (e.g., ilastik, deepImageJ, QuPath, StarDist, ImJoy, ZeroCostDL4Mic, CSBDeep). To enable everyone to contribute and consume the Zoo resources, we provide a model standard to enable cross-compatibility, a rich list of example models and practical use-cases, developer tools, documentation, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download and testing. Our contribution aims to lay the groundwork to make deep learning methods for microscopy imaging findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) across software tools and platforms.",

    "abstract": "Internalization of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane constitutes the major endocytic route for receptors and their ligands. Dynamic and structural properties of endocytic clathrin coats are regulated by the mechanical properties of the plasma membrane. Here, we used conventional fluorescence imaging and multiple modes of structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to image formation of endocytic clathrin coats within live cells and tissues of developing fruit fly embryos. High resolution in both spatial and temporal domains allowed us to detect and characterize distinct classes of clathrin-coated structures. For the first time, we show that membrane tension induces formation of giant coated pits (GCPs) that can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than the canonical clathrin-coated pits. GCPs take longer to form but their mechanism of curvature generation is the same as the canonical pits. We also demonstrate that GCPs can split into smaller fragments during internalization. Considering the supporting roles played by actin filament dynamics in clathrin-mediated endocytosis under mechanically stringent conditions, we suggest that local changes in the coat curvature driven by actin machinery can drive splitting and internalization of GCPs.",

    "abstract": "Distal arthrogryposis (DA) is a collection of rare disorders characterized by congenital joint contractures. Most DA mutations are in muscle- and joint-related genes, and the anatomical defects originate cell-autonomously within the musculoskeletal system. However, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO2, a principal mechanosensor in somatosensation, cause DA subtype 5 via unknown mechanisms. We show that expression of a GOF PIEZO2 mutation in proprioceptive sensory neurons mainly innervating muscle spindles and tendons is sufficient to induce DA5-like phenotypes in mice. Overactive PIEZO2 causes anatomical defects via increased activity within the peripheral nervous system during postnatal development. Remarkably, Botox and a dietary fatty acid that modulates PIEZO2 activity markedly reduce DA5-like deficits. This reveals an unexpected role for somatosensory neurons: excessive mechanosensation within these neurons disrupts musculoskeletal development.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is more difficult to treat than other intractable adult tumors. Here, we describe the composition and function of migrasomes generated along with GBM cell migration. Proteomic analysis revealed that LC3B-positive autophagosomes were abundant in the migrasomes of GBM cells. An increased number of migrasomes was observed following treatment with chloroquine (CQ) or inhibition of the expression of STX17 and SNAP29, which are involved in autophagosome/lysosome fusion. Although ATG7 ablation, which is involved in LC3B lipidation, did not suppress migrasome formation, it was confirmed that migrasome formation could be diminished by blocking the alternative autophagy pathway through double knockout of ATG7/BECN1. Furthermore, depletion of ITGA5 or TSPAN4 did not relieve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cells, resulting in cell death. Taken together, our study suggests that increasing the number of autophagosomes, through inhibition of autophagosome/lysosome fusion, generates migrasomes that have the capacity to alleviate cellular stress.\n\nSummary statementThis study demonstrates that glioblastoma cells contain autophagosomes within their migrasomes. Under stress conditions, the formation of migrasomes serves as a stress-relief mechanism to alleviate cell death.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a pathological condition of unknown etiology which results from injury to the lung and an ensuing fibrotic response that leads to thickening of the alveolar walls and obliteration of the alveolar space. The pathogenesis is not clear and there are currently no effective therapies for IPF. Small airway disease and mucus accumulation are prominent features in IPF lungs, similar to Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease. The ATP12A gene encodes the alpha-subunit of the non-gastric H+, K+-ATPase, which functions to acidify the airway surface fluid and impairs mucociliary transport function in cystic fibrosis patients. We hypothesize that the ATP12A protein may play a role in the pathogenesis of IPF. Our studies demonstrate that ATP12A protein is overexpressed in distal small airways from IPF patient lungs compared to normal human lungs. In addition, overexpression of the ATP12A protein in mouse lungs worsened the bleomycin (BLEO)-induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis. This was prevented by a potassium-competitive proton pump blocker, vonoprazan (VON). This data supports the concept that the ATP12A protein plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. Inhibition of the ATP12A protein has the potential as a novel therapeutic strategy in IPF.",
