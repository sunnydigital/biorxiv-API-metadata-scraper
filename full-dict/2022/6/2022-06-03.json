    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 tools have transformed genetic manipulation capabilities in the laboratory. Empirical rules-of-thumb have been established for only a narrow range of model organisms, and mechanistic underpinnings for sgRNA efficiency remain poorly understood. This work establishes a novel feature set and new public resource, produced with quantum chemical tensors, for interpreting and predicting sgRNA efficiency. Feature engineering for sgRNA efficiency is performed using an explainable-artificial intelligence model; iterative Random Forest (iRF). By encoding quantitative attributes of position-specific sequences for E. coli sgRNAs, we identify important traits for sgRNA design in bacterial species. Additionally, we show that expanding positional encoding to quantum descriptors of base-pair, dimer, trimer and tetramer sequences captures intricate interactions in local and neighboring nucleotides of the target DNA. These features highlight variation in CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA dynamics between E. coli and H. sapien genomes. These novel encodings of sgRNAs greatly enhance our understanding of the elaborate quantum biological processes involved in CRISPR-Cas9 machinery.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of carbapenem-resistant (CR) hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is a new threat to healthcare. In this study, we studied the molecular epidemiology of CR Klebsiella isolates in Qatar using whole genome sequence data. We also characterised the prevalence and genetic basis of hypervirulent phenotypes, and established the virulence potential using a Galleria mellonella model. One hundred CR Klebsiella isolates were recovered, and NDM and OXA-48 were the most common carbapenemases. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the presence of diverse sequence types and clonal lineages; one of them belonged to K. quaisipneumoniae ST196 that may be disseminated among several health care centres. Ten K. pneumoniae isolates carrying rmpA and/or rmpA2, and 2 isolates belonged to KL2, indicating the prevalence of classical hypervirulent (hv) isolates was not high. Isolates carrying CR and hv genes were confined mainly to ST231 and ST383 isolates. One ST383 isolate was further investigated by MinION sequencing, and the assembled genome indicated the blaNDM was located on an IncHI1B type plasmid (pFQ61_ST383_NDM-5), which also harbored several virulence factors, including the regulator of the mucoid phenotype (rmpA), the regulator of mucoid phenotype 2 (rmpA2), and aerobactin (iucABCD and iutA), likely resulting from inversion and recombination events. In contrast, blaOXA-48 was located in an IncL-type plasmid. Comparative genomes indicated the recent evolution and emergence of CR-hv Kp ST383 via the acquisition of hybrid plasmids with both carbapenemase and virulence genes. CR-hv K. pneumoniae ST383 pose an emerging threat to global health due to their simultaneous hypervirulence and multidrug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata is phylogenetically closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model eukaryotic organism. Unlike S. cerevisiae with both haploid and diploid forms and a complete sexual cycle, C. glabrata has long been considered a haploid and asexual species. In this study, we analyzed the ploidy states of 500 clinical isolates of C. glabrata from four Chinese hospitals and found that approximately 4% of the isolates were in or able to spontaneously switch to an aneuploidy (genomic DNA: 1N-2N), diploidy (2N), or hyperdiploid (>2N) form under in vivo or in vitro conditions. Stable diploid-form cells were identified in 3% of the isolates (15/500). Of particular interest, one clinical strain only existed in the diploid form. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) assays revealed two major genetic clusters (A and B) of C. glabrata isolates. Most of the isolates (70%) from China belonged to the A cluster, whereas most of the isolates from other countries (such as Iran, Japan, USA, and European countries) belonged to the B cluster. Further investigation indicated that C. glabrata cells of different ploidy forms differed in a number of aspects, including morphologies, antifungal susceptibility, virulence, and global gene expression profiles. Additionally, C. glabrata could undergo spontaneous switching between the diploid and haploid form under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Given the absence of an apparent sexual phase, one would expect that the ploidy shifts could function as an alternative strategy that promotes genetic diversity and benefits the ability of the fungus to rapidly adapt to the changing environment.\n\nImportanceThe human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata has long been thought to be a haploid organism. Here we report the population structure and ploidy states of 500 clinical isolates of C. glabrata from China. To our surprise, we found that the ploidy of a subset of clinical isolates varied dramatically. Some isolates were in or able to switch to an aneuploid, diploid, or hyperdiploid form. C. glabrata cells with different ploidy differed in a number of biological aspects, including morphologies, antifungal susceptibility, virulence, and global gene expression profiles. Given the absence of an apparent sexual phase in this fungus, we propose that ploidy switching could be a rapid adaption strategy to environmental changes and could function as an alternative strategy of sexual reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of urinary tract infection, especially in catheterized individuals. Amino acids are the predominant nutrient for bacteria during growth in urine, and our prior studies identified several amino acid import and catabolism genes as fitness factors for P. mirabilis catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), particularly D- and L-serine. In this study, we sought to determine the hierarchy of amino acid utilization by P. mirabilis and to examine the relative importance of D- vs L-serine catabolism for critical steps in CAUTI development and progression. Herein, we show that P. mirabilis preferentially catabolizes L-serine during growth in human urine, followed by D-serine, threonine, tyrosine, glutamine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. Independently disrupting catabolism of either D- or L-serine has minimal impact on in vitro phenotypes while completely disrupting both pathways decreases motility, biofilm formation, and fitness due to perturbation of membrane potential and cell wall biosynthesis. In a mouse model of CAUTI, loss of either serine catabolism system decreased fitness, but disrupting L-serine catabolism caused a greater fitness defect than disrupting D-serine catabolism. We therefore conclude that hierarchical utilization of amino acids may be a critical component of P. mirabilis colonization and pathogenesis within the urinary tract.\n\nAbbreviated SummaryAmino acids are a predominant nutrient in urine, and their import and catabolism has been hypothesized to contribute to the ability of bacteria to cause urinary tract infection. We demonstrate that a common uropathogen, Proteus mirabilis, preferentially catabolizes L-serine followed by D-serine, threonine, tyrosine, and glutamine during growth in human urine. We further demonstrate that L-serine catabolism provides a greater fitness advantage than D-serine catabolism, yet both pathways contribute to pathogenesis in the urinary tract.\n\nGraphical Abstract(Created using BioRender.com)\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/494593v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13f3286org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0e84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db2946org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72b421_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Despite advances made in our understanding of Neisseria gonorrhoeae pathogenesis, factors dictating the divergent presentation of gonococcal disease observed between men and women, in vivo, remain unclear. Clinical data indicate that gonococcal pathogenesis of the female genital tract is influenced by steroid hormones. Notwithstanding, there are limited data addressing how steroid hormones modulate gonococcal pathogenesis. Hence, we investigated the effect(s) of physiological concentrations of estrogens and progestogens on N. gonorrhoeae viability and on complement-mediated infection of primary cervical cells. In contrast to previous studies that showed a bacteriostatic effect of non-physiological concentrations of steroid hormones on gonococci, our data indicate that physiological concentrations of estrogens and progestogens do not inhibit gonococcal growth in vitro or during infection of primary cervical cells. Estradiol promoted complement receptor 3 recruitment to the cervical cell surface and, thus, the ability of gonococci to associate with these cells. Progesterone-predominant assay conditions resulted in decreased expression of Opa proteins by gonococci, increased complement production by cervical cells, and increased iC3b opsonization of gonococci during cervical cell challenge. Collectively, our data support clinical observations and demonstrate that estrogens and progestogens distinctly modulate gonococcal cervical infection.",

In this study, scarless knockouts of the sulfur metabolism-related cbs and metB genes are constructed in the desulfurizing strain Rhodococcus sp. IGTS8. We provide sequence analyses for both enzymes of the reverse transsulfuration pathway and report their involvement in the sulfate- and methionine-dependent repression of the biodesulfurization phenotype, based on desulfurization assays in the presence of different sulfur sources. Additionally, the positive effect of cbs and metB gene deletions on dsz gene expression in the presence of both sulfate and methionine, but not cysteine, is uncovered and highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Direct RNA sequencing with a commercial nanopore platform was used to sequence RNA containing uridine (U), pseudouridine ({Psi}), or N1-methylpseudouridine (m1{Psi}) generated by in vitro transcription (IVT). The base calling data as well as the ionic currents and dwell times for U, {Psi}, or m1{Psi} as they translocated through the helicase and nanopore proteins identified diagnostic signatures for {Psi} and m1{Psi}; however, the two modifications yielded similar patterns although both were different from U. Understanding the nanopore signatures for {Psi} and m1{Psi} enabled a running start T7 RNA polymerase assay to study how competing mixtures of UTP with {Psi}TP or m1{Psi}TP lead to nucleotide selection in all possible adjacent sequence contexts. For UTP vs. {Psi}TP, {Psi}TP was favorably incorporated in singly-modified contexts, while doubly-modified contexts found high yields of {Psi}TP insertion on the 5' side and lower yields on the 3' side. For UTP vs. m1{Psi}TP, UTP was favorably selected except in 5'-XA (X = U or m1{Psi}) where the ratio was determined by their relative NTP concentrations. Experiments with chemically-modified triphosphates and DNA templates designed based on the structure of T7 RNA polymerase provide a model to explain the observations. These results may aid in future efforts that employ IVT to make therapeutic mRNAs with sub-stochiometric amounts of m1{Psi}.",

    "abstract": "In two-component systems, the information gathered by the histidine kinase (HK) is relayed to the cognate response regulator (RR). Thereby, the phosphoryl group of the autophosphorylated HK is transferred to the receiver domain of the RR to allosterically activate its effector domain. In contrast, multi-step phosphorelays comprise at least one additional Rec domain (Recinter) that is part of the HK and acts as an intermediary for phosphoryl-shuttling. While RR Rec domains have been studied extensively, little is known about Recinter domains and their potentially discriminating features. As a bona-fide Recinter domain, here we have studied the C-terminal Rec domain of the hybrid HK CckA (CckARec) from Caulobacter crescentus by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. CckARec exhibits the canonical Rec-fold, though with a degenerated 4 helix, in which all active site residues are pre-arranged for phosphoryl-binding. BeF3- binding does not alter secondary structure nor the oligomeric state, indicating the absence of allosteric changes, the hall mark of RRs. Based on structural modeling and sequence co-variation analysis, we present a detailed picture for the intramolecular association of the CckA DHp/Rec domains and discuss the role of a FATGUY motif, a distinguishing feature of CckARec orthologs.",

Some selected parameters of soil such as temperature (29.50 C), moisture (3.5 %), Water holding capacity (74%), pH (8.17), organic carbon % (1.90) and organic matter % (3.28) were measured and analysed. There was no significant variation in these parameters under different fertilizers treatment.

But while engineered expression of transcription factors (TFs) identified through TF screens has been found to rapidly and efficiently produce some cell types, generation of other cell types that require complex combinations of TFs has been elusive. Here we develop an iterative, pooled single-cell TF screening method that improves the identification of effective TF combinations using the generation of human microglia-like cells as a testbed: Two iterations identified a combination of SPI1, CEBPA, FLI1, MEF2C, CEBPB, and IRF8 as sufficient to differentiate human iPSC into microglia-like cells in 4 days. Characterization of TF-induced microglia demonstrated molecular and functional similarity to primary microglia. We explore the use of single-cell atlas reference datasets to confirm identified TFs and how combining single-cell TF perturbation and gene expression data can enable the construction of causal gene regulatory networks. We describe what will be needed to fashion these methods into a generalized integrated pipeline, further ideas for enhancement, and possible applications.",

    "abstract": "1Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly prevalent human disease with accumulating evidence linking its pathophysiology and co-morbidities to chemical exposures. The complex pathophysiology of NAFLD has limited the elucidation of potential chemical etiologies. In this study we generated a high-content imaging analysis method for the simultaneous quantification of sentinel steatosis cellular markers in chemically exposed human liver cells in vitro combined with a computational model for the extrapolation of human oral equivalent doses (OED). First, the in vitro test method was generated using 14 reference chemicals with known capacities to induce cellular alterations in nuclear morphology, lipid accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative stress. These effects were quantified on a single cell- and population-level, and then, using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling and reverse dosimetry, OEDs were extrapolated from these in vitro data. The extrapolated OEDs were confirmed to be within biologically relevant exposure ranges for the reference chemicals. Next, we tested 14 chemicals found in food, selected from thousands of putative chemicals on the basis of structure-based prediction for nuclear receptor activation. Amongst these, orotic acid had an extrapolated OED overlapping with realistic exposure ranges. By the strategy developed in this study, we were able to characterize known NAFLD-inducing chemicals and translate to data scarce food-related chemicals, amongst which we identified orotic acid to induce steatosis. This strategy addresses needs of next generation risk assessment, and can be used as a first chemical prioritization hazard screening step in a tiered approach to identify chemical risk factors for NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes systemic vascular inflammation and cognitive impairment. We sought to identify the underlying mechanisms mediating vascular dysfunction and inflammation following mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we conduced unbiased transcriptional analysis to identify brain endothelial cell signaling pathways dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. This analysis revealed significant suppression of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, a critical regulator of blood brain barrier integrity. We therefore hypothesized that enhancing cerebrovascular Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity would offer protection against BBB permeability, neuroinflammation, and neurological signs in acute infection. Indeed, we found that delivery of cerebrovascular-targeted, engineered Wnt7a ligands protected blood brain barrier integrity, reduced T cell infiltration of the brain, and reduced microglial activation in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, this therapeutic strategy also mitigated SARS-CoV-2 induced deficits in the novel object recognition assay for learning and memory and the pole descent task for bradykinesia. These observations suggest that enhancement of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling or its downstream effectors could be potential interventional strategies for restoring cognitive health following acute viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Selective loss of inhibitory interneurons (INs) that promotes a shift toward an excitatory predominance may have a critical impact on the generation of epileptic activity. While research on mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has mostly focused on hippocampal changes, including IN loss, the subiculum as the major output region of the hippocampal formation has received comparatively little attention. Although it has been shown to occupy a key position in the epileptic network, data on cellular changes in the subiculum are controversial. Using the intrahippocampal kainate (KA) mouse model for MTLE, which recapitulates main features of human MTLE such as hippocampal sclerosis and granule cell dispersion following status epilepticus (SE), we identified cell loss in the subiculum and quantified changes in specific IN subpopulations along its dorsoventral axis.\n\nWe performed intrahippocampal recordings, FluoroJade C-staining for degenerating neurons shortly after SE and immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei (NeuN), parvalbumin (PV), neuropeptide Y (NPY), calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB), and in situ hybridization for glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad) 67 mRNA at 21 days after KA.\n\nWe observed remarkable cell loss in the ipsilateral subiculum shortly after SE which was reflected in lowered density of NeuN+ cells in the chronic stage when epileptic activity could be measured in the subiculum concomitant with the hippocampus. We show a position-dependent reduction of Gad67-expressing INs by ~50% which particularly affected the PV- and to a lesser extent CR-expressing INs, whereas CB-expressing cells were unchanged.\n\nInterestingly, the density of NPY-positive neurons was increased, but double-labeling for Gad67 mRNA expression revealed that rather a de novo expression of NPY in non-GABAergic cells instead of IN changes underlay this increase.\n\nOur data reveal a position- and cell type-specific vulnerability of subicular INs in MTLE which might contribute to hyperexcitability of the subiculum, as reflected in the occurrence of epileptic activity.\n\nKeypoints (3-5)O_LIThe subiculum develops epileptic activity after intrahippocampal kainate injection in mice\nC_LIO_LIGad67-mRNA expressing interneurons are reduced in the subiculum in the intrahippocampal kainate model for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\nC_LIO_LIParvalbumin- and calretinin-expressing interneurons are particularly vulnerable in epilepsy\nC_LIO_LINeuropeptide Y upregulation in non-GABAergic cells in the subiculum indicates compensatory processes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Condensin extrudes DNA loops using an ATP-dependent mechanism that remains to be elucidated. Here, we show how condensin activity alters the topology of the interacting DNA. High condensin concentrations restrain DNA positive supercoils. However, in experimental conditions that sustain DNA loop extrusion, condensin restrains negative supercoils. Namely, upon ATP-mediated loading onto DNA, each condensin constrains a DNA linking number difference ({Delta}Lk) of -0.4. This {Delta}Lk increases to -0.8 during ATP binding and resets to -0.4 upon ATP hydrolysis. These {Delta}Lk values reflect the transient formation of a short left-handed loop of DNA, which is not the extruding loop. We conclude that, upon condensin ATPase-head engagement, a segment of DNA is pinched to form a short negatively supercoiled loop, which can be subsequently merged with the extruding loop. Such \"pinch and merge\" mechanism implies that the DNA is transferred between two dynamic DNA-binding sites while anchored at a third site.",

    "abstract": "The sustainability of marine communities is critical for supporting many biophysical processes that provide ecosystem services that promote human well-being. It is expected that anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change and human activities will tend to create less energetically-efficient ecosystems that support less biomass per unit energy flow. It is debated, however, whether this expected development should translate into bottom-heavy communities (with small basal species being the most abundant and large apex predators the least abundant) or top-heavy communities (where more biomass is supported at higher trophic levels with species having larger body sizes). Here, we combine ecological theory and empirical data to demonstrate that protection from harvesting promotes top-heavy energetically-efficient structures in marine communities. First, we use metabolic scaling theory to show that protected communities are expected to display stronger top-heavy structures than harvested communities. Similarly, we show theoretically that communities with high energy transfer efficiency display stronger top-heavy structures than communities with low transfer efficiency. Next, we use, as a natural experiment, the structures observed within fully protected marine areas compared to harvested areas across 299 geographical sites worldwide that vary in stress from thermal events and adjacent human activity. Using a nonparametric causal-inference analysis, we find a strong, positive, causal effect between protection from harvesting and top-heavy structures. Our work corroborates ecological theory on community development and provides a framework for additional research into the restorative effects of protected areas.",

    "abstract": "DEK has a short isoform (DEK isoform-2; DEK2) that lacks amino acid residues between 49-82. The full-length DEK (DEK isoform-1; DEK1) is ubiquitously expressed and plays a role in different cellular processes but whether DEK2 is involved in these processes remains elusive. We stably overexpressed DEK2 in human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-27A, in which endogenous DEKs were intact or suppressed via short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA). We have found that contrary to ectopic DEK1, DEK2 locates in the nucleus and nucleolus, causes persistent {gamma}H2AX signal upon doxorubicin treatment, and couldnt functionally compensate for the loss of DEK1. In addition, DEK2 overexpressing cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin than DEK1-cells. Expressions of DEK1 and DEK2 in cell lines and primary tumors exhibit tissue specificity. DEK1 is upregulated in cancers of the colon, liver, and lung compared to normal tissues while both DEK1 and DEK2 are downregulated in subsets of kidney, prostate, and thyroid carcinomas. Interestingly, only DEK2 was downregulated in a subset of breast tumors suggesting that DEK2 can be modulated differently than DEK1 in specific cancers. In summary, our findings show distinct expression patterns and subcellular location and suggest non-overlapping functions between the two DEK isoforms.",

    "abstract": "Faithful chromosome segregation requires the assembly of a bipolar spindle, consisting of two antiparallel microtubule (MT) arrays having most of their minus ends focused at the spindle poles and their plus ends overlapping in the spindle midzone. Spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and segregation require highly dynamic MTs. The plus ends of MTs have been extensively investigated; instead, their minus end structure remains poorly characterized. Here, we used large-scale electron tomography to study the morphology of the MT minus ends in 3D-reconstructed metaphase spindles in HeLa cells. In contrast to the homogeneous open morphology of the MT plus ends at the kinetochores, we found that MT minus ends are heterogeneous showing either open or closed morphologies. Silencing the minus-end specific stabilizer, MCRS1 increased the proportion of open MT minus ends. Altogether, these data suggest a correlation between the morphology and the dynamic state of the MT ends. Taking this heterogeneity of the MT minus end morphologies into account, our work indicates an unsynchronized behavior of MTs at the spindle poles, thus laying the ground for further studies on the complexity of MT dynamics regulation.",

So far, cnidarian studies have focused on the role of different BMP signaling network components in regulating pSMAD1/5 gradient formation. Much less is known about the target genes downstream of BMP signaling. To address this, we generated a genome-wide list of direct pSMAD1/5 target genes in the anthozoan Nematostella vectensis, several of which were conserved in Drosophila and Xenopus. Our ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that many of the regulatory molecules with documented bilaterally symmetric expression in Nematostella are directly controlled by BMP signaling. Among the so far uncharacterized BMP-dependent transcription factors and signaling molecules we identified several, whose bilaterally symmetric expression may be indicative of their involvement in secondary axis patterning. One of these molecules, zswim4-6, encodes a novel nuclear modulator of the pSMAD1/5 gradient potentially promoting BMP-dependent gene repression. Strikingly, overexpression of the zebrafish homologue zswim5 suggests that its effect on the pSMAD1/5 gradient is conserved between anthozoan Cnidaria and Bilateria.",

    "abstract": "Since Darwin, biologists have sought to understand the evolution and origins of phenotypic adaptations. The skull is particularly diverse due to intense natural selection such as feeding biomechanics. We investigate the genetic and molecular origins of trophic adaptation using Lake Malawi cichlids, which have undergone an exemplary evolutionary radiation. We analyze morphological differences in the lateral and ventral head among an insectivore that eats by suction feeding, an obligate biting herbivore, and their F2 hybrids. We identify variation in a series of morphologies including mandible width, mandible length, and buccal length that directly affect feeding kinematics and function. Using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, we find that many genes of small effects influence these craniofacial adaptations. Intervals for some traits are enriched in genes related to potassium transport and sensory systems, the latter suggesting correlation between feeding structures and sensory adaptations for foraging. Craniofacial phenotypes largely map to distinct genetic intervals, and morphologies in the head do not correlate. Together, these suggest that craniofacial traits are mostly inherited as separate modules, which confers a high potential for the evolution of morphological diversity. Though these traits are not restricted by genetic pleiotropy, functional demands of feeding and sensory structures likely introduce constraints on variation. In all, we provide insights into the quantitative genetic basis of trophic adaptation, identify mechanisms that influence the direction of morphological evolution, and provide molecular inroads to craniofacial variation.",

Yet the precise vulnerabilities that arise from such adaptations have not been fully characterized. Here, inspired by a bone marrow failure disorder due to loss of the histone deubiquitinase MYSM1, characterized by selectively disadvantaged HSCs, we show how reduced protein synthesis in HSCs results in increased ferroptosis. HSC maintenance can be fully rescued by blocking ferroptosis, despite no alteration in protein synthesis rates. Importantly, this selective vulnerability to ferroptosis not only underlies HSC loss in MYSM1 deficiency, but also characterizes a broader liability of human HSCs. Increasing protein synthesis rates via MYSM1 overexpression makes HSCs less susceptible to ferroptosis, more broadly illuminating the selective vulnerabilities that arise in somatic stem cell populations as a result of physiologic adaptations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is one of the most common forms of younger-onset dementia. FTD is genetically, pathologically and clinically related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mutations in TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) have been identified as a rare cause of FTD and ALS. TBK1 has known roles in inflammation and autophagy and interacts with other FTD and ALS proteins such as optineurin (OPTN): however, which of its roles are important to FTD/ALS pathogenesis remains undetermined. To date, >90 TBK1 rare variants have been identified in FTD/ALS patients: >50% of these are missense variants of unknown significance (VUS).\n\nMethodsIn this study, we have used a functional assay pipeline to investigate the effect of 16 TBK1 VUS with in-silico evidence of pathogenicity, together with two known pathogenic mutations and a common benign TBK1 polymorphism. Our assay pipeline evaluated the effect of TBK1 VUS on steady-state levels of TBK1, kinase activity and binding to OPTN. We also assessed the impact of TBK1 VUS on a key neuropathological feature of FTD and ALS cases: mislocalisation of neuronal TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n\nResultsWe observed some TBK1 VUS that had similar effects to TBK1 loss-of-function mutations, demonstrating decreased kinase activity and loss of OPTN binding. Both known pathogenic mutations and several TBK1 VUS also increased the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio of TDP-43 and this inversely correlated with their degree of OPTN binding but not with kinase activity.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that loss of the direct interaction between TBK1 and OPTN is more critical to FTD and ALS pathogenesis than TBK1s kinase activity. However, further studies are needed to elucidate exactly how loss of TBK1 binding to OPTN leads to TDP-43 pathology and ultimately neurodegeneration.",

Whether and how ER+ breast cancers switch from being estrogen-dependent to -independent remains unclear. With a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, we identified new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets of endocrine resistance. We demonstrate that high levels of PAICS, an enzyme involved in the de novo biosynthesis of purines, can shift the balance of ER activity to be more estrogen-independent and tamoxifen-resistant. We indicate that this is due to an elevated activity of cAMP-activated protein kinase A and mammalian target of rapamycin, kinases known to phosphorylate ER specifically and to stimulate its activity. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of PAICS sensitizes tamoxifen-resistant cells to tamoxifen. Based on these findings, we propose the combined targeting of PAICS and ER as a new, effective, and potentially safe therapeutic regimen.",

    "abstract": "Since the arrival of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States in 2013, elimination and control programs have had partial success. The dynamics of its spread are hard to quantify, though previous work has shown that local transmission and the transfer of pigs within production systems are most associated with the spread of PEDV.\n\nOur work relies on the history of PEDV infections in a region of the southeastern United States. This infection data is complemented by farm-level features and extensive industry data on the movement of both pigs and vehicles. We implement a discrete-time survival model and evaluate different approaches to modeling the local-transmission and network effects.\n\nWe find strong evidence in that the local-transmission and pig-movement effects are associated with the spread of PEDV, even while controlling for seasonality, farm-level features, and the possible spread of disease by vehicles. Our fully Bayesian model permits full uncertainty quantification of these effects. Our farm-level out-of-sample predictions have a receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.779 and a precision-recall AUC of 0.097. The quantification of these effects in a comprehensive model allows stakeholders to make more informed decisions about disease prevention efforts.",

    "abstract": "One major concern related to climate change is that elevated temperatures will drive increases in parasite outbreaks. Increasing temperature is known to alter host traits and host-parasite interactions, but we know relatively little about how these are connected mechanistically - that is, about how elevated temperatures impact the relationship between epidemiologically relevant host traits and infection outcomes. Here, we used a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) disease system to investigate whether temperature interacted with host susceptibility traits in determining infection outcomes. We did this by exposing D. dentifera to M. bicuspidata or leaving them unexposed at either control (20{degrees}C) or warming temperatures (24{degrees}C) in a fully factorial design. We found that elevated temperatures altered the physical barrier and immune responses to parasites during the initial infection process, and that infected hosts at elevated temperatures suffered a greater reduction of fecundity and lifespan. Furthermore, the relationship between a key trait - gut epithelium thickness, which is a physical barrier - and the likelihood of terminal infection reversed at warmer temperatures. Together, our results highlight the complex ways that temperatures can modulate host-parasite interactions, and the importance of considering key host susceptibility traits when predicting disease dynamics in a warmer world.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue  Infectious disease and evolution in a changing world.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous pathogenic variants in DNM1 cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) due to a dominant-negative mechanism impeding vesicular fission. Thus far, pathogenic variants in DNM1 have been studied using a canonical transcript that includes the alternatively spliced exon 10b. However, after performing RNA sequencing in thirty-nine pediatric brain samples, we find the primary transcript expressed in the brain includes the downstream exon 10a instead. Using this information, we evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations of variants affecting exon 10a and identified a cohort of eleven previously unreported individuals. Eight individuals harbor a recurrent de novo splice site variant, NG_029726.1(NM_001288739.1):c.1197-8G>A, which affects exon 10a and leads to DEE consistent with the classical DNM1 phenotype. We find this splice site variant leads to disease through an unexpected dominant-negative mechanism. Functional testing reveals an in-frame upstream splice acceptor causing insertion of two amino acids predicted to impair oligomerization-dependent activity. This is supported by neuropathological samples showing accumulation of synaptic vesicles adherent to the plasma membrane consistent with impaired vesicular fission. Two additional individuals with missense variants affecting exon 10a, p.(Arg399Trp) and p.(Gly401Asp), had a similar DEE phenotype. In contrast, a single individual with a missense variant affecting exon 10b, p.(Pro405Leu), which is less expressed in the brain, had a correspondingly less severe presentation. Thus, we implicate variants affecting exon 10a as causing the severe DEE typically associated with DNM1-related disorders. We highlight the importance of considering relevant isoforms for disease-causing variants, as well as the possibility of splice site variants acting through a dominant-negative mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive elements (REs) are integral to the composition, structure, and function of eukaryotic genomes. Yet, RE dynamics remain understudied in many taxonomic groups, preventing holistic understanding of how genomes and species evolve. Here, we investigated REs across 601 insect species (20 orders) to better understand the RE landscape of insects and to evaluate automated RE annotation methods in the era of biodiversity genomics. We identified wide variation in the types and frequency of REs across insect groups. We quantified associations between REs and protein-coding genes and found an elevated frequency of associations in insects with abundant long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). Sequencing technology impacts RE detection; [~]36% more REs could be identified in long-read versus short-read assemblies. Long terminal repeats (LTRs) showed markedly improved detection in long-read assemblies (162% more), while DNA transposons and LINEs showed less respective technology-related bias. We illustrate fundamental challenges to efficient study of REs in diverse groups, showing that in most insect lineages, 25-85% of repetitive sequences were \"unclassified\" compared to only [~]13% of unclassified repeats in Drosophila species. Our findings suggest this RE-annotation bottleneck, driven largely by uneven taxonomic representation in RE reference databases, is worsening. Although the diversity of available insect genomes has rapidly expanded, the rate of community contributions to RE databases (essential for RE annotation) has not kept pace, preventing high resolution study of REs in most groups. We highlight the tremendous opportunity and need for the field of biodiversity genomics to embrace REs and suggest collective steps for making progress towards this goal.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics and total RNA sequencing (total RNA-Seq) have the potential to improve the taxonomic identification of diverse microbial communities, which could allow for the incorporation of microbes into routine freshwater assessments. However, these targeted-PCR- free techniques require more testing and optimization. In this study, we processed metagenomics and total RNA-Seq data from a commercially available microbial mock community using 768 data-processing workflows, identified the most accurate data-processing tools, and compared their microbial identification accuracy at equal and increasing sequencing depths. The accuracy of data-processing tools substantially varied among replicates. Total RNA-Seq was more accurate than metagenomics at equal sequencing depths and even at sequencing depths almost one order of magnitude lower than those of metagenomics. We show that while data-processing tools require further exploration, total RNA-Seq might be a favorable alternative to metagenomics for targeted-PCR-free taxonomic identifications of microbial communities and might enable a substantial reduction in sequencing costs while maintaining accuracy. This could be particularly an advantage for routine freshwater assessments, which require cost-effective yet accurate methods, and might allow for the incorporation of microbes into freshwater assessments.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is an AAA+ motor that transports intracellular cargos towards the microtubule minus end. Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) binds to the AAA+ ring and stalk of dyneins motor domain and promotes the assembly of active dynein complexes. Because Lis1 slows motility when it remains bound to dynein, dissociation of Lis1 may be a key step in the initiation of dynein-mediated transport. Using single-molecule and optical trapping assays, we investigated how Lis1 binding affects the motility and force generation of yeast dynein in vitro. We showed that Lis1 does not slow dynein motility by serving as a roadblock or tethering dynein to microtubules. Lis1 binding also does not affect the forces that stall dynein movement, but it induces prolonged stalls and reduces the asymmetry in force-induced detachment of dynein from microtubules. Mutagenesis of the Lis1 binding sites on dyneins stalk partially recovers this asymmetry but does not restore dynein velocity. We propose that Lis1 binding slows dynein motility by disrupting nucleotide-induced rearrangements within the AAA+ ring and that Lis1s interaction with dyneins stalk slows force-induced detachment of dynein from microtubules.",

    "abstract": "Radiation and platinum-based chemotherapy form the backbone of therapy in HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We have correlated focal adhesion kinase (FAK/PTK2) expression with radioresistance and worse outcome in these patients. However, the importance of FAK in driving radioresistance and its effects on chemoresistance in these patients remain unclear. We performed an in vivo shRNA screen using targetable libraries to address these questions and identified FAK as an excellent target for both radio- and chemosensitization. Because TP53 is mutated in over 80% of HPV-negative HNSCC, we hypothesized that mutant TP53 may facilitate FAK-mediated therapy resistance. FAK inhibitor increased sensitivity to radiation, increased DNA damage and repressed homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining repair in mutant, but not wild-type, TP53 HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines. Mutant TP53 cisplatin-resistant cell line had increased FAK phosphorylation compared to wild-type, and FAK inhibition partially reversed cisplatin resistance. To validate these findings, we utilized a HNSCC cohort to show that FAK copy number and gene expression were associated with worse disease-free survival in mutant TP53, but not wild-type TP53, HPV-negative HNSCC tumors. Thus, FAK may represent a targetable therapeutic sensitizer linked to a known genomic marker of resistance.",

    "abstract": "Managing Salmonella enterica Enteritidis (SE) carriage in chicken is necessary to ensure human food safety and enhance chicken breeding viability. Salmonella can contaminate poultry products, causing human foodborne disease and economic losses for farmers. Both genetic selection for a decreased carriage and gut microbiota modulation strategies could reduce Salmonella propagation in farms.\n\nTwo-hundred and twenty animals from the White Leghorn inbred lines N and 61 were raised together on floor, infected by SE at 7 days of age, transferred into isolators to prevent oro-fecal recontamination and euthanized at 19 days. Caecal content DNA was used to measure individual Salmonella counts (ISC) by droplet digital PCR. A RNA sequencing approach was used to measure gene expression levels in caecal tonsils after infection of 48 chicks with low or high ISC.\n\nThe analysis between lines identified 7516 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) corresponding to 62 enriched Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Processes (BP) terms. A comparison between low and high carriers allowed us to identify 97 DEGs and 23 enriched GO BP terms within line 61, and 1034 DEGs and 288 enriched GO BP terms within line N. Among these genes, we identified several candidate genes based on their putative functions, including FUT2 or MUC4, which could be involved in the control of SE infection, maybe through interactions with commensal bacteria. Altogether, we were able to identify several genes and pathways associated with differences in SE carriage level. These results are discussed in relation to individual caecal microbiota compositions, obtained for the same animals in a previous study, which may interact with host gene expression levels for the control of the caecal SE load.",
