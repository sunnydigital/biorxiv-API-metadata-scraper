    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are grouped into several classes with diverse sequences. Owing to their diversity, studies involving the detection, classification, and annotation of TEs are difficult tasks. Moreover, simple comparisons of TEs among different species with different methods can lead to misinterpretations. The genome data of several honey bee (Apis) species are available in public databases. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of TEs, using 11 sets of genome data for Apis species, in order to establish the basal TE data (termed here as the  landscape of TEs). Consensus TE sequences were constructed and their distributions in the Apis genomes were determined. Our results showed that TEs from several limited families mainly consisted of Apis TEs and that more DNA/TcMar-Mariner consensus sequences and copies were present in all Apis genomes tested. In addition, more consensus sequences and copy numbers of DNA/TcMar-Mariner were detected in Apis mellifera than in other Apis species. These results suggest that TcMar-Mariner might exert A. mellifera-specific effects on the host A. mellifera species. In conclusion, our unified approach enabled comparison of Apis genome sequences to determine the TE landscape, which provide novel evolutionary insights into Apis species.\n\nSimple SummaryStudies on the detection of transposable elements and their annotations have posed several challenges. For example, simple comparisons of transposable elements in different species using different methods can lead to misinterpretations. Thus, assembling data for transposable elements analyzed by unified methods is important for comparison purposes. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of transposable elements identified using genome datasets from 5 Apis species (11 sets of genome data) and specific software to detect the transposable elements, which revealed the landscapes of transposable elements. We examined the types and locations of transposable elements in the Apis genomes. The landscapes of transposable elements showed that several limited transposable element families consisted mainly of Apis-associated transposable elements. These limited families include DNA/TcMar-Mariner and DNA/CMC-EnSpm. In addition, more DNA/TcMar-Mariner consensus sequences and copies were detected in Apis mellifera than in other Apis species. These data suggest that TcMar-Mariner might exert A. mellifera-specific effects in the host A. mellifera species. Our landscape data provide new insights into Apis transposable elements; furthermore, detailed analyses of our data could pave the way for new biological insights in this field.",

This paper provides an overview of the course structure, showing how the constituent elements have been designed and refined over successive iterations of the course. We detail how FSFE students: 1. Work closely with discipline specialists to develop a small group project that tests an hypothesis to answer a genuine scientific question in the field; 2. Learn critical skills of data management and communication; and 3. Analyse, interpret and present their results in the format of a scientific symposium. This process is repeated in an iterative  cognitive apprenticeship model, supported by a series of workshops that name and explicitly instruct the students in  hard and  soft skills critical relevant for research and other careers. FSFE students develop a coherent and nuanced understanding of how to approach and execute ecological studies. The sophisticated knowledge and ecological research skills that they develop during the course is demonstrated through high quality presentations and peer-reviewed publications in an open-access, student-led journal. We outline our course structure and evaluate its efficacy to show how this novel combination of field course elements allows students to gain maximum value from their educational journey, and to develop cognitive, affective and reflective tools to help apply their skills as scientists.",

    "abstract": "GLP (EHMT1) is a multifunctional protein, best known for its role as an H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 methyltransferase through its reportedly obligatory dimerization with G9A (EHMT2). Here, we investigate the role of GLP in the oocyte in comparison to G9A using oocyte-specific conditional knockout mouse models (G9a cKO, Glp cKO, G9a-Glp cDKO). Loss of GLP in Glp cKO and G9a-Glp cDKO oocytes re-capitulated meiotic defects observed in the G9a cKO; however, there was a significant impairment in oocyte maturation and developmental competence in Glp cKO and G9a-Glp cDKO oocytes beyond that observed in the G9a cKO. Consequently, loss of GLP in oogenesis results upon fertilisation in mid-gestation embryonic lethality. To assess the molecular functions of GLP and G9A, we applied a multi-omics approach, supported by immunofluorescence, to identify changes in epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic signatures in cKO oocytes. H3K9me2 was equally depleted in all cKO oocytes, whereas H3K9me1 was decreased only upon loss of GLP. The transcriptome, DNA methylome and proteome were markedly more affected in G9a-Glp cDKO than G9a cKO oocytes, with transcriptional de-repression associated with increased protein abundance and gains in genic DNA methylation in G9a-Glp cDKO oocytes. Together, our findings suggest that GLP contributes to transcriptional repression in the oocyte, independent of G9A, and is critical for oogenesis and oocyte developmental competence.",

Previous studies reported RNA-binding capacity of HAX1, but the role of this binding in physiology and pathology remains unexplained. Here we report transcriptome-wide characterization of HAX1 RNA targets using RIP-seq and CRAC, indicating that HAX1 binds transcripts involved in ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing. Using CRISPR knockouts we find that RNA targets of HAX1 partially overlap with transcripts downregulated in HAX1 KO, implying a role in mRNA stabilization. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that genes differentially expressed in HAX1 KO (including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation) are also enriched in a subset of genes whose expression correlates with HAX1 expression in four analyzed neoplasms. Functional connection to ribosome biogenesis was also demonstrated by gradient sedimentation ribosome profiles, which revealed differences in the small subunit:monosome ratio in HAX1 WT/KO. We speculate that changes in HAX1 expression may be important for the etiology of HAX1-linked diseases through dysregulation of translation.",

In the southern part of its range, the Parsley Frog Pelodytes punctatus breeds both in autumn and in spring. Our aim was to study the breeding phenology and reproductive success associated with the use of those two seasonal niches to understand how this breeding strategy can be maintained. Field surveys revealed that breeding phenology was typically bimodal with a higher breeding effort in autumn. More importantly, in spring, the survival rate of offspring was severely reduced by the presence of autumn tadpoles, indicating a clear priority effect. However, the autumn cohort often failed to survive over winter, in which case spring cohorts were often successful. Based on those results, we constructed a model in which females can allocate a variable portion of eggs to each season and added a priority effect. We conclude that the existence of the two breeding seasons may indeed constitute a bet-hedging strategy.",

However, the full potential of this approach has yet to be unlocked due to the safety concerns and limited payload capacity of commonly utilized viral vectors. Virus-free DNA transposons, including piggyBac, have potential to obviate these shortcomings. In this study, we improved a previously developed modified piggyBac system with superior transposition efficiency. We demonstrated that the internal domain sequences (IDS) within the 3 terminal repeat domain of hyperactive piggyBac (hyPB) donor vector contain dominant enhancer elements. Plasmid-free donor vector devoid of IDS was used in conjunction with a helper plasmid expressing Quantum PBase v2 to generate an optimal piggyBac system, Quantum pBac (qPB), for use in T cells. Cells transfected with qPB expressing CD20/CD19 CAR outperformed those transfected with the same donor vector and plasmid expressing hyPB transposase in terms of CAR-T cell production. Importantly, qPB yielded mainly CD8+ CAR-TSCM cells, and the qPB- induced CAR-T cells effectively eliminated CD20/CD19-expressing tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings confirm qPB as a promising virus-free vector system with a payload capacity to incorporate multiple genes. This system is highly efficient and potentially safe for mediating transgene integration.",

However, the expensive computational cost severely limits the applications in both the neuroscience and AI fields. The major bottleneck during simulating detailed compartment models is the ability of a simulator to solve large systems of linear equations. Here, we present a novel Dendritic Hierarchical Scheduling (DHS) method to markedly accelerate such process. We theoretically prove that the DHS implementation is computationally optimal and accurate. This GPU-based method performs at 2-3 orders of magnitude higher speed than that of the classic serial Hines method in the conventional CPU platform. We build a DeepDendrite framework, which integrates the DHS method and the GPU computing engine of the NEURON simulator and demonstrate applications of DeepDendrite in neuroscience and AI tasks. We investigated how spatial patterns of spine inputs affect neuronal excitability in a detailed human pyramidal neuron model with 25,000 spines; and examined how dendrites protect morphologically detailed neural networks against adversarial attacks in typical image classification tasks.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the frequency content of sounds over time are arguably the most basic form of information about the behavior of sound-emitting objects. In perceptual studies, such changes have mostly been investigated separately, as aspects of either pitch or timbre. Here, we propose a unitary account of \"up\" and \"down\" subjective judgments of frequency change, based on a model combining auditory correlates of acoustic cues in a sound-specific and listener-specific manner. To do so, we introduce a generalized version of so-called Shepard tones, allowing symmetric manipulations of spectral information on a fine scale, usually associated to pitch (spectral fine structure, SFS), and on a coarse scale, usually associated timbre (spectral envelope, SE). In a series of behavioral experiments, listeners reported \"up\" or \"down\" shifts across pairs of generalized Shepard tones that differed in SFS, in SE, or in both. We observed the classic properties of Shepard tones for either SFS or SE shifts: subjective judgements followed the smallest log-frequency change direction, with cases of ambiguity and circularity. Interestingly, when both SFS and SE changes were applied concurrently (synergistically or antagonistically), we observed a trade-off between cues. Listeners were encouraged to report when they perceived \"both\" directions of change concurrently, but this rarely happened, suggesting a unitary percept. A computational model could accurately fit the behavioral data by combining different cues reflecting frequency changes after auditory filtering. The model revealed that cue weighting depended on the nature of the sound. When presented with harmonic sounds, listeners put more weight on SFS-related cues, whereas inharmonic sounds led to more weight on SE-related cues. Moreover, these stimulus-based factors were modulated by inter-individual differences, revealing variability across listeners in the detailed recipe for \"up\" and \"down\" judgments. We argue that frequency changes are tracked perceptually via the adaptive combination of a diverse set of cues, in a manner that is in fact similar to the derivation of other basic auditory dimensions such as spatial location.",

Neuronal activity in the two efferent pathways of the dorsal striatum, a major input to the basal ganglia, is critical for appropriate behavioral control. Previous evidence has led to divergent conclusions on the respective engagement of both pathways during actions. We used calcium imaging to evaluate how neurons in the direct and indirect pathways in the dorsal striatum encode behaviors during self-paced spontaneous explorations in an open field. We observed that the two striatal pathways exhibit distinct tuning properties during spontaneous behaviors. We applied supervised learning algorithms and found that direct pathway neurons encode behaviors through their activation, whereas indirect pathway neurons exhibit behavior-specific silencing. These properties remain stable for weeks. Our findings highlight a complementary encoding of behaviors in the two striatal pathways that supports an updated model, reconciling previous conflicting conclusions on motor encoding in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Modern linguistic theories and network science propose that the language and speech processing is organized into hierarchical, segregated large-scale subnetworks, with a core of dorsal (phonological) stream and ventral (semantic) stream. The two streams are asymmetrically recruited in receptive and expressive language or speech tasks, which showed flexible functional segregation and integration. We hypothesized that the functional segregation of the two streams was supported by the underlying network segregation. A dynamic conditional correlation approach was employed to construct frame-wise time-varying language networks and investigate the temporal reoccurring patterns. We found that the time-varying language networks in the resting-state robustly clustered into four low-dimensional states, which dynamically reconfigured following a domain-separation manner. Spatially, the hub distributions of the first three states highly resembled the neurobiology of primary auditory processing and lexical-phonological processing, motor and speech production processing, and semantic processing, respectively. The fourth state was characterized by the weakest functional connectivity and subserved as a baseline state. Temporally, the first three states appeared exclusively in limited time bins ([~]15%), and most of the time (> 55%), the language network kept inactive in state 4. Machine learning-based dFC-linguistics prediction analyses showed that dFCs of the four states significantly predicted individual linguistic performance. These findings suggest a domain-separation manner of language network dynamics in the resting-state, which forms a dynamic \"meta-networking\" (network of networks) framework.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe time-varying language network in the resting-state is robustly clustered into four low-dimensional states.\nC_LIO_LISpatially, the first three dFC states are cognitively meaningful, which highly resemble the neurobiology of primary auditory processing and lexical-phonological representation, speech production processing, and semantic processing, respectively.\nC_LIO_LITemporally, the first three states appeared exclusively in limited time bins ([~]15%), and most of the time (> 55%), the language network kept inactive in state 4.\nC_LIO_LIA dynamic \"meta-networking\" framework of language network in the resting-state is proposed.\nC_LI",

Environmental DNA has been promoted as a way to aid in the monitoring of biological communities, but much remains to be understood on the biases introduced by different protocols meant to overcome challenges presented by unique systems under study. Turbid water is one methodologic challenge to eDNA recovery in these systems as it quickly clogs filters, preventing timely processing of samples. We investigated biases in community composition produced by two solutions to overcome slow filtration due to turbidity: freezing of water prior to filtration (for storage purposes and long-term processing), and use of sediment (as opposed to water samples). Bias assessments of community composition in downstream eDNA analysis was conducted for two sets of primers, 12S (fish) and 16S (bacteria and archaea). Our results show that freezing water prior to filtration had different effects on community composition for each primer, especially for the 16S, when using a filter of larger pore size (3 m). Nevertheless, pre-freezing water samples can still be a viable alternative for storage and processing of turbid water samples when focusing on fish communities (12S). The use of sediment samples as an alternative to processing water samples should be done with caution, and at minimum the number of biological replicates and/or volume sampled should be increased.",

    "abstract": "Upland swamps are peat-accumulating, groundwater-dependent and fire-prone wetland ecosystems. Drying caused by anthropogenic processes such as underground mining, ditching and climate change may disrupt surface and groundwater flows effecting a bottom-up control on wetland expression. Fire is an endogenous, recurring disturbance that drives a top-down consumptive force in many of these systems. When compounded with anthropogenic drying, fire may facilitate permanent community transitions. A dearth of ecological data and temporal lags have hampered our ability to predict risks associated with multiple disturbances in wetland plant communities. We collected intact wetland mesocosms from valley floors and lower slopes of four undisturbed swamp sites. We transferred the mesocosms to a glasshouse and established three different soil moisture availability levels to simulate wetland drainage. After 20 months of the hydrological treatment, we simulated a fire event by sequentially applying biomass removal (clipping), heat and smoke to half of the mesocosms. We monitored species biomass, richness and composition over a 3.5-year time frame. We found evidence of a temporal lag in biomass response to low water availability and synergistic hydrological and fire effects on species richness. In unburnt conditions, richness declined with low water availability but was maintained under high and medium water availability. After simulated fire in medium water availability, however, richness also declined and converged with depauperate low water mesocosm richness. Representation by many obligate swamp species declined in low compared with high water availability mesocosms over time, an effect that was amplified by the fire treatment.\n\nSynthesisOur evidence of lagged effects of hydrological change on wetland vegetation and compounding effects of fire should be considered in impact assessments, monitoring programs and ecosystem management to avoid irreversible wetland change in drying environments.",

    "abstract": "In an age of habitat loss and overexploitation, small populations, both captive and wild, are increasingly facing the effects of isolation and inbreeding. Genetic management has therefore become a vital tool for ensuring population viability. However, little is known about how the type and intensity of intervention shape the genomic landscape of inbreeding and mutation load. We address this using whole genome sequence data of scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), an iconic antelope that has been subject to contrasting management strategies since it was declared extinct in the wild. We show that unmanaged populations are enriched for long runs of homozygosity (ROH) and have significantly higher inbreeding coefficients than managed populations. Additionally, despite the total number of deleterious alleles being similar across management strategies, the burden of homozygous deleterious genotypes was consistently higher in unmanaged groups. These findings emphasise the risks associated with deleterious mutations through multiple generations of inbreeding. As wildlife management strategies continue to diversify, our study reinforces the importance of maintaining genome-wide variation in vulnerable populations and has direct implications for one of the largest reintroduction attempts in the world.\n\nSignificance statementConservation genetic management is becoming increasingly important for safeguarding and restoring wildlife populations. Understanding how the intensity of intervention influences genomic components of fitness is therefore essential for supporting species viability. We investigate the impact of contrasting management strategies on the genomic landscape of inbreeding and mutation load in captive populations of scimitar-horned oryx. We reveal how several decades of management have prevented the formation of long runs of homozygosity and masked the expression of deleterious mutations. Our findings highlight the dynamics between inbreeding, mutation load and population size and have direct implications for future management of threatened species.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing endogenous genes from selfish ones is essential for germline integrity. In animals, small regulatory RNAs play a central role in this process; however, the underlying principles are largely unknown. To fill this gap, we studied how selfish toxin-antidote elements (TAs) evade silencing in the nematode Caenorhabditis tropicalis. We found that the slow-1/grow-1 TA is active only when maternally inherited. Surprisingly, this parent-of-origin effect stems from a regulatory role of the toxins mRNA: maternal slow-1 mRNA--but not SLOW-1 protein--licenses slow-1 expression in the zygote by counteracting piRNAs. Our results indicate that epigenetic licensing-- known to play a role in C. elegans sex-determination--is likely a common mechanism that hinders the spread of selfish genes in wild populations while ensuring a lasting memory of self in the germline.",

    "abstract": "Despite the crucial role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the organotypic organization and function of skeletal muscles, most 3D models do not mimic its specific characteristics, namely its biochemical composition, stiffness, anisotropy, and porosity. Here, a novel 3D in vitro model of muscle extracellular matrix was developed to differentiate myogenic cells (C2C12 line) into myotubes and reproduce their natural cell/cell and cell/matrix interactions. An anisotropic hydrogel mimicking the perimysium was obtained thanks to unidirectional 3D printing of dense collagen with aligned collagen fibrils. The space between the different layers was tuned to generate an intrinsic porosity (100 {micro}m) suitable for nutrient and oxygen diffusion. By modulating the gelling conditions, the mechanical properties of the construct reached those measured in the physiological muscle ECM. The addition of large channels (600 {micro}m) by molding permitted to create a second range of porosity suitable for cell colonization without altering the physical properties of the hydrogel. C2C12 cells embedded in Matrigel(R), seeded within the channels, organized in 3D, and differentiated into multinucleated mature myotubes. This organization reproduced the global muscular bundles, i.e., the endomysium encompassing myotubes. These results show that porous and anisotropic dense collagen hydrogels colonized with myoblasts are promising biomaterials to model skeletal muscle.\n\nTable of contents\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=39 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496716v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bae7e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf453corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca69a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd13cd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA novel extracellular matrix-like hydrogel increases the physiological relevance of the skeletal muscle model.\nC_LIO_LIPorous and anisotropic dense collagen hydrogels mimic the muscle ECM physical properties.\nC_LIO_LIUnidirectional printing of dense collagen creates a porous and anisotropic scaffold in a single step.\nC_LIO_LIAnisotropic dense collagen hydrogels promote C2C12 differentiation into myotubes and their 3D organization.\nC_LI",

The most investigated epitranscriptomic modification is methylation at the N6-position of adenosine (m6A). This dynamic modification process is carried out by: writer, reader and eraser proteins.

    "abstract": "Residue-residue distance information is useful for predicting the tertiary structures of protein monomers or the quaternary structures of protein complexes. Many deep learning methods have been developed to predict intra-chain residue-residue distances of monomers accurately, but very few methods can accurately predict inter-chain residue-residue distances of protein complexes. We develop a new deep learning method CDPred (i.e., Complex Distance Prediction) based on the 2D attention-powered residual network architecture to address the gap. CDPred predicts the inter-chain distance maps of dimers (homodimers or heterodimers) from the features extracted from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and the intra-chain distance maps of predicted tertiary structures of monomers. Tested on two homodimer test datasets, CDPred achieves the precision of 61.56% and 43.26% for top L/5 inter-chain contact predictions (L: length of the monomer in homodimer), respectively, which is substantially higher than DeepHomos 37.40% and 23.08% and GLINTERs 48.09% and 36.74%. And tested on the two heterodimer test datasets, the top L/5 inter-chain contact prediction precision (L: length of the shorter monomer in heterodimer) of CDPred is 47.59% and 22.87% respectively, which surpasses GLINTERs 23.24% and 13.49%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the residue-residue co-evolutionary features calculated from multiple sequence alignments by a deep learning language model are more informative for the inter-chain contact prediction than the traditional statistical optimization approach of maximizing direct co-evolutionary signals, and large intra-chain distances in the intra-chain distance maps of monomers are more useful for the inter-chain distance prediction than small intra-chain distances.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative assessment of single cell fluxome is critical for understanding the metabolic heterogeneity in diseases. Unfortunately, single cell fluxomics using laboratory approaches is currently infeasible, and none of the current flux estimation tools could achieve single cell resolution. In light of the natural associations between transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles, it remains both a feasible and urgent task to use the available single cell transcriptomics data for prediction of single cell fluxome. We present scFLUX here, which provides an online platform for prediction of metabolic fluxome and variations using transcriptomics data, on individual cell or sample level. This is in contrast to other flux estimation methods that are only able to model the fluxes for cells of pre-defined groups. The scFLUX webserver implements our in-house single cell flux estimation model, namely scFEA, which integrates a novel graph neural network architecture with a factor graph derived from the complex human metabolic network. To the best of our knowledge, scFLUX is the first and only web-based tool dedicated to predicting individual sample-/cell-metabolic fluxome and variations of metabolites using transcriptomics data. scFLUX is available at http://scflux.org/.

As a large \"two for one\" animal model, with instrumentation of the ewe and her fetus, the model poses challenges to implement de novo and to maintain overtime at the highest standards of operating procedures to ensure its ongoing performance. A common, yet conventionally underreported issue researchers face is the rate of animal loss. Here, we investigate what determines the success of the pregnant sheep model.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study consisting of 82 experiments spanning the course of six years. Our team identified ten variables that we anticipated were likely to influence the experimental outcome, such as the time of year, animal size, and surgical complexity.\n\nResultsThe single variable identified in this study as determining the successful outcome of the experiments is the experience level of the team.\n\nConclusionThe CINAFS model offers enormous potential to further our understanding of human fetal development and to create interventional technologies. However, to improve the outcomes of CINAFS models, improved communication and training are needed. We discuss the implications of our findings for the successful implementation of this challenging yet scientifically advantageous animal model of human physiology.\n\nKey pointsO_LIThe fetal sheep model closely mirrors the physiology of human fetal development\nC_LIO_LIIn addition to its high translational potential, this model is known to have some generally not reported rate of experimental failure\nC_LIO_LIWe show that factors such as animal characteristics & surgical complexity do not influence the experimental outcomes\nC_LIO_LIInstead, the key factor in model experimental success is the level of the research teams experience\nC_LIO_LIThe key factors to improve the animal model outcomes are an intra- and inter-team communication\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is the main HIV co-receptor affecting susceptibility and disease course. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping analysis was performed to assess genetic variants associated with CCR5 expression on circulating immune cells in 209 PLHIV using ART and 304 healthy controls, all of Western European ancestry. The proportions of CCR5 positive cells and CCR5 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were assessed by flow cytometry in monocytes and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets using flow cytometry. We identified the rs60939770, which is an intergenic variant in cis-region to CCR5 gene not in linkage disequilibrium with CCR5d32, related to the proportion of CCR5+ memory T regulatory cells, both in PLHIV and healthy controls. Two genome-wide significant loci, in linkage equilibrium with CCR5d32, were found to be associated with CCR5 MFI of multiple subsets of mostly differentiated memory T cells in both groups. The expression of nearby chemokines receptors (CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCRL2), existing in the same the same topologically associating domain, were also influenced by these genetic variants. Furthermore, we show the genetic variants which modulate CCR5 surface expression affect the production of other inflammatory mediators, including monocyte- and lymphocyte-derived cytokines as well as CCL4 and IL-8. Our data indicate that the genetic regulation of CCR5 expression is cell-specific and affects the production of various inflammatory mediators.\n\nAuthor SummaryCCR5 plays a important role in the acquisition of HIV and it is associated to immune activation in people living with HIV (PLHIV). Using samples of cohorts composed of healthy individuals and PLHIV, we sought to map genomic regions that influence CCR5 expression on monocytes and subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. We identified distinct genetic variants that are associated with CCR5 cell proportions or mean fluorescence intensity in subpopulations of T cells with memory functions in both healthy and PLHIV. The genetic variants also influenced the expression of other nearby chemokine receptors and the production of inflammatory mediators. Thus, we demonstrated that the genetic regulation of CCR5 expression is cell-type specific and may impact HIV susceptibility and disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The rise of single-cell data highlights the need for a nondeterministic view of gene expression, while offering new opportunities regarding gene regulatory network inference. We recently introduced two strategies that specifically exploit time-course data, where single-cell profiling is performed after a stimulus: HARISSA, a mechanistic network model with a highly efficient simulation procedure, and CARDAMOM, a scalable inference method seen as model calibration. Here, we combine the two approaches and show that the same model driven by transcriptional bursting can be used simultaneously as an inference tool, to reconstruct biologically relevant networks, and as a simulation tool, to generate realistic transcriptional profiles emerging from gene interactions. We verify that CARDAMOM quantitatively reconstructs causal links when the data is simulated from HARISSA, and demonstrate its performance on experimental data collected on in vitro differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells. Overall, this integrated strategy largely overcomes the limitations of disconnected inference and simulation.\n\nAuthor summaryGene regulatory network (GRN) inference is an old problem, to which single-cell data has recently offered new challenges and breakthrough potential. Many GRN inference methods based on single-cell transcriptomic data have been developed over the last few years, while GRN simulation tools have also been proposed for generating synthetic datasets with realistic features. However, except for benchmarking purposes, these two fields remain largely disconnected. In this work, building on a combination of two methods we recently described, we show that a particular GRN model can be used simultaneously as an inference tool, to reconstruct a biologically relevant network from time-course single-cell gene expression data, and as a simulation tool, to generate realistic transcriptional profiles in a non-trivial way through gene interactions. This integrated strategy demonstrates the benefits of using the same executable model for both simulation and inference.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in internal states, such as elevated arousal level and increased anxiety or fear, triggered by alerting environmental cues are required for behavioral state transitions promoting survival. However, the specific brain region that plays an interfacing role between alerting stimuli and internal states remains to be identified. Here, we report that the medial sector of the auditory thalamus (ATm), which consists of a group of non-lemniscal thalamic nuclei, can fulfill this function. VGluT2-expressing ATm (ATmVGluT2+) neurons receive direct and strong inputs from both visual and auditory midbrain regions, and project to multiple downstream structures critically involved in brain state regulation. Their activity was correlated with, and indispensable for, both blue light- and sound-induced NREM sleep-to-Wake transition, and their arousing effects were mainly mediated by, but not limited to, the temporal association cortices. ATmVGluT2+ neuron activation in awake behaving mice induced pupil dilation and behavioral responses suggestive of anxiety. Blocking the neurotransmitter release of ATmVGluT2+ neurons receiving auditory inputs selectively abolished loud noise-triggered escape behavior but not locomotion. Thus, the ATm is an interface in mouse brain that can transform alerting environmental cues into internal arousal and emotional state alterations that promote survival.",

    "abstract": "Human cognition is characterized by a wide range of capabilities including goal-oriented selective attention, distractor suppression, decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Much research has focused on studying these individual components of cognition in isolation, whereas in several translational applications for cognitive impairment, multiple cognitive functions are altered in a given individual. Hence it is important to study multiple cognitive abilities in the same subject or, in computational terms, model them using a single model. To this end, we propose a unified, reinforcement learning-based agent model comprising of systems for representation, memory, value computation and exploration. We successfully modelled the aforementioned cognitive tasks and show how individual performance can be mapped to model meta-parameters. This model has the potential to serve as a proxy for cognitively impaired conditions, and can be used as a clinical testbench on which therapeutic interventions can be simulated first before delivering to human subjects.",

    "abstract": "Neural responses to sensory stimuli are markedly influenced by the context in which a stimulus is preceded or embedded. Cortical and subcortical neurons typically exhibit adaptation to repetitive auditory, visual, somatosensory, and olfactory stimulation. Here, we investigated single neuron responses to sequences of sounds either repeatedly delivered from a single spatial location or randomly delivered from multiple spatial locations in the auditory cortex of awake marmosets. Instead of inducing adaptation, repetitive stimulation from a target speaker evoked long-lasting, location-specific facilitation (LSF) in many neurons, irrespective of the visibility of the target speaker. The extent of LSF decreased with decreasing presentation probability of the target speaker. Intracellular recordings showed that repetitive sound stimulation evoked sustained membrane potential depolarization which gave rise to firing rate facilitation. Computational models suggest two distinct neural mechanisms underlying LSF. Our findings revealed a novel form of contextual modulation in the auditory cortex that may play a role in auditory streaming and predictive coding.",

In our previous work, we introduced a novel method, state-based neurofeedback (sb-NFB) that targets patterns of MEG signals related to shifts in spatial attention. In this pilot study, we used sb-NFB to train participants to decrease the time required to covertly shift spatial attention from one visual hemifield to the other. We characterized the changes to cortical connectivity during each training session. In addition, we run a separate, Posner-like validation task before the training sessions and after the training was complete. We found a significant main effect of training on the reaction time linked to switching spatial attention in both the training task and the validation task. This indicates the achieved improvement in shifting spatial attention generalized to another situation requiring this capability.",

    "abstract": "As prevalence rates of Alzheimers disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, are projected to more than double by 2050, emphasis has been placed on early intervention strategies that target resilience mechanisms to delay or prevent the onset of clinical symptoms. Several neural mechanisms underlying brain resilience to AD have been proposed, including redundant neural connections between the posterior hippocampi (HC) and all other brain regions, and global functional connectivity of the left frontal cortex (LFC). It remains unknown, however, if regional redundancy of the HC and LFC underscores neural resilience in the presence of AD pathologies. From the ADNI database, 363 cognitively normal older adults (CN) (N = 220; 36% A{beta}+) and patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (N = 143; 51% A{beta}+) were utilized. Regional redundancy was calculated from resting state fMRI data using a graph theoretical approach by summing the direct and indirect paths (path lengths=1-4) between each ROI and its 262 functional connections. The results showed that A{beta}-status significantly disrupted posterior HC, but not anterior HC or LFC, redundancy. A{beta}- groups showed higher redundancy of the bilateral posterior HC than A{beta}+. In regard to redundancy-cognition relationships, higher posterior HC redundancy was related to better episodic memory performance, an effect which was primarily driven by the A{beta}- group. Despite the positive relationship between posterior HC redundancy and cognition, we did not find compelling evidence that redundancy of the posterior HC serves in a resilience manner, as posterior HC redundancy did not moderate the potentially deleterious relationship between A{beta} deposition and cognition. No relationships were found between anterior HC or LFC redundancy and cognitive performance. Together, these findings suggest that redundancy of the LFC does not underpin its role in resilience and that posterior HC redundancy may capture disruptions to network connectivity that occur as a result of A{beta} deposition.",

    "abstract": "Variations in image intensities and contrasts between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions affect the subsequent image processing and its derived outcomes. Therefore, comparability between acquisitions is improved if we reduce these variations. This is especially relevant for longitudinal studies where a change of scanner or acquisition protocol often happens between subsequent examinations. In this study, we use a robust intensity distribution alignment (RIDA) method to reduce between-scan effects and improve longitudinal volume change estimates between two MRI scanners - Siemens 1.5T Avanto and 3T Skyra. The method is based on MRI T1w images acquired in close succession and robustly aligns two cumulative distribution functions of voxel intensities to harmonize image intensities and improve image-derived outcomes of a range of subcortical brain. We compare RIDA with volume-based correction - a simple linear regression model. In both cases, we derive intensity and volume transformations from a training dataset of 20 participants scanned on both scanners on the same day and apply to an independent longitudinal test dataset of 243 participants. All participants in the test set were scanned at the Avanto scanner at the baseline and then at the Avanto and Skyra scanners on the same day at the follow-up, on average 4.4 years (sd = 0.5 years) later. This allowed us to directly assess the effect of scanner and protocol change on the longitudinal change estimates. Eight subcortical brain regions were segmented using SAMSEG, and annualized symmetrized percent change in volume between time points was calculated. We find that RIDA significantly reduces between-scan effects and improves longitudinal volume estimates for the amygdala and lateral ventricles. It also reduces between-scan effects for caudate, putamen, and thalamus, but not as much as linear regression models. Whether the method will be useful for a particular study will depend on the image intensity profiles of the scans. Therefore, a pilot study of double-scanned participants is recommended to assess the advantages of the method for the analysis in question.",

    "abstract": "To develop reparative therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), we need to better understand the physiology of loss and replacement of oligodendrocytes, the cells that make myelin and the target of damage in MS. In vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy allows direct visualization of oligodendrocytes in transgenic mouse models, and promises a deeper understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of replacing oligodendrocytes after damage. However, the task of tracking oligodendrocytes requires extensive human effort and is especially challenging in three-dimensional images. While several models exist for automatically annotating cells in two-dimensional images, few models exist to annotate cells in three-dimensional images and even fewer are designed for tracking cells in longitudinal imaging. Furthermore, the complexity of processes and myelin formed by individual oligodendrocytes can result in the failure of algorithms that are specifically designed for tracking cell bodies alone. Here, we propose a novel beta-mixture unsupervised oligodendrocyte segmentation system (BOSS) that can segment and track oligodendrocytes in three-dimensional images over time that requires minimal human input. We evaluated the performance of the BOSS model on a set of eight images obtained longitudinally. We showed that the BOSS model can segment and track oligodendrocytes similarly to a blinded human observer. Our method offers many advantages, as it does not require fully curated data, reduces computational time, and most importantly recapitulates cell dynamic patterns observed by manually tracking oligodendrocytes. Although BOSS was developed to apply to our studies on oligodendrocytes, we anticipate that it can be modified to study four-dimensional in vivo data of any brain cell.",

However, the precise mechanism by which pathogenic Rickettsia elude host immune defense responses remains to be determined. Here, we observed that pathogenic R. typhi and R. rickettsii, but not non-pathogenic R. montanensis become ubiquitinated and induce autophagy upon entry into bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Moreover, unlike R. montanensis, R. typhi, and R. rickettsii colocalized with LC3B but not with Lamp2 upon host cell entry. Finally, we observed that pathogenic but not non-pathogenic Rickettsia reduce pro-inflammatory IL-1 responses. In sum, we identified a previously unappreciated pathway by which pathogenic, but not non-pathogenic, Rickettsia become ubiquitinated and induced autophagy, but avoided autophagolysosomal destruction as well as inflammasome-mediated anti-microbicidal IL-1 cytokine responses to establish an intracytosolic niche in macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a globally distributed zoonotic protozoan parasite that causes moderate to severe, sometime deadly, watery diarrhea in humans and animals, for which fully effective treatments are yet unavailable. In the study of mechanism of action of drugs against intracellular pathogens, it is important to validate whether the observed anti-infective activity is attributed to the drug action on the pathogen (on-target effect) or host cells (off-target effect). For the epicellular Cryptosporidium, we have previously developed a concept that the host cells with significantly increased drug tolerance by transient overexpression of the multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1) could be utilized to evaluate whether an observed anti-cryptosporidial activity of an inhibitor was attributed to the action of the inhibitor on the parasite or host cell targets. However, the transient transfection model was only applicable to evaluating inhibitors that were MDR1 substrates. Here we report an advanced model using stable MDR1-transgenic HCT-8 cells that allowed continuous application of drug pressure for rapid development of novel resistance to non-MDR1 substrates. Using the new model, we successfully validated that nitazoxanide, the only FDA-approved drug to treat human cryptosporidiosis and non-MDR1 substrate, killed C. parvum by fully acting on the parasite target (100% on-target). We also confirmed that paclitaxel acted fully on-target, while several other inhibitors including mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, vincristine and ivermectin acted partially on-target. Additionally, we developed mathematical models to quantify the proportional contributions of on-target and off-target effects to the observed anti-cryptosporidial activity and to evaluate the relationships between antiparasitic efficacy (ECi), cytotoxicity (TCi), safety interval (SI) and Hill slope (h) parameters. Owning to the promiscuity of the MDR1 efflux pump, the MDR1-transgenic host cell model could be applied to assess the on/off-target effects of newly hits/leads, either substrates or non-substrates of MDR1, against Cryptosporidium or other epicellular pathogens.\n\nAuthor SummaryCryptosporidium parvum is an important zoonotic parasite, for which fully effective treatments are unavailable. Anti-cryptosporidial drug discovery faces many challenges and technical difficulties. One obstacle is the lack of tools to assess whether the killing of C. parvum by an inhibitor is attributed to the action of the inhibitor on the parasite or on host cells. To address this question, we developed an MDR1-transgenic host cell line that allowed rapid development of drug resistance by applying continuous drug pressure. By analyzing the antiparasitic activity and cytotoxicity between wild-type and drug-resistant host cells, we verified that nitazoxanide (the only FDA-approved drug for treating cryptosporidiosis) and paclitaxel (anti-cryptosporidial lead) killed the parasite by acting fully on the parasite, whereas mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, vincristine and ivermectin killed the parasite by acting on both the parasite and host cells. We also developed algorithms to quantify the percent contributions of actions on the parasite and host cells to the observed anti-cryptosporidial activity. In summary, we developed novel in vitro and mathematical models for evaluating/quantifying the on/off-target effects of anti-cryptosporidial drugs. The models are also applicable to evaluate/quantify the drug actions on other epicellular pathogens.",

Our goal was to investigate the traits and ecological processes that affect plastic dispersal responses within an insect-host system undergoing human-induced rapid evolutionary change (HIREC). Since the 1960s, populations of the red-shouldered soapberry bug from Florida, USA, originally feeding on the seeds of Cardiospermum corindum on the islands, quickly adapted to feeding on an invasive, ornamental tree, Koelreuteria elegans, on the mainland, which led to host-specific wing polyphenism. Here, we measured the morphology of >3,500 soapberry bugs field collected from 2013 to 2020 and the flight performance of 378 total soapberry bugs tested in a flight mill during Fall 2019 and Winter 2020. Flight tests showed females and mainland natives exhibited variable flight responses mediated by mass, while males were consistent, wing-dependent flyers. However, historical specimens showed annual rises in flightless morphs for males and dwindling wing-to-body sizes for island natives since 2013. Despite uncertain future fitness consequences, plasticity could help predict mobility character and agent dispersal behavior and ultimately help identify whether recent trends signal adjustment or maladaptation to HIREC.",

    "abstract": "Comparative phylogenetic studies based on 2D image data can reveal macroevolutionary patterns and processes by integrating phylogenetic and ecological analyses. The advent of high-throughput imaging facilities has led to the accumulation of large image datasets; however, large-scale data extraction and analysis using these resources can be labour- and computation-intensive. Moreover, there are few standardized methods to analyse multitrait image-based data in a phylogenetic framework. Several packages in the R statistical environment offer utilities for processing and analysing large-scale image data. Techniques for the comparative phylogenetic analysis of multitrait data have also been introduced in other packages. However, most of these approaches are specialized for discrete purposes, and there is a lack of streamlined and efficient methodological pipelines integrating features across packages. Here, we present multEvol, an interactive pipeline for the extraction and phylogenetic analysis of shape and colour pattern data from 2D images in the R statistical computing environment. Using this pipeline, shape outlines and colour pattern data for multiple colours can be extracted, visualised, and compared in a phylogenetic framework. Using various utilities provided in the phytools, RNiftyReg, Momocs, patternize, convevol, and geiger packages, we introduce an interactive interface that allows user inputs for iterative data extraction. This pipeline provides an efficient method for the bulk processing of images of biological specimens from museum collections. As such, it has potential applications in the large-scale morphometric analysis of museum specimens to reveal macroevolutionary patterns in ecology, evolution and integrative biology.",

    "abstract": "Methylation of cytosines is the prototypic epigenetic modification of the DNA. It has been implicated in various regulatory mechanisms throughout the animal kingdom and particularly in vertebrates. We mapped DNA methylation in 580 animal species (535 vertebrates, 45 invertebrates), resulting in 2443 genome-scale, base-resolution DNA methylation profiles of primary tissue samples from various organs. Reference-genome independent analysis of this comprehensive dataset quantified the association of DNA methylation with the underlying genomic DNA sequence throughout vertebrate evolution. We observed a broadly conserved link with two major transitions - once in the first vertebrates and again with the emergence of reptiles. Cross-species comparisons focusing on individual organs supported a deeply conserved association of DNA methylation with tissue type, and cross-mapping analysis of DNA methylation at gene promoters revealed evolutionary changes for orthologous genes with conserved DNA methylation patterns. In summary, this study establishes a large resource of vertebrate and invertebrate DNA methylomes, it showcases the power of reference-free epigenome analysis in species for which no reference genomes are available, and it contributes an epigenetic perspective to the study of vertebrate evolution.",

    "abstract": "RNA velocity analysis of single cells promises to predict temporal dynamics from gene expression. Indeed, in many systems, it has been observed that RNA velocity produces a vector field that qualitatively reflects known features of the system. Despite this observation, the limitations of RNA velocity estimates are poorly understood. Using real data and simulations, we dissect the impact of different steps in the RNA velocity workflow on the estimated vector field. We find that the process of mapping RNA velocity estimates into a low-dimensional representation, such as those produced by UMAP, has a large impact on the result. The RNA velocity vector field strongly depends on the k-NN graph of the data. This dependence leads to significant estimator errors when the k-NN graph is not a faithful representation of the true data structure, a feature that cannot be known for most real datasets. Finally, we establish that RNA velocity estimates expression speed neither at the gene nor cellular level. We propose that RNA velocity is best considered a smoothed interpolation of the observed k-NN structure, as opposed to an extrapolation of future cellular states, and that the use of RNA velocity as a validation of latent space embedding structures is circular.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian mitochondria, mRNAs are co-transcriptionally stabilized by the protein factor LRPPRC. Here, we characterize LRPPRC as an mRNA delivery factor and report its cryo-EM structure in complex with SLIRP, mRNA and the mitoribosome. The structure shows that LRPPRC associates with the mitoribosomal proteins mS39 and the N-terminus of mS31 through recognition of the LRPPRC helical repeats. Together, the proteins form a corridor for hand-off the mRNA. The mRNA is directly bound to SLIRP, which also has a stabilizing function for LRPPRC. To delineate the effect of LRPPRC on individual mitochondrial transcripts, we used an RNAseq approach, metabolic labeling and mitoribosome profiling that showed a major influence on ND1, ND2, ATP6, COX1, COX2, and COX3 mRNA translation efficiency. Our data suggest that LRPPRC-SLIRP acts in recruitment of mitochondrial mRNAs to modulate their translation. Collectively, the data define LRPPRC-SLIRP as a regulator of the mitochondrial gene expression system.",

    "abstract": "Although delayed wound healing is an important clinical complication in diabetic patients, few targeted treatments are available, and it remains challenging to promote diabetic wound healing. Impaired neovascularization is one of the prime characteristics of the diabetic phenotype of delayed wound healing. Additionally, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chronic low-grade inflammation and hypoxia are associated with diabetes, which disrupts mechanisms of wound healing. We developed lignin composites with multiple wound healing-promotive functions, including pro-angiogenesis, sustained oxygenation from calcium peroxide (CaO2)-based oxygen releasing nanoparticles and ROS-scavenging with thiolated lignosulfonate that captures the elevated ROS in diabetic wounds. The sustained release of oxygen and ROS-scavenging by the lignin composites promoted endothelial cell branching and their reorganization into characteristic network formation in vitro, promoted angiogenic growth factor expression and angiogenesis in full thickness skin wounds tested in a diabetic murine model of delayed wound healing, and decreased hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) expression. These effects significantly increased the granulation tissue deposition and tissue repair. Our findings demonstrate that lignin composites promote diabetic wound healing without use of other drugs and show the potential of functionalized lignosulfonate for wound healing applications requiring balanced antioxidation and controlled oxygen release.",

    "abstract": "Computational modeling has become a central aspect of research in the cognitive neurosciences. As the field matures, it is increasingly important to move beyond standard models to quantitatively assess models with richer dynamics that may better reflect underlying cognitive and neural processes. For example, sequential sampling models (SSMs) are a general class of models of decision making intended to capture processes jointly giving rise to reaction time distributions and choice data in n-alternative choice paradigms. A number of model variations are of theoretical interest, but empirical data analysis has historically been tied to a small subset for which likelihood functions are analytically tractable. Advances in methods designed for likelihood-free inference have recently made it computationally feasible to consider a much larger spectrum of sequential sampling models. In addition, recent work has motivated the combination of SSMs with reinforcement learning (RL) models, which had historically been considered in separate literatures. Here we provide a significant addition to the widely used HDDM Python toolbox and include a tutorial for how users can easily fit and assess a (user extensible) wide variety of SSMs, and how they can be combined with RL models. The extension comes batteries included, including model visualization tools, posterior predictive checks, and ability to link trial-wise neural signals with model parameters via hierarchical Bayesian regression.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale organization of functional connectivity (FC) -- the functional connectome -- traverses distinct spatial patterns in a dynamic trajectory as demonstrated independently in fMRI and electrophysiological studies. These patterns are thought to satisfy ever-changing processing demands. FMRI and electrophysiology capture partly non-overlapping neural populations at different timescales, and it remains unknown to what degree the dynamic connectome trajectories across the two modalities are associated. We sought to clarify this relationship by studying resting wakefulness in a rare concurrent intracranial EEG and functional MRI dataset (iEEG-fMRI; 9 human neurosurgical patients) and in whole-brain connectomes obtained from source-localized EEG-fMRI (26 healthy humans). We measured \"spatial convergence\" as cross-modal spatial similarity of connectome configurations at a given time, and \"temporal convergence\" as synchronous occurrence of spatial convergence. We investigated three possible scenarios characterizing the cross-modal association of connectome trajectories: I) spatially and temporally convergent, II) spatially convergent but temporally divergent, and III) spatially and temporally divergent. We found that the behavior of fMRI and iEEG/EEG is consistent with scenario II: connectome trajectories spatially converge at intermittent times. Importantly, such asynchronous spatial convergence of connectome configurations was driven by cross-modally matched recurrent connectome states, independently across electrophysiological timescales. This connectome-level multi-frequency spatial convergence and temporal divergence suggests that hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals capture distinct aspects of FC, rather than serving as intermodal measurements of the same phenomenon. The multitude of flexible trajectories across timescales may concurrently enable FC across multiple independent sets of distributed brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Tinnitus is a phantom sound perception affecting both auditory and limbic structures. The mechanisms of tinnitus remain unclear and it is debatable whether tinnitus alters attention to sound and the ability to inhibit repetitive sounds, a phenomenon also known as auditory gating. Here we investigate if noise exposure interferes with auditory gating and whether natural extracts of cannabis or nicotine could improve auditory pre-attentional processing in noise-exposed mice. We used 22 male C57BL/6J mice divided into noise-exposed (exposed to a 9-11 kHz narrow band noise for 1 hour) and sham (no sound during noise exposure) groups. Hearing thresholds were measured using auditory brainstem responses, and tinnitus-like behavior was assessed using Gap prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle. After noise exposure, mice were implanted with multi-electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus to assess auditory event-related potentials in response to paired clicks. The results showed that mice with tinnitus-like behavior displayed auditory gating of repetitive clicks, but with larger amplitudes and longer latencies of the N40 component of the aERP waveform. The combination of cannabis extract and nicotine improved auditory gating ratio in noise-exposed mice without permanent hearing threshold shifts. Lastly, the longer latency of the N40 component appears due to an increased sensitivity to cannabis extract in noise-exposed mice compared to sham mice. The study suggests that the altered central plasticity in tinnitus is more sensitive to the combined actions on the cholinergic and the endocannabinoid systems. Overall, the findings contribute to a better understanding of pharmacological modulation of auditory sensory gating.",

Here we show that metformin and empagliflozin elicit proinflammatory responses on mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages with single agent challenge, which are modulated when added in combination. In-silico docking experiments suggested that empagliflozin can interact with both TLR2 and DECTIN1 receptors and we observed that both empagliflozin and metformin increase expression of Tlr2 and Clec7a. Thus, findings from this study suggest that metformin and empagliflozin as single agents or in combination can directly modulate inflammatory gene expression in macrophages and upregulate the expression of their receptors.",

Mature C. sinensis specimens were continuously cultivated in our laboratory (altitude 2,200 m). The SFPs (with ascocarps) and ascospores of C. sinensis were collected for microscopic and molecular analyses using species-/genotype-specific primers. Sequences of mutant genotypes of O. sinensis were aligned with that of Genotype #1 Hirsutella sinensis and compared phylogenetically using a Bayesian majority-rule method.\n\nResultsFully and semiejected ascospores were collected from the same specimens. The semiejected ascospores tightly adhered to the surface of the asci as observed by the naked eye and under optical and confocal microscopies. The multicellular heterokaryotic ascospores showed uneven staining of nuclei. The immature and mature stromata, SFPs (with ascocarps) and ascospores were found to differentially contain several GC- and AT-biased genotypes of O. sinensis, Samsoniella hepiali, and an AB067719-type fungus. The genotypes within AT-biased Cluster-A in the Bayesian tree occurred in all compartments of C. sinensis, but those within AT-biased Cluster-B were present in immature and mature stromata and SPFs but absent in the ascospores. Genotype #13 of O. sinensis was present in semi-ejected ascospores and Genotype #14 in fully ejected ascospores. GC-biased Genotypes #13-14 featured large DNA segment substitutions and genetic material recombination between the genomes of the parental fungi (H. sinensis and the AB067719-type fungus). These ascosporic offspring genotypes combined with varying abundances of S. hepiali in the 2 types of ascospores participated in the control of the development, maturation and ejection of the ascospores.\n\nConclusionMultiple genotypes of O. sinensis coexist differentially in the stromata, SFPs and 2 types of C. sinensis ascospores, along with S. hepiali and the AB067719-type fungus. The fungal components in different combinations and their dynamic alterations in the compartments of C. sinensis during maturation play symbiotic roles in the lifecycle of natural C. sinensis.",

    "abstract": "Introductory ParagraphIn many species, including Arabidopsis, heterochromatin often comprises repetitive DNA elements, such as arrays of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Repetitive regions pose a risk in meiosis since recombination between them can lead to gross genomic rearrangements. However, meiotic recombination at rDNA arrays and other heterochromatic repeat regions is blocked by not well understood mechanisms. Here, we have identified RAD21.2, an -kleisin subunit of cohesin, as a repressor of meiotic recombination at the rDNA regions in Arabidopsis. We show that RAD21.2 co-localizes with heterochromatic factors and is specifically enriched at rDNA repeats, which are devoid of the meiosis specific -kleisin REC8, needed for recombination. Knocking down RAD21.2, we find that REC8 moves into the nucleolus organizing regions (NORs), where we see an increase of RAD51 recombinase foci numbers. Concomitantly, we find extensive rearrangements of the NORs and the offspring of these plants have large variation in rDNA copy numbers demonstrating that RAD21.2 is necessary for transgenerational genome stability.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe cohesin component RAD21.2 represses meiotic recombination and by that contributes to genome stability over generations.",

    "abstract": "AimTo investigate if the artificial delivery of microRNAs naturally present in the breastmilk can impact the gut and brain of young rats according to weaning.\n\nMethodsAnimals from a new transgenic rat line expressing green-fluorescent protein in the endocrine lineage (cholecystokinin expressing cells) received at Day-12, near neural diversification, a single oral bolus of mir-320-3p or miR-375-3p, embedded in DiOleyl-Succinyl-Paromomycin (DOSP), and were further early (Day-15) or regularly (Day-30) weaned. Relevant miRNA (miR-320-3p, miR-375-3p, miR-375-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-132-3p, miR-504), polr3d, hspb6, inflammation, enteroendocrine, and circadian clock-related mRNAs, chromatin complexes, and duodenal cell density were assayed at 8h post-inoculation and at Day-45.\n\nResultsThe miR-320-3p/DOSP induced immediate effects on H3K4me3 chromatin complexes with polr3d promoter (p<0.05) but no long-term effects. On regular weaning, at Day-45, both miR-320-3p and 375-3p were down-regulated in the stomach, up-regulated in the hypothalamus (p<0.001) but only miR-320-3p was up-regulated in the duodenum. After early weaning, the miR-320-3p and miR-375-3p levels were down-regulated in the stomach and the duodenum, but up-regulated in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Combining miR-320-3p/DOSP with early weaning enhanced miR-320-3p and chromogranin A expression in the duodenum. In the hippocampus, the miR-504 was down-regulated for both sexes, but in the brain stem, up regulated only for females, along with miR-320-3p and miR-16-5p levels. In the hypothalamus, clock levels were up regulated for both sexes. In the miR-375-3p/DOSP group, the density of enteroendocrine duodenal cells increased. The long-term effect of miR-375-3p/DOSP was more limited, according to the fourfold lower number of predicted targets than with miR-320-3p.\n\nConclusionAddressing oral miRNA-320-3p loads to duodenal cell lineage is paving the way for the design of new therapeutics, manipulating long term consequences of early life stress.",

    "abstract": "Several pathogens sustain themselves inside the host by mimicking short linear motifs (SLiMs) of the host proteins. SLiMs are short stretches of 3-10 amino acids which are functionally diverse and mediate various signaling and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Hence, mimicry of the host- SLiMs helps the microbes in modulating/disrupting the host defense mechanisms. This is the first report investigating the evolutionary characteristics and presence of eukaryotic host-like SLiMs in microbial peptides (mimitopes). Evaluation of the selection pressure revealed that 60% of the bacterial and 25% of the viral mimitopes which overlapped with the host-like SLiMs were evolutionarily conserved ({omega} < 1). Interestingly, host-like SLiMs were abundant in mimicry proteins but were less frequent in microbial mimitopes. This reflects that the majority of the pathogens cannot potentially rewire the host PPI networks for their advantage, but some can. Of the 152 bacterial and 43 viral mimitopes investigated only 10 bacterial and 4 viral mimitopes showed SLiMs. This indicates that mimitopes of some pathogens can be explored as novel drug targets for eliminating the etiopathological agent and treating the autoimmune disease, thereof. The repertoire of mimitopes identified here might provide important clues for the discovery of new drugs/protein-based immune-modulatory molecules against the pathogens.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMimicry of the host- SLiMs helps the microbes in modulating/disrupting the host defense mechanisms.\nC_LIO_LIHost-like SLiMs were abundant in mimicry proteins but were less frequent in microbial mimitopes.\nC_LIO_LIEvaluation of the selection pressure revealed that 60% of the bacterial and 25% of the viral mimitopes which overlapped with the host-like SLiMs were evolutionarily conserved.\nC_LI",

The organic coenzyme thiamine diphosphate (TDP) is supplied as needed and controlled by a riboswitch sensing mechanism in plants through the circadian regulated THIC gene. Riboswitch disruption leads to loss of time-of-day regulation of THIC expression, negatively impacting plant fitness. Pathway precursor balancing combined with enhancing the biosynthesis pathway demonstrate the importance of the riboswitch in gauging TDP levels and indicate that TDP impacts the clock in Arabidopsis. Altering the phase of THIC expression to be synchronous with TDP transporters disrupts the precision of the riboswitch suggesting that temporal separation of these processes is important. All defects are bypassed by growing plants under continuous light conditions highlighting the need to control levels of this coenzyme under diel cycles. Thus, consideration of coenzyme homeostasis within the well-studied domain of metabolic homeostasis is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Enriching plant tissues in phytonutrients can be done by stimulating their biosynthesis but also by providing appropriate sink structures for their sequestering and storage. Chromoplasts are plastids specialized in the production and accumulation of carotenoids that are naturally formed in non-photosynthetic tissues such as flower petals and ripe fruit. Chromoplasts can also be artificially differentiated from leaf chloroplasts by boosting the production of phytoene (the first committed intermediate of the carotenoid pathway) with the bacterial phytoene synthase crtB. Here we show that crtB-induced leaf chromoplasts develop plastoglobules harboring high levels of carotenoids (mainly phytoene and pro-vitamin A {beta}-carotene) but also other nutritionally-relevant isoprenoids such as tocopherols (vitamin E) and phylloquinone (vitamin K1). Further promoting plastoglobule proliferation by exposure to intense (high) light resulted in a higher accumulation of these health-related metabolites but also an acceleration of the chloroplast-to-chromoplast conversion. We further show that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulates chromoplastogenesis. Our data suggest that, similar to that already described for decreased photosynthesis and enhanced carotenoid biosynthesis, ROS production is not just a consequence but a promoter of the chromoplast differentiation process.",

Amyloids of the amyloid-{beta} peptide or the protein -synuclein are traditionally considered hallmarks of Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, respectively. However, the co-occurrence of amyloids of these proteins has also been reported in patients diagnosed with either disease. Here, we show that soluble species containing amyloid-{beta} can induce the aggregation of -synuclein. Fibrils formed under these conditions are solely composed of -synuclein to which amyloid-{beta} can be found associated, but not as part of the core of the fibrils. Importantly, by global kinetic analysis, we found that the aggregation of -synuclein under these conditions occurs via heterogeneous primary nucleation, triggered by soluble aggregates containing amyloid-{beta}.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a crucial component for the proper maintenance of chromatin structure and function. It has been proposed that HP1 functions through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which allows it to sequester and compact chromatin into transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin regions. In vitro, HP1 can form phase separated liquid droplets upon phosphorylation of its N-terminus extension (NTE) and/or through interactions with DNA and chromatin. While it is known that LLPS requires homodimerization of HP1 and that it involves interactions between the positively charged hinge region of HP1 and the negatively charged phosphorylated NTE or nucleic acid, the precise molecular details of this process and its regulation are still unclear. Here, we combine computational modeling and experimental approaches to elucidate the phase separation properties of HP1 under phosphorylation-driven and DNA-driven LLPS conditions. We also tune these properties using peptides from four HP1 binding partners (Sgo1, CAF-1, LBR, and H3). In phosphorylation-driven LLPS, HP1 can exchange intradimer hinge-NTE interactions with interdimer contacts, which also leads to a structural change from a compacted to an extended HP1 dimer conformation. This process can be enhanced by the presence of positively charged peptide ligands such as Sgo1 and H3 and disrupted by the addition of negatively charged or neutral peptides such as LBR and CAF-1. In DNA-driven LLPS, both positively and negatively charged peptide ligands can perturb phase separation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of electrostatic interactions in the LLPS of HP1 where binding partners can modulate the overall charge of the droplets and screen or enhance hinge region interactions through specific and non-specific effects. Our study illuminates the complex molecular framework that can fine tune the properties of HP1 and that can contribute to heterochromatin regulation and function.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe spontaneous action potential (AP) firing rate of sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC) is regulated by a system of intracellular Ca2+ and membrane ion current clocks driven by Ca2+-calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. The mean AP cycle length (APCL) and APCL variability inform on the effectiveness of clock coupling. Endogenous ATP metabolite adenosine (ado) binds to adenosine receptors that couple to Gi protein-coupled receptors, reducing spontaneous AP firing rate via G{beta}{gamma} signaling that activates an membrane-clock outward current, IKACh. Ado also inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity via Gi signaling, impacting cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent protein phosphorylation and intracellular Ca2+ cycling. We hypothesize that in addition to IKAdo activation, ado signaling impacts Ca2+ via Gi signaling and that both effects reduce AP firing rate by reducing the effectiveness of the Ca2+ and membrane clock coupling. To this end, we measured Ca2+ and membrane potential characteristics in enzymatically isolated single rabbit SANC. 10 {micro}M ado substantially increased both the mean APCL (on average by 43%, n=10) and AP beat-to-beat variability from 5.1{+/-}1.7% to 7.2{+/-}2.0% (n=10) measured via membrane potential and 5.0{+/-}2.2 to 10.6{+/-}5.9 (n=40) measured via Ca2+ (assessed as the coefficient of variability, CV=SD/mean). These effects were mediated by hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic membrane potential (membrane clock effect) and suppression of diastolic spontaneous, local Ca2+ releases (LCRs) (Ca2+ clock effect): as LCR size distributions shifted from larger to smaller values, the time of LCR occurrence during diastolic depolarization (LCR period) became prolonged, and the ensemble LCR Ca2+ signal became reduced. The tight linear relationship of coupling between LCR period to the APCL in the presence of ado \"drifted\" upward and leftward, i.e. for a given LCR period, APCL was prolonged, becoming non-linear indicating clock uncoupling. An extreme case of uncoupling occurred at higher ado concentrations (>100 {micro}M): small stochastic LCRs of the Ca2+ clock failed to self-organize and synchronize to the membrane clock, thus creating a failed attempt to generate an AP resulting in arrhythmia and cessation of AP firing. Thus, the effects of ado to activate G{beta}{gamma} and IKACh, Ado and to activate Gi, suppressing adenylyl cyclase activity, both contribute to the ado-induced increase in the mean APCL and APCL variability by reducing the fidelity of clock coupling and AP firing rate.",

Through opto-physiological experiments, we discover that Chrna5+ neurons contain a distinct population of acetylcholine super-responders. Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics, we discover molecular markers conferring subplate identity on this subset. We determine that Chrna5+ super-responders express a unique complement of GPI-anchored lynx prototoxin genes (Lypd1, Ly6g6e, and Lypd6b), predicting distinct nicotinic receptor regulation. To manipulate lynx regulation of endogenous nicotinic responses, we developed a pharmacological strategy guided by transcriptomic predictions. Overall, we reveal Chrna5-Cre mice as a transgenic tool to target the diversity of subplate neurons in adulthood, yielding new molecular strategies to manipulate their cholinergic activation relevant to attention disorders.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi can sense useful resources and hazards in their environment and direct growth of their hyphae accordingly. Chemotropism ensures access to nutrients, contact with other individuals (e.g., for mating), and interaction with hosts in the case of pathogens. Previous studies have revealed a complex chemotropic sensing landscape during host-pathogen interactions, but the underlying molecular machinery remains poorly characterized. Here we studied mechanisms controlling directed hyphal growth of the important plant-pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae towards different chemoattractants. We found that the homologs of the Rag GTPase Gtr1 and the GTPase-activating protein Tsc2, an activator and a repressor of the TOR kinase respectively, play important roles in hyphal chemotropism towards nutrients, plant-derived signals, and heterologous -pheromone of Fusarium oxysporum. Furthermore, important roles of these regulators were identified in fungal development and pathogenicity. We also found that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Fus3 is required for chemotropism towards nutrients, while the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Ste2 and the MAPK Slt2 control chemosensing of plant-derived signals and -pheromone. Our study establishes V. dahliae as a suitable model for the analysis of fungal chemotropism and discovers new components of chemotropic signaling, during growth and host-pathogen interactions of V. dahliae.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have diverse defences against phages. In response, jumbo phages evade multiple DNA-targeting defences by protecting their DNA inside a nucleus-like structure. We previously demonstrated that RNA-targeting type III CRISPR-Cas systems provide jumbo phage immunity by recognising viral mRNA exported from the nucleus for translation. Here, we demonstrate that recognition of phage mRNA by the type III system activates a cyclic triadenylate-dependent accessory nuclease, NucC. Although unable to access phage DNA in the nucleus, NucC degrades the bacterial chromosome, triggers cell death, and disrupts phage replication and maturation. Hence, type III-mediated jumbo phage immunity occurs via abortive infection, with suppression of the viral epidemic protecting the population. We further show that type III systems targeting jumbo phages have diverse accessory nucleases, including RNases that provide immunity. Our study demonstrates how type III CRISPR-Cas systems overcome the inaccessibility of jumbo phage DNA to provide robust immunity.",

    "abstract": "Alphaviruses, such as Sindbis virus and Chikungunya virus, are RNA viruses with a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome that infect various vertebrates including humans. A conserved sequence element (CSE) of [~]19 nucleotides (nts) in the 3 non-coding region is important for replication. Despite extensive mutational analysis of the CSE no comprehensive model of this element exists to date. Here it is shown that the CSE can form an RNA pseudoknot with part of the polyA tail and is similar to the human telomerase peudoknot with which it shares 17 nts. Mutants that alter the stability of the pseudoknot were investigated in the context of a replicon of Sindbis virus and by native gel electrophoresis. These studies reveal that the pseudoknot is required for virus replication and is stabilized by UAU base triples. The new model is discussed in relation to previous data on Sindbis virus mutants and revertants lacking (part of) the CSE.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes represent a major fraction of marine biomass and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. We studied the vertical profiles (from surface down to the bathypelagic realm) of abundance, cytometric signatures, and activity of prokaryotic communities along a productivity gradient in the subtropical and tropical Atlantic to assess whether there is a vertical linkage between surface productivity regimes and deep ocean prokaryotic communities. We found that latitudinal changes in the vertical patterns of cytometric variables were coupled with surface productivity: higher prokaryotic abundances and viabilities, and smaller cell sizes were observed below highly productive surface waters, an effect reaching down to the bathypelagic layer. On the contrary, leucine uptake rates in deep waters showed no clear relationship with surface productivity. Changes in resource and energy allocation to growth vs. maintenance in hostile environments, cell-size-dependent metabolic requirements and variability in leucine to carbon conversion may all be part of the array of factors involved in controlling prokaryotic activity patterns that were measured. Our work adds to the recent findings that highlight the importance of vertical connectivity for prokaryotic communities in the dark ocean.",

    "abstract": "Thermokarst lagoons represent the transition state from a freshwater lacustrine to a marine environment, and receive little attention regarding their role for greenhouse gas production and release in Arctic permafrost landscapes. We studied the fate of methane (CH4) in sediments of a thermokarst lagoon in comparison to two thermokarst lakes on the Bykovsky Peninsula in northeastern Siberia through the analysis of sediment CH4 concentrations and isotopic signature, methane-cycling microbial taxa, sediment geochemistry, and lipid biomarkers. We specifically assessed whether sulfate-driven anaerobic methane oxidation (S-AOM) through anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANMEs), common in marine sediments with constant supply of sulfate and methane, establish after thermokarst lagoon development and whether sulfate-driven ANMEs consequently oxidize CH4 that would be emitted to the water column under thermokarst lake conditions. The marine-influenced lagoon environment had fundamentally different methane-cycling microbial communities and metabolic pathways compared to the freshwater lakes, suggesting a substantial reshaping of microbial and carbon dynamics during lagoon formation. Anaerobic sulfate-reducing ANME-2a/2b methanotrophs dominated the sulfate-rich sediments of the lagoon despite its known seasonal alternation between brackish and freshwater inflow. CH4 concentrations in the freshwater-influenced sediments averaged 1.34{+/-}0.98 {micro}mol g-1, with highly depleted {delta}13C-CH4 values ranging from -89{per thousand} to -70{per thousand}. In contrast, the sulfate-affected upper 300 cm of the lagoon exhibited low average CH4 concentrations of 0.011{+/-}0.005 {micro}mol g-1 with comparatively enriched {delta}13C-CH4 values of -54{per thousand} to -37{per thousand} pointing to substantial methane oxidation. Non-competitive methylotrophic methanogens dominated the methanogenic community of the lakes and the lagoon, independent of porewater chemistry and depth. This potentially contributed to the high CH4 concentrations observed in all sulfate-poor sediments. Our study shows that S-AOM in lagoon sediments can effectively reduce sediment CH4 concentrations and we conclude that thermokarst lake to lagoon transitions have the potential to mitigate terrestrial methane fluxes before thermokarst lakes fully transition to a marine environment.",

    "abstract": "Translatable circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as a crucial molecular format for transient protein expression, with high potential to be an alternative for linear mRNA to reshape the landscape of mRNA pharmaceutical industry. Canonical Anabaena permuted intron-exon (Ana PIE) format that developed by ORNA is an efficient method for RNA circularization, and the engineered circRNAs direct supreme protein expression in eukaryotic cells. However, recent studies revealed that this method may unavoidably result in a remain of immunogenicity in the circRNA products, albeit after thorough RNA purification. In the current study, we develop a novel strategy for efficient generation of circRNA, via the permuted T4Td introns mediated autocatalytically ribozymatic reaction mediated ligation of the flanking segment sequences that concealing in ORF or translation initiation sequence (normally equal to IRES). This strategy universally realizes around 90% circularization effectivity, and the circRNA products can be purified to around 90% purity by our new purification method, and presented thoroughly minimized immunogenicity, thus is termed \"Clean-PIE\". The purified circRNAs are found to direct potent and durable expression of various proteins in vitro and in vivo. The partly purified Fluc circRNA by HPLC-SEC was found to direct Fluc expression in muscle for no less than 20 days. The highly purified circRNA exhibits much stronger protein expression in vitro and in vivo, and presumed a longer duration. Additionally, the scale-up of RNA circularization with the RNA precursors from 1 L transcription revealed high circularization effectivity (around 90%) and a high productivity of the final circRNA products. Collectively, Clean-PIE is a novel circRNA platform that possesses high circularization effectivity, enabled high RNA purity and thoroughly minimized immunogenicity, as well as scaling-up accessibility and directing extreme durability of protein expression, thus has the potential to develop advanced RNA vaccines and therapeutics in pharmaceutical industrial scale.",

    "abstract": "Point mutations in LRRK2 cause Parkinsons Disease and augment LRRK2s kinase activity. However, cellular pathways that enhance LRRK2 kinase function have not been identified. While overexpressed Rab29 draws LRRK2 to Golgi membranes to increase LRRK2 kinase activity, there is little evidence that endogenous Rab29 performs this function under physiological conditions. Here we identify Rab38 as a novel physiological regulator of LRRK2. In mouse melanocytes, which express high levels of Rab38, Rab32, and Rab29, knockdown of Rab38 but not Rab32 or Rab29 decreases phosphorylation of multiple LRRK2 substrates, including Rab10 and Rab12, by both exogenous and endogenous LRRK2. In B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells, Rab38 drives LRRK2 membrane association, and overexpressed kinase-active but not kinase-inactive LRRK2 shows striking pericentriolar recruitment, which is dependent on the presence of endogenous Rab38 but not Rab32 or Rab29. Deletion or mutation of LRRK2 at the Rab38 binding site in the N-terminal armadillo domain decreases LRRK2 membrane association, pericentriolar recruitment, and ability to phosphorylate Rab10. Consistently, overexpression of LRRK2350-550, a fragment that encompasses the Rab38 binding site, blocks endogenous LRRK2s phosphorylation of Thr73-Rab10. Finally, disruption of BLOC-3, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab38 and 32, inhibits Rab38s regulation of LRRK2. In sum, our data identify Rab38 as a physiologic regulator of LRRK2 function and lend support to a model in which LRRK2 plays a central role in Rab GTPase coordination of vesicular trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Expansion mutations in polyalanine stretches are now associated with a growing number of human diseases with common genotypes and similar phenotypes 1-6. These similarities prompted us to query the normal function of physiological polyalanine stretches, and investigate whether a common molecular mechanism is involved in these diseases. Here, we show that UBA6, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme 7, 8, recognizes a polyalanine stretch within its cognate E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, USE1. Aberrations in this polyalanine stretch reduced ubiquitin transfer to USE1 and downstream target, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, E6AP. Intriguingly, we identified competition for the UBA6-USE1 interaction by various proteins with polyalanine expansion mutations in the disease state. In mouse primary neurons, the deleterious interactions of expanded polyalanine proteins with UBA6, alter the levels and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of E6AP, which in turn affected the levels of the synaptic protein, Arc. These effects could be observed in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived autonomic neurons from patients with polyalanine expansion mutations. Our results suggest a shared mechanism for such mutations, which may contribute to the congenital malformations seen in polyalanine diseases.",

    "abstract": "Phototoxicity is an important issue in fluorescence live imaging of light-sensitive cellular processes such as mitosis, especially in high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy that often requires high-intensity illumination. Among several approaches to reduce phototoxicity, the addition of antioxidants to the imaging media has been used as a simple and effective method. However, it remains unknown what are the optimal antioxidants that could prevent phototoxicity-induced defects during mitosis in fluorescence live cell microscopy. In this study, we analyzed the impact of phototoxicity on the mitotic progression in fluorescence live imaging of human diploid cells and performed a screen to identify the most efficient antioxidative agents that reduce it. Quantitative analysis shows that high amounts of light illumination cause various mitotic defects such as prolonged mitosis and delays of chromosome alignment and centrosome separation. Among several antioxidants known to reduce cellular phototoxicity, our screen reveals that ascorbic acid significantly alleviates these phototoxic effects in mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the addition of ascorbic acid to the imaging media enables fluorescence imaging of mitotic events at very high temporal resolution without obvious photodamage. Thus, this study provides a simple and practical method to effectively reduce the phototoxic effects on mitotic processes in fluorescence live cell imaging.",

While the importance of dimethylation of H3K4 mark for centromeric transcription has been highlighted in various studies, the identity of the enzyme(s) depositing these marks on the centromere is still unknown. The MLL (KMT2) family play a crucial role in RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated gene regulation by methylating H3K4. Here, we report that MLL family regulate transcription of human centromeres. CRISPR-mediated downregulation of MLL causes loss of H3K4me2, resulting in an altered epigenetic chromatin state of the centromeres. Intriguingly, our results reveal that loss of MLL, but not SETD1A, increases co-transcriptional R-loop formation, and Pol II accumulation at the centromeres. Finally we report that the presence of MLL and SETD1A is crucial for kinetochore maintenance. Altogether, our data reveals a novel molecular framework where both the H3K4 methylation mark and the methyltransferases regulate stability and identity of the centromere.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-intrinsic defence mechanisms eliminate aberrant cells from epithelia and thereby maintain the health of developing tissues or adult organisms.  Interface contractility comprises one such distinct mechanism that specifically guards against aberrant cells, which undergo inappropriate cell fate and differentiation programs. The cellular mechanisms which facilitate detection and elimination of these aberrant cells are currently unknown. We find that in Drosophila imaginal discs, interface contractility is associated with bilateral JNK activation at the clonal interface of wild type and aberrant cells. Bilateral JNK activation is unique to interface contractility and is not observed in other tissue-intrinsic defence mechanisms, such as cell-cell competition. We find that JNK is activated cell-autonomously by either of the contacting cell types and drives apoptotic elimination of cells at clonal interfaces. Ultimately, JNK interface signalling provides a collective tissue-level mechanism, which ensures elimination of aberrant, misspecified cells that cannot be identified by cell fitness criteria, as in cell-cell competition. Importantly, oncogenic Ras activates interface contractility but evades apoptotic elimination by bilateral JNK activation. Combined, our work establishes bilateral JNK interface signalling and interface apoptosis as a new hallmark of interface contractility, and it highlights how oncogenic mutations evade tumour suppressor function encoded by this tissue-intrinsic surveillance system.",

TMEM87 disruption has been implicated in cancers and developmental disorders. To better understand TMEM87 structure and function, we determined a cryo-EM structure of human TMEM87A in lipid nanodiscs. TMEM87A consists of a Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain atop a membrane spanning seven-transmembrane helix domain with a large cavity open to solution and the membrane outer leaflet. Structural and functional analyses suggest TMEM87A may not function as an ion channel or G-protein coupled receptor. We find TMEM87A shares its characteristic domain arrangement with seven other proteins in humans; three that had been identified as evolutionary related (TMEM87B, GPR107, and GPR108) and four previously unrecognized homologs (GPR180, TMEM145, TMEM181, and WLS)). Among these structurally related GOLD domain seven-transmembrane helix (GOST) proteins, WLS is best characterized as a membrane trafficking and secretion chaperone for lipidated Wnt signaling proteins. We find key structural determinants for WLS function are conserved in TMEM87A.

    "abstract": "Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, resulting in tumor genomes having large numbers of genetic aberrations, including homozygous deletions of protein coding genes. That tumor cells remain viable in the presence of such gene loss suggests high robustness to genetic perturbation. In model organisms and cancer cell lines, paralogs have been shown to contribute substantially to genetic robustness - they are generally more dispensable for growth than singletons. Here, by analyzing copy number profiles of >10,000 tumors, we test the hypothesis that the increased dispensability of paralogs shapes tumor genome evolution. We find that genes with paralogs are more likely to be homozygously deleted and that this cannot be explained by other factors known to influence copy number variation. Furthermore, features that influence paralog dispensability in cancer cell lines correlate with paralog deletion frequency in tumors. Finally, paralogs that are broadly essential in cancer cell lines are less frequently deleted in tumors than non-essential paralogs. Overall our results suggest that homozygous deletions of paralogs are more frequently observed in tumor genomes because paralogs are more dispensable.",

    "abstract": "(2S)-Naringenin is a key precursor for biosynthesis of various high-value flavonoids and possesses a variety of nutritional and pharmaceutical properties on human health. Systematic optimization approaches have been employed to improve (2S)-naringenin production in different microbial hosts. However, very few studies have focused on the spatiotemporal distribution of (2S)-naringenin and related pathway intermediate p-coumaric acid, which is an important factor for efficient production. Here, we show that fine-turning of p-coumaric acid synthesis enables alleviated cell burden and improved (2S)-naringenin production in yeast. First, we systematically optimized the (2S)-naringenin biosynthetic pathway by alleviating the bottleneck downstream of p-coumaric acid and increasing malonyl-CoA supply, which improved (2S)-naringenin production but significant amounts of p-coumaric acid still accumulated outside the cell. We further established a dual dynamic control system through combing a malonyl-CoA biosensor regulator and an RNAi strategy, to autonomously control the synthesis of p-coumaric acid and downregulate a pathway competing for malonyl-CoA. The optimized strains remarkably decreased extracellular accumulation of p-coumaric acid and simultaneously improved (2S)- naringenin production. Finally, production of 933 mg/L of (2S)-naringenin could be achieved by using minimal medium with negligible accumulation of p-coumaric acid. Our work highlights the importance of systematic control of pathway intermediates for efficient microbial production of plant natural products.",

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) share phenotypic and molecular commonalities, including the fact that they can be caused by mutations in ubiquitous proteins involved in RNA metabolism, namely SMN, TDP-43 and FUS. Although this suggests the existence of common disease mechanisms, there is currently no model to explain the resulting motor neuron dysfunction. In this work we generated a parallel set of Drosophila models for adult-onset RNAi and tagged neuronal expression of the fly orthologues of the three human proteins, named Smn, TBPH and Caz, respectively. We profiled nuclear and cytoplasmic bound mRNAs using a RIP-seq approach and characterized the transcriptome of the RNAi models by RNA-seq. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the common functional impact of these proteins on neuronal cells, we devised a computational approach based on the construction of a tissue-specific library of protein functional modules, selected by an overall impact score measuring the estimated extent of perturbation caused by each gene knockdown. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the three proteins do not bind to the same RNA molecules and that only a limited set of functionally unrelated transcripts is commonly affected by their knock-down. However, our integrative approach revealed they exert a concerted effect on protein functional modules, acting through distinct targets. Most strikingly, functional annotation revealed that these modules are involved in critical cellular pathways for motor neurons, including neuromuscular junction function. Furthermore, selected modules were found to be significantly enriched in orthologues of human neuronal disease genes. The results presented here show that SMA and ALS disease-associated genes linked to RNA metabolism functionally converge on neuronal protein complexes, providing a new hypothesis to explain the common motor neuron phenotype. The functional modules identified represent promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets, namely given their alteration in asymptomatic settings.",

    "abstract": "While many Bayesian state-space models for infectious disease processes focus on population infection dynamics (e.g., compartmental models), in this work we examine the evolution of infection processes and the complexities of the immune responses within the host using these techniques. We present a joint Bayesian state-space model to better understand how the immune system contributes to the control of Leishmania infantum infections over the disease course. We use longitudinal molecular diagnostic and clinical data of a cohort of dogs to describe population progression rates and present evidence for important drivers of clinical disease. Among these results, we find evidence for the importance of co-infection in disease progression. We also show that as dogs progress through the infection, parasite load is influenced by their age, ectoparasiticide treatment status, and serology. Furthermore, we present evidence that pathogen load information from an earlier point in time influences its future value and that the size of this effect varies depending on the clinical stage of the dog. In addition to characterizing the processes driving disease progression, we predict individual and aggregate patterns of Canine Leishmaniasis progression. Both our findings and the application to individual-level predictions are of direct clinical relevance, presenting possible opportunities for application in veterinary practice and motivating lines of additional investigation to better understand and predict disease progression. Finally, as an important zoonotic human pathogen, these results may support future efforts to prevent and treat human Leishmaniosis.\n\n1 AUTHOR SUMMARYThe immune system is a complex network that involves organs, cells, and proteins working together with the main purpose of protecting the body against harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins. To explore and study the responses of the host immune system during the course of a disease, we modeled the interaction between pathogen load, antibody responses, and the clinical presentation of this complex system. Specifically, we focused on Canine Leishmaniasis (CanL), a vector-borne disease caused by a parasite that affects internal organs of the body and is known to be fatal if patients remain untreated. In addition, we also considered the impact of possible co-infections with other diseases, which could potentially interact with many disease processes and contribute to different outcomes for infected subjects. With CanL specifically, we consider the presence of Borrelia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia,, and Heartworm. In general, one limitation in vaccination strategies is a focus on neutralizing antibodies, without incorporating the broader complexities of immune responses. Here, we explore this complexity by jointly considering the interaction between pathogen and antibody development with the purpose of improving our understanding of the processes of disease progression and natural immunity.\n\nIn this paper, we present a Bayesian model specification for immune responses to a Leishmania infection considering a tick-borne co-infection study. The model implementation is based on the general vector autoregressive (VAR) model, adapted to the problem under study. While the methodology around Bayesian VAR models is not new in the literature, in this work we adapt the more general VAR approach in a parsimonious way to a particular subclass of longitudinal problems. We believe our defined Bayesian model is useful to clinicians and veterinarians to better understand the immune responses and Leishmania infection control over time, which makes this work a novel application of Bayesian VAR models. We present evidence that pathogen load information from an earlier point in time influences its future value and that the size of this effect varies depending on the CanL clinical stage of the dog. In addition to characterizing evidence for the processes driving disease progression, we predict individual and aggregate patterns of CanL progression.\n\nThe structure of this paper starts in Section 2 with an introduction to CanL infection as well as a discussion of possible co-infection with other pathogens. In Section 3, we include a description of the motivating prospective study along with the measured individual-level variables, a definition of the clinical signs of leishmaniosis infection, and a description of the available data coming from the study. In addition, this section explains the dynamic process and corresponding model specification via Bayesian methodology and a statement of contribution. A summary of prior distributions for model parameters, model implementation details, and convergence diagnostics are also included. In Section 4, we provide summary results from the posterior distribution as well as a summary of the corresponding disease progression forecasts. In Section 5, we discuss the results and describe future considerations to improve and extend the model.",

    "abstract": "To identify novel cellular modulators of HIV-1 infection in IFN-stimulated myeloid cells, we have carried out a screen that combines functional and evolutionary analyses in THP-1-PMA cells that led us to the Tripartite Motif Protein 69 (Trim69), a poorly studied member of the Trim family of innate immunity regulators. Trim69 inhibits HIV-1, primate lentiviruses and the negative and positive-strand RNA viruses VSV and SARS-CoV2, overall indicating it is a broad-spectrum antiviral factor. Trim69 binds directly to microtubules and its antiviral activity is intimately linked to its ability to promote the accumulation of stable MTs, a specialized subset of microtubules. By analyzing the behavior of primary blood cells, we provide evidence that a program of MT stabilization is commonly observed in response to IFN-I in cells of the myeloid lineage and Trim69 is the key factor behind this program.\n\nOverall, our study identifies Trim69 as the first antiviral innate defense factor that regulates the properties of microtubules to limit viral spread, highlighting the possibility that the cytoskeleton may be a novel unappreciated fighting ground in the host-pathogen interactions that underlie viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Swine influenza A virus (swIAV) infections in pig populations cause considerable morbidity and economic losses. Frequent reverse zoonotic incursions of human IAV boost reassortment opportunities with authentic porcine and avian-like IAV in swine herds potentially enhancing zoonotic and even pre-pandemic potential. Vaccination using adjuvanted inactivated full virus vaccines is frequently used in attempting control of swIAV infections. Accelerated antigenic drift of swIAV in large swine holdings and interference of maternal antibodies with vaccine in piglets can compromise these efforts. Potentially more efficacious modified live-attenuated vaccines (MLVs) bear the risk of reversion of MLV to virulence. Here we evaluated new MLV candidates based on cold-passaged swIAV or on reassortment-incompetent bat-IAV-swIAV chimeric viruses. Serial cold-passaging of various swIAV subtypes did not yield unambiguously temperature-sensitive mutants although safety studies in mice and pigs suggested some degree of attenuation. Chimeric bat-swIAV expressing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of an avian-like H1N1, in contrast, proved to be safe in mice and pigs, and a single nasal inoculation induced protective immunity against homologous challenge in pigs. Reassortant-incompetent chimeric bat-swIAV vaccines could aid in reducing the amount of swIAV circulating in pig populations, thereby increasing animal welfare, limiting economic losses and lowering the risk of zoonotic swIAV transmission.",

    "abstract": "In Principal cells (PC) of the cortical collecting duct (CCD), the highly regulated and coordinated reabsorption of sodium occurs through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) at the apical membrane and Na/K ATPase at the basolateral membrane. However, it is not known how sodium ions (Na+) are transported across the cell. We investigated intracellular transport in mCCDcl1 cells using a fluorescent sodium dye, CoroNa Green AM. Dye uptake was stimulated by aldosterone, blocked by amiloride (an ENaC inhibiter), and basolateral transport was prevented by ouabain (an Na/K ATPase blocker) thus validating the dyes apparently faithful replication of sodium transport. Cells exhibited a consistent pattern of sodium-containing vesicles, of various sizes, surrounded by cytoskeleton and lipid membrane. While the smallest vesicles ([~]0.5m) co-stained with lysotracker, larger vesicles (up to 6.4m) did not co-stain with either lysosomal- or mitochondrial-specific dyes and appeared to have internal structure, suggesting that they were multivesicular bodies. Time-lapse imaging showed a subset of these multivesicular bodies release or take up sodium dye in a controlled manner. Our novel data suggest that intracellular sodium compartmentalisation is highly regulated and offer new insights into intracellular sodium dynamics in the collecting duct, revealing potential new targets for control of sodium homeostasis.\n\nNew and NoteworthyThe article shows for the first time, to our knowledge, intracellular sodium transport mechanism in mCCDcl1 cells in the form of dynamic vesicular bodies. These structures offer new targets for the regulation of sodium homeostasis and transport in the kidney collecting duct, with wider implications for blood pressure regulation.",

    "abstract": "A fungal metabolite, FR235222, specifically inhibits a histone deacetylase of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and TgHDAC3 has emerged as a key factor regulating developmental stage transition in this species. Here, we exploited FR235222 to ask if changes in histone acetylation regulate developmental stage transition of Theileria annulata, another apicomplexan species. We found that FR235222 treatment of T. annulata-infected transformed leukocytes induced a proliferation arrest. The blockade in proliferation was due to drug-induced conversion of intracellular schizonts to merozoites that lack the ability to maintain host leukocyte cell division. Induction of merogony by FR235222 leads to an increase in expression of merozoite-marker (rhoptry) proteins. RNA-seq of FR235222-treated T. annulata-infected B cells identified deregulated expression of 468 parasite genes including a number encoding parasite ApiAP2 transcription factors. Thus, similar to T. gondii, FR235222 inhibits T. annulata HDAC (TaHDAC1) activity and places parasite histone acetylation as a major regulatory event of the transition from schizonts to merozoites.",

    "abstract": "The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses worldwide has serious consequences for animal health and a major economic impact on the poultry production sector. Since 2014, Europe has been severely hit by several HPAI epidemics, with France being the most affected country. Most recently, France was again affected by two devastating highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemics in 2020-21 and 2021-22. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the 2020-21 and 2021-22 epidemics, in a first step towards identifying the poultry sectors remaining vulnerabilities regarding HPAI viruses in France. We examined the spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks that occurred in France in 2020-21 and 2021-22, and we assessed the outbreaks spatial distribution in relation to two High-Risk Zones recently incorporated into French legislation to strengthen HPAI prevention and control. There were 468 reported outbreaks during the 2020-21 epidemic, and 1,223 outbreaks during the 2021-22 epidemic. In both epidemics, most outbreaks (80.6% and 74.0%) were located into the two High-Risk Zones. The southwestern High-Risk Zone was affected in both epidemics, while the western High-Risk Zone was affected for the first time in 2021-22, explaining the extremely high number of outbreaks reported. We showed that the spatial distribution model used to create the two High-Risk Zones was able to predict the location of outbreaks for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 epidemics. These zones were characterized by high poultry farm densities; future efforts should therefore focus on reducing the density of susceptible poultry in highly dense areas.",

    "abstract": "Point mutations in the KCNJ13 gene cause an autosomal recessive, childhood blindness, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA16) due to a loss-of-function Kir7.1 channel. In the present study, we investigated the etiology of LCA16 caused by a KCNJ13 missense mutation (c.431T>C, p.Leu144Pro) and explored the activity of two cytosine base editors mRNAs (CBEs, BE4max-WTCas9, and evoCDA-SpCas9-NG) as a proof-of-concept therapeutic option. We observed the KCNJ13-related retinopathy phenotype in patients harboring L144P mutation. Our in-silico prediction and in vitro validation demonstrated that L144P mutation affects the channel function. We observed high on-target efficiency in the CBEs treated L144P mutant gene expressing HEK-293 cells. Strikingly, our evaluation of base editing efficacy using electrophysiology showed negligible channel function. We found that the editing bystander  Cs in the protospacer region led to a missense change (L143F) in evoCDA edited cells and only silent changes in BE4max edited cells. Upon investigation of the effect of the synonymous codon, our extended analysis revealed distortion of mRNA structure, altered half-life, and/or low abundance of the cognate tRNA. We propose that KCNJ13-L144P mutation or other genes that share similar genetic complexity may be challenging to correct with the current generation of CRISPR base editors, and a combinational therapy using CRISPR base editors with a tighter editing window and requisite cognate-tRNA supplementation could be an alternative therapeutic approach to restore Kir7.1 channel function in LCA16 patients. Other options for hard-to-rescue alleles could employ homology-directed repair using CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases, Prime editing, and AAV-mediated gene augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Robust and precise transcript targeting in mammalian cells remains a difficult challenge using existing approaches due to inefficiency, imprecision, and subcellular compartmentalization. Here, we show that the CRISPR-Csm complex, a multi-protein effector from type III CRISPR immune systems in prokaryotes, provides surgical RNA ablation of both nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts. As part of the most widely occurring CRISPR adaptive immunity pathway, CRISPR-Csm uses a programmable RNA-guided mechanism to find and degrade target RNA molecules without inducing indiscriminate trans-cleavage of cellular RNAs, giving it an important advantage over the CRISPR-Cas13-family enzymes. Using single-vector delivery of the S. thermophilus Csm complex, we observe high-efficiency RNA knockdown (90-99%) and minimal off-target effects in human cells, outperforming existing technologies including shRNA- and Cas13-mediated knockdown. We also find that catalytically inactivated Csm achieves specific and durable RNA binding, a property we harness for live-cell RNA imaging. These results establish the feasibility and efficacy of multi-protein CRISPR-Cas effector complexes as RNA-targeting tools in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside at the apex of hematopoiesis, can maintain this function for life, and are the functional units in clinical bone marrow transplantation. Limitations in HSC numbers not only restricts their clinical use but also several embodiments of experimental research. A highly defined ex vivo culture system was recently shown to support robust expansion of in vivo HSC activity, prompting us to explore this system further. Over a 3-week culture period, only 0.1% of cultured cells retained the original input HSC phenotype, but these cells contained virtually all functional long-term HSC activity. Despite a low frequency of candidate HSCs, the net functional HSC expansion was large and necessitated several adjustments to the classical competitive repopulation for quantification. The ex vivo differentiated progeny from candidate HSCs was rich in progenitor cell activity and allowed for radioprotection from even single cultured HSCs. Limited numbers of expanded HSCs allowed for long-term multilineage engraftment of unconditioned hosts, with expanded HSCs rapidly returning to quiescence in this in vivo setting. Finally, clonal barcoding and competitive repopulation experiments demonstrated that successful HSC expansion emanated from rare HSC clones that was only partially predicted by phenotype. While a culture system that robustly expands HSC activity have been a long-sought goal in experimental HSC biology, our studies highlight the large impact of cellular heterogeneity also for this aspect of HSC biology.\n\nKey pointEx vivo self-renewal is an intrinsic property of rare candidate HSCs, with implications for assessments of HSC activity by transplantation.",
