    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough constipation is a common syndrome and a worldwide health problem. Constipation patients are becoming younger with a 29.6% overall prevalence in the children, which has captured great attention because of its epigenetic rejuvenation and recurrent episodes. Despite the usage of rhubarb to relieve constipation, novel targets and genes involved in target-relevant pathways with remarkable functionalities should still be sought after.\n\nMaterials and methodsWe established a reliable constipation model in C57B/6N male mice using intragastric administration diphenoxylate and the eligible subjects received 600mg/25g rhubarb extraction to ameliorate constipation. Resultant constipation was morphological and genetically compared with the specimen from different groups.\n\nResultsThe constipation mice exhibited thicker muscle layers, improved content of cytokines, including IL-17 and IL-23, and lower content of IL-22. The bacterial abundance and diversity varied tremendously. Notably, the alterations were reversed after rhubarb treatment. Additionally, SCFA and MLCFA were significantly influenced by constipation accompanied by enhanced expressions of SCFA receptors, GPR41 and GPR43.\n\nConclusionThis thesis has provided an insight that rhubarb promoted the flexibility of collagen fiber, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokines, and maintained intestinal microflora balance with potential effects on affecting the metabolism of fatty acids and polyamines.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian DNA folds into 3D structures that facilitate and regulate genetic processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and epigenetics. Several insights derive from chromosome capture methods, such as Hi-C, which allow researchers to construct contact maps depicting 3D interactions among all DNA segment pairs. These maps show a complex cross-scale organization spanning megabase-pair compartments to short-ranged DNA loops. To better understand the organizing principles, several groups analyzed Hi-C data assuming a Russian-doll-like nested hierarchy where DNA regions of similar sizes merge into larger and larger structures. Apart from being a simple and appealing description, this model explains, e.g., the omnipresent chequerboard pattern seen in Hi-C maps, known as A/B compartments, and foreshadows the co-localization of some functionally similar DNA regions. However, while successful, this model is incompatible with the two competing mechanisms that seem to shape a significant part of the chromosomes 3D organization: loop extrusion and phase separation. This paper aims to map out the chromosomes actual folding hierarchy from empirical data. To this end, we take advantage of Hi-C experiments and treat the measured DNA-DNA interactions as a weighted network. From such a network, we extract 3D communities using the generalized Louvain algorithm. This algorithm has a resolution parameter that allows us to scan seamlessly through the community size spectrum, from A/B compartments to topologically associated domains (TADs). By constructing a hierarchical tree connecting these communities, we find that chromosomes are more complex than a perfect hierarchy. Analyzing how communities nest relative to a simple folding model, we found that chromosomes exhibit a significant portion of nested and non-nested community pairs alongside considerable randomness. In addition, by examining nesting and chromatin types, we discovered that nested parts are often associated with active chromatin. These results highlight that crossscale relationships will be essential components in models aiming to reach a deep understanding of the causal mechanisms of chromosome folding.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNucleic acid aptamers as antibody alternatives bind specifically to target molecules. These aptamers are generated by isolating candidates from libraries with random sequence fragments, through an evolutionary engineering system. We recently reported a high-affinity DNA aptamer generation method that introduces unnatural bases (UBs) as a fifth letter into the library, by genetic alphabet expansion. By incorporating hydrophobic UBs, the affinities of DNA aptamers to target proteins are increased over 100-fold, as compared to those of conventional aptamers with only the natural four letters. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement of the methods for routinely generating high-affinity UB-containing DNA (UB-DNA) aptamers. The success probabilities of the high-affinity aptamer generation depend on the existence of the aptamer candidate sequences in the initial library. We estimated the success probabilities by analysing several UB-DNA aptamers that we generated, as examples. In addition, we investigated the possible improvement of conventional aptamer affinities by introducing one UB at specific positions. Our data revealed that UB-DNA aptamers adopt specific tertiary structures, in which many bases including UBs interact with target proteins for high affinity, suggesting the importance of the UB-DNA library design.",

    "abstract": "The pathogens to which T cells respond is determined by the T cell receptors (TCRs) present in an individuals repertoire. Although more than 90% of the TCR repertoire is generated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated N-nucleotide addition during V(D)J recombination, the benefit of TdT-modified TCRs remains unclear. Here, we computationally and experimentally investigated whether TdT systematically modifies the affinity distribution of a TCR repertoire in ways that impacts acute or chronic infection. Our computational model predicts a shift toward low-affinity T cells over time during chronic, but not acute, infections. Elimination of low-affinity T cells in silico substantially delayed chronic infection clearance. Corroborating an affinity-centric benefit for TCR diversity, we showed that infection of TdT-deficient mice delayed the clearance of a chronic viral pathogen, while acute viral control was unaffected. Our data thus suggest that TdT-mediated TCR diversity is of particular benefit in the control of prolonged pathogen replication.",

    "abstract": "The cytoplasmic replication of poxviruses requires extensive protein synthesis, challenging the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the role of the ER in the life cycle of poxviruses is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that infection with the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a poxvirus, causes ER stress in vivo and in vitro, further facilitating the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although UPR activation aids in the restoration of the cellular environment, its significance in the LSDV life cycle remains unclear. Furthermore, the role of ER imbalance for viral replication is also unknown. We show that LSDV replication is hampered by an unbalanced ER environment. In addition, we verify that the LSDV replication depends on the activation of PERK-eIF2 and IRE1-XBP1 signaling cascades rather than ATF6, implying that global translation and XBP1 cleavage are deleterious to LSDV replication. Our findings suggest that LSDV engages all UPR signaling sensors, and that activation of PERK and IRE1 sensors is indispensable to maintaining its own replication.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlthough numerous viruses cause ER stress and employ endogenous UPR components to control viral growth, there is no such evidence for poxviruses. Recent real-world epidemics of poxviruses such as monkeypox and LSDV indicated a lack of available coping strategies. Our findings show that LSDV encoding up to 156 open reading frames (ORFs) causes pressure to the stabilization of ER, triggers ER stress, and further promotes the activation of all three UPR signaling pathways. However, inhibiting PERK-eIF2 and IRE1-XBP1 was not conducive for LSDV replication. Since LSDV efficiently utilizes UPR components to assist its own replication, signal-blocking agents of PERK and IRE1 may be useful in the treatment of LSDV. More evidence for the efficacy of such therapy for LSDV, even monkeypox, could come from a clearer characterization of the ER stress-mediated viral replication process.",

    "abstract": "Two different hypotheses have been raised as to how temperature affects resource allocation in microorganisms. The translation-compensation hypothesis (TCH) predicts that the increase in enzymatic efficiency with temperature results in fewer required ribosomes per cell and lower RNA:protein ratio. In contrast, the growth rate hypothesis (GRH) predicts that increasing growth rate with temperature requires more ribosomes and hence a higher cellular RNA:protein. We tested these two hypotheses in lab cultures of Prochlorococcus and Alteromonas as well as over an annual cycle in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The RNA:protein of Alteromonas mostly decreased with temperature in accordance with the TCH, while that of Prochlorococcus increased with temperature, as predicted by the GRH. No support was found for either hypotheses in surface waters from the Eastern Mediterranean, whereas the fraction of phosphorus in RNA was positively correlated with per-cell bacterial production in the deep chlorophyll maximum, supporting the GRH in this niche. A considerable part of the cellular phosphorus was not allocated to RNA, DNA, phospholipids or polyphosphate, raising the question which cellular molecules contain these P reserves. While macromolecular quotas differed significantly between laboratory cultures and field samples, these were connected through a power law, suggesting common rules of resource allocation.\n\nOriginality-Significance statementWe investigated whether the translation-compensation hypothesis (TCH) or growth rate hypothesis (GRH) affect the macromolecular composition and phosphorus allocation in both lab cultures of Prochlorococcus and Alteromonas as well as in seawater with natural microbial communities. Our results highlight that the TCH and GRH may each be applicable to different organisms (autotroph or heterotroph), physiological states or environmental conditions. Testing the applicability of theoretical models such as the TCH and GRH in lab cultures and field samples is an important step toward mechanistic models of bacterial physiology. This is especially important to our understanding of how bacterioplankton allocate resources in response to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and nutrient stress, which are likely to expand due to the predicted global changes.",

    "abstract": "Modification of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive-strand RNA genome by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulates the viral lifecycle. This lifecycle takes place solely in the cytoplasm, while m6A addition on cellular mRNA takes place in the nucleus. Thus, the mechanisms by which m6A is deposited on the viral RNA have been unclear. In this work, we find that m6A modification of HCV RNA by the m6A-methyltransferase proteins METTL3 and METTL14 is regulated by WTAP. WTAP, a predominantly nuclear protein, is an essential member of the cellular mRNA m6A-methyltransferase complex and known to target METTL3 to mRNA. We found that HCV infection induces localization of WTAP to the cytoplasm. Importantly, we found that WTAP is required for both METTL3 interaction with HCV RNA and for m6A modification across the viral RNA genome. Further, we found that WTAP, like METTL3 and METTL14, negatively regulates the production of infectious HCV virions, a process that we have previously shown is regulated by m6A. Excitingly, WTAP regulation of both HCV RNA m6A modification and virion production were independent of its ability to localize to the nucleus. Together, these results reveal that WTAP is critical for HCV RNA m6A modification by METTL3 and METTL14 in the cytoplasm.\n\nIMPORTANCEPositive-strand RNA viruses such as HCV represent a significant global health burden. Previous work has described how HCV RNA contains the RNA modification m6A and how this modification regulates viral infection. Yet, how this modification is targeted to HCV RNA has remained unclear due to the incompatibility of the nuclear cellular processes that drive m6A modification with the cytoplasmic HCV lifecycle. In this study, we present evidence for how m6A modification is targeted to HCV RNA in the cytoplasm by a mechanism in which WTAP recruits the m6A-methyltransferase METTL3 to HCV RNA. This targeting strategy for m6A modification of cytoplasmic RNA viruses is likely relevant for other m6A-modified positive-strand RNA viruses with cytoplasmic lifecycles such as enterovirus 71 and SARS-CoV-2 and provides an exciting new target for potential antiviral therapies.",

    "abstract": "Host restriction limits the emergence of novel pandemic strains from the Influenza A Virus avian reservoir. For efficient replication in mammalian cells, the avian influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase must adapt to use human orthologues of the host factor ANP32, which lack a 33 amino acid insertion relative to avian ANP32A. Here we find that influenza polymerase requires ANP32 proteins to support both steps of replication: cRNA and vRNA synthesis. Nevertheless, avian strains are only restricted in vRNA synthesis in human cells. Therefore, avian polymerase can use human ANP32 orthologues to support cRNA synthesis, without acquiring mammalian adaptations. This implies a fundamental difference in the mechanism by which ANP32 proteins support cRNA vs vRNA synthesis.\n\nImportanceIn order to infect humans and cause a pandemic, avian influenza must first learn how to use human versions of the proteins the virus hijacks for replication - instead of the avian versions found in bird cells. One such protein is ANP32. Understanding the details of how host proteins such as ANP32 support viral activity may allow the design of new antiviral treatments that disrupt these interactions. In this work, we use cells that lack ANP32 to unambiguously demonstrate ANP32 is needed for both steps of influenza genome replication. Surprisingly however, we find that avian influenza can use human ANP32 proteins for the first step of replication without any adaptation, but only avian ANP32 for the second step of replication. This suggests ANP32 may have an additional role in supporting the second step of replication, and it is this activity that is specifically blocked when avian influenza infects human cells.",

    "abstract": "Previously, Tuller et al. found that the first 30 to 50 codons of the genes of yeast and other eukaryotes are slightly enriched for rare codons, so are presumably translated somewhat slowly. They argued, based on informatics, that this initial slow translation \"ramp\" was adaptive; and increased efficiency of translation by queuing ribosomes to prevent collisions. Today, the translational speeds of different codons are known, and indeed rare codons are translated slowly. We re-examined the slow translation ramp. We confirm the finding that 5 regions are enriched for rare codons. However, we also find that the 5 ends of yeast genes are poorly conserved in evolution, suggesting that they are unstable and turn over relatively rapidly. When a new 5 end forms de novo, it is likely to include codons that would otherwise be rare. Because evolution has had a relatively short time to select against these codons, 5 ends are typically slightly enriched for rare, slow codons. Opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al., we show by direct experiment that genes with slowly translated codons at the 5 end are expressed relatively poorly, and substituting faster codons improves expression. Further informatic studies suggest that for natural genes, slow 5 ends are correlated with poor gene expression, opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al. Thus we conclude that slow 5 translation is a \"spandrel\"; it is a non-adaptive consequence of something else, in this case the turnover of 5 ends in evolution, and it does not improve translation.\n\nHighlightThe 5 ends of yeast genes are unstable over evolutionary time, enriching for rare codons, slowing translation; slow initial translation does not enhance expression.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, mutations lead to the evolution of antibiotic resistance, which is one the main public health problems of the 21st century. Therefore, determining which cellular processes most frequently contribute to mutagenesis, especially in cells that have not been exposed to exogenous DNA damage, is critical. Here, we show that endogenous oxidative stress is a key driver of mutagenesis and the subsequent development of antibiotic resistance. This is the case for all classes of antibiotics tested and across highly divergent species, including patient-derived strains. We show that the transcription-coupled repair pathway, which uses the nucleotide excision repair proteins (TC-NER), is responsible for endogenous oxidative stress-dependent mutagenesis and subsequent evolution. This strongly suggests that a majority of mutations arise through transcription-associated processes rather than the replication fork. In addition to determining that the NER proteins play a critical role in mutagenesis and evolution, we also identify the DNA polymerases responsible for this process. Our data strongly suggest that cooperation between three different mutagenic DNA polymerases, likely at the last step of TC-NER, is responsible for mutagenesis and evolution. Overall, our work identifies that a highly conserved pathway drives mutagenesis due to endogenous oxidative stress, which has broad implications for all diseases of evolution, including antibiotic resistance development.",

    "abstract": "The human genome encodes [~]20,000 proteins, many still uncharacterised. Scientific and social factors have resulted in a focus on well-studied proteins, leading to a concern that poorly understood genes are unjustifiably neglected. To address this, we have developed an \"Unknome database\" that ranks proteins based on how little is known about them. We applied RNAi in Drosophila to 260 unknown genes that are conserved between flies and humans. About a quarter are required for viability, and functional screening of the rest revealed hits for fertility, development, locomotion, protein quality control and resilience to stress. CRISPR/Cas9 gene disruption validated a component of Notch signalling and two genes contributing to male fertility. Our work demonstrates the importance of poorly understood genes, provides a resource for future research acceleration, and highlights a need for our awareness of ignorance to be protected from erosion by automated database annotation.",

The preparation of plasmids typically involves a laborious process of bacterial cloning, validation, and purification. While the expression plasmids can be designed and ordered from the contract manufacturers, the cost may be prohibitive when a large number of plasmids is required. We have developed an efficient fully synthetic method and protocol that enables the production of circularized DNA containing expression elements ready for transfection in as little as 3 hours, thereby eliminating the bacterial cloning steps. The protocol describes how to take a linear double-stranded DNA fragment and efficiently circularize and purify this DNA fragment with minimal hands-on time. As proof of the principle, we applied Circular Vector expressing engineered prime editing guide RNA (epegRNA) in cell culture, and demonstrated matching and even exceeding performance of this method as compared to guides expressed by plasmids. The method is not limited to gene editing and its speed of preparation, low cost, and ease of use will make it a useful tool in a variety of applications requiring the expression of short RNAs and proteins.",

Despite substantial research efforts, the physiological and pathological role of this multidomain protein remains poorly defined.

The LRRK2 interactors exhibited distinct expression features in the brain as compared to the peripheral tissues analysed. Moreover, a high degree of similarity was found for the LRRK2 interactors in putamen, caudate and nucleus accumbens, thus defining a potential LRRK2 functional cluster within the striatum. We also explored the functions highlighted by the \"core LRRK2 interactors\" within each tissue and illustrated how the LRRK2 interactomes can be used as a tool to trace the relationship between LRRK2 and specific interactors of interest, here exemplified with a study focused on the LRRK2 interactors belonging to the Rab protein family.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) control Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) infection through various antimicrobial activities. We previously found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were required for optimal antibacterial function, however, the NADPH oxidase is known to be dispensable for the ability of PMNs to kill pneumococci. In this study, we explored the role of ROS produced by the mitochondria in PMN antimicrobial defense against pneumococci. We found that the mitochondria are an important source of overall intracellular ROS produced by murine PMNs in response to infection. We investigated the host and bacterial factors involved and found that mitochondrial ROS (MitROS) are produced independent of bacterial capsule or pneumolysin but presence of live bacteria that are in direct contact with PMNs enhanced the response. We further found that MyD88-/- PMNs failed to produce MitROS in response to pneumococcal infection suggesting that released bacterial products acting as TLR ligands are sufficient for inducing MitROS production in PMNs. To test the role of MitROS in PMN function, we used an opsonophagocytic killing assay and found that MitROS were required for the ability of PMNs to kill pneumococci. We then investigated the role of MitROS in host resistance and found that MitROS are produced by PMNs in response to pneumococcal infection. Importantly, treatment of mice with a MitROS scavenger prior to systemic challenge resulted in reduced survival of infected hosts. In exploring host pathways that control MitROS, we focused on extracellular adenosine, which is known to control PMN anti-pneumococcal activity, and found that signaling through the A2B adenosine receptor inhibits MitROS production by PMNs. A2BR-/- mice produced more MitROS and were significantly more resistant to infection. Finally, we verified the clinical relevance of our findings using human PMNs. In summary, we identified a novel pathway that controls MitROS production by PMNs, shaping host resistance against S. pneumoniae.\n\nAuthor summaryDespite the presence of antibiotics and vaccines, Streptococcus pneumoniae infections remain a serious cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Understanding protective host responses is key for designing improved therapies against infection. Neutrophils are innate immune cells that are crucial for control of S. pneumoniae infection. In this study we explored the mechanisms by which neutrophils kill S. pneumoniae. We found that the mitochondria, whose primary role is energy production, also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are critical for the ability of neutrophils to kill S. pneumoniae. We explored the bacterial and host factors involved in mitochondrial ROS (MitROS) production by neutrophils. We found that recognition of bacterial products by neutrophils triggers this response and that the host A2B adenosine receptor regulates it. Importantly, MitROS were required for host resistance against S. pneumoniae. This study describes a novel pathway that controls anti-microbial responses and can be a future therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theory predicts a late-life decline in the force of natural selection, possibly leading to late-life deregulations of the immune system. A potential outcome of such immune-deregulation is the inability to produce specific immunity against target pathogens. We tested this possibility by infecting multiple Drosophila melanogaster lines (with bacterial pathogens) across age-groups, where either individual or different combinations of Imd- and Toll-inducible antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were deleted using CRISPR gene editing. We show a high degree of non-redundancy and pathogen-specificity of AMPs in young flies: in some cases, even a single AMP could confer complete resistance. In contrast, ageing led to a complete loss of such specificity, warranting the action of multiple AMPs across Imd- and Toll-pathways during infections. Moreover, use of diverse AMPs either had no survival benefits, or even accompanied survival costs post-infection. These features were also sexually dimorphic: females expressed a larger repertoire of AMPs than males, but extracted equivalent survival benefits. Finally, age-specific expansion of the AMP-pool was associated with downregulation of negative-regulators of the Imd-pathway and a potential damage to renal function, as features of poorly-regulated immunity, Overall, we could establish ageing as an important driver of nonspecific AMP responses, across sexes and bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "NLRP1 inflammasome functions as canonical cytosolic sensor in response to intracellular infections and is implicated in auto-inflammatory diseases. But the regulation and signal transduction mechanisms of NLRP1 are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the T60 variant of CARD8, but not the canonical T48 isoform, negatively regulates NLRP1 inflammasome activation by directly interacting with the receptor molecule NLRP1 and inhibiting inflammasome assembly. Furthermore, our results suggest that the different ASC preference in three types of inflammasomes, namely ASC-indispensable NLRP1 inflammasome, ASC-dispensable mNLRP1b inflammasome and ASC-independent CARD8 inflammasome, is mainly caused by the CARD domain, not the UPA subdomain. Based on the systematic site-directed mutagenesis and structural analysis, we find that the signal transduction of NLRP1 inflammasome relies on multiple interaction surfaces on its death domain superfamily member CARD domain. Finally, our results partly explain the mechanism of the NLRP1 mutation-derived auto-inflammatory diseases caused by the overactivation of the NLRP1 inflammasome. In conclusion, our study not only reveals how CARD8 downregulates NLRP1 inflammasome activation, but also provides insights into the mechanisms of CARD-containing inflammasome assembly.",

    "abstract": "Barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr) are often used as proxies for the reconstruction of past marine productivity and global climate. The ability to accumulate Ba2+ and Sr2+ in the form of crystals is rare among eukaryotes. Here we report that unicellular heterotrophs called diplonemids (Euglenozoa), one of the most abundant groups of marine planktonic protists, accumulate conspicuous amounts of these trace elements in the form of intracellular barite (BaSO4) and celestite (SrSO4) crystals, in concentrations greater than in other known Ba/Sr-accumulating organisms. Moreover, these flagellates can uptake Sr2+ exclusively or together with Ba2+ and form (Ba,Sr)SO4. One species, Namystinia karyoxenos, is naturally capable of intracellular accumulation of Ba2+ and Sr2+ 42,000 and 10,000 times relative to the surrounding medium. Altering the amounts of both elements in the medium resulted in corresponding changes in the quantity and composition of crystals. Planktonic copepods fed with diplonemids produce celestite-rich fecal pellets, which facilitate deposition of these minerals on the seafloor. We propose that diplonemids, which emerged during the Neoproterozoic era, qualify as impactful players of Ba2+/Sr2+ cycling in the ocean that possibly contributed to sedimentary rock formation over long geological periods.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal lining is protected by a mucous barrier composed predominantly of complex carbohydrates. Gut microbes employ an array of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) to liberate mucosal sugars as a nutrient source to facilitate host colonization. Intensive catabolism of mucosal glycans, however, may contribute to barrier erosion, pathogen encroachment and inflammation.\n\nSialic acid is an acidic sugar featured at terminal positions of host glycans. Characterized sialidases from the microbiome belong to the GH33 family, according to CAZy (Carbohydrate Active enZyme) database classification. A 2018 functional metagenomics screen using thermal spring DNA uncovered the founding member of the GH156 sialidase family, which lacks homology to GH33 sialidases and could not be taxonomically assigned. Subsequent structural analysis revealed critical active site residues. We sought to determine if GH156 sialidases are present in the human gut microbiome where they might contribute to mucous erosion.\n\nA subset of GH156 sequences from the CAZy database containing key sialidase residues was used to build a Hidden Markov Model. HMMsearch against public databases revealed [~]10X more putative GH156 sialidases than currently recognized by CAZy. Represented phyla include Bacteroidota, Verrucomicrobiota and Firmicutes_A from human microbiomes, all of which play notable roles in carbohydrate fermentation. Genomic analyses suggested that taxa containing GH156-encoding genes may utilize host-glycans. Analyses of metagenomic datasets revealed that GH156s are frequently encoded in metagenomes, with a greater variety and abundance of GH156 genes observed in traditional hunter-gatherer or agriculturalist societies than in industrialized societies, particularly relative to individuals with IBD. A GH156 gene frequently detected in traditional populations was cloned from stool sample DNA and the recombinant protein exhibited sialidase activity with a fluorogenic substrate.\n\nImportanceSialic acids occupy terminal positions of human glycans where they act as receptors for microbes, toxins and immune signaling molecules. Microbial enzymes that remove sialic acids, sialidases, are abundant in the human microbiome where they may contribute to shaping the microbiota community structure or contribute to pathology. Furthermore, sialidases have proven to hold therapeutic potential for cancer therapy. Here we examined the sequence space of a sialidase family of enzymes, GH156, previously unknown to the human gut environment. Our analyses suggest that human populations with disparate dietary practices harbour distinct varieties and abundances of GH156-encoding genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the sialidase activity of a gut derived GH156. These results expand the diversity of sialidases that may contribute to host glycan degradation and these sequences may have biotechnological or clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella is a frequent zoonotic foodborne pathogen, with swine and pork meats the most common source of human infection. In Chiang Mai and Lamphun Province in northern Thailand, there has been a high prevalence of salmonellosis for over a decade. Infection is usually with several dominant S. enterica serotypes, including serotypes Rissen and Monophasic Typhimurium. However, several less common serotypes also contribute to disease. Whole genome sequencing of 43 of these less common S. enterica serotypes isolated from the pork production chain through 2011-2014 were used to evaluate their genetic diversity and virulence potential. Salmonella contamination at local retail markets represented cross-contamination from multiple sources, including decontaminated foodstuff. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of host cell adhesion, invasion and intracellular survival for the development of clinical salmonellosis. We screened our dataset for known virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance genes, identifying at least 10 antimicrobial resistance genes in all isolates. These results indicate that these less common S. enterica serotypes also pose a significant public health risk. Our findings support the need for appropriate surveillance of food products going to market to reduce public exposure to highly pathogenic, multi-drug resistant Salmonella. Surveillance throughout the pork production chain would motivate stakeholders to reinforce sanitation standards and help reduce the risk of salmonellosis in humans.",

Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the phage T5 outer membrane (OM) receptor FhuA in complex with the T5 RBP pb5, and the crystal structure of FhuA complexed to the OM SE lipoprotein Llp. Pb5 inserts four loops deeply into the extracellular lumen of FhuA and contacts the plug, but does not cause any conformational changes in the receptor, supporting the view that DNA translocation does not occur through the lumen of OM channels. The FhuA-Llp structure reveals that Llp is periplasmic and binds to a non-native conformation of the plug of FhuA, causing the inward folding of two extracellular loops via \"reverse\" allostery. The inward-folded loops of FhuA overlap with the pb5 binding site, explaining how Llp binding to FhuA abolishes further infection of E. coli by phage T5, and suggesting a mechanism for SE via the jamming of TonB-dependent transporters by small phage lipoproteins.",

    "abstract": "Catecholamines, such as L-norepinephrine (L-NE), are naturally present in the human gut and are discharged into the sewage. The bioactivity of L-NE can significantly alter the speciation and function of the microbial community by stimulating bacterial growth and producing H2O2. The accompanying changes in intracellular metabolism could significantly impact biological wastewater treatment processes, but they have remained unexplored. We investigate the alterations by L-NE and two other Catecholamines (Dopamine, and L-Dopa) to microbial consortia sourced from a dairy farm settling pond (FS) and the activated sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MS). We contrast the effect of the catecholamines on these mixed microbial communities with dextrose, a readily degradable substrate, and elevated levels of intracellular H2O2 through high dissolved oxygen (HDO) perturbations and exogenous applications of paraquat (PQ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The microbial community composition in different catecholamines was similar to the Dextrose treatment. However, there were significant changes in the PQ and H2O2 supplemented systems. In addition, the functional potential of the microbial communities with catecholamines and Dextrose were similar and provided insight into metabolic shifts from the control systems. While exogenous H2O2 increased the abundance of Rhodocyclaceae, Flavobacteriaceae and Chitinophagaceae and others, L-NE paralleled dextrose by increasing Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Sphingobacteriaceae in the microbial consortia. A number of protein functions related to oxidoreductase, peroxidase, and catalase activities, ATP and FAD/FADH2 binding, nitrate reductase, and glutamate-ammonia ligase activity were differentially expressed by L-NE over dextrose, but many of the ROS-scavenging functions were overexpressed in the exogenous H2O2 treatment over L-NE. A proteome-constrained flux balance analysis showed that in comparison to dextrose, L-NE increased the fluxes of gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, oxidative stress metabolism, and glutamate metabolism. L-NE increases stress tolerance and microbial growth by upregulating the activities of oxidative stress mitigating enzymes (catalase and thioredoxin) and nitrogen assimilation activities (glutamine formation).",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant pathogens disseminated through food are a public health concern. Although a significant proportion of the urban population in developing countries consume street-vended foods, their role in spreading antibiotic resistance has been rarely investigated. In this study, we evaluated the antibiotic resistance patterns of bacterial isolates (n = 50) collected from five categories of street-vended foods (phuchka, chatpati, sausage, bun, and salad) in Bangladesh. Antibiotic susceptibility to twelve antibiotics was investigated by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. We found a high prevalence of E. coli (n = 32) in street-vended foods, with most isolates (65.63%) exhibiting multidrug resistance. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index showed that 22 isolates had MAR above 0.2, with resistance mostly against oxacillin, ampicillin, and cefuroxime. From the rest, three representative isolates were selected for molecular identification by DNA sequencing of 16S rDNA. Klebsiella oxytoca showed multiple drug resistance (MDR) and was resistant to ampicillin, oxacillin, cefuroxime, and kanamycin. Burkholderia fungorum showed no distinct inhibition zone against ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Additionally, the Serratia nematodiphila isolate showed no distinct inhibition zone against three antibiotics, including ampicillin, oxacillin, and cefuroxime. These findings might contribute to the knowledge of emerging antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens and raise concerns about the safety of street-vended foods in Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "Aspartate (Asp) can act on liver Kupffer cells, inhibit NOD-like receptor-P 3 (NLRP3) inflammatory bodies, and improve liver inflammation in acute hepatitis. However, the effect of Asp on the role of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in chronic liver injury remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Asp on CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice and HSCs via the NF-{kappa}B/ NLRP3 signaling pathway. Liver fibrosis was induced in C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneally (IP) injecting 0.5 mL/kg 2% CCl4 three times weekly for 8 weeks. Asp was administered to mice by gavage once every morning for 4 weeks. Massons trichrome staining, Sirius red staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to detect and analyze the pathological changes in liver tissues. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were applied to determine the protein expression levels of -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), collagen III (COL III), NLRP3, and IL-1{beta}. Also, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression levels. In the liver fibrosis model, the pathological changes in liver tissues improved following treatment with Asp. A marked decrease was observed in protein and mRNA expression levels of -SMA, COL III, NLRP3, and IL-1{beta}. In addition, HSCs were treated with Asp. The expression levels of -SMA, COL III, NLRP3, and IL-1{beta} reduced in dose- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, Asp upregulated the expression of NS3TP1 in vivo and in vitro, and NS3TP1 had a significant inhibitory effect on liver fibrosis. Asp attenuated liver fibrosis and reduced collagen production by suppressing the NF-{kappa}B/ NLRP3 signaling pathway via upregulating the expression of NS3TP1.",

    "abstract": "Environmental obesogens are being studied for their potential role in the increasing prevalence of obesity globally. A major focus in this field of research has been on the mechanism by which these agents act. In this study we focused on the obesogenic organotin tributyltin (TBT), which is believed to act by binding to the PPAR{gamma} nuclear receptor in a heterodimer with RXR to alter gene regulation. To test whether this was the dominant mechanism for TBT activity, we performed time-course studies of transcription and chromatin accessibility in mesenchymal stem cells differentiating to adipocytes. We found limited evidence for PPAR{gamma} effects by TBT, but a strong response by Ras-related GTPases and evidence for the loss of TEAD transcription factor activity during differentiation. These observations combine to implicate a known property of organotins, to cause cytoskeletal cytoskeletal damage as the primary event in an updated model for TBT effects, leading to the loss of YAP co-regulator activity and the consequent failure of TEAD repression of adipogenesis.",

Our analyses define 25,883 piRNA producing-loci in C. briggsae. piRNA sequences in C. briggsae are extremely divergent from their counterparts in C. elegans, yet both species adopt similar genomic organization that drive piRNA expression. By examining production of Piwi-mediated secondary small RNAs, we identified a set of protein-coding genes that are evolutionarily conserved piRNA targets. In contrast to C. elegans, small RNAs targeting ribosomal RNAs or histone transcripts are not hyper-accumulated in C. briggsae Piwi mutants. Instead, we found that transcripts with few introns are prone to small RNA overamplification. Together our work highlights evolutionary conservation and divergence of the nematode piRNA pathway and provides insights into its role in endogenous gene regulation.",

Homologous recombination was measured by an ectopic break-induced replication (BIR) assay in which recombination occurred between a 108-bp homologous sequence shared between the DSB end and the donor sequence.

BIR efficiency decreased with increasing divergence between donor and recipient, but repair occurred even when every 6th base pair was mismatched. There was little difference in the tolerance of mismatches in mitotic or meiotic diploids; however, there were notable differences in meiotic diploids when recombination was facilitated by Dmc1 or when Dmc1 was deleted and Rad51 was activated. We found that Dmc1 and Rad51 are similarly tolerant of mismatches during meiotic recombination. Surveillance of mismatches by the Msh2 mismatch repair protein proved to be Dmc1-specific.

    "abstract": "The European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis L.) is the endemic species of the European coasts. Its exploitation has been reduced during the last decades, because of the appearance of two parasites that have led to the collapse of the stocks and the strong decline of the natural oyster beds. O. edulis has been the subject of numerous studies and programs in population genetics and on the presence of the parasites Bonamia ostreae and Marteilia refringens. These studies investigated the effects of these parasites mainly on immunity at the molecular and cellular levels. Several genetic selection programs especially related to resistance to the parasite have been initiated. Within the framework of a European project (PERLE 2) which aims to produce genetic lines of O. edulis with hardiness traits (growth, survival, resistance) for the purpose of repopulating natural oyster beds in Brittany and reviving the culture of this species on the foreshore, obtaining a reference genome has proved to be essential as done recently in many bivalve species of aquaculture interest. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the European flat oyster, generated by combining PacBio technology, Illumina, 10X linked and Hi-C sequencing. The finished assembly is 887.2 Mb with a scaffold-N50 of 97.1 Mb scaffolded on the expected 10 pseudo-chromosomes. Annotation of the genome revealed the presence of 35962 protein-coding genes. We analyzed in details the transposable elements (TE) diversity in the flat oyster genome, highlight some specificities in tRNA and miRNA composition and provide first insights in the molecular response of O. edulis to M. refringens. This genome will serve as a reference for genomic studies on O. edulis to better understand its basic physiology or developing genetic markers in breeding projects for aquaculture or natural reef restoration.",

    "abstract": "Amplification-based qPCR provides accurate and sensitive nucleic acid quantification. However, the requirement of temperature cycling and real-time monitoring limits its translation to different settings. Here, we adapted isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) reaction to develop a semi-quantitative method that relies on final amplicon yield to estimate initial target nucleic acid copy number. To achieve this, we developed a phenomenological model that captures the essential RPA dynamics. We identified reaction conditions that constrained the reaction yield corresponding to the starting DNA template concentration. We validated these predictions experimentally and show that the amplicon yields at the end of the RPA reaction correlates well to the starting DNA concentration while reducing non-specific amplification robustly. We demonstrate this approach termed here as quantitative endpoint RPA (qeRPA) to detect DNA over five log orders with detection limit of 100 molecules. Using a linear regression model with normalized endpoint intensity (NEI) standard curve, we estimate viral load from the serum of dengue-infected patients with comparable performance to qPCR. Hence, qeRPA can be employed for robust and sensitive nucleic acid estimation at close to room temperature without real-time monitoring and can be beneficial for field-deployment in limited-resource settings.",
