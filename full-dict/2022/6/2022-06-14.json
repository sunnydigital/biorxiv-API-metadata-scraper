    "abstract": "The contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) to plant iron (Fe) acquisition has been demonstrated in several studies. Recently, it has been shown that AM fungi use a high-affinity reductive pathway for Fe uptake. In the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis the ferric reductase RiFRE1 and the Fe permeases RiFTR1 and RiFTR2 have already been characterized. In an attempt to identify the third component of the reductive iron uptake pathway, a genome-wide approach has been used in R. irregularis to find genes encoding ferroxidases of the multicopper oxidase (MCO) gene family. Nine genes putatively encoding MCOs (RiMCO1-9) were identified. A phylogenetic analysis of MCO sequences of fungi from different taxonomic groups revealed that all RiMCOs clustered together in the ferroxidase/laccase group, and none with the Fet3-type ferroxidases. RiMCO1 and RiMCO3 were the only MCO genes displaying a detectable gene expression pattern typical of a high-affinity Fe transport system, indicating that RiMCO1 and RiMCO3 might have a role in the reductive high-affinity Fe uptake system. Moreover, yeast mutant complementation assays showed that the iron permease RiFTR1 can operate without the presence of a ferroxidase, indicating that it is able to transport also ferrous (II) iron.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of genetic variants linked to Mendelian disease have been characterized in dogs to date, and commercial screening is being offered for most of them worldwide. There typically remains a paucity of information regarding the broader population frequency of newly discovered variants, as well as uncertainty regarding their functional and clinical impact on additional genomic ancestry backgrounds beyond the discovery breed. Panel screening of disease variants, commercially offered as direct-to-consumer genetic testing, provides an opportunity to establish large-scale cohorts with both genotype and phenotype data available to address open questions related to variant prevalence and relevance. In this study, we screened the largest canine cohort examined in a single study to date (1,054,293 representative dogs from our existing cohort of more than three million dogs; a total of 811,628 mixed breed dogs and 242,665 purebreds from more than 150 countries and territories) for 250 genetic disease-associated variants to understand their prevalence and distribution in the general population. Electronic medical records from veterinary clinics were available for 43.5% of the genotyped dogs, enabling follow up on the clinical impact of variants. We provide detailed frequencies for all tested variants across breeds and find that 57% of dogs carry at least one copy of a studied Mendelian disease-linked variant. We provide evidence of full penetrance for 10 variants, and at minimum plausible evidence for the clinical significance of 22 variants, on a wide variety of breed backgrounds. We further show that a reduction in genome-wide heterozygosity is associated with an increased Mendelian disease load and assess genome-wide heterozygosity levels in over 100 breeds. The accumulated knowledge represents a resource to guide discussions on disease variant presence and genetic test relevance by breed.",

    "abstract": "The preservation of genome integrity during sperm and egg development is vital for reproductive success. During meiosis, the tumor suppressor BRCA1/BRC-1 and structural maintenance of chromosomes 5/6 (SMC-5/6) complex genetically interact to promote high fidelity DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, but the specific DSB repair outcomes these proteins regulate remain unknown. Here we show that BRCA1/BRC-1 and the SMC-5/6 complex limit intersister crossover recombination as well as error-prone repair pathways during meiotic prophase I. Using genetic and cytological methods to monitor repair of DSBs with different repair partners in Caenorhabditis elegans, we demonstrate that both BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 repress intersister crossover recombination events, with meiotic cells becoming more dependent upon these proteins to repair DSBs in late meiotic prophase I. Sequencing of conversion tracts from homolog-independent DSB repair events indicates that BRC-1 regulates intersister/intrachromatid noncrossover conversion tract length. Moreover, we find that BRC-1 also specifically inhibits error prone repair of DSBs induced at mid-pachytene. Finally, we reveal that functional BRC-1 enhances DSB repair defects in smc-5 mutants by repressing theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). Taken together, our study illuminates the coordinate interplay of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 to regulate DSB repair outcomes in the germline.",

    "abstract": "High-grade complex karyotype sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of more than seventy tumors that vary in histology, clinical course, and patient demographics. Despite these differences, sarcomas are treated similarly with varying efficacy. This is in part due to the rarity of the disease and the lack of preclinical models for the study of individual sarcoma subtypes. Here, we describe the development of a model of high-grade sarcoma formation from human mesenchymal stem cells by introducing genetic changes that are seen in complex karyotype sarcomas. RB1 and P53 are tumor suppressors that are often mutated or functionally inactivated in sarcomas and these were targeted using CRISPR-Cas9 technology which, alone did not result in sarcoma formation. To identify drivers, a lentiviral library screen was performed and the results were validated in a secondary screen. From this, YAP1 and K-RAS were found to robustly drive the formation of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and myxofibrosarcoma which exist on a disease spectrum. Other drivers were identified that resulted in high grade sarcomas. The majority of these tumors were undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma although pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma were present in a subset of tumors driven by CDK4 and PIK3CA. This tool allows for the study of human sarcoma subtype development from mesenchymal stem cells and provides a platform for further mechanistic studies, investigations of metastasis, and drug development for this aggressive and heterogeneous disease.",

    "abstract": "The origin of thermophilic bacteria is essential to our understanding of the early evolution of life. However, due to the lack of deep-branching culturable lineages, many controversies remain. Here, we report a novel deep-branching, sulfur-reducing, thermophilic bacterium that was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent using a newly developed cultivation strategy (\"Subtraction-Suboptimal\", StS). This bacterial lineage clusters together with other major thermophilic bacterial groups on phylogenomic trees and forms a robust superphylum-level clade that represents a major, early-diverging bacterial lineage. Ancestral analyses and metabolic modeling reveal the ancestor of this lineage might be a thermophilic and mixotrophic bacteria with a preference for amino acids utilization. These findings provide evolutionary insights into the early divergence of thermophilic bacteria and their adaptive strategies on early Earth.",

    "abstract": "Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) have long been considered a sedimentary record of seawater trace metal composition during the Precambrian. However, recent work has suggested that the trace metal composition of BIFs was derived from phytoplankton biomass, not seawater. In this model, phytoplankton biomass settles from the photic zone to the seafloor sediments, where it is then oxidized by heterotrophic microbes, such as dissimilatory Fe(III) reducing (DIR) bacteria, for energy generation. Remineralization of this biomass released the trace metals associated with organic molecules from phytoplankton (i.e., in metalloproteins), allowing these metals to be captured by Fe (oxyhydr)oxides and preserved in BIFs. While there is compelling evidence that the phytoplankton biomass served as a trace metal shuttle to precursor BIF sediments, it is unclear whether the degradation of biomass by DIR bacteria would liberate the biogenic trace metals as the model proposes. This work tests this hypothesis by using anoxic incubations of a model DIR bacterium (Shewanella oneidensis MR-1) with phytoplankton biomass as energy and carbon sources and ferrihydrite, a poorly crystalline Fe(III) oxyhydroxide (Fe(OH)3), as electron acceptor. Our results show that while S. oneidensis MR-1 can consume some of the carbon substrates found in phytoplankton biomass, there is no evidence that S. oneidensis MR-1 degraded metalloproteins which would have liberated trace metals. In the context of the Precambrian, these data imply that other heterotrophic bacteria, such as fermenters, may have had a larger role in the liberation of trace metals from dead biomass during early BIF development.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPhytoplankton are the proposed source of trace metals to banded iron formations\nC_LIO_LIIron reducers are hypothesized to release metals from phytoplankton biomass\nC_LIO_LIExperiments show that iron reducers do not liberate metals when degrading biomass\nC_LIO_LIOther microbial heterotrophs must have liberated the biogenic trace metals\nC_LI",
