    "abstract": "Recent advances in Hi-C techniques have allowed us to map genome-wide chromatin interactions and uncover higher-order chromatin structures, thereby shedding light on the principles of genome architecture and functions. However, statistical methods for detecting changes in large-scale chromatin organization such as topologically-associating domains (TADs) are still lacking. We proposed a new statistical method, DiffGR, for detecting differentially interacting genomic regions at the TAD level between Hi-C contact maps. We utilized the stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient to measure similarity of local TAD regions. We then developed a non-parametric approach to identify statistically significant changes of genomic interacting regions. Through simulation studies, we demonstrated that DiffGR can robustly and effectively discover differential genomic regions under various conditions. Furthermore, we successfully revealed cell type-specific changes in genomic interacting regions in both human and mouse Hi-C datasets, and illustrated that DiffGR yielded consistent and advantageous results compared with state-of-the-art differential TAD detection methods.

    "abstract": "Tropical forest restoration stands to deliver important conservation gains, particularly in lowland Southeast Asia, which has suffered some of the worlds highest rates of forest loss and degradation. This promise, however, depends on the extent to which biodiversity at forest restoration sites continues to be exposed to threats. A key knowledge gap concerns the extent to which biodiversity recovery in naturally regenerating tropical forests is impacted by trapping for the multi-million-dollar wildlife trade. Here, we use a repeated survey dataset to quantify rates of avian community recovery under forest regeneration, at a flagship restoration site in the lowland rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. We show that over a decade, forest regeneration was associated with significant abundance increases for 43.8% of bird species.\n\nHowever, the apparent negative impacts of trade-driven trapping on avian populations also intensified: the proportion of species that show increased abundance only in very remote forests increased from 5.4% to 16.2%, while the overall accessibility of the forest increased. We found that 14% of species did not recover as fast as predicted based on the observed improvement in forest conditions over the study period. Our results highlight the potential for rapid avifaunal recovery in regenerating tropical forests, but also emphasize the urgency of tackling the serious threat of wildlife trade to Southeast Asias biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Many interconnected degradation machineries including autophagosomes, lysosomes, and endosomes work in tandem to conduct autophagy, an intracellular degradation system that is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Altered autophagy contributes to the pathophysiology of various diseases, including cancers and metabolic diseases. Although many studies have investigated autophagy to elucidate disease pathogenesis, identification of specific components of the autophagy machinery has been challenging. The goal of this paper is to describe an approach to reproducibly identify and distinguish subcellular structures involved in macro autophagy. We provide methods that help avoid common pitfalls, including a detailed explanation for distinguishing lysosomes and lipid droplets and discuss differences between autophagosomes and inclusion bodies. These methods are based on using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), capable of generating nanometer-scale micrographs of cellular degradation components in a fixed sample. We also utilize serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to offer a protocol for visualizing 3D morphology of degradation machinery. In addition to TEM and 3D reconstruction, we discuss other imaging techniques, such as immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling that can be utilized to reliably and accurately classify cellular organelles. Our results show how these methods may be used to accurately quantify the cellular degradation machinery under various conditions, such as treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum stressor thapsigargin or ablation of the dynamin-related protein 1.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are a highly adaptive population of innate immune cells. Polarization with IFN{gamma} and LPS into the \"classically activated\" M1 macrophage enhances pro-inflammatory and microbicidal responses, important for eradicating bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By contrast, \"alternatively activated\" M2 macrophages, polarized with IL-4, oppose bactericidal mechanisms and allow mycobacterial growth. These activation states are accompanied by distinct metabolic profiles, where M1 macrophages favor near exclusive use of glycolysis, whereas M2 macrophages up-regulate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here we demonstrate that activation with IL-4 and IL-13 counterintuitively induces protective innate memory against mycobacterial challenge. In human and murine models, prior activation with IL-4/13 enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to a secondary stimulation with mycobacterial ligands. In our murine model, enhanced killing capacity is also demonstrated. Despite this switch in phenotype, IL-4/13 trained murine macrophages do not demonstrate M1-typical metabolism, instead retaining heightened use of OXPHOS. Moreover, inhibition of OXPHOS with oligomycin, 2-deoxy glucose or BPTES all impeded heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine responses from IL-4/13 trained macrophages. Lastly, this work identifies that IL-10 attenuates protective IL-4/13 training, impeding pro-inflammatory and bactericidal mechanisms. In summary, this work provides new and unexpected insight into alternative macrophage activation states in the context of mycobacterial infection.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are promising models of the cortical computations supporting human object recognition. However, despite their ability to explain a significant portion of variance in neural data, the agreement between models and brain representational dynamics is far from perfect. We address this issue by asking which representational features are currently unaccounted for in neural timeseries data, estimated for multiple areas of the ventral stream via source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data acquired in human participants (9 females, 6 males) during object viewing. We focus on the ability of visuo-semantic models, consisting of human-generated labels of object features and categories, to explain variance beyond the explanatory power of DNNs alone. We report a gradual reversal in the relative importance of DNN versus visuo-semantic features as ventral-stream object rep-resentations unfold over space and time. While lower-level visual areas are better explained by DNN features, especially during the early phase of the response (< 128 ms after stimulus onset), higher-level cortical dynamics are best accounted for by visuo-semantic features during a later time window (starting 146 ms after stimulus onset). Among the visuo-semantic features, object parts and basic categories drive the advantage over DNNs. These results show that a significant component of the variance unexplained by DNNs in higher-level cortical dynamics is structured, and can be explained by readily nameable aspects of the objects. We conclude that current DNNs fail to fully capture dynamic representations in higher-level human visual cortex and suggest a path toward more accurate models of ventral stream computations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen we view objects such as faces and cars in our visual environment, their neural representations dynamically unfold over time at a millisecond scale. These dynamics reflect the cortical computations that support fast and robust object recognition. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a promising framework for modeling these computations but cannot yet fully account for the neural dynamics. Using magnetoencephalography data acquired in human observers during object viewing, we show that readily nameable aspects of objects, such as \"eye\", \"wheel\", and \"face\", can account for variance in the neural dynamics over and above DNNs. These findings suggest that DNNs and humans may in part rely on different object features for visual recognition and provide guidelines for model improvement.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants in -actinin-2 (ACTN2) are associated with several forms of (cardio)myopathy. We previously reported a heterozygous missense (c.740C>T) ACTN2 gene variant, associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and characterized by an electro-mechanical phenotype in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Here, we created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tools two heterozygous functional knock-out hiPSC lines with a second wild-type (ACTN2wt) and missense ACTN2 (ACTN2mut) allele, respectively. We evaluated their impact on cardiomyocyte structure and function, using a combination of different technologies, including immunofluorescence and live cell imaging, RNA-seq, and mass spectrometry. This study showed that ACTN2mut present a higher percentage of multinucleation, protein aggregation, hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray and activation of both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway as compared to ACTN2wt in 2D-cultured hiPSC-CMs. Furthermore, the expression of ACTN2mut was associated with a marked reduction of sarcomere-associated protein levels in 2D-cultured hiPSC-CMs and force impairment in engineered heart tissues. In conclusion, our study highlights the activation of proteolytic systems in ACTN2mut hiPSC-CMs likely to cope with ACTN2 aggregation and therefore directs towards proteopathy as an additional cellular pathology caused by this ACTN2 variant, which may contribute to human ACTN2-associated cardiomyopathies.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses initiate infection in the gastrointestinal tract, and sex is often a biological variable that impacts pathogenesis. Previous data suggest that sex hormones can influence intestinal replication of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family. However, the specific sex hormone(s) that regulate intestinal CVB3 replication is poorly understood. To determine if testosterone promotes intestinal CVB3 replication, we orally inoculated male and female Ifnar-/- mice that were treated with either placebo or testosterone-filled capsules. Following oral inoculation, we found that testosterone-treated male and female mice shed significantly more CVB3 in the feces than placebo-treated mice indicating that testosterone enhances intestinal replication. Similarly, testosterone enhanced viral dissemination in both sexes as we observed higher viral loads in peripheral tissues following infection. Further, male mice treated with testosterone also had a higher mortality rate than testosterone-depleted male mice. Finally, we observed that testosterone significantly affected the immune response to CVB3. We found that testosterone broadly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines while decreasing the number of splenic B cells and dendritic cells following CVB3 infection. Moreover, while testosterone did not affect the early CD4 T cell response to CVB3, testosterone reduced the activation of CD8 T cells. These data indicate that testosterone can promote intestinal CVB3 replication and dissemination while impacting the subsequent viral immune response.\n\nImportanceBiological sex plays a significant role in the outcome of various infections and diseases. The impact of sex hormones on intestinal replication and dissemination of Coxsackievirus B3 remains poorly understood. Using an oral inoculation model, we found that testosterone enhances CVB3 shedding and dissemination in male and female mice. Further, testosterone can alter the immune response to CVB3. This work highlights the role of testosterone in CVB3 pathogenesis and suggests that sex hormones can impact the replication and dissemination of enteric viruses.",

    "abstract": "The fitness effects of all possible mutations available to an organism largely shapes the dynamics of evolutionary adaptation. Tremendous progress has been made in quantifying the strength and abundance of selected mutations available to single microbial species in simple environments, lacking strong ecological interactions. However, the adaptive potential of strains that are part of multi-strain communities remains largely unclear. We sought to fill this gap by analyzing a stable community of two closely related ecotypes (\"L\" and \"S\") shortly after they emerged within the E. coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). We engineered genome-wide barcoded transposon libraries to measure the fitness effects of all possible gene knockouts in the coexisting strains as well as their ancestor, for many different, ecologically relevant conditions. We found that the fitness effects of many gene knockouts sensitively depends on the genetic background and the ecological conditions, as set by the abiotic environment and relative frequency of both ecotypes. Despite the idiosyncratic behavior of individual knockouts, we still see consistent statistical patterns of fitness effect variation across both genetic background and community composition. Genes that are in the same operon, or that strongly interact with each other, are more likely to be correlated with each other across backgrounds compared to random pairs of genes. Additionally, fitness effects are correlated with evolutionary outcomes for a number of conditions, possibly revealing shifting patterns of adaptation. Together, our results reveal how ecological and epistatic effects combine to drive adaptive potential in a nascent ecological community.",

    "abstract": "In the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) inhibits the innate immune response by inserting its C-terminal helices into the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome and promoting mRNA degradation. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which Nsp1 achieves host translational shutoff while allowing for viral protein synthesis remains elusive. We set out to characterize the interactome of full-length Nsp1 and its topology by crosslinking mass spectrometry in order to investigate the role of the N-terminal domain and linker regions in host translational shutoff. We find that these regions are in contact with 40S proteins lining the mRNA entry channel and detect a novel interaction with the G subunit of the eIF3 complex. The crosslink-derived distance restraints allowed us to derive an integrative model of full-length Nsp1 on the 40S subunit, reporting on the dynamic interface between Nsp1, the ribosome and the eIF3 complex. The significance of the Nsp1-eIF3G interaction is supported by further evidence that Nsp1 predominantly binds to 40-43S complexes. Our results point towards a mechanism by which Nsp1 is preferentially recruited to canonical initiation complexes, leading to subsequent mRNA degradation.",

    "abstract": "The Motor-Cognitive model suggests a functional dissociation between motor imagery and overt action, in contrast to the Functional Equivalence view of common processes between the two behaviours. According to the Motor-Cognitive model, motor imagery differs from overt action primarily through the use of executive resources to monitor and elaborate a motor image during execution, which can result in a lack of correspondence between motor imagery and its overt action counterpart. The present study examined the importance of executive resources in motor imagery by using TMS to impair the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while measuring the time to complete imagined versus overt actions. In two experiments, TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slowed motor imagery but did not affect overt actions. TMS over the same region also interfered with performance of a mental calculation task, though it did not reliably affect less demanding cognitive tasks also thought to rely on executive functions. Taken together, these results were consistent with the Motor-Cognitive model but not with the idea of functional equivalence. The implications of these results for the theoretical understanding of motor imagery, and potential applications of the Motor-Cognitive model to the use of motor imagery in training and rehabilitation, are discussed.",

However, the current physical understanding of the mechanical responses of TGTs remains limited, which restricts the range of information that can be extracted from experimental observations. In order to provide quantitative in-depth understanding and interpretation of experimental observations, in this work, we quantified the tension-dependent lifetime of TGTs from which the mechanical stability of TGTs under various physiologically relevant stretching conditions can be derived. Applications of the determined mechanical stability of TGTs to cell studies strongly suggest revisiting the previous interpretations of several reported experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "De novo gene origination, where a previously non-genic genomic sequence becomes genic through evolution, has been increasingly recognized as an important source of evolutionary novelty across diverse taxa. Many de novo genes have been proposed to be protein-coding, and in several cases have been experimentally shown to yield protein products. However, the systematic study of de novo proteins has been hampered by doubts regarding the translation of their transcripts without the experimental observation of protein products. Using a systematic, ORF-focused mass-spectrometry-first computational approach, we identify almost 1000 unannotated open reading frames with evidence of translation (utORFs) in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, 371 of which have canonical start codons. To quantify the comparative genomic similarity of these utORFs across Drosophila and to infer phylostratigraphic age, we further develop a synteny-based protein similarity approach. Combining these results with reference datasets on tissue- and life-stage-specific transcription and conservation, we identify different properties amongst these utORFs. Contrary to expectations, the fastest-evolving utORFs are not the youngest evolutionarily. We observed more utORFs in the brain than in the testis. Most of the identified utORFs may be of de novo origin, even accounting for the possibility of false-negative similarity detection. Finally, sequence divergence after an inferred de novo origin event remains substantial, raising the possibility that de novo proteins turn over frequently. Our results suggest that there is substantial unappreciated diversity in de novo protein evolution: many more may exist than have been previously appreciated; there may be divergent evolutionary trajectories; and de novo proteins may be gained and lost frequently. All in all, there may not exist a single characteristic model of de novo protein evolution, but rather complex origins and evolutionary trajectories for de novo proteins.\n\nImpact statementThe analysis of mass-spectrometry data for all possible open reading frames reveals protein evidence for evolutionarily young, unannotated proteins with distinct characters.",

    "abstract": "Insulin-resistant brain state is proposed to be the early sign of Alzheimers disease(AD), which can be studied in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rodent model. ICV-STZ is reported to induce sporadic AD with the majority of the disease hallmarks as phenotype. On the other hand, Available experimental evidence has used varying doses of STZ (<1 to 3mg/kg) and studied its effect for different study durations, ranging from 14-270 days. Though these studies suggest 3mg/kg of ICV-STZ to be the optimum dose for progressive pathogenesis, the reason for such is elusive.\n\nHere we sought to investigate the mechanism of action of 3mg/kg ICV-STZ on cognitive and non-cognitive aspects at a follow-up interval of two weeks for two months. On 60th day, we examined layer thickness, cell density, ventricular volume, spine density, protein expression related to brain metabolism and mitochondrial function by histological examination. Findings suggest progressive loss of spatial, episodic, avoidance memory with increase in anxiety in a span of two month. Furthermore, hippocampal neurodegeneration, ventricular enlargement, diffused amyloid plaque deposition, loss of spine in dentate gyrus and imbalance in energy homeostasis was found on 60th day post injection. Interestingly, AD rats showed a uniform fraction of time spent in four quadrants of water maze with change in strategy when they were exposed to height. Our findings reveal that ICV-STZ injection at a dose of 3mg/kg can cause cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities due to structural loss both at neuronal as well as synaptic level, which is tightly associated with change in neuronal metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial wilt pathogens in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) have broad but finite host ranges. Population genetic surveys of RSSC pathogens show that many sequevars (subspecies groups) are predominantly recovered from wilting solanaceous plants. In contrast, strains in the IIB-4 sequevar have been isolated from plants in over a dozen families. Certain IIB-4 lineages have been classified as banana-virulent or \"not pathogenic to banana (NPB)\". Prior analysis suggested that the NPB lineage has diverged from the banana-virulent IIB-4 strains. To test this model, we analyzed the phenotypes and phylogeny of a diverse collection of 19 IIB-4 isolates. We used Illumina sequencing to assemble draft genomes of 12 new strains. Based on whole genome phylogenetic analysis, these IIB-4 strains clustered into five subclades. We quantified virulence of each strain on tomato, banana, melon, and impatiens plants. Overall, the virulence patterns correlated with phylogeny. Banana virulence was restricted to the 4/4 IIB-4D subclade (N=4/4 strains) and IIB-4E subclade (N=1/2 strains). Subclades IIB-4D and IIB-4E are sister subclades and their closest relative, the IIB-4A-C subclade, lacked virulence on banana. Our data support a revised model in which banana virulence is an innovation within the IIB4D/E subclades.\n\nData SummaryIllumina sequencing and genome assembly data are available as NCBI BioProject PRJNA826884, and Table S1 lists the accession numbers for assemblies in GenBank and raw sequencing data in SRA.

    "abstract": "The vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin) has anticancer potential. However, lack of clinical success has prevented its approval for solid tumours. Herein, we propose combining short-term low-dose ATRA preconditioning with fimaporfin-based photodynamic therapy (ATRA+PDT) for the improved treatment of solid cancers. Compared to monotherapies, ATRA+PDT induced synergistic cytotoxic responses including promotion of apoptosis in colon and breast carcinoma cell lines. Neither enhanced activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) nor increased expression of CD133 was detected after ATRA treatment indicating that ATRA+PDT cause cell death independent of differentiation. In the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29, the effect of ATRA+PDT on gene expression was evaluated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We identified 1129 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after ATRA+PDT compared to PDT. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) predicted the unfolded protein response (UPR), interferon (IFN) signaling and retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling as strongly activated canonical pathways after ATRA+PDT compared to PDT. A validation of the RNA-sec data by RT-qPCR revealed that ATRA+PDT elevated mRNA expression of early growth response 1 (EGR1) and strongly the stress-induced activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), of which was confirmed on the protein level. In addition, ATRA+PDT abolished mRNA expression of regenerating islet-derived protein 4 (REG4). During the first 20 days post-ATRA+PDT, we obtained significant anti-tumour responses in HT-29 xenografts, including complete responses in 2/5 mice. In conclusion, ATRA+PDT represent a novel combination therapy for solid tumours that should be further tested in immunocompetent preclinical models.",

Single cell data integration tasks can be categorized into horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and mosaic integration, where mosaic integration is the most general and challenging case with few methods developed. We propose scMoMaT, a method that is able to integrate single cell multi-omics data under the mosaic integration scenario using matrix tri-factorization. During integration, scMoMaT is also able to uncover the cluster specific bio-markers across modalities. These multi-modal bio-markers are used to interpret and annotate the clusters to cell types. Moreover, scMoMaT can integrate cell batches with unequal cell type compositions. Applying scMoMaT to multiple real and simulated datasets demonstrated these features of scMoMaT and showed that scMoMaT has superior performance compared to existing methods. We also show that integrated cell embedding combined with learned bio-markers leads to cell type annotations of higher quality or resolution compared to their original annotations.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic placement is the problem of placing \"query\" sequences into an existing tree (called a \"backbone tree\"), and is useful in both microbiome analysis and to update large evolutionary trees. The most accurate phylogenetic placement method to date is the maximum likelihood-based method pplacer, which uses RAxML to estimate numeric parameters on the backbone tree and then adds the given query sequence to the edge that maximizes the probability that the resulting tree generates the query sequence. Unfortunately, pplacer fails to return valid outputs on many moderately large datasets, and so is limited to backbone trees with at most [~]10,000 leaves. In TCBB 2022, Wedell et al. introduced SCAMPP, a technique to enable pplacer to run on larger backbone trees. SCAMPP operates by finding a small \"placement subtree\" specific to each query sequence, within which the query sequence are placed using pplacer. That approach matched the scalability and accuracy of APPLES-2, the previous most scalable method. In this study, we explore a different aspect of pplacers strategy: the technique used to estimate numeric parameters on the backbone tree. We confirm anecdotal evidence that using FastTree instead of RAxML to estimate numeric parameters on the backbone tree enables pplacer to scale to much larger backbone trees, almost (but not quite) matching the scalability of APPLES-2 and pplacer-SCAMPP. We then evaluate the combination of these two techniques - SCAMPP and the use of FastTree. We show that this combined approach, pplacer-SCAMPP-FastTree, has the same scalability as APPLES-2, improves on the scalability of pplacer-FastTree, and achieves better accuracy than the comparably scalable methods.

    "abstract": "SUMMARYCell type is hypothesized to be a key determinant of the role of a neuron within a circuit. However, it is unknown whether a neurons transcriptomic type influences the timing of its activity in the intact brain. In other words, can transcriptomic cell type be extracted from the time series of a neurons activity? To address this question, we developed a new deep learning architecture that learns features of interevent intervals across multiple timescales (milliseconds to >30 min). We show that transcriptomic cell class information is robustly embedded in the timing of single neuron activity recorded in the intact brain of behaving animals (calcium imaging and extracellular electrophysiology), as well as in a bio-realistic model of visual cortex. In contrast, we were unable to reliably extract cell identity from summary measures of rate, variance, and interevent interval statistics. We applied our analyses to the question of whether transcriptomic subtypes of excitatory neurons represent functionally distinct classes. In the calcium imaging dataset, which contains a diverse set of excitatory Cre lines, we found that a subset of excitatory cell types are computationally distinguishable based upon their Cre lines, and that excitatory types can be classified with higher accuracy when considering their cortical layer and projection class. Here we address the fundamental question of whether a neuron, within a complex cortical network, embeds a fingerprint of its transcriptomic identity into its activity. Our results reveal robust computational fingerprints for transcriptomic types and classes across diverse contexts, defined over multiple timescales.",

Within the diverse tumor subpopulations, Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells (GSC) have been involved in GBM recurrence. In our study, we demonstrated that these tumor cells can be identified through singular mitochondrial alternative metabolisms. Combining state-of-the-art metabolic studies and the development of a straightforward tumoroid model recapitulating key features of primary GBM cultures, we uncovered a significant use of -ketoglutarate reductive carboxylation and pyruvate carboxylation in tumoroid GBM cells, catalyzed respectively by isocitrate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase enzymes. We demonstrated that these singular metabolic features are shared by GBM cells from the mesenchymal subtype and radiation-escaping cells, also involved in recurrence. Finally, we demonstrated that pyruvate carboxylation is required for GBM cell survival in hypoxic niches where glutamine is restricted. Thus, besides providing a new way to identify GSC, our study also opens new therapeutic strategy to limit GBM recurrence.",

In this study, we quantitatively investigated the nanoscale distribution of PI(4,5)P2 on the neuronal cell membranes by SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling with cryo-fixed mouse cerebellum. We demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 makes clusters with a mean size of [~] 1,000 nm2 and these clusters show preferential accumulation in specific membrane compartments depending on cell types. Purkinje cell (PC) spines and granule cell (GC) presynaptic active zones are particularly rich in the PI(4,5)P2 clusters. Furthermore, these clusters are extensively associated with clusters of CaV2.1 and GIRK3 throughout different membrane compartments of PCs, GCs, and molecular layer interneurons. In contrast, these clusters showed compartment-specific association with mGluR1 in PC spines.

However, traditional multi-tissue integration methods cannot handle uncollected tissues or rely on genotype information, which is subject to privacy concerns and often unavailable. To address these challenges, we present HYFA (Hypergraph Factorisation), a novel method for joint imputation of multi-tissue and cell-type gene expression. HYFA imputes tissue-specific gene expression via a specialised graph neural network operating on a hypergraph of individuals, metagenes, and tissues. HYFA is genotype- agnostic, supports a variable number of collected tissues per individual, and imposes strong inductive biases to leverage the shared regulatory architecture of tissues. In performance comparison on data from the Genotype Tissue Expression project, HYFA achieves superior performance over existing transcriptome imputation methods, especially when multiple reference tissues are available. Through transfer learning on a paired single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) dataset, we further show that HYFA can accurately resolve cell-type signatures from bulk gene expression, highlighting the methods ability to leverage gene expression programs underlying cell-type identity, even in tissues that were never observed in the training set. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we find that the metagenes learned by HYFA capture information about known biological pathways. Notably, the HYFA-imputed dataset can be used to identify regulatory genetic variations (eQTLs), with substantial gains over the original incomplete dataset. Our framework can accelerate effective and scalable integration of tissue and cell-type gene expression biorepositories.",

    "abstract": "Sperm motility is necessary for successful fertilization, but there remains controversy about whether human sperm motility is primarily powered by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.\n\nSignificance StatementDevelopment of novel contraceptives is critical, since half of all pregnancies are still unplanned, even in developed countries. This high unplanned pregnancy rate contributes to a wide variety of social, environmental, and ecological problems. Impairing human sperm is a way to develop male and unisex contraceptives, but much remains unknown about these unique cells. Here we settle a long-running debate about human sperm metabolism, finding that human sperm can maintain their ATP levels without mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This finding will help focus future contraceptive development efforts. We also identify the potential use of an FDA-approved compound (Niclosamide) as a motility-impairing ingredient in spermicides and correct the misunderstood subcellular localization of an existing contraceptive target, Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4.",

However, accurately identifying the tens of contacting ones from hundreds of thousands of inter-protein residue pairs is extremely challenging, and performances of the state-of-the-art inter-protein contact prediction methods are still quite limited. In this study, we developed a deep learning method for inter-protein contact prediction, referred to as DRN-1D2D_Inter. Specifically, we employed pretrained protein language models to generate structural information enriched input features to residual networks formed by dimensional hybrid residual blocks to perform inter-protein contact prediction. Extensively benchmarked DRN-1D2D_Inter on multiple datasets including both heteromeric PPIs and homomeric PPIs, we show DRN-1D2D_Inter consistently and significantly outperformed two state-of-the-art inter-protein contact prediction methods including GLINTER and DeepHomo, although both the latter two methods leveraged native structures of interacting proteins in the prediction, and DRN-1D2D_Inter made the prediction purely from sequences.",

We uncovered the genetic, cell signaling and metabolic processes underlying specification of the progenitors and how they contribute to subtypes of endothelial and interstitial embryonic and postnatal valvular cells. Using clonal genetic tracing with multicolor reporter, we describe specific modes of growth of endocardial cell-derived clones which build up in a proper manner functional valve leaflets.\n\nOur data reveal how both genetic and metabolic specification mechanisms specifically drive the fate of a subset of endocardial cells toward valve progenitors and their distinct clonal contribution to the formation of the valve.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques such as deep learning have been increasingly used to assist EEG annotation, by automating artifact recognition, sleep staging, and seizure detection. In lack of automation, the annotation process is prone to bias, even for trained annotators. On the other hand, completely automated processes do not offer the users the opportunity to inspect the models output and re-evaluate potential false predictions. As a first step towards addressing these challenges, we developed Robins Viewer (RV), a Python-based EEG viewer for annotating time-series EEG data. The key feature distinguishing RV from existing EEG viewers is the visualization of output predictions of deep-learning models trained to recognize patterns in EEG data. RV was developed on top of the plotting library Plotly, the app-building framework Dash, and the popular M/EEG analysis toolbox MNE. It is an open-source, platform-independent, interactive web application, which supports common EEG-file formats to facilitate easy integration with other EEG toolboxes. RV includes common features of other EEG viewers, e.g., a view-slider, tools for marking bad channels and transient artifacts, and customizable preprocessing. Altogether, RV is an EEG viewer that combines the predictive power of deep-learning models and the knowledge of scientists and clinicians to optimize EEG annotation. With the training of new deep-learning models, RV could be developed to detect clinical patterns other than artifacts, for example sleep stages and EEG abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhen deep-sea hydrothermal fluids mix with cold oxygenated fluids, minerals precipitate out of solution and form hydrothermal deposits. These actively venting deep-sea hydrothermal vent deposits support a rich diversity of thermophilic microorganisms which are involved in a range of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen metabolisms. Global patterns of thermophilic microbial diversity in deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems have illustrated the strong connectivity between geological processes and microbial colonization, but little is known about the genomic diversity and physiological potential of these novel taxa. Here we explore this genomic diversity in 42 metagenomes from four deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields and a deep-sea volcano collected from 2004 to 2018, and document their potential implications in biogeochemical cycles.\n\nResultsOur dataset represents 3,635 metagenome-assembled genomes encompassing 511 novel genera, with 395 Bacteria and 116 Archaea, providing many targets for cultivation of novel archaeal and bacterial families. Notably, 52% (206) of the novel bacterial genera and 72% (84) of the novel archaeal genera were found at the deep-sea Brothers volcano, many of which were endemic to the volcano. We report some of the first examples of medium to high-quality MAGs from phyla and families never previously identified, or poorly sampled, from deep-sea hydrothermal environments. We greatly expand the novel diversity of Thermoproteia, Patescibacteria (Candidate Phyla Radiation, CPR), and Chloroflexota found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and identify a small sampling of two potentially novel phyla, designated JALSQH01 and JALWCF01. Metabolic pathway analysis of metagenomes provides insights into the prevalent carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and hydrogen metabolic processes across all sites, and illustrates sulfur and nitrogen metabolic  handoffs in community interactions. We confirm that Campylobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria occupy similar ecological guilds but their prevalence in a particular site is driven by shifts in the geochemical environment.\n\nConclusionOur study of globally-distributed hydrothermal vent deposits provides a significant expansion of microbial genomic diversity associated with hydrothermal vent deposits and highlights the metabolic adaptation of taxonomic guilds. Collectively, our results illustrate the importance of comparative biodiversity studies in establishing patterns of shared phylogenetic diversity and physiological ecology, while providing many targets for enrichment and cultivation of novel and endemic taxa.",

    "abstract": "The filamentous fungus Fusarium oxysporum causes vascular wilt disease in a wide range of plant species and opportunistic infections in humans. Previous work suggested that invasive growth in this pathogen is controlled by environmental cues such as pH and nutrient status. Here we investigated the role of Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), a global regulator of eukaryotic cell growth and development. Inactivation of the negative regulator Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (Tsc2), but not constitutive activation of the positive regulator Gtr1, in F. oxysporum resulted in inappropriate activation of TORC1 signaling under nutrient limiting conditions. The tsc2{Delta} mutants showed reduced colony growth on minimal medium with different nitrogen sources and increased sensitivity to cell wall or high temperature stress. Furthermore, these mutants were impaired in invasive hyphal growth across cellophane membranes and exhibited a marked decrease in virulence, both on tomato plants and on the invertebrate animal host Galleria mellonella. Importantly, invasive hyphal growth in tsc2{Delta} strains was rescued by rapamycin-mediated inhibition of TORC1. Collectively, these results reveal a key role of TORC1 signaling in development and pathogenicity of F. oxysporum and suggest new potential targets for controlling fungal infections.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYFilamentous fungal pathogens cause devastating losses in agriculture and lethal infections in humans. A prerequisite of fungal infection is invasive hyphal growth, a process that is exquisitely controlled by environmental cues including nutrients and host signals. Here we examined the role of TOR complex 1 (TORC1), a conserved pathway that regulates cell growth in response to nutrient status. We show that deregulation of TORC1 signaling impairs pathogenicity in Fusarium oxysporum, a cross-kingdom fungal pathogen that attacks more than 150 different crops as well as immunocompromised humans. Inactivation of Tsc2, a negative regulator of TORC1, led to constitutive TORC1 activation, reduced growth under nutrient-limiting conditions and increased sensitivity to cell wall stress. Importantly, tsc2{Delta} mutants were impaired in invasive hyphal growth and in virulence on plant and animal hosts. Our results support a conserved role of TORC1 as a negative regulator of pathogenicity-related functions and reveal new leads for antifungal drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Robust Perfect Adaptation (RPA) is a ubiquitously-observed signalling response across all scales of biological organisation. A major class of network architectures that drive RPA in complex networks is the Opposer module - a feedback-regulated network into which specialised integral-computing  opposer node(s) are embedded. Although ultrasensitivity-generating chemical reactions have long been considered a possible mechanism for such adaptation-conferring opposer nodes, this hypothesis has relied on simplified Michaelian models, which neglect the presence of protein-protein complexes, and which are now widely acknowledged to make inaccurate predictions of signalling responses. Here we develop complex-complete models of interlinked covalent-modification cycles with embedded ultrasensitivity: explicitly capturing all molecular interactions and protein complexes. Strikingly, we demonstrate that the presence of protein-protein complexes thwarts the networks capacity for RPA in any  free active protein form, conferring RPA capacity instead on the concentration of a larger protein pool consisting of two distinct forms of a single protein. Furthermore, compared to predictions by simplified models, the parametric requirements for RPA in this protein pool are much more severe, and RPA generally obtains over a narrower range of input stimuli. These surprising results raise fundamental new questions as to the biochemical requirements for adaptation-conferring Opposer modules within complex cellular networks.",

Tat is especially required for the transcription of viral genes but it is still not clear if and how Tat is incorporated into HIV-1 virions. Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a prolylisomerase that binds to HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) and is thereby encapsidated. Here we found that a Tat-CypA-CA tripartite complex assembles in HIV-1 infected cells. Biochemical and biophysical studies showed that high affinity interactions drive the assembly of this complex. Virions devoid of encapsidated Tat showed a 5-10 fold decrease in HIV-infectivity and, conversely, encapsidating Tat into {Delta}Tat viruses greatly enhanced infectivity. The absence of encapsidated Tat decreases the efficiency of retrotranscription by [~]50% and transcription by 99%. We thus identified a Tat-CypA-CA complex that enables Tat encapsidation and showed that encapsidated Tat is required to initiate robust HIV-1 infection and viral production.",

NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is one of the most important moleculars in the range of cell protection. We examined the expression of NRF2 in PH models and explored the role of NRF2 in regulating abnormal phenotypes in pulmonary artery cells. We determined the expression level of NRF2 in lung tissues of PH model decreased significantly. We found that NRF2 was reduced in rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (rPAEC) under hypoxia, while it was overexpressed in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (rPASMC) under hypoxia. Next, the results showed that knockdown NRF2 in rPAEC promoted endothelial-mesenchymal transformation and upregulated reactive oxygen species level. After the rPASMC was treated with siRNA or activator, we found that NRF2 could promote cell proliferation by regulating PDGFR/ERK1/2 and mTOR/P70S6K pathways, and accelerate cell migration by affecting MMP2/3/7. Therefore, the study suggests that the combination of NRF2 activators should be considered to eliminate the promoting effect of NRF2 activators on proliferation and migration of rPASMC.\n\nSummary statementHypoxia regulates NRF2 in PAECs and PASMCs differently.

    "abstract": "Inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) comprise a specific class of signaling molecules that regulate central biological processes in eukaryotes. The conserved Vip1/PPIP5K family controls intracellular IP8 levels, the highest phosphorylated form of IPPs present in yeasts, as it has both inositol kinase and pyrophosphatase activities. Previous studies have shown that the fission yeast S. pombe Vip1/PPIP5K family member Asp1 impacts chromosome transmission fidelity via modulation of spindle function. We now demonstrate that an IP8 analogue is targeted by endogenous Asp1 and that cellular IP8 is subject to cell cycle control. Mitotic entry requires Asp1 kinase function and IP8 levels are increased at the G2/M transition. In addition, the kinetochore, the conductor of chromosome segregation assembled on chromosomes is modulated by IP8. Members of the yeast CCAN kinetochore-subcomplex such as Mal2/CENP-O localize to the kinetochore depending on the intracellular IP8-level: higher than wild-type IP8 levels reduces Mal2 kinetochore targeting, while a reduction in IP8 has the opposite effect. As our perturbations of the inositol polyphosphate and IPP pathways demonstrate that kinetochore architecture depends solely on IP8 and not on other IPPs, we conclude that chromosome transmission fidelity is controlled by IP8 via an interplay between entry into mitosis, kinetochore architecture and spindle dynamics.",

We also observed several instances of an additional cell type in the medial layer between endothelial cells and pericytes, specifically associated with EPs. A conserved characteristic across PC subtypes was extracellular matrix (ECM) encompassing the vascular unit and dispersed among neighboring cells. ECM thicknesses fell within a specific range depending on vessel location, and only thinned where cells were in closer proximity. Pericytes and endothelial cells formed \"peg-and-socket\" structures at these locations, providing another distinguishing feature across PC subtypes. Unique contact locations seemed to be present between medial and endothelial cells, as well as between vascular cells and the brain parenchyma. The ECM surrounding EPs exhibited another notable configuration in that thin extensions radiated out from the vessel wall into the surrounding parenchyma, suggesting mechanical and/or biochemical roles. Considering these data together, ultrastructural observations may provide an orthogonal perspective on pericyte heterogeneity and the presence of medial cells in cerebrovascular walls as well as assessing ECM coverage as a criterion for PC identification and exploring PC-associated ECM extensions that may have unique relevance in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is essential for both physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic morphogenesis, wound repair and metastasis of cancer cells. Collective cell migration is the coordinated movement of multiple cells connected with cadherin-based adherence junctions. Cadherins undergo dynamic intracellular trafficking and their surface level is determined by a balance between endocytosis, recycling and degradation. However, regulatory mechanisms of cadherin turnover in the collective cell migration remain to be elucidated.\n\nIn this study, we show that a BAR domain protein pacsin 2 plays an essential role in collective cell migration by regulating the internalization of N-cadherin in human bladder cancer cells T24. Pacsin 2 and its associating GTPase dynamin 2 colocalized with N-cadherin at the cell periphery in T24 cells. Depletion of either pacsin 2 or dynamin 2 induced interdigitating cell-cell contacts enriched with N-cadherin. Imaging analyses of the wound healing assay showed that pacsin 2-depleted T24 cells migrated in a collective and directed manner in contrast with randomly migrating control cells. Furthermore, cell-surface biotinylation assay showed that internalization of N-cadherin is attenuated in pacsin 2-depleted cells. Interestingly, the GST-pulldown assay demonstrated that the SH3 domain of pacsin 2 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin, suggesting that surface levels of N-cadherin are regulated by pacsin 2-mediated endocytosis. These data support new insights into a novel endocytic route of N-cadherin in collective cell migration providing pacsin 2 as a possible therapeutic target for cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "An outbreak of Monkeypox has been reported in 75 countries so far, and it is spreading at a fast pace around the world. The clinical attributes of Monkeypox resemble those of Smallpox, while skin lesions and rashes of Monkeypox often resemble those of other poxes, for example, Chickenpox and Cowpox. These similarities make Monkeypox detection challenging for healthcare professionals by examining the visual appearance of lesions and rashes. Additionally, there is a knowledge gap among healthcare professionals due to the rarity of Monkeypox before the current outbreak. Motivated by the success of artificial intelligence (AI) in COVID-19 detection, the scientific community has shown an increasing interest in using AI in Monkeypox detection from digital skin images. However, the lack of Monkeypox skin image data has been the bottleneck of using AI in Monkeypox detection. Therefore, in this paper, we used a web-scrapping-based Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Smallpox, Cowpox, Measles, and healthy skin image dataset to study the feasibility of using state-of-the-art AI deep models on skin images for Monkeypox detection. Our study found that deep AI models have great potential in the detection of Monkeypox from digital skin images (precision of 85%). However, achieving a more robust detection power requires larger training samples to train those deep models.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is essential for infection, and is a target for neutralizing antibodies. Consequently, selection of mutations in the S protein is expected to be driven by the impact on the interaction with hACE2 and antibody escape. Here, for the first time, we systematically characterized the collective effects of mutations in each of the Omicron sub-lineages (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.4) on both the viral S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the hACE2 protein using post molecular dynamics studies and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis. Our analysis suggested that Omicron sub-lineage mutations result in altered physicochemical properties that change conformational flexibility compared to the reference structure, and may contribute to antibody escape. We also observed changes in the hACE2 substrate binding groove in some sub-lineages. Notably, we identified unique allosteric communication paths in the reference protein complex formed by the DRN metrics betweenness centrality and eigencentrality hubs, originating from the RBD core traversing the receptor binding motif of the S protein and the N-terminal domain of the hACE2 to the active site. We showed allosteric changes in residue network paths in both the RBD and hACE2 proteins due to Omicron sub-lineage mutations. Taken together, these data suggest progressive evolution of the Omicron S protein RBD in sub-lineages towards a more efficient interaction with the hACE2 receptor which may account for the increased transmissibility of Omicron variants.",

This revealed that LAMP1- and RAB7-tagged organelles move significantly faster than NPY tagged organelles in both anterograde and retrograde direction. NPY travelled more selectively in anterograde direction than LAMP1 and RAB7. By using a synapse marker and a calcium sensor we further investigated the transport dynamics of NPY-tagged organelles. We found that these organelles slow down and pause at synapses. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, a significant increase of transport speed was observed after spontaneous activity and elevated calcium levels in vivo as well as electrically stimulated activity in acute brain slices. Together, we show a remarkable diversity in speeds and properties of three axonal organelle marker in vivo that differ from properties previously observed in vitro.",

However, factors associated with this inter-individual variation remain unclear. Here, using a systems biology approach based on multi-omics analyses of human blood and stool samples, we find that baseline expression of AP-1 transcription factors, FOS and ATF3, is inversely correlated with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-induced T-cell responses. FOS expression is associated with transcription modules related to baseline immunity, but it is negatively associated with those related to T-cell activation upon BNT162b2 mRNA stimulation. Interestingly, the gut microbial fucose/rhamnose degradation pathway is positively correlated with FOS and ATF3 expression and inversely correlated with BNT162b2-induced T-cell responses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that baseline expression of AP-1 genes, which is associated with the gut microbial fucose/rhamnose degradation pathway, is a key negative correlate of BNT162b2-induced T-cell responses.",

    "abstract": "The infectious disease human monkeypox is spreading rapidly in 2022 causing a global health crisis. The genomics of the monkeypox virus (MPXV) have been extensively analyzed and reported, although little is known about the virus-encoded proteome. In particular, there is almost no structure information about MPXV proteins, other than computational models. Here we report a 1.52 [A] x-ray structure of the MPXV protein A42R, the only MPXV-encoded protein with a known structure. This protein shows sequence similarity to profilins, which are cellular proteins known to function in regulation of actin cytoskeletal assembly. However, structural comparison of the A42R with known members of the profilin family reveals critical differences that support prior biochemical findings that this protein only weakly binds actin and does not bind poly(L-proline). In addition, the analysis suggests that this protein may have distinct interactions with phosphatidylinositol lipids. Overall, our data suggest that the role of A42R in replication of orthopoxviruses may not be easily determined by comparison to cellular profilins. Further, our findings support a need for increased efforts to determine high-resolution structures of other MPXV proteins to inform physiological studies of the poxvirus infection cycle and to reveal potential new strategies to combat human monkeypox should the infection become more common in the future.",

Multiple single amino acid changes in Mpro confer resistance to nirmatrelvir (the active component of Paxlovid).

The Mpro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir, is the antiviral component of Paxlovid, an orally available treatment for COVID-19. As Mpro inhibitor use increases, drug resistant mutations will likely emerge. We have established a non-pathogenic system, in which yeast growth serves as a proxy for Mpro activity, enabling rapid identification of mutants with altered enzymatic activity and drug sensitivity. The E166 residue is known to be a potential hot spot for drug resistance and yeast assays showed that an E166R substitution conferred strong nirmatrelvir resistance while an E166N mutation compromised activity. On the other hand, N142A and P132H mutations caused little to no change in drug response and activity. Standard enzymatic assays confirmed the yeast results. In turn, we solved the structures of Mpro E166R, and Mpro E166N, providing insights into how arginine may drive drug resistance while asparagine leads to reduced activity. The work presented here will help characterize novel resistant variants of Mpro that may arise as Mpro antivirals become more widely used.",

    "abstract": "Nirmatrelvir, an oral antiviral targeting the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2, has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in reducing hospitalization or death due to COVID-191,2. However, as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities3-9, there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here, we have examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in increasing concentrations of nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale in 480 wells. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both, and their sequences revealed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment done at a larger scale with many replicates, 53 independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23 different residues of the enzyme. Yet, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L, or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 clones, each containing a unique mutation or a combination of mutations showed that the above precursor mutations only mediated low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (~100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I. Structural explanations are discussed for some of the mutations that are proximal to the drug-binding site, as well as cross-resistance or lack thereof to ensitrelvir, another clinically important 3CL protease inhibitor. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir does readily arise via multiple pathways in vitro, and the specific mutations observed herein form a strong foundation from which to study the mechanism of resistance in detail and to inform the design of next generation protease inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The gut-lung axis describes the interaction between microbiota in the gut and health status of the airway, whereby there is a bidirectional relationship facilitated by systemic transport of microbially-derived metabolites and immune factors. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that is associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Recent literature has shown that the microbial dysbiosis in the CF gut can alter the hosts inflammatory status and that there are distinct microbial compositions in children with CF who have low versus high intestinal inflammation. These distinct microbial profiles can be used as signatures in children with CF (cwCF) to predict health outcomes. Here, we use supervised machine learning to train a random forest model on the distinct microbial composition of cwCF to predict: age (as a validation of the method), frequency of upper respiratory infection (URIfreq), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a clinical marker for systemic inflammation that negatively correlates with lung function. We find that the out of bag error, a measure of model accuracy, is lower when predicting age for cwCF compared to children without CF, consistent with previous data. We are able to predict high URIfreq with only 16% error and high NLR with 27% error. This machine learning pipeline may allow physicians and microbiome researchers to use the stool microbiota of cwCF as a tool for identifying individuals with the more negative airway clinical outcomes from this population, and potentially allow for early intervention.\n\nImportanceChildren with CF (cwCF) often experience chronic respiratory infections, leading to progressive, irreversible lung function decline and significant morbidity and premature mortality. Modulator therapy has revolutionized the treatment of eligible adults with CF. cwCF as young as age 6 are now eligible to receive modulator therapy, although by early childhood many children have already experienced pulmonary exacerbations. Here we show that for cwCF, stool microbiota composition is associated with higher upper respiratory infection frequency and increased systemic inflammation. Our findings may aid in developing diagnostic tools that can allow physicians further understanding of which intestinal microbiota profiles are associated with health outcomes and to identify targets for preventative treatment for cwCF.",

    "abstract": "Type I CRISPR systems are the most common CRISPR type found in bacteria. They use a multisubunit effector, guided by crRNA, to detect and bind dsDNA targets, forming an R-loop and recruiting the Cas3 enzyme to facilitate target DNA destruction, thus providing immunity against mobile genetic elements. Subtypes have been classified into families A-G, with type I-G being the least well understood. Here, we report the composition, structure and function of the type I-G Cascade CRISPR effector from Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus, revealing key new molecular details. The unique Csb2 subunit processes pre-crRNA, remaining bound to the 3 end of the mature crRNA, and seven Cas7 subunits form the backbone of the effector. Cas3 associates stably with the effector complex via the Cas8g subunit and is important for target DNA recognition. Structural analysis by cryo-Electron Microscopy reveals a strikingly curved backbone conformation with Cas8g spanning the belly of the structure. Type I-G Cascade is one of the most streamlined Class 1 CRISPR effectors. These biochemical and structural insights shed new light on the diversity of type I systems and open the way to applications in genome engineering.",

    "abstract": "Coastal aquaculture operations for feed additive species results in the release of waste into the surrounding environment, with the potential for adverse environmental change. Ubiquitous pelagic protists are sensitive to environmental changes making them potential sentinels for detecting and monitoring impacts. This study used 18S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing as a molecular tool to study the pelagic protist community, with the aim of evaluating their potential as bioindicators of aquaculture activity in a low-oxygen, highly stratified marine embayment. Sampling occurred at three different depths along a distance gradient from two leases and at three control sites. Our results showed that the diversity and composition of both phytoplankton and other protist communities were more strongly influenced by depth stratification than the aquaculture activity. Nonetheless, differential abundance and machine learning analyses revealed a suite of potential bioindicators for aquaculture activity; this included the phytoplankton taxa Chrysophyceae, Gymnodiniphycidae (Gyrodinium), Cryptomonadales and Ciliophora (Philasterides armatalis, Plagiopylida, and Strombidium). Among the other protists, ciliates were also more abundant in closer proximity to the leases in both surface and bottom samples. Overall, our findings indicated that the use of 18S rRNA sequencing of protist communities is a promising tool for identifying environmental changes from aquaculture in the water column.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExposure to microbes early in life has long-lasting effects on microbial community structure and function of the microbiome. However, in commercial poultry settings chicks are reared as a single-age cohort with no exposure to adult birds which can have profound effects on microbiota development and subsequent pathogen challenge. Microbiota manipulation is a proven and promising strategy to help reduce pathogen load and transmission within broiler flocks.\n\nResultsManipulation of the microbiota between 4 and 72 hours of hatch markedly reduces faecal shedding and colonisation with the foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST4/74). Administration route has minimal effect on the protection conferred with fewer birds in transplant groups shown to shed ST4/74 in the faeces compared to PBS-gavaged control birds. Analysis of the microbiome following transplantation demonstrated that the relative abundance of the anti-inflammatory bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was significantly higher in CMT groups compared to PBS controls. The presence of F. prausnitzii was also shown to increase in PBS-challenged birds compared to unchallenged birds potentially indicating a role of this bacterium in limiting Salmonella infections.\n\nConclusionsThis study highlights the efficacy of using microbiome transplants as a means to reduce colonisation and shedding of Salmonella in chickens. Effective protection can be conferred during the first few days of a chicks life regardless of time point and traditional hatchery delivery systems are sufficient to alter the microbiome and transfer donor material. Early microbiota intervention in chickens is a promising route of pathogen control in broiler flocks in the fight to control food-borne outbreaks in the human population.",

    "abstract": "Progress in molecular methods has enabled the monitoring of bacterial populations in time. Nevertheless, understanding community dynamics and its links with ecosystem functioning remains challenging due to the tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Conceptual frameworks that make sense of time-series of taxonomically-rich bacterial communities, regarding their potential ecological function, are needed. A key concept for organizing ecological functions is the niche, the set of strategies that enable a population to persist and define its impacts on the surroundings. Here we present a framework based on manifold learning, to organize genomic information into potentially occupied bacterial metabolic niches over time. We apply the method to re-construct the dynamics of putatively occupied metabolic niches using a long-term bacterial time-series from the Baltic Sea, the Linnaeus Microbial Observatory (LMO). The results reveal a relatively low-dimensional space of occupied metabolic niches comprising groups of taxa with similar functional capabilities. Time patterns of occupied niches were strongly driven by seasonality. Some metabolic niches were dominated by one bacterial taxon whereas others were occupied by multiple taxa, and this depended on season. These results illustrate the power of manifold learning approaches to advance our understanding of the links between community composition and functioning in microbial systems.\n\nImportanceThe increase in data availability of bacterial communities highlights the need for conceptual frameworks to advance our understanding of these complex and diverse communities alongside the production of such data. To understand the dynamics of these tremendously diverse communities, we need tools to identify overarching strategies and describe their role and function in the ecosystem in a comprehensive way. Here, we show that a manifold learning approach can coarse grain bacterial communities in terms of their metabolic strategies and that we can thereby quantitatively organize genomic information in terms of potentially occupied niches over time. This approach therefore advances our understanding of how fluctuations in bacterial abundances and species composition can relate to ecosystem functions and it can facilitate the analysis, monitoring and future predictions of the development of microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "The primary route of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission is through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, when it probes the skin of a vertebrate host during a blood meal. Viral particles are injected into the bite site together with mosquito saliva and a complex mixture of other components. Some of them are shown to play a key role in the augmentation of the arbovirus infection in the host, with increased viremia and/or morbidity. This vector-derived contribution to the infection is not usually considered when vaccine candidates are tested in preclinical animal models. In this study, we performed a preclinical validation of a promising ZIKV vaccine candidate in a mosquito-mouse transmission model using both Asian and African ZIKV lineages. Mice were immunized with engineered ZIKV virus-like particles and subsequently infected through the bite of ZIKV-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Despite a mild increase in viremia in mosquito-infected mice compared to those infected through traditional needle injection, the vaccine protected the animals from developing the disease and strongly reduced viremia. In addition, during peak viremia, naive mosquitoes were allowed to feed on infected vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice. Our analysis of viral titers in mosquitos showed that the vaccine was able to inhibit virus transmission from the host to the vector.\n\nAuthor summaryZika is a mosquito-borne viral disease, causing acute debilitating symptoms and complications in infected individuals and irreversible neuronal abnormalities in newborn children. The primary vectors of ZIKV are generally considered to be mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, in particular Aedes aegypti. Despite representing a significant public health burden with a widespread transmission in many regions of the world, Zika remains a neglected disease with no effective antiviral therapies or approved vaccines to control and prevent infections. The efficacy of several promising candidate vaccines is however under investigation, mainly through artificial infections (i.e. needle-mediated injections of the virus) in animal models, while it is known that components of the mosquito bite lead to an enhancement of viral infection and spread. In this study, we have also included mosquitoes as viral vectors, demonstrating that the ability of a promising candidate vaccine to protect animals against ZIKV infections after the bite of an infected mosquito, and to also prevent its further transmission. These findings represent an additional crucial step for the development of an effective prevention tool for clinical use.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503125v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136fd6borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137950borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a0e01org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8d90d7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "To alter microbial community composition for therapeutic purposes, an accurate and reliable modeling framework capable of predicting microbial community outcomes is required. Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations have been utilized to describe a breadth of microbial communities, yet, the conditions in which this modeling framework is successful remain unclear. Here, we propose that a set of simple in vitro experiments--growing each member in cell-free filtrates obtained from other members--can be used as a test to decide whether a LV model is appropriate for describing microbial interactions of interest. We show that for LV to be a good candidate, the ratio of growth rate to carrying capacity of each isolate when grown in the cell-free spent medium of other isolates should remain constant. Using an in vitro community of human nasal bacteria as a tractable system, we find that LV can be a good approximation when the environment is low-nutrient (i.e., when growth is limited by the availability of nutrients) and complex (i.e., when multiple resources, rather than a few, determine growth). These findings can help clarify the range of applicability of LV models and reveal when a more complex model may be necessary for predictive modeling of microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFor almost a century, it has been recognized that influenza A virus (IAV) infection can promote the development of secondary bacterial infections (SBI) mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). Recent observations have shown that IAV is able to directly bind to the surface of Spn. To gain a foundational understanding of how direct IAV-Spn interaction alters bacterial biological fitness we employed combinatorial multi-omic and molecular approaches.\n\nResultsHere we show IAV significantly remodels the global transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome profiles of Spn independently of host effectors. We identified Spn surface proteins that interact with IAV proteins (hemagglutinin, nucleoprotein, and neuraminidase). In addition, IAV was found to directly modulate expression of Spn virulence determinants such as pneumococcal surface protein A, pneumolysin, and factors associated with antimicrobial resistance among many others. Metabolic pathways were significantly altered leading to changes in Spn growth rate. IAV was also found to drive Spn capsule shedding and the release of pneumococcal surface proteins. Released proteins were found to be involved in evasion of innate immune responses and actively reduced human complement hemolytic and opsonizing activity. IAV also led to phosphorylation changes in Spn proteins associated with metabolism and bacterial virulence. Validation of proteomic data showed significant changes in Spn galactose and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, supplementation with galactose rescued bacterial growth and promoted bacterial invasion, while glucose supplementation led to enhanced pneumolysin production and lung cell apoptosis.\n\nConclusionsHere we demonstrate that IAV can directly modulate Spn biology without the requirement of host effectors and support the notion that inter-kingdom interactions between human viruses and commensal pathobionts can promote bacterial pathogenesis and microbiome dysbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Although oral cavity is the second most colonized site after the stomach, the association between gastric and oral Helicobacter pylori remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the genetic relatedness between gastric and oral H. pylori in Japanese patients with early gastric cancer by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis using seven housekeeping genes. Gastric biopsy specimens and oral samples, including saliva, supragingival dental biofilm, and superficial layers of the tongue, were collected from 21 patients positive for H. pylori by a fecal antigen test. The number of H. pylori allelic profiles of seven loci obtained from oral and gastric samples ranged from zero to seven since the yield of DNA was small even when the nested PCR was performed. The alleles of seven loci from both collection sites were determined from only one patient, and two out of seven alleles matched between oral and gastric samples. MLST analysis revealed that only one sample had a matching oral and gastric H. pylori genotype, suggesting that different genotypes of H. pylori inhabit the oral cavity and gastric mucosa. The phylogenetic analysis showed that oral H. pylori in two patients was markedly similar to gastric H. pylori, implying that the the origins of two strains may be the same, and the stomach and the oral cavity may be infected at the same time. In brief, although different genotypes of H. pylori exist in the oral cavity independently of H. pylori present in the stomach, there are rare cases in which the same H. pylori is present in the stomach and the oral cavity. It is necessary to establish a culture method for oral H. pylori for elucidating whether the oral cavity will act as the source of the gastric infection, as our analysis was based on a limited number of allele sequences.\n\nAuthor summaryHericobacter pylori is a clinically important pathogen that causes chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers, which are associated with gastric carcinoma. Oral H. pylori DNA has also been detected in a range of oral specimens, including saliva, supra- or sub-gingival biofilm, dentin caries, dental pulp, infected root canal, and coating of the tongue. Thus, researchers speculate that the main route of transmission of gastric H. pylori infections is via the oral cavity, however, there is inadequate evidence to support this suggestion. This study aimed to investigate if the oral and gastric H. pylori have the same origin using multilocus sequence typing. The results of this study provided some insight into the role of oral cavity as the source of H. pylori infections in stomach.",

    "abstract": "Gyromitrin (acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone) and its homologs are deadly mycotoxins produced most infamously by the lorchel (also known as false morel) Gyromitra esculenta, which is paradoxically consumed as a delicacy in some parts of the world. There is much speculation about the presence of gyromitrin in other species of the lorchel family (Discinaceae), but no studies have broadly assessed its distribution. Given the history of poisonings associated with the consumption of G. esculenta and G. ambigua, we hypothesized that gyromitrin evolved in the last common ancestor of these taxa and would be present in their descendants with adaptive loss of function in the nested truffle clade, Hydnotrya. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a sensitive analytical derivatization method for the detection of gyromitrin using 2,4-dinotrobenzaldehyde as the derivatization reagent. In total, we analyzed 66 specimens for the presence of gyromitrin over 105 tests. Moreover, we sequenced the nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region (ITS barcode) and nuc 28S rDNA to assist in species identification and to infer a supporting phylogenetic tree. We detected gyromitrin in all tested specimens from the G. esculenta group as well as G. leucoxantha. This distribution is consistent with a model of rapid evolution coupled with horizontal transfer, which is typical for secondary metabolites. We clarified that gyromitrin production in Discinaceae is both discontinuous and more limited than previously thought. Further research is required to elucidate the gyromitrin biosynthesis gene cluster and its evolutionary history in lorchels.

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis results from the deposition and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and immune cell infiltration in the sub-arterial space leading to arterial occlusion. Numerous studies have now shown that transcytosis transports the circulating LDL across endothelial cells lining the blood vessel. LDL transcytosis is initiated by binding to either Scavenger Receptor B1 (SR-B1) or Activin A receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) on the apical side of endothelial cells leading to its transit to the basolateral side. Individuals with elevated levels of circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are partly protected from atherosclerosis due to its ability to remove excess cholesterol and act as an antioxidant. Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), an HDL constituent, can bind to SR-B1, suggesting that ApoA1/HDL may also compete with LDL for SR-B1 binding and thereby oppose its deposition in the sub-arterial space. To examine this possibility, we used in vitro approaches to quantify the internalization and transcytosis of fluorescently labelled LDL in coronary endothelial cells. Using microscale thermophoresis and affinity capture, we find that SR-B1 and ApoA1 directly interact and that binding is enhanced when using the cardioprotective variant of ApoA1 termed Milano (ApoA1-Milano). In vivo injection of either wild-type ApoA1 or ApoA1-Milano significantly reduced the acute accumulation of LDL in the atheroprone inner curvature of the murine aorta; inhibition was greater with Milano than the wild-type ApoA1. Together, the results suggest that an additional mechanism for HDLs atheroprotective effects is attenuating LDL transcytosis through competition for the SR-B1 receptor.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT assists the folding of about 10% of cytosolic proteins through an ATP-driven conformational cycle, and the essential cytoskeleton protein tubulin is the obligate substrate of TRiC. Here, we present an ensemble of cryo-EM structures of human TRiC throughout its ATPase cycle, with three of them revealing endogenously engaged tubulin in different folding stages. Our structural and XL-MS analyses suggested a gradual upward translocation and stabilization of tubulin within the TRiC chamber accompanying TRiC ring closure. Remarkably, in the closed TRiC-tubulin-S3 map resolved to 3.1-[A]-resolution, we captured a near-natively folded tubulin. We found the near-natively folded tubulin engaging through its N and C domains mainly with the A and I domains of the CCT3/6/8 subunits through electrostatic and hydrophilic interactions, while the tubulin I domain was found to remain dynamic. Moreover, we also showed the potential role of TRiC C-terminal tails in substrate stabilization and folding. Our study delineates the pathway and molecular mechanism of TRiC-mediated tubulin folding conjugated with TRiC ATPase cycle, and may also inform the design of therapeutic agents targeting TRiC-tubulin interactions.",

    "abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that play essential roles in the excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the central nervous system. A number of open-pore structures of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic-acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors became recently available by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These structures provide valuable insights into the conformation of the selectivity filter (SF), the part of the ion channel that determines the ion selectivity. Nonetheless, due to the moderate resolution of the cryo-EM structures, detailed information such as ion occupancy of monovalent and divalent cations as well as exact displacement of the side-chains in the SF is still missing. Here, in order to resolve high-resolution crystal structures of the AMPA SF in its open-state, we incorporated the partial SF sequence of the AMPA receptor into the bacterial tetrameric cation channel NaK, which served as a structural scaffold. We determined a series of X-ray structures of NaK-CDI, NaK-SDI and NaK-SELM mutants at 1.42-2.10 [A] resolution, showing distinct ion occupation of different monovalent cations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of NaK-CDI indicated the channel to be conductive to monovalent cations, which agrees well with our electrophysiology recordings. Moreover, unique structural asymmetry of the SF was revealed by the X-ray structures and MD simulations, implying its importance in ion non-selectivity of tetrameric cation channels.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis exists ubiquitously in organisms and plays an essential role in maintaining the homeostasis of functional tissues. While the signaling pathway of cell apoptosis has been widely studied, the mechanism of how apoptotic cells regulate the structural homeostasis of a living tissue still remains largely elusive. Using a functional epithelial monolayer as a model system, we find that the integrity of the epithelium is interrupted by apoptosis-induced defects, with an increasing permeability to small molecules across the epithelium. The defects promote a structural reorganization through enhanced cell spreading and migratory dynamics, resulting in a quick recovery of epithelium integrity. Moreover, we show the epithelial monolayer remodeling is driven by local enhanced traction force after apoptosis, which triggers the process of fluidization and mesenchymal-like migration. Our results show the quick recovery of epithelial homeostasis when being interrupted by cell apoptosis, and indicate the importance of apoptosis-induced mechanical force in mediating cell behaviors to maintain the structural integrity of epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis is a specialized cell division that halves the number of chromosomes in two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation. In angiosperm plants is meiosis followed by mitotic divisions to form rudimentary haploid gametophytes. In Arabidopsis, termination of meiosis and transition to gametophytic development is governed by TDM1 and SMG7 that mediate inhibition of translation. Mutants deficient in this mechanism do not form tetrads, but instead undergo multiple cycles of aberrant nuclear divisions, that are likely caused by the failure to downregulate cyclin dependent kinases during meiotic exit. A suppressor screen to identify genes that contribute to meiotic exit uncovered a mutation in CDKD;3 that alleviates meiotic defects in smg7 deficient plants. The CDKD;3 deficiency prevents aberrant meiotic divisions observed in smg7 mutants, or delays their onset after initiation of cytokinesis, which permits formation of functional microspores. Although CDKD;3 acts as an activator of CDKA;1, the main cyclin dependent kinase that regulates meiosis, cdkd;3 mutation appears to promote meiotic exit independently of CDKA;1. Furthermore, analysis of CDKD;3 interactome revealed enrichment for proteins implicated in cytokinesis suggesting a more complex function of CDKD;3 in cell cycle regulation.",

    "abstract": "Ethylene glycol (EG) is a promising next generation feedstock for bioprocesses. It is a key component of the ubiquitous plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and other polyester fibers and plastics, used in antifreeze formulations, and can also be generated by electrochemical conversion of syngas, which makes EG a key compound in a circular bioeconomy. The majority of biotechnologically relevant bacteria assimilate EG via the glycerate pathway, a wasteful metabolic route that releases CO2 and requires reducing equivalents as well as ATP. In contrast, the recently characterized {beta}-hydroxyaspartate cycle (BHAC) provides a more efficient, carbon-conserving route for C2 assimilation. Here we aimed at overcoming the natural limitations of EG metabolism in the industrially relevant strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440 by replacing the native glycerate pathway with the BHAC. We first prototyped the core reaction sequence of the BHAC in Escherichia coli before establishing the complete four-enzyme BHAC in Pseudomonas putida. Directed evolution on EG resulted in an improved strain that exhibits 35% faster growth and 20% increased biomass yield compared to a recently reported P. putida strain that was evolved to grow on EG via the glycerate pathway. Genome sequencing and proteomics highlight plastic adaptations of the genetic and metabolic networks in response to the introduction of the BHAC into P. putida and identify key mutations for its further integration during evolution. Taken together, our study shows that the BHAC can be utilized as  plug-and-play module for the metabolic engineering of two important microbial platform organisms, paving the way for multiple applications for a more efficient and carbon-conserving upcycling of EG in the future.",

To ensure a basal supply of ribosomes, cells preserve a small pool of dormant ribosomes under nutrient-limited conditions. The regulation of dormant ribosomes is poorly characterized. Here, we show that upon inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin or nitrogen starvation, Stm1 (suppressor of target of Myb protein 1) forms non-translating, dormant 80S ribosomes. Furthermore, Stm1-bound 80S ribosomes are protected from proteasomal degradation. Upon re-feeding, TORC1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits Stm1, thereby reactivating translation. Finally, SERBP1 (SERPINE1 mRNA binding protein), a mammalian ortholog of Stm1, forms dormant 80S ribosomes upon mTORC1 inhibition in mammalian cells. Thus, TORC1 regulates ribosomal dormancy in an evolutionarily conserved manner via a ribosome preservation factor.",

    "abstract": "During mammalian embryogenesis, DNMT3B activity is critical for the genome-wide establishment of DNA methylation. Using naive ESC differentiation as a model, we elucidated the mechanism by which lncRNA, Dnmt3bas, controls the inducible expression and alternative splicing of Dnmt3b. Our data showed that Dnmt3bas knockdown increased transcriptional induction and decreased H3K27me3 at Dnmt3b cis-regulatory elements post-differentiation. Notably, transcriptional induction of Dnmt3b was accompanied by exon inclusion, switching the major isoform from catalytically inactive Dnmt3b6 to the active Dnmt3b1. While Dnmt3bas overexpression attenuated Dnmt3b induction, it increased the Dnmt3b1:Dnmt3b6 ratio. This observation was explained by a specific interaction of Dnmt3bas with hnRNPL, which promotes exon inclusion. These data suggest that Dnmt3bas coordinates alternative splicing and transcriptional induction of Dnmt3b by facilitating the interaction of hnRNPL and RNA Pol II at the Dnmt3b promoter. This two-pronged mechanism would tightly control DNMT3B activity, ensuring the fidelity and specificity of de novo DNA methylation during development.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic translational programmes underpin cancer development and are often driven by dysregulation of oncogenic signalling pathways that converge on the eukaryotic translation initiation (eIF) 4F complex. Altered eIF4F activity promotes translation of oncogene mRNAs that typically contain highly structured 5UTRs rendering their translation strongly dependent on RNA unwinding by the DEAD-box helicase eIF4A1 subunit of the eIF4F complex. While eIF4A1-dependent mRNAs have been widely investigated, it is still unclear how highly structured mRNAs recruit and activate eIF4A1 unwinding specifically to facilitate their preferential translation.\n\nHere, we show that RNA sequence motifs regulate eIF4A1 unwinding activity in cells. Our data demonstrate that eIF4A1-dependent mRNAs contain AG-rich motifs within their 5UTR which recruit and stimulate eIF4A1 unwinding of localised RNA structure to facilitate mRNA translation. This mode of eIF4A1 regulation is used by mRNAs encoding components of mTORC-signalling and cell cycle progression and renders these mRNAs particularly sensitive to eIF4A1-inhibition. Mechanistically, we show that binding of eIF4A1 to AG-rich sequences leads to multimerization of eIF4A1 with eIF4A1 subunits performing distinct enzymatic activities. Our structural data suggest that RNA-binding of multimeric eIF4A1 induces conformational changes in the RNA substrate resulting in an optimal positioning of eIF4A1 proximal to the RNA duplex region that supports efficient unwinding.\n\nHence, we conclude a model in which mRNAs utilise AG-rich sequences to specifically recruit eIF4A1, enabling assembly of the helicase-active multimeric eIF4A1 complex, and positioning these complexes proximal to stable localised RNA structure allowing ribosomal subunit scanning.",

Further, developmental differences early in life can have lifelong health outcomes. Yet, sex differences in gene expression within the placenta at different time points throughout pregnancy and comparisons to adult tissues remains poorly characterized.\n\nMethodsHere, we collect and characterize sex differences in gene expression in term placentas ( [&ge;] 36.6 weeks; 23 male XY and 27 female XX). These are compared with sex differences in previously collected first trimester placenta samples and 42 non-reproductive adult tissues from GTEx.\n\nResultsWe identify 268 and 53 sex differentially expressed genes in the uncomplicated late first trimester and term placentas, respectively. Of the 53 sex differentially expressed genes observed in the term placentas, 31 are also sex differentially expressed genes in the late first trimester placentas. Furthermore, sex differences in gene expression in term placentas are highly correlated with sex differences in the late first trimester placentas. We found that sex differential gene expression in the term placenta is significantly correlated with sex differences in gene expression in 42 non-reproductive adult tissues (correlation coefficient ranged from 0.892 to 0.957), with the highest correlation in brain tissues. Sex differences in gene expression were largely driven by gene expression on the sex chromosomes. We further show that some gametologous genes (genes with functional copies on X and Y) will have different inferred sex differences if the X-linked gene expression in females is compared to the sum of the X-linked and Y-linked gene expression in males.\n\nConclusionsWe find that sex differences in gene expression are conserved in late first trimester and term placentas and that these sex differences are conserved in adult tissues. We demonstrate that there are sex differences associated with innate immune response in late first trimester placentas but there is no significant difference in gene expression of innate immune genes between sexes in healthy full term placentas.

We show that UNC-45 forms discrete complexes with folded and unfolded myosin, forwarding them to downstream chaperones and E3 ligases. Structural analysis of a minimal chaperone:substrate complex reveals that UNC-45 binds to a conserved FX3HY motif in the myosin motor domain. Disrupting the observed interface by mutagenesis prevents myosin maturation leading to protein aggregation in vivo. We also show that a mutation in the FX3HY motif linked to the Freeman Sheldon Syndrome impairs UNC-45 assisted folding, reducing the level of functional myosin.

To address this problem, we developed an accurate mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic method called Chromatin Aggregation Capture (ChAC) followed by Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) to analyze chromatome reorganizations during the transition from ground to formative and primed pluripotency states. This allowed us to generate a comprehensive atlas of proteomes, chromatomes, and chromatin affinities for the three pluripotency phases, revealing the specific binding and rearrangement of regulatory complexes. The technical advances, the comprehensive chromatome atlas, and the extensive analysis reported here provide a foundation for an in-depth understanding of mechanisms that govern the phased progression of pluripotency and changes of cellular identities in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "The static stability of a fish in the water is determined by the relative locations of its center of mass and center of buoyancy. These locations may not be constant, but may depend on the volume of the swim bladder. Changes in swim bladder volume affect both the distribution of mass and the overall volume of the fish, thus affecting the location of the center of mass and center of buoyancy, respectively. To determine the static stability and to examine the influence of the swim bladder on static stability, we used micro-computed tomography to estimate the locations of the center of mass and center of buoyancy in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochrius). In fish oriented head up in the scanner, we found that the center of buoyancy is located 0.441 body lengths from the snout and 0.19 body lengths above the ventral surface of the pelvic girdle, and that the center of mass is 0.0012 BL posterior to and 0.00045 BL ventral to the center of buoyancy. Swim bladders from our specimens ranged in size from 1.9% to 7.6% total body volume, and we found no correlation between swim bladder volume and the distance between the center of mass and center of buoyancy. However, in fish scanned in a head-down orientation, the center of mass is anterior and dorsal to the center of buoyancy--the opposite configuration of that found in fish oriented head up. This change in center of mass and center of buoyancy seems to be caused by changes in the location of the swim bladder in the body: the centroid of the swim bladder is located more posteriorly in fish oriented head-down. The air in the bladder \"rises\" while heavier tissues \"sink,\" driving a change in tissue distribution and changing the location of the center of mass relative to the center of buoyancy. We conclude that while static stability does not change with swim bladder volume, pitch angle could have a marked effect on static stability.",

    "abstract": "The regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) is an Fe-S cluster containing helicase that plays important roles in telomere DNA maintenance, DNA repair, and genome stability. It is a modular protein comprising a helicase domain, two tandem harmonin homology domains 1 & 2 (HHD1 and HHD2), and a Zn2+ binding RING domain. In this study, we have unravelled a novel interaction between RTEL1 and replication protein A (RPA) and shown their co-localization upon DNA damage in the cells. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that 32C domain of RPA and DNA competitively bind with HHD2 of RTEL1. To understand the structural basis of HHD2 - 32C and HHD2 - DNA interactions, we have determined a 1.6 [A] resolution crystal structure of HHD2. NMR chemical shift perturbations-based mapping revealed the 32C and DNA binding surface on HHD2 of RTEL1. Together, these results establish an interplay among RTEL1, RPA, and DNA that provide mechanistic insights into the RTEL1 recruitment at DNA during the processes of replication, repair, and recombination.",

    "abstract": "Nanog and Oct4 are core transcription factors in a gene regulatory network that regulate hundreds of target genes for pluripotency maintenance in mouse embryonic stem cells. To understand their function as a gatekeeper or a pioneer factor at the molecular scale, we quantified the residence time on target loci, fluctuation at the loci, and interaction clustering by visualizing single molecules of Nanog and Oct4 in a living nucleus during the pluripotency loss. Interestingly, Nanog interacted longer with its target loci in the lower Nanog expression state or at the onset of differentiation, indicating the possibility of a new feedback mechanism to maintain Nanog expression. The interaction time of Nanog and Oct4 corresponded to their fluctuation and interaction clustering, which depended on their expression or differentiation state, respectively. The DNA viscoelasticity near the Oct4 target locus remained flexible during the differentiation, reflecting its role as a pioneer factor. Based on these results, we propose a new feedback mechanism for pluripotency maintenance in which Nanog function is prolonged, corresponding to chromatin condensation, and Oct4 reopens the condensation.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy is a frequent feature of human tumors. Germline mutations leading to aneuploidy are very rare in humans, and their tumor-promoting properties are mostly unknown at the molecular level. We report here novel germline biallelic mutations in MAD1L1, the gene encoding the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) protein MAD1, in a 36-year-old female with a dozen of neoplasias, including five malignant tumors. Functional studies in peripheral blood cells demonstrated lack of full-length protein and deficient SAC response, resulting in [~]30-40% of aneuploid cells as detected by cytogenetic and single-cell (sc) DNA analysis. scRNA-seq analysis of patient blood cells identified mitochondrial stress accompanied by systemic inflammation with enhanced interferon and NFkB signaling. The inference of chromosomal aberrations from scRNA-seq analysis detected inflammatory signals both in aneuploid and euploid cells, suggesting a non-cell autonomous response to aneuploidy. In addition to random aneuploidies, MAD1L1 mutations resulted in specific clonal expansions of {gamma}{delta} T-cells with chromosome 18 gains and enhanced cytotoxic profile, as well as intermediate B-cells with chromosome 12 gains and transcriptomic signatures characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. These data point to MAD1L1 mutations as the cause of a new aneuploidy syndrome with systemic inflammation and unprecedented tumor susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Genetic colocalisation is an important tool to test for shared genetic aetiology and is commonly used to strengthen causal inference in genetic studies of molecular traits and drug targets. However, the single causal variant assumption of the original colocalization method is a considerable limitation in genomic regions with multiple causal effects.\n\nWe integrated conditional analyses (GCTA-COJO) and colocalisation analyses (coloc), into a novel analysis tool called Pair-Wise Conditional Colocalization (PWCoCo). PWCoCo performs conditional analyses to identify independent signals for the two tested traits in a genomic region and then conducts colocalisation of each pair of conditionally independent signals for the two traits using summary-level data. This allows for the stringent single-variant assumption to hold for each pair of colocalisation analysis.\n\nWe found that the computational efficiency of PWCoCo is on average better than colocalisation with Sum of Single Effects Regression using Summary Stats (SuSiE-RSS), with greater gains in efficiency for high-throughput analysis. In a case study using GWAS data for multiple sclerosis and brain cortex-derived eQTLs (MetaBrain), we recapitulated all previously identified genes, which showcased the robustness of the method. We further found colocalisation evidence for secondary signals in nine additional loci, which was not identifiable in conventional GWAS and/or colocalisation.\n\nPWCoCo offers key improvements over existing methods, including: (1) robust colocalisation when the single variant assumption is violated; (2) independent colocalisation of secondary signals, which enables identification of novel disease-causing variants; (3) an easy-to-use and computationally efficient tool to test for colocalisation of high-dimensional omics data.",

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) present specific activation pathways and signaling among receptor subtypes. Hence, an extensive knowledge of the structural dynamics of the receptor is critical for the development of therapeutics. Here, we target the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R), for which a negligible number of drugs have been approved. We combine molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling techniques, network theory and pocket detection to decipher the activation pathway of A1R, decode the allosteric networks and identify transient pockets. The A1R activation pathway reveal hidden intermediate and pre-active states together with the inactive and fully-active states observed experimentally. The protein energy networks computed throughout these conformational states successfully unravel the extra and intracellular allosteric centers and the communication pathways that couples them. We observe that the allosteric networks are dynamic, being increased along activation and fine-tuned in presence of the trimeric G-proteins. Overlap of transient pockets and energy networks uncover how the allosteric coupling between pockets and distinct functional regions of the receptor is altered along activation. By an in-depth analysis of the bridge between activation pathway, energy networks and transient pockets, we provide a further understanding of A1R. This information can be useful to ease the design of allosteric modulators for A1R.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin is a neuromodulator that affects multiple behavioral and cognitive functions. Nonetheless, how serotonin causes such a variety of effects through brain-wide projections and various receptors remains unclear. Here we measured the brain-wide response to optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) with functional MRI using an 11.7T scanner with a cryoprobe. Transient activation of DRN serotonin neurons caused brain-wide activation, including reward-related brain areas. The same stimulation under anesthesia with isoflurane decreased activation of reward-related areas and the hippocampal complex. These brain-wide response patterns can be explained by DRN serotonergic projection topography and serotonin receptor expression profiles, with enhanced weights on 5-HT1 receptors. Together, these results provide foundational understanding of the primarily facilitatory effect on brain areas by the DR serotonergic system, which is consistent with recent discoveries of its roles in adaptive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Layer 5 pyramidal neurons of sensory cortices project \"corticofugal\" axons to myriad of sub-cortical targets, thereby broadcasting high-level signals important for perception and learning. Recent studies suggest dendritic Ca2+ spikes as key biophysical mechanisms supporting corticofugal neuron function: These long-lasting events drive burst firing, thereby initiating uniquely powerful signals to modulate sub-cortical representations and trigger learning-related plasticity. However, the behavioral relevance of corticofugal dendritic spikes is poorly understood. We shed light on this issue using 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of auditory corticofugal dendrites as mice engage in a sound-discrimination task. Unexpectedly, only a minority of dendritic spikes were triggered by sound. Rather, task-related dendritic activity mostly occurred following sound termination and reflected mices instrumental actions, irrespective of reward consumption. Temporally selective silencing of this motor-related activity impaired auditory discrimination learning. Thus, corticofugal systems contribution to learning and plasticity may be largely motor, rather than sensory in nature.",
