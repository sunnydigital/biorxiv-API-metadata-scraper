    "abstract": "Game parks are the last preserve of many large mammals, and in savanna ecosystems, management of surface waters poses a conservation challenge. In arid and semi-arid regions, water can be a scarce resource during dry seasons and drought. Artificial waterholes are common in parks and reserves across Africa, but can alter mammal community composition by favoring drought intolerant species, with consequences for disease dynamics, and population viability of drought-tolerant species. Analysis of waterborne environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to inform conservation of rare and invasive species, and conduct large-scale biodiversity assessments. To explore the reliability of eDNA as an indicator of mammal waterhole use in savannas, we compare eDNA metabarcoding and camera traps for documenting artificial waterhole use in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, a global hotspot for mammal diversity. We show that eDNA metabarcoding can recover the majority of mammal species detected by camera traps, including a number of endangered species, but DNA signatures of mammal visitation are temporally limited, with best performance when tracking water-dependent large bodied mammals visiting within two days of sampling. Our results highlight limitation of eDNA based monitoring in these systems, including the lack of long-term eDNA persistence in small and highly utilized waterholes, and variability in detection rates among species. However, we demonstrate that eDNA-based approaches can be used to track mammals of conservation concern, and reflect patterns of recent waterhole use and co-occurrence across water-dependent species, both of which are crucial for making evidence-based decisions regarding water management and provisioning.",

    "abstract": "Theta oscillations are a hallmark of hippocampal activity across mammals and play a critical role in many hippocampal models of memory and spatial navigation. To reconcile the cross-species differences observed in the presence and properties of theta, we recorded hippocampal local field potentials in rats and ferrets during auditory and visual localisation tasks designed to vary locomotion and sensory attention. Here, we show that theta oscillations occur during locomotion in both ferrets and rats, however during periods of immobility, theta oscillations persisted in the ferret, contrasting starkly with the switch to large irregular activity (LIA) in the rat. Theta during immobility in the ferret was identified as analogous to Type 2 theta that has been observed in rodents due to its sensitivity to atropine, and was modulated by behavioural state, with the strongest theta observed during reward epochs. These results demonstrate that even under similar behavioural conditions, differences exist between species in the relationship between theta and behavioural state.",

    "abstract": "Perturbation and mechanistic studies have shown that the DNA-binding transcription factor Zeb2 controls cell fate decision and differentiation and/or maturation in multiple cell lineages in embryos and after birth. In cultured embryonic stem cells (ESCs) Zeb2s strong upregulation is necessary for the exit from primed pluripotency and for entering general and neural differentiation. We edited mouse ESCs to produce epitope-tagged Zeb2 from one of its two endogenous alleles. Using ChIP-sequencing, we mapped 2,432 DNA-binding sites of Zeb2 in ESC-derived neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs). A new, major site maps promoter-proximal to Zeb2 itself, and its homozygous removal demonstrates that Zeb2 autoregulation is necessary to elicit proper Zeb2-dependent effects in NPC differentiation. We then cross-referenced all Zeb2 DNA-binding sites with transcriptome data from Zeb2 perturbations in ESCs, ventral forebrain in mouse embryos, and adult neurogenesis from the mouse forebrain V-SVZ. While the characteristics of these neurodevelopmental systems differ, we still find interesting overlaps. This contributes to explaining neurodevelopmental disorders caused by ZEB2 deficiency, including Mowat-Wilson Syndrome.",

Here, we propose a conceptual framework for how Drosophila use their internal representation of head direction to maintain and modify preferred headings upon selective thermal reinforcement. We show that flies in a well-established operant visual learning paradigm use stochastically generated fixations and directed saccades to express heading preferences, and that silencing their head direction representation compromises their ability to modify these preferences based on reinforcement. We describe how flies ability to quickly adapt their behavior to the rules of their environment may rest on a behavioral policy whose parameters are flexible but whose form and dependence on the head-direction representation are genetically encoded in the structure of their circuits. Many of the mechanisms we outline may be broadly relevant for rapidly adaptive behavior driven by internal representations.",

Here, we uncover a function of the Hippo pathway in developmental cell fate decisions in the Drosophila eye-antennal disc exerted through the interaction of Yorkie (Yki) with the transcriptional regulator Bonus (Bon), an ortholog of mammalian Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1/tripartite motif (TIF1/TRIM) family proteins. Instead of controlling tissue growth, Yki and Bon promote epidermal and antennal fates at the expense of the eye fate. Proteomic, transcriptomic, and genetic analyses reveal that Yki and Bon control these cell fate decisions by recruiting transcriptional and post-transcriptional co-regulators, and by activating epidermal differentiation genes and repressing Notch target genes. Our work expands the range of functions and regulatory mechanisms under Hippo pathway control.",

    "abstract": "A universal coordinate system that can ensemble the huge number of cells and capture their heterogeneities is of vital importance for constructing large-scale cell atlases as references for future molecular and cellular studies. Studies have shown that cells in complex organs exhibit multifaceted heterogeneities in their transcriptomic features at multiple resolutions. This nature of complexity makes it hard to design a fixed coordinate system through a combination of known features. It is desirable to build a learnable universal coordinate model that can capture major heterogeneities and serve as a controlled generative model for data argumentation. We developed UniCoord, a specially tuned joint-VAE model to represent single-cell transcriptomic data in a lower-dimensional latent space with high interpretability. Each latent dimension can represent either discrete or continuous feature, and either supervised by prior knowledge or unsupervised. The original transcriptomic profiles can be regenerated from the latent dimensions. The latent dimensions can be easily reconfigured to generate transcriptomic profiles of pseudo cells with desired properties. UniCoord can also be used as a pre-trained model to analyze new data with unseen cell types and thus can serve as a feasible framework for cell annotation and comparison. UniCoord provides a prototype for a learnable universal coordinate framework to enable better analysis and generation of cells with highly orchestrated functions and heterogeneities.",

    "abstract": "The transient but pronounced ventral tail bending is found in many chordate embryos and constitutes an interesting model of how tissue interactions control embryo shape (Lu et al., 2020). Here, we identify one key upstream regulator of ventral tail bending in the ascidian Ciona embryo. We show that during early tailbud stage, ventral epidermal cells exhibit a boat-shaped morphology (boat cell) with a narrow apical surface where phosphorylated myosin (pMLC) accumulated. We further show that interfering with the function of the BMP ligand Admp leads to pMLC localizing to the basal instead of the apical side of ventral epidermal cells and a reduced number of boat cells. Finally, we show that cutting ventral epidermal midline cells at their apex using a ultraviolet laser relaxes ventral tail bending. Based on these results, we propose a novel function for Admp in localizing pMLC to the apical side of ventral epidermal cells, which causes the tail to bend ventrally by resisting antero-posterior notochord extension at the ventral side of the tail.\n\nSummary StatementAdmp is an upstream regulator of tail bending in the chordate Ciona tailbud embryo, determining tissue polarity of the ventral midline epidermis by localizing phosphorylated myosin.",

    "abstract": "During development, retinal progenitors navigate a complex landscape of fate decisions that results in the generation of unique cell types necessary for proper vision. Here, we aim to provide the resources and techniques required to identify fac-tors that are critical for fate decisions in photoreceptors. These factors help create a diversity of photoreceptor subtypes that sustain vision in day and night, enable the discrimination of colors, facilitate the detection of prey and predators, and support other aspects of vision. First, we generate a key resource: a high-quality and deep transcriptomic profile of each photoreceptor subtype in zebrafish. We make this resource openly accessible, easy to explore and integrate it with other currently available photoreceptor transcriptomic datasets. Second, using our transcriptomic profiles, we derive an in-depth map of expression of transcription factors in photoreceptors--potential key players in cell-fate decisions. Third, we explore CRISPR-FO screening as a fast, efficient and versatile technique to assess the involvement of candidate transcription factors in photoreceptor subtype-specification. We first show that known phenotypes can be easily replicated: loss of S cones in foxq2 mutants and loss of rods in nr2e3 mutants. We then explore four additional transcription factors of unknown function (Skor1a, Sall1a, Lrrfip1a and Xbp1) and find no evidence for their involvement in photoreceptor-subtype specification. Finally, we identify novel functions of Tbx2, demonstrating that it plays a central role in controlling the identity of all photoreceptor sub-types within the retina. Our study provides an open roadmap to discover additional factors involved in this process. This dataset and screening method will be a valuable way to explore the genes involved in many essential aspects of photoreceptor biology.",

    "abstract": "Copy-number aberrations (CNAs) are genetic alterations that amplify or delete the number of copies of large genomic segments. Although they are ubiquitous in cancer and, thus, a critical area of current cancer research, CNA identification from DNA sequencing data is challenging because it requires partitioning of the genome into complex segments with the same copy-number states that may not be contiguous. Existing segmentation algorithms address these challenges either by leveraging the local information among neighboring genomic regions, or by globally grouping genomic regions that are affected by similar CNAs across the entire genome. However, both approaches have limitations: overclustering in the case of local segmentation, or the omission of clusters corresponding to focal CNAs in the case of global segmentation. Importantly, inaccurate segmentation will lead to inaccurate identification of important CNAs. For this reason, most pan-cancer research studies rely on manual procedures of quality control and anomaly correction. To improve copy-number segmentation and their control, we introduce CNAVO_SCPLOWIZC_SCPLOW, a web-based tool that enables the user to simultaneously perform local and global segmentation, thus overcoming the limitations of each approach. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by several metrics, CNAVO_SCPLOWIZC_SCPLOW allows the user to obtain more accurate segmentation relative to existing local and global segmentation methods. Moreover, we analyze six bulk DNA sequencing samples from three breast cancer patients. By validating with parallel singlecell DNA sequencing data from the same samples, we show that by using CNAVO_SCPLOWIZC_SCPLOW, our user was able to obtain more accurate segmentation and improved accuracy in downstream copy-number calling.

    "abstract": "Arousal powerfully influences cortical activity, in part by modulating local inhibitory circuits. Somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons (SOM) are particularly well-situated to shape local population activity in response to shifts in arousal, yet the relationship between arousal state and SOM activity has not been characterized outside of sensory cortex. To determine whether SOM activity is similarly modulated by behavioral state across different levels of the cortical processing hierarchy, we compared the behavioral modulation of SOM neurons in auditory cortex (AC), a primary sensory region, and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an association-level region of cortex. Behavioral state modulated activity differently in AC and PPC. In PPC, transitions to high arousal were accompanied by large increases in activity across the full PPC neural population, especially in SOM neurons. In AC, arousal transitions led to more subtle changes in overall activity, as individual SOM and Non-SOM neurons could be either positively or negatively modulated during transitions to high arousal states. The coding of sensory information in population activity was enhanced during periods of high arousal in AC, but not PPC. Our findings suggest unique relationships between activity in local circuits and arousal across cortex, which may be tailored to the roles of specific cortical regions in sensory processing or the control of behavior.\n\nSignificance statementThe effects of arousal on brain networks are profound, but vary across regions. Somatostatin neurons may carry out some of the effects of arousal on local network activity in sensory cortex, by modulating response gain and decorrelating population activity. However, SOM neurons have not been well studied outside of sensory cortex, and so it is unknown whether SOM neurons are similarly affected by shifts in brain state throughout the cortex. Here, we have revealed specialization in the relationship between arousal and activity in SOM neurons that could contribute to the diversity of arousal-related impacts on local computation across cortical regions.",

    "abstract": "Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) predominantly incorporates serine and fatty acyl-CoAs into diverse sphingolipids that serve as structural components of membranes and signaling molecules within or amongst cells. However, SPT also uses alanine as a substrate in the contexts of low serine availability, alanine accumulation, or disease-causing mutations in hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSAN1), resulting in the synthesis and accumulation of 1-deoxysphingolipids. These species promote cytotoxicity in neurons and impact diverse cellular phenotypes, including suppression of anchorage-independent cancer cell growth. While altered serine and alanine can promote 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis, they impact numerous other metabolic pathways important for cancer cells. Here we combined isotope tracing, quantitative metabolomics, and functional studies to better understand the mechanistic drivers of 1-deoxysphingolipid toxicity in cancer cells. Both alanine treatment and SPTLC1C133W expression induce 1-deoxy(dihydro)ceramide synthesis and accumulation but fail to broadly impact intermediary metabolism, abundances of other lipids, or growth of adherent cells. However, spheroid culture and soft agar colony formation were compromised when endogenous 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis was induced via SPTLC1C133Wexpression. Consistent with these impacts on anchorage-independent cell growth, we observed that 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis reduced plasma membrane endocytosis. These results highlight a potential role for SPT promiscuity in linking altered amino acid metabolism to plasma membrane endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "The Dam1 complex is essential for mitotic progression across evolutionarily divergent fungi. Upon analyzing amino acid (aa) sequences of Dad2, a Dam1 complex subunit, we identified a conserved 10-aa-long Dad2 signature sequence (DSS). An arginine residue (R126) in the DSS is essential for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that possesses point centromeres. The corresponding arginine residues are functionally important but not essential for viability in Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, both carry several kilobases long regional centromeres. The purified recombinant Dam1 complex containing either Dad2{Delta}DSS or Dad2R126A failed to bind microtubules (MTs) or form any visible rings like the wild-type complex. Intriguingly, functional analysis revealed that the requirement of the conserved arginine residue for chromosome biorientation and mitotic progression reduced with increasing centromere length. We propose that plasticity of the invariant arginine of Dad2 in organisms with regional centromeres is achieved by conditional elevation of the kinetochore protein(s) to enable multiple kinetochore MTs (kMTs) to bind to each chromosome. The capacity of a chromosome to bind multiple kMTs may mask deleterious effects of such lethal mutations.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThere is a need to assess the sustainability of wild bird harvest in the United Kingdom (UK), and more widely, across Europe. Yet data on populations and harvest sizes are limited.\nC_LIO_LIWe used a Demographic Invariant Method (DIM) to estimate Potential Excess Growth (PEG) for populations of UK wintering waterbirds and calculated a Sustainable Harvest Index (SHI) for each. We compared this with population trends and conservation classifications (e.g. Birds of Conservation Concern; BoCC) to assess the sustainability of harvests and the utility of these classifications.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach found evidence for potential overharvest of mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian teal Anas crecca, gadwall Mareca strepera, Canada geese Branta canadensis, greylag geese Anser anser and woodcock Scolopax rusticola. Whether DIM methods predict overharvest is highly dependent on estimates of maximum population growth rates inferring PEG. We found estimates of maximum population growth to be variable across a range of different methods.\nC_LIO_LIWe found no relationship between SHI and short-term wintering trends or conservation classification under the UKs BoCC framework. There was however a positive relationship between SHI and long-term wintering trends.\nPolicy Implications: Our results suggest that UK based harvest is unlikely to be a major determinant of population trends for the majority of UK overwintering waterbirds, but harvest rates for some species may exceed that required to maintain stationary population growth. The lack of a relationship between conservation classifications and SHI strongly suggests that such conservation classifications are not an appropriate tool for making decisions about harvest management. Instead, our assessment provides the basis for a framework to make evidence-based decisions on sustainable harvest levels in the face of incomplete data. There is currently no clear policy instrument in the UK to support such a framework via controls on either harvest effort or mortality of waterfowl.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by sporadic collapse of the upper airway leading to periodic disruptions in breathing. Upper airway patency governed by genioglossal nerve activity originates from the hypoglossal motor nucleus. Mice with targeted deletion of the gene Hmox2, encoding the carbon monoxide (CO) producing enzyme, heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), exhibit severe OSA, yet the contribution of central HO-2 dysregulation to the phenomenon is unknown. Using the rhythmic brainstem slice preparation, which contains the preBotzinger complex (preBotC) and the hypoglossal nucleus, we tested the hypothesis that central HO-2 dysregulation weakens hypoglossal motoneuron output. Disrupting HO-2 activity increased transmission failure as determined by the intermittent inability of the preBotC rhythm to trigger output from the hypoglossal nucleus. Failed transmission was associated with a reduced input-output relationship between the preBotC and the motor nucleus. These network phenomena were related to smaller inspiratory drive currents and reduced intrinsic excitability among hypoglossal neurons. In addition to HO-2, hypoglossal neurons also expressed the CO-regulated H2S producing enzyme cystathionine {square}-lyase (CSE). H2S abundance was higher in hypoglossal neurons of HO-2 null mice than wild-type controls. Disrupting CSE function normalized transmission in HO-2 null mice and an H2S donor mimicked the effects of HO-2 dysregulation. These findings demonstrate a hitherto uncharacterized modulation of hypoglossal activity through the interaction of HO-2 and CSE-derived H2S, and supports the perspective that centrally derived HO-2 activity plays an important role regulating upper airway control.",

    "abstract": "As the sister group to bilaterians, cnidarians stand in a unique phylogenetic position that provides insight into evolutionary aspects of animal development, physiology, and behavior. While cnidarians are classified into two types, sessile polyps and free-swimming medusae, most studies at the cellular and molecular levels have been conducted on representative polyp-type cnidarians and have focused on establishing techniques of genetic manipulation. Recently, gene knockdown by delivery of short hairpin RNAs into eggs via electroporation has been introduced in two polyp-type cnidarians, Nematostella vectensis and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, enabling systematic loss-of-function experiments. By contrast, current methods of genetic manipulation for most medusa-type cnidarians, or jellyfish, are quite limited, except for Clytia hemisphaerica, and reliable techniques are required to interrogate function of specific genes in different jellyfish species. Here, we present a method to knock down target genes by delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) into fertilized eggs via electroporation, using the hydrozoan jellyfish, Clytia hemisphaerica and Cladonema paciificum. We show that siRNAs targeting endogenous GFP1 and Wnt3 in Clytia efficiently knock down gene expression and result in known planula phenotypes: loss of green fluorescence and defects in axial patterning, respectively. We also successfully knock down endogenous Wnt3 in Cladonema by siRNA electroporation, which circumvents the technical difficulty of microinjecting small eggs. Wnt3 knockdown in Cladonema causes gene expression changes in axial markers, suggesting a conserved Wnt/{beta}-catenin-mediated pathway that controls axial polarity during embryogenesis. Our gene-targeting siRNA electroporation method is applicable to other animals, including and beyond jellyfish species, and will facilitate the investigation and understanding of myriad aspects of animal development.",

    "abstract": "Mutations enhancing the kinase activity of LRRK2 cause Parkinsons disease (PD) and therapies that reduce LRRK2 kinase activity are being tested in clinical trials. Numerous rare variants of unknown clinical significance have been reported, but how the vast majority impact on LRRK2 function is unknown. Here, we investigate 100 LRRK2 variants linked to PD, including previously described pathogenic mutations. We identify 23 LRRK2 variants that robustly stimulate kinase activity, including variants within the N-terminal non-catalytic regions [ARM (E334K, A419V), ANK(R767H), LRR (R1067Q, R1325Q)], as well as variants predicted to destabilise the ROC:CORB interface [ROC (A1442P, V1447M), CORA (R1628P) CORB (S1761R, L1795F)] and COR:COR dimer interface [CORB (R1728H/L)]. Most activating variants decrease LRRK2 biomarker site phosphorylation (pSer935/pSer955/pSer973), consistent with the notion that the active kinase conformation blocks their phosphorylation. We conclude that the impact of variants on kinase activity is best evaluated by deploying a cellular assay of LRRK2-dependent Rab10 substrate phosphorylation, compared to a biochemical kinase assay, as only a minority of activating variants [CORB (Y1699C, R1728H/L, S1761R) and kinase (G2019S, I2020T, T2031S)], enhance in vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated LRRK2. Twelve variants including several that activate LRRK2 and have been linked to PD, suppressed microtubule association in the presence of a Type I kinase inhibitor [ARM(M712V), LRR(R1320S), ROC (A1442P, K1468E, S1508R), CORA(A1589S), CORB (Y1699C, R1728H/L) and WD40(R2143M, S2350I, G2385R)]. Our findings will stimulate work to better understand the mechanisms by which variants impact biology and provide rationale for variant carrier inclusion or exclusion in ongoing and future LRRK2 inhibitor clinical trials.",

Salt marsh ecosystems impacted by sudden vegetation dieback events were previously thought to recover naturally within a few months to years. In this study, we provide evidence that approximately 14% of total marsh area has not revegetated 10-years after a dieback event in Charleston, SC. Dieback onset coincided with a severe drought in 2012, and a second dieback event occurred in 2016 after a historic flood influenced by Hurricane Joaquin in October of 2015, with unvegetated zones reaching nearly 30% of total marsh area in 2017. Most affected areas were associated with lower elevation zones in the interior of the marsh (midmarsh). During the 2013 dieback event, we estimate that unvegetated midmarsh area expanded by 300%. Grass planting was shown to be an effective restoration practice, with restored plants having greater aboveground biomass than relict sites after two years of transplanting. A positive restoration outcome indicated that the stressors that caused the initial dieback are no longer present. Despite that, many dieback areas have not recovered naturally even as they are located within the typical elevation range of a healthy vegetated marsh. A mechanistic modelling approach was used to assess the effects of vegetation dieback on salt marsh resilience to SLR. Predictions indicate that a highly productive restored marsh (2000 g m-2 y-1) would persist at a moderate SLR rate of 60 cm 100 y-1, whereas a non- restored mudflat would lose all of its elevation capital after 100 years. Thus, rapid restoration of marsh dieback is critical to avoid further degradation. Also, failure to incorporate the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events which trigger irreversible marsh diebacks underestimates salt marsh vulnerability to climate change. At an elevated SLR rate of 122 cm 100 y-1, most likely an extreme climate change scenario, even highly productive ecosystems augmented by sediment placement would not keep pace with SLR.

The main focus of microbeSEG is a comprehensible, easy, efficient, and complete workflow from the creation of training data to the final application of the trained segmentation model. We demonstrate that accurate cell segmentation results can be obtained within 45 minutes of user time.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) protein structures reveal the fundamental information about protein function. The state-of-art protein structure prediction methods such as Alphafold are being widely used to predict structures of uncharacterized proteins in biomedical research. There is a significant need to further improve the quality and nativeness of the predicted structures to enhance their usability. Current machine learning methods of refining protein structures focus mostly on improving the backbone quality of predicted structures without effectively leveraging and enhancing the conformation of all atoms including side-chain, while molecular simulation methods are computationally intensive and time-consuming.\n\nIn this work, we develop ATOMRefine, a deep learning-based, end-to-end, all-atom protein structural model refinement method. It uses a SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer network that is equivariant to the rotation and translation of 3D structures in conjunction with a novel graph representation of all atoms to directly refine protein atomic coordinates of all the atoms in a predicted tertiary structure represented as a molecular graph. The method is first trained and tested on the structural models in AlphafoldDB whose experimental structures are known, and then blindly tested on 69 CASP14 regular targets and 7 CASP14 refinement targets. ATOMRefine improves the quality of both backbone atoms and all-atom conformation of the initial structural models generated by AlphaFold. It also performs better than the state-of-the-art refinement methods in multiple evaluation metrics including an all-atom model quality score - the MolProbity score based on the analysis of all-atom contacts, bond length, atom clashes, torsion angles, and side-chain rotamers. As ATOMRefine can refine a protein structure quickly, it provides a viable, fast solution for improving protein geometry and fixing structural errors of predicted structures through direct coordinate refinement.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the demographic history of populations is a key goal in population genetics, and with improving methods and data, ever more complex models are being proposed and tested. Demographic models of current interest typically consist of a set of discrete populations, their sizes and growth rates, and continuous and pulse migrations between those populations over a number of epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully describe. There is currently no standard format to define such models, significantly hampering progress in the field. In particular, the important task of translating the model descriptions in published work into input suitable for population genetic simulators is labor intensive and error prone. We propose the Demes data model and file format, built on widely used technologies, to alleviate these issues. Demes provides a well-defined and unambiguous model of populations and their properties that is straightforward to implement in software, and a text file format that is designed for simplicity and clarity. We provide thoroughly tested implementations of Demes parsers in multiple languages including Python and C, and showcase initial support in several simulators and inference methods. An introduction to the file format and a detailed specification are available at:https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-spec-docs/.",

    "abstract": "With novel hallucinogens poised to enter psychiatry, we lack a unified framework for quantifying which changes in consciousness are optimal for treatment. Using transformers (i.e. BERT) and 11,816 publicly-available drug testimonials, we first predicted 28-dimensions of sentiment across each narrative, validated with psychiatrist annotations. Secondly, BERT was trained to predict biochemical and demographic information from testimonials. Thirdly, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) linked 52 drugs receptor affinities with testimonial word usage, revealing 11 latent receptor-experience factors, mapped to a 3D cortical atlas. Together, these 3 machine learning methods elucidate a neurobiologically-informed, temporally-sensitive portrait of drug-induced subjective experiences. Different models results converged, revealing a pervasive distinction between lucid and mundane phenomena. MDMA was linked to \"Love\", DMT and 5-MeO-DMT to \"Mystical Experiences\", and other tryptamines to \"Surprise\", \"Curiosity\" and \"Realization\". Applying these models to real-time biofeedback, practitioners could harness them to guide the course of therapeutic sessions.",

    "abstract": "The pituitary is the master neuroendocrine gland, which regulates body homeostasis. It consists of the anterior pituitary/adenohypophysis (AH), which harbors hormones producing cells and the posterior pituitary/neurohypophysis (NH), which relays the direct passage of hormones from the brain to the periphery. It is widely accepted that the AH originates from the oral ectoderm (Rathkes pouch) whereas the neural ectoderm contributes to the NH. Using single cell transcriptomics of the zebrafish pituitary we characterized cyp26b1-positive pituicyte of the NH and prop1-positive adenohypophyseal progenitors. We found that these cell types expressed common markers implying lineage relatedness. Genetic tracing revealed that in contrast to the prevailing dogma, neural plate precursors of both zebrafish (her4.3+) and mouse (Sox1+) contribute to both the neurohypophyseal and adenohypophyseal cells. We further show that pituicytes and prop1+ progenitors reside in close anatomical proximity and pituicyte-derived RA-degrading enzyme Cyp26b1 fine-tunes differentiation of prop1+ progenitors into hormone-producing cells. These results challenge the notion that AH cells are exclusively derived from non-neural ectoderm and demonstrate that a cross-talk between neuro- and adeno-hypophyseal cells fine-tunes the development of pituitary neuroendocrine cells.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting peptide secondary structures remains a challenging task due to the lack of discriminative information in short peptides. In this study, we propose PHAT, a deep graph learning framework for the prediction of peptide secondary structures. The framework includes a novel interpretable deep hypergraph multi-head attention network that uses residue-based reasoning for structure prediction. Our algorithm can incorporate sequential semantic information from large-scale biological corpus and structural semantic information from multi-scale structural segmentation, leading to better accuracy and interpretability even with extremely short peptides. Our interpretable models are able to highlight the reasoning of structural feature representations and the classification of secondary substructures. We further demonstrate the importance of secondary structures in peptide tertiary structure reconstruction and downstream functional analysis, highlighting the versatility of our models. To facilitate the use of our model, we establish an online server which is accessible via http://inner.wei-group.net/PHAT/. We expect our work to assist in the design of functional peptides and contribute to the advancement of structural biology research.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental unresolved problem in neuroscience is how the brain associates in memory events that are separated in time. Here we propose that reactivation-induced synaptic plasticity can solve this problem. Previously, we reported that the reinforcement signal dopamine converts hippocampal spike timing-dependent depression into potentiation during continued synaptic activity (Brzosko et al., 2015). Here, we report that postsynaptic bursts in the presence of dopamine produces input-specific LTP in hippocampal synapses 10 minutes after they were primed with coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity. The priming activity sets an NMDAR-dependent silent eligibility trace which, through the cAMP-PKA cascade, is rapidly converted into protein synthesis-dependent synaptic potentiation, mediated by a signaling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP. Incorporated into a computational model, this synaptic learning rule adds specificity to reinforcement learning by controlling memory allocation and enabling both  instructive and  supervised reinforcement learning. We predicted that this mechanism would make reactivated neurons activate more strongly and carry more spatial information than non-reactivated cells, which was confirmed in freely moving mice performing a reward-based navigation task.",

    "abstract": "Why are people with focal epilepsy not constantly seizing? Previous molecular work has implicated gamma-aminobutyric acid balance as integral to seizure generation and termination, but is the high-level distributed brain network involved in suppressing seizures? Recent intracranial electrographic evidence has suggested that seizure onset zones have an increased inward connectivity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that seizure onset zones are actively suppressed by the rest of the brain network during interictal states.\n\nWe tested this hypothesis on 81 subjects with drug resistant focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation. We utilized intracranial electrographic resting-state and neurostimulation recordings to evaluate the network connectivity of seizure onset, propagative, and non-involved regions. We then utilized diffusion imaging to acquire estimates of white matter connectivity to evaluate structure-function coupling effects on connectivity findings. Finally, using our observations, we generated a resting-state classification model to assist clinicians in detecting seizure onset and propagative zones without the need for multiple ictal recordings.\n\nOur findings indicate that seizure onset and propagative zones demonstrate markedly increased inward connectivity and decreased outward connectivity on both resting-state and neurostimulation analyses. When controlling for distance between regions, the difference between inward vs. outward connectivity remained stable up to 80 mm between brain connections. Structure-function coupling analyses revealed that seizure onset zones exhibit abnormally enhanced coupling (hypercoupling) of surrounding regions compared to presumably healthy tissue. Using these observations, our classification models achieved a maximum held-out testing set accuracy of 92.0{+/-}2.2%.\n\nThese results indicate that seizure onset zones are actively segregated and suppressed by a widespread brain network. Furthermore, this electrographically observed functional suppression is disproportionate to any observed structural connectivity alterations of the seizure onset zones. These findings have implications for the identification of seizure onset zones using only brief resting-sate recordings to reduce patient morbidity and augment the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant epilepsy. Furthermore, testing of the interictal suppression hypothesis can provide insight into potential new resective, ablative, and neuromodulation approaches to improve surgical success rates in those suffering from drug resistant focal epilepsy.",

For most lineages, peaks in sampling frequencies coincided with different epidemiological waves of infection in Mexico. Lineages B.1.1.222 and B.1.1.519 exhibited similar dynamics, constituting clades that likely originated in Mexico and persisted for >12 months. Lineages B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.617.2 also displayed similar dynamics, characterized by multiple introduction events leading to a few successful extended local transmission chains that persisted for several months. For the largest B.1.617.2 clades, we further explored viral lineage movements across Mexico. Many clades were located within the south region of the country, suggesting that this area played a key role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "The formation of a stable G-quadruplex (GQ) can inhibit the elevated telomerase activity that is common in most cancers. The global structure and the thermal stability of the GQs are usually evaluated by spectroscopic methods and thermal denaturation properties. However, most biochemical processes involving GQs might require local conformational changes at the guanine tetrad (G4) level. These local conformational changes of individual G4 layers during protein and drug interactions have not yet been explored in detail. In this study we monitored the local conformations of individual G4 layers in GQs using 6-methylisoxanthopterine (6MI) chromophores, which are circular dichroism (CD)-active fluorescent base analogues of guanine, as local conformational probes. A synthetic, tetra-molecular, parallel GQ with site-specifically positioned 6MI monomers or dimers was used as the experimental construct. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies and gel electrophoretic studies showed that properly positioned 6MI monomers and dimers could form stable GQs with CD-active fluorescent G4 layers. The local conformation of individual fluorescent G4 layers in the GQ structure was then tracked by monitoring the absorbance, fluorescence intensity, thermal melting, fluorescence quenching and CD changes of the incorporated probes. Overall, these studies showed that site-specifically incorporated fluorescent base analogues could be used as probes to monitor the local conformational changes of individual G4 layers of a GQ structure. This method can be applied to explore the details of small molecule-GQ interaction at the level of the individual G4 layers, which may prove useful in designing drugs to treat GQ-related genetic disorders, cancer and aging.",

    "abstract": "EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) is an important regulator of various physiological and developmental processes and hence may serve to improve plant adaptation which will be substantial for future plant breeding. To expand the limited knowledge on barley ELF3 in determining agronomic traits, we conducted field studies with heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs) derived from selected lines of the wild barley nested association mapping population HEB-25. During two growing seasons, phenotypes of nearly isogenic HIF sister lines, segregating for exotic and cultivated alleles at the ELF3 locus, were compared for ten developmental and yield-related traits. We determine novel exotic ELF3 alleles and show that HIF lines, carrying the exotic ELF3 allele, accelerated plant development compared to the cultivated ELF3 allele, depending on the genetic background. Remarkably, the most extreme phenotypic effects could be attributed to one exotic ELF3 allele, differing in only one SNP from the cultivated Barke ELF3 allele. This SNP causes an amino acid change, which predictively has an impact on the protein structure of ELF3, thereby possibly affecting phase separation behaviour and nano-compartment formation of ELF3 and, potentially, also affecting its local cellular interactions causing significant trait differences between HIF sister lines.",

The underlying mechanism of BA.2.75s enhanced infectivity, especially compared to BA.5, remains unclear. Here, we show that BA.2.75 exhibits substantially higher ACE2-binding affinity than BA.5. Also, BA.2.75 spike shows decreased thermostability and increased \"up\" RBD conformation in acidic conditions, suggesting enhanced low-pH-endosomal cell-entry pathway utilization. BA.2.75 is less humoral immune evasive than BA.4/BA.5 in BA.1/BA.2 breakthrough-infection convalescents; however, BA.2.75 shows heavier neutralization evasion in Delta breakthrough-infection convalescents. Importantly, plasma from BA.5 breakthrough infection exhibit significantly weaker neutralization against BA.2.75 than BA.5, mainly due to BA.2.75s distinct RBD and NTD-targeting antibody escaping pattern from BA.4/BA.5. Additionally, Evusheld and Bebtelovimab remain effective against BA.2.75, and Sotrovimab recovered RBD-binding affinity.

Are there evolutionary rules governing the arsenal of accessory genes MGEs carry? If such rules exist, they might be reflected in the types of accessory genes different MGEs carry. To test this hypothesis, we compare prophages and plasmids with respect to the frequencies at which they carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in the genomes of 21 pathogenic bacterial species using public databases. Our results indicate that prophages tend to carry VFGs more frequently than ARGs in three species, whereas plasmids tend to carry ARGs more frequently than VFGs in nine species. In Escherichia coli, where these trends are detected, prophage-borne VFGs encode a much narrower range of functions than do plasmid-borne VFGs, typically involved in damaging host cells or modulating host immunity. In the species where the above trends were not detected, ARGs and VFGs are barely found in prophages and plasmids. These results indicate that MGEs differentiate in the types of accessory genes they carry depending on their infection strategies, suggesting an evolutionary rule governing horizontal gene transfer mediated by MGEs.",

    "abstract": "Organoids bearing human stem cell-derived progenitors enable basic and applied investigation of organogenesis in a wide range of epithelial tissues. During liver organogenesis (LO), E9.5 collectively migrating hepatoblasts (MHs) arise from the E9.0 liver diverticulum (LD) and directly penetrate the surrounding mesoderm (MES) tissue, forming cell strands that link migration, differentiation, and growth. Currently, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) organoid protocols model the E10.5 liver bud and forward differentiation, but not the LD or the LD-derived MHs, in spite of their significance. In fact, the transcriptome underlying MHs, the niche that drives their migration, and methods to induce them from hPSC remain key questions.\n\nWe performed bioinformatics analysis of single cell RNA-seq data, in vivo transplantation, and in vitro hPSC differentiation with organoid formation, microscopy, gene and protein expression, small molecule inhibitor screening of growth, and organoid culture in bioengineered devices to assess tissue tension.\n\nOur in depth bioinformatic analysis of early murine LO demonstrates pathway up-regulation of an unexpected wide array of soluble signaling factors, as well as cell cycle, chromatin modification, and metabolic reprogramming, in addition to a widespread cell stress-response. These findings led us hypothesize that the LD and MES tissue form a tissue complex (LD-MESC) that drives MH induction. Using this LD-MESC concept, we designed an in vivo transplant system, as well as a three-step in vitro protocol for inducing hPSC-derived MHs, both of which recapitulate liver growth, morphogenesis, differentiation. We show that Hippo signaling pathway, in agreement with murine MH data, mediates migration and growth of hPSC-MH in vitro. These data substantiate the LD-MESC model developed here, and directly address key challenges facing liver regenerative medicine.\n\nOur bioinformatics, in vitro, and in vivo data all support the concept that the LD-MESC initiates LO. This concept can be used to change protocols to emphasize linking of migration, growth, with differentiation. Modeling epithelial collective migration for LO bolsters not only organogenesis studies of alternate endodermal organs, but also in vivo transplantation efforts, and facilitates employing migrating organoids to therapeutically target human tumor migration/metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with only a fraction of patients responding to immunotherapy. The correlation between increased T-cell infiltration and positive patient outcomes has motivated the search for therapeutics promoting T-cell infiltration. While transwell and spheroid platforms have been employed, these models lack flow and endothelial barriers, and cannot faithfully model T-cell adhesion, extravasation and migration through 3D tissue. Presented here is a 3D chemotaxis assay, in a lung tumor on chip model with 3D endothelium (LToC-Endo), to address this need. The described assay consists of a vascular tubule cultured under rocking flow, through which T-cells are added; a collagenous stromal barrier, through which T-cells infiltrate; and a chemoattractant/tumor compartment. Here, activated T-cells extravasate and infiltrate in response to gradients of rhCXCL11 and rhCXCL12. Adopting a T-cell activation protocol with a rest period enables proliferative burst prior to introducing T-cells into chips, increases T-cell expression of CXCR3 and CXCR4 receptors, and enhances assay sensitivity. In addition, incorporating this rest recovers endothelial activation in response to rhCXCL12. As a final control, we show that blocking ICAM-1 interferes with T-cell adhesion and chemotaxis. This microphysiological system, which mimics in vivo stromal and vascular barriers, can be used to evaluate potentiation of immune chemotaxis into tumors while probing for vascular responses to potential therapeutics. Finally, we propose a translational strategy by which this assay could be linked to preclinical and clinical models to support human dose prediction, personalized medicine, and the reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal models.",

    "abstract": "Proper muscle contraction requires the assembly and maintenance of sarcomeres and myofibrils. While the protein components of myofibrils are generally known, less is known about the mechanisms by which they individually function and together synergize for myofibril assembly and maintenance. For example, it is unclear how the disruption of actin filament (F-actin) regulatory proteins leads to the muscle weakness observed in myopathies. Here, we show that knockdown of Drosophila Tropomodulin (Tmod) results in several myopathy-related phenotypes, including reduction of muscle cell (myofiber) size, increased sarcomere length, disorganization and misorientation of myofibrils, ectopic F-actin accumulation, loss of tension-mediating proteins at the myotendinous junction, and misshaped and internalized nuclei. Our findings support and extend the tension-driven self-organization myofibrillogenesis model. We show that, like its mammalian counterpart, Drosophila Tmod caps F-actin pointed-ends, and this activity is critical for cellular processes in different locations within the myofiber that directly and indirectly contribute to the maintenance of muscle function. Our findings provide significant insights to the role of Tmod in muscle development, maintenance, and disease.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTDrosophila Tropomodulin knockdown in larval myofibers results in myopathy-related phenotypes. Our findings support that Tmod acts in actin-related processes at different subcellular locales, all critical for muscle integrity and function.",

    "abstract": "The advancements in sequencing technologies and assembly methods enable the regular production of high-quality genome assemblies characterizing complex regions. However, challenges remain in efficiently interpreting variations at various scales, from smaller tandem repeats to megabase re-arrangements, across many human genomes. We present a pangenome research toolkit enabling analyses of complex pangenome variations at multiple scales. A graph decomposition method is developed for interpreting such variations. Surveying a set of 395 challenging and medically important genes in pangenome provides quantitative insights into repetitiveness and diversity that could impact the accuracy of variant calls. We apply the graph decomposition methods to the Y-chromosome gene, DAZ1/DAZ2/DAZ3/DAZ4, of which structural variants have been linked to male infertility, and X-chromosome genes OPN1LW and OPN1MW linked to eye disorders, highlighting the power of PGR-TK and pangenomics to resolve complex variation in regions of the genome that were previously too complex to analyze across many haplotypes.",

Antimicrobial activity was determined using the disk diffusion method. Total antioxidant level (TAS), total oxidant level (TOS), and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity were detected for the antioxidant activity of the plant. The main essential oil components of the above-ground parts Hyoscyamus niger were determined as major components the phytol 52.09%, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone 19.66 %. H. niger seeds were hydrodistilled separately, obtaining yields of 0.7% (v w-1) of yellow oils. In the essential oils of H. niger seeds, forty-one components were identified representing 99.0% of the oils. According to the results of the analysis hexahydrofarnesyl acetone 46.36%, hexanal 9.05% as major components. It was determined that the methanol extracts of the above-ground H. niger inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms at different rates (13-32 mm). TAS value of methanol extracts of H. niger was calculated as 3.7705 mmol, while the TOS value was calculated as 6.9403 mol. It was determined that the scavenging effects of the DPPH radical increase, depend on increasing concentrations.",

However, there are disparities between the mouse and human IgE biology, and the role of PI3K p110{delta} in the production of human IgE is yet to be determined. To investigate the effect of PI3K p110{delta} inhibition in the production of human IgE we isolated human B cells from tonsil tissue and stimulated them with IL-4 and anti-CD40 antibody to induce class switching to IgE and IgG1 in the presence or absence of IC87114, a small molecule inhibitor of PI3K p110{delta}. Using FACS, RT-PCR and ELISA we examined the effect of PI3K p110{delta} inhibition on IgE production and also determined the mechanisms involved. Unlike in mice, we observed that PI3K p110{delta} inhibition significantly reduces the number of IgE+ switched cells and the amounts of secreted IgE in IL4 and anti-CD40 cultures. However, the number of IgG1+ cells and secreted IgG1 were largely unaffected by PI3K p110{delta} inhibition. The expression levels of AID, {varepsilon} and {gamma}1 germinal transcripts or other factors involved in the regulation of CSR to IgE and IgG1 were also unaffected by IC87114. However, we found that IC87114 significantly decreases the proliferation of tonsil B cells stimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40, specifically reducing the frequency of cells that had undergone 4 divisions or more. Our data identifies proliferation as the key mechanism through which PI3K p110{delta} regulates CSR of human B cells to IgE and highlights PI3K p110{delta} as a pharmacological target for the treatment of allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "Truncating mutations of the maternally imprinted, paternally expressed MAGEL2 gene are the predicted genetic cause of several rare neurodevelopmental disorders including Schaaf-Yang (SYS), Chitayat-Hall and Opitz Trigonocephaly C syndromes. MAGEL2 is also deleted or inactivated in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Previous studies in mice have utilized Magel2 gene deletion models to examine the consequences of its absence. In this study, we report the generation, molecular validation, and phenotypic characterization of a novel rat model with a truncating Magel2 mutation generating a mutant peptide sequence more closely modeling variants associated with SYS-causing mutations. Within the hypothalamus, a brain region wherein mouse and human MAGEL2 is paternally-expressed, we demonstrate at the level of transcript and peptide detection that Magel2 in the rat exhibits a paternal, parent-of-origin effect. In the evaluation of behavioral features across several domains, juvenile Magel2 mutant rats display select alterations in anxiety-like behavior and sociability measures. Moreover, the analysis of peripheral organ systems detected alterations in body composition, cardiac structure and function, and breathing irregularities in Magel2 mutant rats. Several of these findings are concordant with reported mouse phenotypes, signifying the conservation of MAGEL2 function across rodent species for specific behavioral outcome measures. We conclude that our comprehensive analysis demonstrating impairments across multiple domains demonstrates the tractability of this model system for the study of truncating MAGEL2 mutations.",

We integrate single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), comparative genomics, and automated behavior analysis to investigate a recently-evolved social \"bower building\" behavior in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes. We functionally profile telencephalic nuclei matched to 38 paired behaving/control individuals. Our data suggest bower behavior has evolved in part through divergence in a gene module selectively expressed in a subpopulation of glia lining the pallium. Downregulation of the module is associated with glial departure from quiescence and rebalancing of neuronal subpopulation proportions in the putative homologue of the hippocampus. We show further evidence that behavior-associated excitation of neuronal populations that project to the putative hippocampus mediate glial function and rebalancing. Our work suggests that bower behavior has evolved through changes in glia and region-specific neurogenesis, and more broadly shows how snRNA-seq can generate insight into uncharted behaviors and species.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus represents a key structure in the integration of emotional processing, learning and memory, and reward-related behaviors. While the ventral subdivision of the hippocampus (vHPC) is involved in processing emotional values of salient stimuli and goal-directed behaviors, the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) plays a critical role in episodic, spatial, and associative memory. In addition, it has been shown that the dHPC is necessary for context- and cue-associated reward behaviors, including the expression of reward seeking. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a central structure in the mesolimbic reward pathway, integrates the salience of aversive and rewarding stimuli and its activity is sufficient to drive aversive and appetitive behaviors. Recent evidence has demonstrated that dHPC[-&gt;]Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) pathway is necessary for expression of a conditioned place preference. However, despite years of groundbreaking research and identification of direct projections from the dHPC to the NAc, the sufficiency for dHPC[-&gt;]NAC inputs to drive reinforcement and reward associated behavior remains to be determined.\n\nHere using a wide range of complementary and cutting-edge techniques including behavior, in-vivo manipulation using optogenetics, chemogenetics, brain clearing, local field potential and fiber photometry recordings, we demonstrate that activation of excitatory projections from the CA1 subregion of the dHPC (dCA1) is sufficient to drive reinforcing behaviors. In addition, we provide strong evidence that this reinforcing behavior is driven by 1) a direct projection from the dCA1 to the NAc and 2) enhanced glutamatergic signaling within the NAc. Furthermore, we uncovered that while dCA1 stimulation increases the activity of both enkephalin- and dynorphin-containing medium spiny neurons in the NAc, the selective activity of dynorphin-containing neurons is necessary for the expression of this reinforcing behavior. Our findings shed light on a novel pathway governing reinforcement and further extend the role of the dHPC on reward seeking.",

    "abstract": "Maternal immune activation (MIA) during the critical windows of gestation is correlated with long- term neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring, including increased risks for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) derived from the gestational parent is one of the major molecular mediators, by which MIA alters the developing brain. In this study, we established a human three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model of MIA by treating induced pluripotent stem cell- derived dorsal forebrain organoids with a constitutively active form of IL-6, Hyper-IL-6. We validated our model by showing that dorsal forebrain organoids express the molecular machinery necessary for responding to Hyper-IL-6 and activate STAT signaling upon Hyper-IL-6 treatment. RNA sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) genes, which have been implicated with ASD. Immunohistochemical analysis as well as single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed a small increase in the proportion of radial glia cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed the highest number of differentially expressed genes in radial glia cells with downregulation of genes related to protein translation in line with data from mouse models of MIA. Additionally, we identified differentially expressed genes not found in mouse models of MIA which might drive species-specific responses to MIA. Together, we establish a human 3D model of MIA, which can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the increased risk for developing disorders such as ASD.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth in genomic selection data provides unprecedented opportunities to discover and utilize complex genetic effects for improving phenotypes but methodology is lacking. Epistasis effects are interaction effects and haplotype effects may contain local high-order epistasis effects. Multifactorial methods with SNP, haplotype and epistasis effects up to the third-order are developed to investigate the contributions of global low-order and local high-order epistasis effects to the phenotypic variance and the accuracy of gnomic prediction of quantitative traits. These methods include genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) with associated reliability for individuals with and without phenotypic observations including a computationally efficient GBLUP method for large validation populations, and genomic restricted maximum estimation (GREML) of the variance and associated heritability using a combination of EM-REML and AI-REML iterative algorithms. These methods were developed for two models, Model-I with 10 effect types, and Model-II with 13 effect types including intra- and inter-chromosome pairwise epistasis effects that replace the pairwise epistasis effects of Model-I. GREML heritability estimate and GBLUP effect estimate for each effect of an effect type are derived except for third-order epistasis effects. The multifactorial models evaluate each effect type based on the phenotypic values adjusted for the remaining effect types and can use more effect types than separate models of SNP, haplotype and epistasis effects; and provide a methodology capability to evaluate the contributions of complex genetic effects to the phenotypic variance and prediction accuracy, and to discover and utilize complex genetic effects for improving the phenotypes of quantitative traits.",

Transcription factors are the most frequently mutated and dysregulated genes in AML and they have critical roles in AML pathogenesis and progression. In this study, we performed large-scale RNA interference screens in MLL-AF9 transformed AML cells and identified GTF2IRD1 as a novel transcription factor essential for the survival of various types of myeloid leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo, but not for primary normal hematopoietic cells. Inhibition of GTF2IRD1 reduced the frequency of primary childhood and adult AML cells, including cell populations enriched for leukemia-initiating cells. In animal models for AML, inhibition of GTF2IRD1 significantly delayed the disease progression. Inhibition of GTF2IRD1 caused an accumulation of quiescent AML cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle but caused minor effects in apoptosis. In line with this, RNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant downregulation of E2F targets as a consequence of inhibition of GTF2IRD1. Taken together, we identified GTF2IRD1 as a transcription factor with a selective importance in AML and our findings may contribute to new therapeutic inventions for the disease.",

We simulate a computationally-annotated dataset using a few annotated images, a short unannotated video clip of a wheat field, and several video clips from fields with no wheat. This dataset is then used to train a customized U-Net model for wheat head segmentation. Considering the distribution shift between the simulated and real data, we apply three domain adaptation steps to gradually bridge the domain gap. Only using two annotated images, we achieved a Dice score of 0.89 on the internal test set, i.e., images extracted from the wheat field video. The model trained using only two annotated images was evaluated on a diverse external dataset collected from 18 different domains across five countries and achieved a Dice score of 0.73. To further expose the model to images from different growth stages and environmental conditions, we incorporated two annotated images from each of the 18 domains and further fine-tuned the model. This resulted in improving the Dice score to 0.91. These promising results highlight the utility of the proposed approach in the absence of large-annotated datasets. Although the utility of the proposed method is shown on a wheat head dataset, it can be extended to other segmentation tasks with similar characteristics of irregularly repeating patterns of object instances.",

This dataset is then used to train a customized U-Net model for wheat head segmentation. Considering the distribution shift between the simulated and real data, we apply three domain adaptation steps to gradually bridge the domain gap. Only using two annotated images, we achieved a Dice score of 0.89 on the internal test set, i.e., images extracted from the wheat field video. The model trained using only two annotated images was evaluated on a diverse external dataset collected from 18 different domains across five countries and achieved a Dice score of 0.73. To further expose the model to images from different growth stages and environmental conditions, we incorporated two annotated images from each of the 18 domains and further fine-tuned the model. This resulted in improving the Dice score to 0.91. These promising results highlight the utility of the proposed approach in the absence of large-annotated datasets. Although the utility of the proposed method is shown on a wheat head dataset, it can be extended to other segmentation tasks with similar characteristics of irregularly repeating patterns of object instances.",

    "abstract": "The shape of tomato fruits is closely correlated to microtubule organization and the activity of microtubule associated proteins (MAP), but insights into the mechanism from a cell biology perspective are still largely elusive. Analysis of tissue expression profiles of different microtubule regulators revealed that functionally distinct classes of MAPs are highly expressed during fruit development. Among these, several members of the plant-specific MAP70 family are preferably expressed at the initiation stage of fruit development. Transgenic tomato lines overexpressing SlMAP70 produced elongated fruits that show reduced cell circularity and microtubule anisotropy, while SlMAP70 loss-of-function mutant showed an opposite effect with flatter fruits. Microtubule anisotropy of fruit endodermis cells exhibited dramatic rearrangement during tomato fruit development, and SlMAP70-1 is likely implicated in cortical microtubule organization and fruit elongation throughout this stage by interacting with SUN10/SlIQD21a. The expression of SlMAP70 (or co-expression of SlMAP70 and SUN10/SlIQD21a) induces microtubule stabilization and prevents its dynamic rearrangement, both activities are essential for fruit shape establishment after anthesis. Together, our results identify SlMAP70 as a novel regulator of fruit elongation, and demonstrate that manipulating microtubule stability and organization at the early fruit developmental stage has a strong impact on fruit shape.",

    "abstract": "Self-incompatibility (SI) is a genetic mechanism utilized by many flowering plants to promote outcrossing by recognizing and rejecting self-pollen. While the molecular mechanisms controlling SI can differ in various families, plants in the Brassicaceae family have been found to regulate SI through a S-haplotype-specific receptor-ligand interaction. The recognition of self-pollen leads to the activation of ARMADILLO-REPEAT-CONTAINING1 (ARC1), an E3 ligase which is thought to degrade the compatibility factors required for pollen germination, thus resulting in SI. However, the role of ARC1 in SI in the Brassicaceae family has been disputed within the scientific community. While various studies demonstrate that the manipulation of ARC1 and its downstream targets can break-down the SI response, others show that the SI phenotype can be imparted to self-compatible cultivars without the ARC1 gene. This study investigated the involvement of ARC1 in SI through the generation of loss-of-function ARC1 mutants using CRISPR-Cas9 in B. napus. Loss of ARC1 resulted in complete breakdown of SI in two different S-haplotypes providing strong evidence for the essential nature of ARC1 for mounting a successful SI response.",

The evolutionary forces that have shaped replication timing programs in eukaryotic species are largely unknown. Here, we studied the molecular causes and consequences of replication timing evolution across 94 humans, 95 chimpanzees, and 23 rhesus macaques. Replication timing differences recapitulated the species phylogenetic tree, suggesting continuous evolution of the DNA replication timing program in primates. Hundreds of genomic regions had significant replication timing variation between humans and chimpanzees, of which 66 showed advances in replication origin firing in humans while 57 were delayed. Genes overlapping these regions displayed correlated changes in expression levels and chromatin structure. Many human-chimpanzee variants also exhibited inter-individual replication timing variation, pointing to ongoing evolution of replication timing at these loci. Association of replication timing variation with genetic variation revealed that DNA sequence evolution can explain replication timing variation between species. Taken together, DNA replication timing shows substantial and ongoing evolution in the human lineage that is driven by sequence alterations and impacts regulatory evolution.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to cope with drought, which involve massive changes in nuclear gene expression. However, little is known about the roles of post-transcriptional processing of nuclear or organellar transcripts and how meaningful these changes are. To address these issues, we used long non-coding RNA-sequencing to monitor (post)transcriptional changes during different times of drought exposure in Arabidopsis Col-0 and a mutant (protein phosphatase 7-like, pp7l), from which we demonstrated that it can survive long periods of drought stress. The changes detected in the pp7l mutant were marginal, while in the wild type chloroplast transcript levels were globally reduced, editing efficiency dropped, but splicing was not affected. Mitochondrial transcripts were slightly elevated, while editing and splicing were unchanged. Also, transcriptional activation of transposable elements played only a minor role. Conversely, alternative splicing (AS) affected nearly 2,000 genes (11% of expressed nuclear genes). Of these, 25% underwent isoform switching, and 15% were regulated solely at the level of AS, representing transcripts that would have gone unnoticed in a microarray-based approach. Our data show that AS enhances proteome diversity to counteract drought stress and represent a valuable resource that will facilitate the development of new strategies to improve plant performance under drought. Moreover, altering the relative contributions of spliced isoforms might enhance drought resistance. For instance, our data imply that accumulation of a non-functional FLM (FLOWERING LOCUS M) isoform - and not the ratio of functional isoforms as suggested for temperature responses - accounts for the early-flowering phenotype under drought conditions.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, with 15 mutations in Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD), renders virtually all clinical monoclonal antibodies against WT SARS-CoV-2 ineffective. We recently engineered the SARS-CoV-2 host entry receptor, ACE2, to tightly bind WT-Spike-RBD and prevent viral entry into host cells (\"receptor traps\"). Here we determine cryo-EM structures of our receptor traps in complex with full length Spike. We develop a multi-model pipeline combining Rosetta protein modeling software and cryo-EM to allow interface energy calculations even at limited resolution and identify interface side chains that allow for high affinity interactions between our ACE2 receptor traps and Spike-RBD. Our structural analysis provides a mechanistic rationale for the high affinity (0.53 - 4.2nM) binding of our ACE2 receptor traps to Omicron-RBD confirmed with biolayer interferometry measurements. Finally, we show that ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize Omicron- and Delta-pseudotyped viruses, providing alternative therapeutic routes to combat this evolving virus.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron (B.1.1.529), rapidly swept the world since its emergence. Compared with previous variants, Omicron has a high number of mutations, especially those in its spike glycoprotein that drastically dampen or abolish the efficacy of currently available vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Several major sublineages of Omicron evolved, including BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4/5, and BA.2.75, which rapidly changing the global and regional landscape of the pandemic. Although vaccines are available, therapeutic antibodies remain critical for infected and especially hospitalized patients. To address this, we have designed and generated a panel of human/humanized therapeutic bispecific antibodies against Omicron and its sub-lineage variants, with activity spectrum against other lineages. Among these, the top clone CoV2-0213 has broadly potent activities against multiple SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and Omicron lineages, including BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4/5, and BA.2.75. We have solved the cryo-EM structure of the lead bi-specific antibody CoV-0213 and its major Fab arm MB.02. Three-dimensional structural analysis shows distinct epitope of antibody - spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interactions and reveals that both Fab fragments of CoV2-0213 can simultaneously target one single spike RBD or two adjacent ones in the same spike trimer, further corroborating its mechanism of action. CoV2-0213 represents a unique and potent broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing bispecific antibody (nbsAb) against the currently circulating major Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.3, and BA.4/5). CoV2-0213 is primarily human and ready for translational testing as a countermeasure against the ever-evolving pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Cold-chain environment could extend the survival duration of SARS-CoV-2 and increases the risk of transmission. However, the effect of clod-chain environmental factors and packaging materials on SARS-CoV-2 stability and the efficacy of intervention measures to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 under cold-chain environment remains uncertain. This study aimed to unravel cold-chain environmental factors that preserved the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and disinfection measures against SARS-CoV-2 under the cold-chain environment. The spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Wuhan hu-1 was used to construct the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and used as model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in the cold-chain environment, various types of packaging material surfaces i.e., PE plastic, stainless steel, Teflon and cardboard, and in frozen seawater was investigated. The influence of LED visible light(wavelength 450 nm-780 nm) and airflow movement on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at -18{degrees} C were subsequently assessed. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus decayed more rapidly on porous cardboard surface compared with the non-porous surfaces including PE plastic, stainless steel and Teflon. Compared with 25{degrees} C, the decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was significantly lower at low temperature. Seawater preserved viral stability both at -18{degrees} C and repeated freeze-thawing cycles compared with deionized water. LED visible light illumination and airflow movement environment at -18{degrees} C reduced the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus stability. In conclusion, our results indicate cold-chain temperature and seawater as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and LED visible light illumination and airflow movement as possible disinfection measures of SARS-CoV-2 under the cold-chain environment.\n\nImportanceIt is widely recognized that low temperature is a condition for maintaining virus vitality, and cold-chain transportation spreads the events of the SARS-CoV-2 were reported. This study provides that the decay rate of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at low temperatures varies on different packaging materials, and salt ions present in frozen foods such as seafood may protect virus survival. These results provide evidence for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through cold-chain transport and also suggest the importance for disinfection of items. However, the commonly used disinfection methods of ultraviolet radiation and chemical reagents are generally not suitable for the disinfection of frozen food. Our study shows LED visible light illumination and airflow movement as possible disinfection measures of SARS-CoV-2 under the cold-chain environment. This has implications for reducing the long-distance transmission of the virus through cold-chain transportation.",

The direct role of the retrosplenial cortex in regulating social behaviors remains unclear. This work reveals that the neural activity of retrosplenial agranular cortex (RSA), a subregion of retrosplenial cortex, is initially activated, then quickly suppressed upon social contact. The up-down phase of RSA neurons is crucial for normal social behaviors. PV-positive GABAergic neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were found to send inhibitory projections to RSA. Blocking these CA1-RSA inhibitory inputs significantly impaired social behavior. Notably, enhancing the CA1-RSA inhibitory input could rescue social behavior defects in an ASD mouse model.

    "abstract": "Reproductive senescence is broadly observed across mammalian females, including humans, eventually leading to a loss of fertility. The pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is essential for gonad function, is primarily controlled by kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARCkiss), the pulse generator of GnRH. The pulsatility of GnRH release, as assessed by the amount of circulating gonadotropin, is markedly reduced in aged animals, suggesting that the malfunctions of ARCkiss may be responsible for reproductive aging and menopause-related disorders. However, the activity dynamics of ARCkiss during the natural transition to reproductive senescence remain unclear. Herein, we introduce chronic in vivo Ca2+ imaging of ARCkiss in female mice by fiber photometry to monitor the synchronous episodes of ARCkiss (SEskiss), a known hallmark of GnRH pulse generator activity, from the fully reproductive to acyclic phase over 1 year. During the reproductive phase, we find that not only the frequency, but also the intensities and waveforms of individual SEskiss, vary depending on the stage of the estrus cycle. During the transition to reproductive senescence, the integrity of SEskiss patterns, including the frequency and waveforms, remains mostly unchanged, whereas the intensities tend to decline. These data illuminate the temporal dynamics of ARCkiss activities in aging female mice. More generally, our findings demonstrate the utility of fiber-photometry-based chronic imaging of neuroendocrine regulators in the brain to characterize aging-associated malfunction.\n\nSignificance StatementThe transition to reproductive senescence significantly impacts the quality of life of women, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Goto and Miyamichi establish long-term (from the reproductive to acyclic phase) chronic imaging of the central pacemaker activities of reproductive functions by fiber photometry in female mice. In particular, they focus on kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Their data reveal that during the transition to reproductive senescence, the pulsatile activities of kisspeptin neurons show unexpected robustness in terms of frequency, but a tendency for the intensity to decline. Their findings exhibit the power of direct chronic visualization of hormonal regulators in the brain, which is generally applicable to facilitate studies of aging-associated malfunctions in neuroendocrine systems.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian somatosensory system is comprised of multiple neuronal populations that form specialized, highly organized sensory endings in the skin. The organization of somatosensory endings is essential to their functions, yet the mechanisms which regulate this organization remain unclear. Using a combination of genetic and molecular labeling approaches, we examined the development of mouse hair follicle-innervating low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and explored competition for innervation targets as a mechanism involved in the patterning of their receptive fields. We show that follicle innervating neurons are present in the skin at birth and that LTMR receptive fields gradually add follicle-innervating endings during the first two postnatal weeks. Using a constitutive Bax knockout to increase the number of neurons in adult animals, we show that two LTMR subtypes have differential responses to an increase in neuronal population size: A{delta}-LTMR neurons shrink their receptive fields to accommodate the increased number of neurons innervating the skin, while C-LTMR neurons do not. Our findings suggest that competition for hair follicles to innervate plays a role in the patterning and organization of follicle-innervating LTMR neurons.\n\nSummary StatementA{delta} follicle-innervating low-threshold mechanoreceptor neurons form tiled receptive fields through competition for hair follicles during the early postnatal period.",

This coincides with an arrest of cellular proliferation. A subset of such cells enters quiescence, a reversible non-dividing state. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved transcriptional corepressor Tup1 is critical for transcriptional repression after glucose depletion. We show that Tup1-Ssn6 binds new targets upon glucose depletion, where it remains as the cells enter the G0 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, we show that Tup1 represses a variety of glucose metabolism and transport genes. We explored how Tup1 mediated repression is accomplished and demonstrated that Tup1 coordinates with the Rpd3L complex to deacetylate H3K23. We found that Tup1 coordinates with Isw2 to affect nucleosome positions at glucose transporter HXT family genes during G0. Finally, microscopy revealed that a quarter of cells with a Tup1 deletion contain multiple DAPI puncta. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the role of Tup1 in transcriptional reprogramming in response to environmental cues leading to the quiescent state.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are responsible for late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinsons disease (PD). LRRK2 has been implicated in a wide range of physiological processes including membrane repair in the endolysosomal system. Here, using cell free systems, we report that purified LRRK2 directly binds acidic lipid bilayers with a preference for highly curved bilayers. While this binding is nucleotide independent, LRRK2 can also deform low curvature liposomes into narrow tubules in a guanylnucleotide-dependent but ATP-independent way. Moreover, assembly of LRRK2 into scaffolds at the surface of lipid tubules can constrict them. We suggest that an interplay between the membrane remodeling and signaling properties of LRRK2 may be key to its physiological function. LRRK2, via its kinase activity, may achieve its signaling role at sites where membrane remodeling occurs.\n\nSignificance StatementLRRK2 is one of the most frequently mutated gene in familial Parkinsons disease. While much has been learned about its molecular properties, upstream regulators and protein substrates of its kinase activity, its precise function remains unclear. Recent evidence has pointed to a role of LRRK2 in membrane repair in the endo/lysosomal system. Here we show that purified LRRK2 has membrane remodeling properties. We suggest that its ability to sense and induce membrane curvature may be key to its function in membrane dynamics.

    "abstract": "Morphological development of the lung requires complex signal crosstalk between the mesenchymal and epithelial progenitors. Elucidating the genetic cascades underlying the signal crosstalk is essential to understanding the morphogenesis of the lung. Here, we have identified Nolz-1/Znf503 as a mesenchymal lineage-specific transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in lung morphogenesis. The null mutation of Nolz-1 resulted in a severe hypoplasia phenotype, including decreased proliferation of mesenchymal cells, aberrant differentiation of epithelial cells, and defective growth of epithelial branches. The deletion of Nolz-1 also downregulated the expressions of Wnt2, Lef1, Fgf10, Gli3 and Bmp4. Mechanistically, we found that Nolz-1 regulated lung morphogenesis primarily through Wnt2 signaling. Loss of function and overexpression studies demonstrated that Nolz-1 transcriptionally activated Wnt2 and downstream {beta}-catenin signaling to control mesenchymal cell proliferation and epithelial branching. The Nolz-1-Wnt2 axis was also supported by evidence that exogenous Wnt2 could causally rescue defective proliferation and epithelial branching in Nolz-1 knockout lungs. Finally, we have identified Fgf9 as an upstream regulator of Nolz-1. Collectively, Fgf9-Nolz-1-Wnt2 signaling represents a novel signaling axis in the control of lung morphogenesis. These findings are also relevant to lung tumorigenesis in which a pathological function of Nolz-1 is involved.",

Studies in yeast have established that the single end invasion intermediate is highly regulated to ensure crossover distribution. Single end invasions are thought to differentiate into double Holliday junctions that are resolved by MutLgamma (MLH1/3) into crossovers. Currently, we lack knowledge of early steps of mammalian crossover recombination or how intermediates are differentiated in any organism. Using comprehensive analysis of recombination and cytology, we infer that polymerized single-end invasion intermediates and nicked double Holliday junctions are crossover precursors in mouse spermatocytes. In marked contrast to yeast, MLH3 plays a structural role to differentiate single end invasions into double Holliday junctions with differentially polymerized 3 ends. Therefore, we show independent genetic requirements for precursor formation and asymmetry with regard to 3 end processing, providing mechanistic insight into crossover formation and patterning.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-wide patterning is essential to multicellular development, requiring cells to individually generate polarity axes and coordinate them in space and time with neighbors. Using the C. elegans intestinal epithelium, we identified a patterning mechanism informed by stabilized cell/cell contact and executed via the scaffolding protein PAR-3 and the transmembrane protein E-cadherin/HMR-1. Intestinal cells break symmetry as PAR-3 and HMR-1 recruit apical determinants into micron-scale  local polarity complexes (LPCs) at homotypic contacts. LPCs undergo a HMR-1-based migration to a common tissue midline, thereby establishing tissue-wide polarity. Thus, symmetry breaking results from PAR-3-dependent intracellular polarization coupled to HMR-1-based tissue-level communication that occurs through a non-adhesive signaling role for HMR-1. Intestinal cells gain initial asymmetry from differential contact duration as homotypic contacts last longer than heterotypic contacts, thus providing stable platforms for LPC assembly and offering a logical and likely conserved framework for how internal epithelia with no obvious pre-existing asymmetries can polarize.",

This article presents an overview of the VGNC project and discussion of key findings resulting from this work to date. VGNC approved nomenclature is accessible at https://vertebrate.genenames.org, and is additionally displayed by the NCBI, Ensembl and UniProt databases.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) form the bulk of the genetic variation contributing to schizophrenia. Currently little is known about how eQTL expression is regulated or how this leads to the underlying cellular pathology. Neuregulin1-ErbB4 signaling plays a crucial role in synaptogenesis and has been implicated in schizophrenia. A psychosis-associated missense mutation in NRG1 (rs74942016) is predicted to impair Nrg1 nuclear back-signaling, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and dendritogenesis, thereby implicating this mode of signaling in the underlying cellular pathology. We generated a transgenic mouse harboring the rs74942016 mutation in nrg1. We investigated the effect of this mutation (V321L in Type III Nrg1) on Nrg1 nuclear signaling. We performed transcriptomic analysis of the mutant dentate gyrus (DG) and identified several developmental processes predicted to be altered compared to wildtype DG. We assessed neurogenesis, cell cycle dynamics, fate commitment, and neuronal maturation in vivo in the mutant neurogenic niche. We found that the V321L mutation impairs nuclear translocation of the Nrg1 ICD. RNA sequencing identified cell cycle regulation, differentiation, neurogenesis, and dendritic growth as dysregulated processes in the mutant DG. We experimentally confirmed these predictions. Key nodes along the neurogenesis developmental timeline were found to be disrupted in the mutant DG, resulting in abnormal dendrite morphology and neural fate specification. We found that orthologs of known schizophrenia susceptibility genes were dysregulated in the mutant DG and interacted within a larger network of dysregulated genes in the mutant DG. Importantly, the schizophrenia-associated genes functioned as hubs coordinating this larger network, and the additional nodes within this extended network were functionally linked to known physiological processes and pathways associated with schizophrenia. Thus, our data show that Nrg1 nuclear back signaling is an important regulator of cell proliferation, neuronal specification, and maturation in the adult mouse DG. Loss of Nrg1 nuclear back-signaling due to the V321L mutation disrupts adult neurogenesis and results in dysregulation of a schizophrenia susceptibility gene network.",
