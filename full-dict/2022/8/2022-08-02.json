    "abstract": "Objective assays of human cochlear synaptopathy (CS) have been challenging to develop. Its suspected if relative summating potential (SP) changes are different in CS listeners. In this proof-of-concept study, young, normal-hearing adults were recruited and assigned to a low/high-risk group for having CS based on their audiograms at 9-16 kHz. SPs to paired-clicks with varying inter-click intervals isolated non-refractory receptor components of cochlear activity. Abrupt increases in SPs to paired- vs. single-clicks were observed in high-risk listeners. Critically, overexaggerated SPs predicted speech-in-noise and subjective hearing abilities, suggesting relative SP changes to rapid clicks might help identify putative synaptopathic listeners.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that the microRNA (miRNA) processor complex consisting of the RNAse Drosha and the DiGeorge Critical Region (DGCR) 8 protein is essential for central B cell maturation. To determine whether miRNA processing is required to initiate T cell-mediated antibody responses, we deleted DGCR8 in maturing B-2 cells by crossing a mouse with loxP-flanked DGCR8 alleles with a CD23-Cre mouse. As expected, non-immunized mice showed reduced numbers of mature B-2 cells and IgG-secreting cells and diminished serum IgG titers. In accordance, germinal centers and antigen-specific IgG-secreting cells were absent in mice immunized with T cell-dependent antigens. Therefore, DGCR8 is required to mount an efficient T cell-dependent antibody response. However, DGCR8 deletion in B-1 cells was incomplete, which explains relatively unaffected B-1 cell numbers and adequate IgM and IgA titers in DGCR8-knock out mice and suggests that this mouse model could be used to analyze B-1 responses in the absence of functional B-2 cells.",

We employed in vivo quantitative MR Spectroscopy (MRS) in healthy adult participants and quantified the changes in GABA and Glx complex (Glutamate and Glutamine) before and after five sessions of tDCS stimulation. tDCS was delivered at 2mA intensity for 20 minutes for the active group and 1 minute for the sham group. tDCS was applied over five days while participants were engaged in a charitable donation task, known to engage the reward network. We observed increased levels of GABA in vmPFC, but not in DLPFC. Glx levels were decreased in both vmPFC and DLPFC. We found that self-reported happiness increased significantly over time only in the active group. There was a decrease in self-reported guiltiness in both active and sham groups. Altogether, the results indicate that self-reported emotions can be modulated by prefrontal stimulation. This may be because the changes in GABA and Glx concentrations following repeated stimulation induce remote changes in the reward network through interactions with other metabolites, previously thought to be unreachable with noninvasive stimulation techniques.",

In this study, from a screening of approved-drug libraries using an MPXV infection cell system, atovaquone, mefloquine, and molnupiravir exhibited anti-MPXV activity, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.51-5.2 M, which is more potent than cidofovir. Whereas mefloquine was suggested to inhibit viral entry, atovaquone and molnupiravir targeted post-entry process to impair intracellular virion accumulation. Inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an atovaquones target enzyme, showed conserved anti-MPXV activities. Combining atovaquone with tecovirimat enhanced the anti-MPXV effect of tecovirimat. Quantitative mathematical simulations predicted that atovaquone can promote viral clearance in patients by seven days at clinically relevant drug concentrations. Moreover, atovaquone and molnupiravir exhibited pan-Orthopoxvirus activity against vaccinia and cowpox viruses. These data suggest that atovaquone would be potential candidates for treating monkeypox.",

Due to confounding factors in the human population, such as pre-existing immunity, comparing severity of disease caused by different VOCs is challenging. Here, we investigate disease progression in the rhesus macaque model upon inoculation with the Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 VOCs. Disease severity in rhesus macaques inoculated with Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 was lower than those inoculated with Delta and resulted in significantly lower viral loads in nasal swabs, bronchial cytology brush samples, and lung tissue in rhesus macaques. Cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in nasosorption samples of Delta animals compared to Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 animals. Overall, these data suggests that in rhesus macaques, Omicron replicates to lower levels than the Delta VOC, resulting in reduced clinical disease.",

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-{kappa}B inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more I{kappa}B expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B that I{kappa}B usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable I{kappa}B mutant reduced NF-{kappa}B translocation and increased viral infection. These data demonstrate the functionality of ACE2-OE organoids in SARS-CoV-2 research and identify an incomplete NF-{kappa}B feedback loop as a rheostat of viral infection that may promote inflammation and severe disease.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we reported that BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals after Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection have strong serum neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), yet less against the highly contagious Omicron sublineages BA.4 and BA.5 that have displaced previous variants. As the latter sublineages are derived from Omicron BA.2, we characterized serum neutralizing activity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine triple-immunized individuals who experienced BA.2 breakthrough infection. We demonstrate that sera of these individuals have broadly neutralizing activity against previous VOCs as well as all tested Omicron sublineages, including BA.2 derived variants BA.2.12.1, BA.4/BA.5. Furthermore, applying antibody depletion we showed that neutralization of BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 sublineages by BA.2 convalescent sera is driven to a significant extent by antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike glycoprotein, whereas their neutralization by Omicron BA.1 convalescent sera depends exclusively on antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD). These findings suggest that exposure to Omicron BA.2, in contrast to BA.1 spike glycoprotein, triggers significant NTD specific recall responses in vaccinated individuals and thereby enhances the neutralization of BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. Given the current epidemiology with a predominance of BA.2 derived sublineages like BA.4/BA.5 and rapidly ongoing evolution, these findings are of high relevance for the development of Omicron adapted vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections have rapidly spread throughout the world, and the virus has acquired an ability to spread via aerosols even at long distances. Hand washing, face-masking, and social distancing are the primary preventive measures against infections. With mounting scientific evidence, World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 an air-borne disease. This ensued the need to disinfect air to reduce the transmission. Ultraviolet C (UVC) comprising the light radiation of 200-280 nm range is a commonly used method for inactivation of pathogens. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are not beneficial in closed spaces due to poor or no ability to damage circulating viruses. Therefore, standard infection-prevention practices coupled with a strategy to reduce infectious viral load in air substantially might be helpful in reducing virus transmissibility. In this study, we implemented UV light-based strategies to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics. We tested various disinfection protocols by using UVC-based air purification systems and currently installed such a system in workspaces, rushed out places, hospitals and healthcare facilities for surface, air, and water disinfection. In this study, we designed a prototype device to test the dose of UVC required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and demonstrate that the radiation rapidly destroys the virus in aerosols. The UVC treatment renders the virus non-infectious due to chemical modification of nucleic acid. We also demonstrate that UVC treatment alters the Spike protein conformation that may further affect the infectivity of the virus. We show by using a mathematical model based on the experimental data that UVC-based air disinfection strategy can substantially reduce the risk of virus transmission. The systematic treatment by UVC of air in the closed spaces via ventilation systems could be helpful in reducing the active viral load in the air.",

Here, we are leveraging the unique properties of these DNA-NPs and demonstrate that precisely patterning ten copies of a reconstituted trimer of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 along with CpG adjuvants on the DNA-NPs is able to elicit a robust protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model.

    "abstract": "Monkeypox has emerged as a fast-spreading disease around the world and an outbreak has been reported in 75 countries so far. Although the clinical attributes of Monkeypox are similar to those of Smallpox, skin lesions and rashes caused by Monkeypox often resemble those of other types of pox, for example, chickenpox and cowpox. This scenario makes an early diagnosis of Monkeypox challenging for the healthcare professional just by observing the visual appearance of lesions and rashes. The rarity of Monkeypox before the current outbreak further created a knowledge gap among healthcare professionals around the world. To tackle this challenging situation, scientists are taking motivation from the success of supervised machine learning in COVID-19 detection. However, the lack of Monkeypox skin image data is making the bottleneck of using machine learning in Monkeypox detection from patient skin images. Therefore, in this project, we introduce the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset 2022, the largest of its kind so far. We used web-scraping to collect Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Smallpox, Cowpox, and Measles infected skin as well as healthy skin images to build a comprehensive image database and make it publicly available. We believe that our database will facilitate the development of baseline machine learning algorithms for early detection of Monkeypox in clinical settings. Our dataset is available at the following Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arafathussain/monkeypox-skin-image-dataset-2022.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe outbreak of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection in May 2022 is declared a global health emergency by WHO. As of 28th July, 21067 cases have been confirmed and the numbers are on the rise. Unfortunately, MPXV pathophysiology and its underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Likewise, the knowledge of biochemicals and drugs used against MPXV and their downstream effects is sparse. In this work, using Knowledge Graph (KG) representations we have depicted chemical and biological aspects of MPXV. To achieve this, we have collected and rationally assembled several biological study results, assays, drug candidates, and preclinical evidence to form a dynamic and comprehensive network. The KG is compliant with FAIR annotations allowing seamless transformation and integration to/with other formats and infrastructures.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe Monkeypox knowledge graph is publicly available at https://github.com/Fraunhofer-ITMP/mpox-kg\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\nContactReagon.Karki@itmp.fraunhofer.de",

    "abstract": "Recent studies revealed mechanisms by which the microbiome affects its hosts brain, behavior and wellbeing, and that dysbiosis - persistent microbiome-imbalance - is associated with the onset and progress of various chronic diseases, including addictive behaviors. Yet, understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape the host-microbiome ecosystem and affect the host state, is still limited. Here we propose that competition dynamics within the microbiome, associated with host-microbiome mutual regulation, may promote dysbiosis and aggravate addictive behaviors. We constructed a mathematical framework, modeling the dynamics of the host-microbiome ecosystem in response to alterations. We find that when this ecosystem is exposed to substantial perturbations, the microbiome may shift towards a composition that reinforces the new host state. Such positive feedback loop augments post-perturbation imbalances, hindering attempts to return to the initial equilibrium, thus promoting relapse episodes and prolonged addictions. We also find that the initial microbiome composition is a key factor: a diverse microbiome enhances the ecosystems resilience, whereas lower microbiome diversity is more prone to reach dysbiosis, exacerbating addictions. This framework provides novel evolutionary and ecological perspectives on host-microbiome interactions and their implications for host behavior and health, while offering verifiable predictions with potential relevance to clinical treatments.",

    "abstract": "Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology, as such interactions shape the composition and functioning of microbial communities. However, predicting microbial interactions is challenging since they can vary considerably depending on species metabolic capabilities and environmental conditions. Here, we employ machine learning models to predict pairwise interactions between culturable bacteria based on their phylogeny, monoculture growth capabilities, and interactions with other species. We trained our models on one of the largest available pairwise interactions dataset containing over 7500 interactions between 20 species from 2 taxonomic groups that were cocultured in 40 different carbon environments. Our models accurately predicted both the sign (accuracy of 88%) and the strength of effects (R2 of 0.87) species had on each others growth. Encouragingly, predictions with comparable accuracy could be made even when not relying on information about interactions with other species, which are often hard to measure. However, species monoculture growth was essential to the model, as predictions based solely on species phylogeny and inferred metabolic capabilities were significantly less accurate. These results bring us a step closer to a predictive understanding of microbial communities, which is essential for engineering beneficial microbial consortia.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of most Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) genomes excludes repeat regions in tp0470 and the tp0433 gene, encoding the acidic repeat protein (arp). As a first step to understanding the evolution and function of these genes and the proteins they encode, we developed a protocol to nanopore sequence tp0470 and arp genes from 212 clinical samples collected from ten countries on six continents. Both tp0470 and arp repeat structures recapitulate the whole genome phylogeny, with subclade-specific patterns emerging. The number of tp0470 repeats is on average appears to be higher in Nichols-like clade strains than in SS14-like clade strains. Consistent with previous studies, we found that 14-repeat arp sequences predominate across both major clades, but the combination and order of repeat type varies among subclades, with many arp sequence variants limited to a single subclade. Although strains that were closely related by whole genome sequencing frequently had the same arp repeat length, this was not always the case. Structural modelling of TP0470 suggested that the eight residue repeats form an extended -helix, predicted to be periplasmic. Modeling of the ARP revealed a C-terminal sporulation-related repeat (SPOR) domain, predicted to bind denuded peptidoglycan, with repeat regions possibly incorporated into a highly charged {beta}- sheet. Outside of the repeats, all TP0470 and ARP amino acid sequences were identical. Together, our data, along with functional considerations, suggests that both TP0470 and ARP proteins may be involved in T. pallidum cell envelope remodeling and homeostasis, with their highly plastic repeat regions playing as-yet-undetermined roles.",

    "abstract": "E. coli are frequently isolated food-borne pathogens from meat, milk, and their products. Moreover, there has been a significant rise in the antimicrobial resistance patterns of E. coli O157:H7 to commonly used antibiotics. A cross-sectional study was conducted from October, 2019 to July, 2021 to estimate prevalence and identify associated factors of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 and to determine antibiotic resistance pattern of E. coli O157:H7 from foods of bovine origin in Dessie and Kombolcha towns. A total of 384 samples were collected. Systematic and simple random sampling techniques were employed for sampling carcasses and milking cows, respectively. E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were detected according to recommended bacteriological protocols. E. coli O157:H7 strains were evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility using agar disk diffusion method. Both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were applied to analyze the data. Overall prevalence rates of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were 54.7% and 6.5%, respectively. Highest prevalence rates of E. coli (79.6%) and E. coli O157:H7 (16.7%) were obtained from carcass swab and milk tank samples, respectively. Unlike E. coli O157:H7, a statistically significant difference in the E. coli prevalence (P<0.05) was observed among the different sample types. Multidrug resistance was observed among all isolates of E. coli O157:H7. All E. coli O157:H7 isolates (100.0%) were susceptible to Ampicillin, Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and Norfloxacin. On the contrary, all of the isolates (100%) were resistant to Penicillin G, Vancomycin, and Oxacillin. The current study indicated that different foods of bovine origin in the study area were unsafe for human consumption. Hence, good hygienic production methods should be employed to ensure the safety of foods of bovine origin.",

    "abstract": "The use of food-processing wastewaters to produce microbial biomass-derived single cell protein (SCP) is a sustainable way to meet the global food demand. Yet, despite the potential benefits of lower costs and greater resource recovery compared to pure cultures, bioconversion processes relying on microbial community-based approaches to SCP production have received scarce attention. Here, we evaluated SCP production from soybean-processing wastewaters under controlled reactor conditions using the existent microbial communities in these wastewaters. Six sequencing batch reactors of 4.5-L working volume were operated at 30 {square} for 34 d in cycles consisting of 3-h anaerobic and 9-h aerobic phases. Four reactors received no microbial inoculum and the remaining two were amended with a 1.5 L of mixed culture from a prior microbial community-based SCP production. Microbial characterization was done via 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Influent wastewater batches had variable chemical characteristics but a similar microbial composition. Reactors produced more SCP when fed with wastewaters of higher soluble total Kjeldahl nitrogen (sTKN) content and a lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (sCOD:sTKN). The biomass protein yield ranged from 0.24 to 3.13 g protein/g sTKN, with a maximum protein content of 50%. An average of 92% of sCOD and 73% of sTN removal was achieved. Distinct microbial communities were enriched in all six bioreactors after 34 d, where the prevailing genera included Azospirillum, Rhodobacter, Lactococcus, Novosphingobium, and Acidipropionibacterium. In contrast, the microbial community of influent wastewaters was dominated by Lactococcus and Weissella. We showed that constituents in soybean wastewater can be converted to SCP through microbial community-based growth processes and demonstrated the effect of variable influent wastewater composition on SCP production.",

    "abstract": "The Order Pelagibacterales (SAR11) is the most abundant group of heterotrophic bacterioplankton in global oceans and comprises multiple subclades with unique spatiotemporal distributions. Subclade IIIa is the primary SAR11 group in brackish waters and shares a common ancestor with the dominant freshwater IIIb (LD12) subclade. Despite its dominance in brackish environments, subclade IIIa lacks systematic genomic or ecological studies. Here, we combine closed genomes from new IIIa isolates, new IIIa MAGS from San Francisco Bay (SFB), and 466 high-quality publicly available SAR11 genomes for the most comprehensive pangenomic study of subclade IIIa to date. Subclade IIIa represents a taxonomic family containing three genera (denoted as subgroups IIIa.1, IIIa.2, and IIIa.3) that had distinct ecological distributions related to salinity. The expansion of taxon selection within subclade IIIa also established previously noted metabolic differentiation in subclade IIIa compared to other SAR11 subclades such as glycine/serine prototrophy, mosaic glyoxylate shunt presence, and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis potential. Our analysis further shows metabolic flexibility among subgroups within IIIa. Additionally, we find that subclade IIIa.3 bridges the marine and freshwater clades based on its potential for compatible solute transport, iron utilization, and bicarbonate management potential. Pure culture experimentation validated differential salinity ranges in IIIa.1 and IIIa.3 and provided the first IIIa cell size and volume data. This study is an important step forward for understanding the genomic, ecological, and physiological differentiation of subclade IIIa and the overall evolutionary history of SAR11.",

    "abstract": "Lactococcus garvieae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, but there are few reports regarding bovine mastitis. The recent prevalence of L. garvieae poses an increasing disease threat and global public health risk. A total of 39 L. garvieae isolates were obtained from 2899 bovine clinical mastitis milk samples in 6 provinces of China from 2017 to 2021. Five clonal complexes were determined from 32 MLST types of L. garvieae; ST46 was the predominant sequence type and 13 novel MLST types were identified. All isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol and clindamycin, but susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, and marbofloxacin. Based on genomic analyses, L. garvieae had 6310 genes, including 1015, 3641 and 1654 core, accessory and unique genes. All isolates had virulence genes coding for collagenase, fibronectin-binding protein, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase and NADH oxidase. Most isolates had lsaD and mdtA AMR genes. Based on COG results, the functions of defense, transcription and replication, recombination and repair were enhanced in unique genes, whereas functions of translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis were enhanced in core genes. The KEGG functional categories enriched in unique genes included human disease and membrane transport, whereas COG functional categories enriched in core genes included energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism and translation. No gene was significantly associated with host specificity. In addition, core genome SNPs analysis suggested potential host adaptation of some isolates in several sequence types. Therefore, this study characterized L. garvieae isolated from mastitis and assessed host adaptation of L. garvieae to various hosts.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study provides important insights on bovine mastitis key topic pathogen Lactococcus garvieae, which constitutes mastitis concerns. However, comprehensive genomic analyses of L. garvieae from dairy farms have not been performed. This study gives a detailed and comprehensive novel feature in L. garvieae, an important but poorly characterized bacterium, recovered in the past 5 years in 6 Chinese provinces. We documented diverse contributory genetic processes, including predominant sequence type ST46 and 13 novel MLST types. L. garvieae had 6310 genes, including 1015, 3641 and 1654 core, accessory and unique genes. All isolates had virulence genes coding for collagenase, fibronectin-binding protein, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase and NADH oxidase, and resistant to chloramphenicol and clindamycin.

    "abstract": "Mutations in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) have been linked to the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Extensive auto-regulation, cross-regulation, cooperation and competition mechanisms among RBPs are in place to ensure proper expression levels of common targets, often including other RBPs and their own transcripts. Moreover, several RBPs play a crucial role in the nervous system by localizing target RNAs in specific neuronal compartments. These include the RBPs FUS, FMRP and HuD. ALS mutations in a given RBP are predicted to produce a broad impact on such delicate equilibrium. Here we studied the effects of the severe FUS-P525L mutation on common FUS and FMRP targets. Expression profiling by digital color-coded molecular barcoding in cell bodies and neurites of human iPSC-derived motor neurons revealed altered levels of transcripts involved in cytoskeleton, neural projection and synapses. One of the common targets is HuD, which is upregulated because of the loss of FMRP binding to its 3UTR due to mutant FUS competition. Notably, many genes are commonly altered upon FUS mutation or HuD overexpression, suggesting that a substantial part of the effects of mutant FUS on the motor neuron transcriptome could be due to HuD gain-of-function. Among altered transcripts we also identified other common FUS and FMRP targets, namely MAP1B, PTEN, and AP2B1, that are upregulated upon loss of FMRP binding on their 3UTR in FUS-P525L motor neurons. This work demonstrates that the impairment of FMRP function by mutant FUS might alter the expression of several genes, including new possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ALS.",

    "abstract": "Gene repression by the polycomb pathway is essential for proper development in metazoans. Polycomb domains, characterized by trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K27me3), carry the memory of repression through successive cell divisions, and hence, need to be maintained to counter dilution during replication of parental H3K27me3 with unmodified nascent H3. Yet, how locus-specific H3K27me3 is maintained through replication is unknown. To understand H3K27me3 recovery post-replication, we first defined nucleation sites within each polycomb domain in mouse embryonic stem cells. Then, to track H3K27me3 dynamics in unperturbed cells during replication, we developed CUT&Flow, which maps H3K27me3 domains as a function of the cell cycle stage. Using CUT&Flow, we show that post-replication rejuvenation of polycomb domains occurs by nucleation and spreading, using the same nucleation sites used during de novo domain formation. By using subunit-specific inhibitors of the PRC2 complex, we find that PRC2 need not rely on pre-existing H3K27me3 to target nucleation sites post-replication. The timing of nucleation relative to the cell cycle reflects the combination of replication timing and H3K27me3 deposition kinetics derived from de novo domain formation. Thus, competition between H3K27me3 deposition and nucleosome turnover drives both de novo domain formation and maintenance during every cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionFibrosis is a key feature of many chronic myopathic disorders, such as in the muscle-wasting condition, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Fibrosis disrupts skeletal muscle architecture, limits muscle function, impairs regeneration and might reduce efficacy of therapeutic interventions: quantifying muscle fibrosis is thus of key value in monitoring disease progression (or response to treatment) in both pre-clinical and clinical settings. Fibrosis can be visualised histologically via staining with picrosirius red, but its quantification can be time consuming and subject to investigator bias: a rapid, reliable and user-friendly means of quantifying muscle fibrosis in histological images is currently lacking.\n\nMethodsWe investigated whether the Hue/Saturation/Brightness (HSB) colour-space could be used to quantify connective tissue content in picrosirius red (PSR)-stained muscle sections, using multiple healthy and dystrophic muscles, sampled from two animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (the mdx mouse and the DE50-MD dog), at different ages.\n\nResultsHSB-based analysis allows muscle fibres, connective tissue and slide background to be readily distinguished in PSR images using only a minimal set of parameters, and correctly identifies fibrotic accumulation under conditions where progressive fibrosis is expected. We have developed an imageJ macro that allows semi-automated high-throughput measurement of fibrotic accumulation, and then further extended our method to demonstrate its validity with another histological stain (acid phosphatase) to quantify lysosomal activity.\n\nConclusionsHistological analysis of muscle pathology is challenging and time consuming, especially with large collections of images: our methods permit fibrotic accumulation to be quantified in such collections rapidly and easily in open-source software, with minimal hardware requirements, and the underlying methodology can be readily extended to other colorimetric histopathological stains.",

    "abstract": "Targeted quantification of proteins is a standard methodology with broad utility, but targeted quantification of glycoproteins has not reached its full potential. The lack of optimized workflows and isotopically labeled standards limits the acceptance of glycoproteomics quantification. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and streamlined chemoenzymatic synthesis of a library of isotopically labeled glycopeptides of IgG1 which we use for quantification in an energy optimized LC-MS/MS-PRM workflow. Incorporation of the stable isotope labeled N-acetylglucosamine enables an efficient monitoring of all major fragment ions of the glycopeptides generated under the soft collision induced dissociation (CID) conditions which reduces the CVs of the quantification to 0.7-2.8%. Our results document, for the first time, that the workflow using a combination of stable isotope labeled standards with intra-scan normalization enables quantification of the glycopeptides by an electron transfer dissociation (ETD) workflow as well as the CID workflow with the highest sensitivity compared to traditional workflows., This was exemplified by a rapid quantification (13-minute) of IgG1 Fc glycoforms from COVID-19 patients.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/501850v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b5b18corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b87b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eba7ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15da596_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mapping the subcellular organization of proteins is crucial for understanding their biological functions. Herein, we report a reactive oxygen species induced protein labeling and identification (RinID) method for profiling subcellular proteome in the context of living cells. Our method capitalizes on a genetically encoded photocatalyst, miniSOG, to locally generate singlet oxygen that reacts with proximal proteins. Labeled proteins are conjugated in situ with an exogenously supplied nucleophilic probe, which serves as a functional handle for subsequent affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry-based protein identification. From a panel of nucleophilic compounds, we identify biotin-conjugated aniline and propargyl amine as highly reactive probes. As a demonstration of the spatial specificity and depth of coverage in mammalian cells, we apply RinID in the mitochondrial matrix, capturing 394 mitochondrial proteins with 97% specificity. We further demonstrate the broad applicability of RinID in various subcellular compartments, including the nucleus and the endoplasmic reticulum.",

    "abstract": "Inflammasomes are filamentous signaling platforms essential for host defense against various intracellular calamities such as pathogen invasion and genotoxic stresses. However, dysregulated inflammasomes cause an array of human diseases including autoinflammatory disorders and cancer. It was recently identified that endogenous pyrin-only-proteins (POPs) regulate inflammasomes by directly inhibiting their filament assembly. Here, by combining Rosetta in silico, in vitro, and in cellulo methods, we investigate the target specificity and inhibition mechanisms of POPs. In contrast to a previous report, we find that POP1 is a poor inhibitor of the central inflammasome adaptor ASC. Instead, POP1 inhibits the assembly of upstream receptor PYD filaments such as those of AIM2, IFI16, NLRP3, and NLRP6. Moreover, not only does POP2 directly suppress the nucleation of ASC, but it can also inhibit the elongation of receptor filaments. In addition to inhibiting the elongation of AIM2 and NLRP6 filaments, POP3 potently suppresses the nucleation of ASC. Our Rosetta analyses and biochemical experiments consistently suggest that a combination of favorable and unfavorable interactions between POPs and PYDs is necessary for effective recognition and inhibition. Together, we reveal the intrinsic target redundancy of POPs and their inhibitory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum requires a two-host system, moving between Anopheles mosquito and humans, to complete its life cycle. To overcome such dynamic growth conditions its histones undergo various post-translational modifications to up-regulate and down-regulate certain genes required for invasion and replication. The P. falciparum genome encodes six bromodomaincontaining proteins, of which Bromodomain Protein 1 (PfBDP1) has been shown to interact with acetylated lysine modifications on histone H3 to regulate the expression of invasion-related genes. Here, we investigated the ability of the PfBDP1 bromodomain to interact with acetyllsyine modifications on additional core and variant histones. A crystal structure of the PfBDP1 bromodomain (PfBDP1-BRD) reveals it contains the conserved bromodomain fold, but our comparative analysis between the PfBDP1-BRD and the 8 human bromodomain families indicates it has a unique binding mechanism. Solution NMR spectroscopy and ITC binding assays carried out with acetylated histone ligands demonstrate that it preferentially recognizes tetra-acetylated histone H4, and we detected weaker interactions with multi-acetylated H2A.Z in addition to the previously reported interactions with acetylated histone H3. Our findings indicate PfBDP1 may play additional roles in the P. falciparum life cycle, and the distinctive features of its bromodomain binding pocket could be leveraged for the development of new therapeutic agents to help overcome the continuously evolving resistance of P. falciparum against currently available drugs.",

Such consortia are expected to target societal problems, be international, to engage in trans- or interdisciplinary research, to involve stakeholders and have specific plans for implementation. For example, Horizon Europe focuses on five missions that are being targeted by such type of consortia. This, however, does not seem to be the type of funding that active researchers appreciate the most: a recent letter signed by over 24.000 researchers clearly shows their preference for ERC grants. What are the underlying reasons for this difference? Here, we share insights on how natural science and medical researchers experience the impact of these funding schemes using interviews. Our findings highlight that the two different types of funding schemes have a different performative effect on research, and that ERC-type funding aligns most with how scientists think research should best be conducted.",

    "abstract": "The site-specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in mammalian cells is an emergent technology with much potential. For each different ncAA to be incorporated, this technology requires a distinct orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pair that recognizes a distinct nonsense codon. The aaRS/tRNA pairs currently available for ncAA mutagenesis in eukaryotes are all traditionally used to decode the TAG nonsense codon. Unfortunately, these pairs suppress the other two nonsense codons, TGA or TAA, at a significantly lower level, compromising the scope of multi-ncAA mutagenesis. Here we report that the bacteria-derived tryptophanyl (EcTrp) pair is an excellent TGA-suppressor in mammalian cells. Additionally, we show that this pair does not cross-react with any of the three previously established aaRS/tRNA pairs. Consequently, the TGA-suppressing EcTrp pair can be combined with TAG-suppressing pyrrolysyl (archaeal), tyrosyl (bacterial), or leucyl (bacterial) pairs to develop three new routes for dual-ncAA incorporation in mammalian cells. We show that all three platforms enable site-specific incorporation of two distinct ncAAs into proteins - including a full-length humanized antibody - with excellent fidelity and good efficiency. Finally, we combined the EcTrp pair with the bacterial Tyr pair and the archaeal pyrrolysyl pair to site-specifically incorporate different combinations of three distinct ncAAs into a reporter protein in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing recognition of the utility of models of the spatial dynamics of viral spread within tissues. Multicellular models, where cells are represented as discrete regions of space coupled to a virus density surface, are a popular approach to capture these dynamics. Conventionally, such models are simulated by discretising the viral surface and depending on the rate of viral diffusion and other considerations, a finer or coarser discretisation may be used. The impact that this choice may have on the behaviour of the system has not been studied. Here we demonstrate that, if rates of viral diffusion are small, then the choice of spatial discretisation of the viral surface can have quantitative and even qualitative influence on model outputs. We investigate in detail the mechanisms driving these phenomena and discuss the constraints on the design and implementation of multicellular viral dynamics models for different parameter configurations.\n\nAuthor summaryHere we analyse the impact that the resolution of spatial discretisation has on the behaviour of spatial models of viral dynamics. We show that the extent of this influence depends on the size of the diffusion coefficient, and that, if the diffusion coefficient is sufficiently small - for example, small enough to describe tight plaque-forming dynamics - the choice of discretisation of the viral surface relative to the cell grid can appreciably change key predictions of the model. We show that the resolution of spatial discretisation modulates the timescale of infection, and identify the mechanisms by which this occurs. This work provides theory to inform the development of multicellular models of viral dynamics, which is in short supply in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Highly self-reactive T cells are censored from the repertoire by both central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms upon receipt of high-affinity TCR signals. Clonal deletion is considered a major driver of central tolerance; however, other mechanisms such as induction of regulatory T cells and functional impairment have been described. An understanding of the interplay between these different central tolerance mechanisms is still lacking. We previously showed that impaired clonal deletion to a model tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) did not compromise tolerance. In this study, we determined that murine T cells that failed clonal deletion were rendered functionally impaired in the thymus. PD-1 was induced in the thymus and was required to establish cell-intrinsic tolerance to TRA in CD8+ thymocytes independently of clonal deletion. PD-1 signaling in developing thymocytes was sufficient for tolerance induction, however in some cases the absence of PD-L1-mediated signaling in the periphery resulted in broken tolerance at late time points. Finally, we showed that chronic exposure to high affinity antigen supported the long-term maintenance of tolerance. Taken together, our study identifies a critical role for PD-1 in establishing central tolerance in autoreactive T cells that escape clonal deletion. It also sheds light on potential mechanisms of action of anti-PD-1 pathway immune checkpoint blockade and the development of immune-related adverse events.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/502412v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e3d786org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15aaaaaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17ab803org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c6e23b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Municipal wastewater provides a representative sample of human fecal waste across a catchment area and contains a wide diversity of microbes. Sequencing wastewater samples provides information about human-associated and medically-important microbial populations, and may be useful to assay disease prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\n\nHere, we present a study in which we used untargeted metatranscriptomic sequencing on RNA extracted from 275 sewage influent samples obtained from eight wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California between August 2020 - August 2021. We characterized bacterial and viral transcripts, assessed metabolic pathway activity, and identified over 2,000 AMR genes/variants across all samples. Because we did not deplete ribosomal RNA, we have a unique window into AMR carried as ribosomal mutants. We show that AMR diversity varied between WTPs and that the relative abundance of many individual AMR genes/variants increased over time and may be connected to antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, we detected transcripts mapping to human pathogenic bacteria and viruses suggesting RNA sequencing is a powerful tool for wastewater-based epidemiology and that there are geographical signatures to microbial transcription. We captured the transcription of gene pathways common to bacterial cell processes, including central carbon metabolism, nucleotide synthesis/salvage, and amino acid biosynthesis. We also posit that due to the ubiquity of many viruses and bacteria in wastewater, new biological targets for microbial water quality assessment can be developed.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, our study provides the most complete longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis of a large populations wastewater to date and demonstrates our ability to monitor the presence and activity of microbes in complex samples. By sequencing RNA, we can track the relative abundance of expressed AMR genes/variants and metabolic pathways, increasing our understanding of AMR activity across large human populations and sewer sheds.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome provides vital functions for mammalian hosts, yet research on the variability and function of the microbiome across adult lifespans and multiple generations is limited in large mammalian carnivores. Here we use 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing to profile the taxonomic composition, genomic diversity, and metabolic function of the gut microbiome of 12 wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) residing in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya over a 23-year period spanning three generations. We determined the extent to which host factors predict variation in the gut microbiome and identify the core microbes present in the guts of hyenas. We also investigate novel genomic diversity in the mammalian gut by reporting the first metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for hyenas. We found that gut microbiome taxonomic composition was highly variable across the two decades of sampling, but despite this, a core set of 14 bacterial genera and 19 amplicon sequence variants were identified. The strongest predictors of microbiome alpha and beta-diversity were host identity and age, suggesting that hyenas possess individualized microbiomes, and that these may change with age during adulthood. Gut microbiome functional profiles were also individual-specific, and were moderately correlated with antelope prey abundance, indicating that the functions of the gut microbiome vary with host diet. We recovered 149 high-quality MAGs from the hyena gut, spanning 25 bacterial orders and 51 genera. Some MAGs were classified as taxa previously reported for other carnivores, but many were novel and lacked species level matches to genomes in existing reference databases.\n\nImportanceThere is a gap in knowledge regarding the genomic diversity and variation of the gut microbiome across a hosts lifespan and across multiple generations of hosts in wild mammals. Using two types of sequencing approaches, we demonstrate that although gut microbiomes are individualized and temporally variable among hyenas, they correlate similarly to large-scale changes in their hosts ecological environment. We also recovered 149 high-quality MAGs from the hyena gut, greatly expanding the microbial genome repertoire known for hyenas, carnivores and wild mammals in general. Some MAGs came from genera abundant in the gastrointestinal tracts of canid species and other carnivores but over 80% of MAGs were novel and from species previously not represented in genome databases. Collectively, our novel body of work illustrates the importance of surveying the gut microbiome of non-model wild hosts, using multiple sequencing methods and computational approaches, and at distinct scales of analysis.",

We applied BacDrop to study Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates and to elucidate their heterogeneous responses to antibiotic stress. In an unperturbed population presumed to be homogenous, we find within- population heterogeneity largely driven by the expression of mobile genetic elements that promote the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

    "abstract": "Brugia malayi, a parasitic roundworm of humans, is colonized by the obligate intracellular bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis. The symbiosis between this nematode and bacterium is essential for nematode reproduction and long-term survival in a human host. Therefore, identifying molecular mechanisms required by Wolbachia to persist in and colonize B. malayi tissues will provide new essential information regarding the basic biology of this endosymbiosis. Wolbachia utilize a Type IV secretion system to translocate so-called \"effector\" proteins into the cytosol of B. malayi cells to promote colonization of the eukaryotic host. However, the characterization of these Wolbachia secreted proteins (wSPs) has remained elusive due to the genetic intractability of both organisms. Strikingly, expression of the wSP, Wbm0076, in the surrogate eukaryotic cell model, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulted in the disruption of the yeast actin cytoskeleton and inhibition of endocytosis. Genetic analyses show that Wbm0076 is a member of the family of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WAS[p]), a well-conserved eukaryotic protein family required for the organization of actin skeletal structures. Thus, Wbm0076 likely plays a central role in the active cell-to-cell movement of Wolbachia throughout B. malayi tissues during nematode development. As most Wolbachia isolates sequenced to date encode at least partial orthologs of Wbm0076, we find it likely that the ability of Wolbachia to directly manipulate host actin dynamics is an essential requirement of all Wolbachia endosymbioses, independent of host cell species.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYFilarial nematodes of the family Onchocercidae cause several debilitating human diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis; more than 50 million people are infected by these arthropod-borne roundworms in mostly tropical and sub-tropical regions. Many of these nematodes, including Brugia malayi, are obligately colonized by an intracellular bacterium of the genus Wolbachia, which is absolutely required for the proper development and reproduction of these worms in a mammalian host. Clearance of Wolbachia from these nematodes leads to a loss of both worm viability and its ability to cause disease in humans. Efforts to understand the molecular interactions required to maintain this important bacterium:nematode endosymbiosis, however, have been hampered due to the genetic intractability of these organisms. In this work, we utilize yeast as a surrogate eukaryotic cell to show that a candidate secreted effector protein from Wolbachia, Wbm0076, disrupts actin dynamics and endocytosis. We also observe interactions of Wbm0076 with a highly-conserved eukaryotic actin regulatory protein. As some intracellular bacteria manipulate host actin dynamics to promote mobility within or into host cells, our study provides evidence of an important Wolbachia protein activity that may be essential for its proper localization during the development of B. malayi.",

    "abstract": "Newly Born proteins, devoid of detectable homology to any other proteins, known as orphan proteins, occur in a single species or within a taxonomically restricted gene family. They are generated by expression of novel Open Reading Frames, and appear throughout evolution. We were curious if the three recently developed programs for predicting protein structures, viz., AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold, and ESMFold, might be of value for comparison of such  Newly Born proteins to random polypeptides with amino acid content similar to that of native proteins, which have been called  Never Born proteins. The programs were used to compare the structures of two sets of  Never Born proteins that had been expressed - Group 1, which had been shown experimentally to possess substantial secondary structure, and Group 3, which had been shown to be intrinsically disordered. Overall, the models generated were scored as being of low quality but revealed some general principles. Specifically, all four members of Group 1 were predicted to be compact by all three algorithms. The members of Group 3 were predicted to be very extended, as would be expected for intrinsically disordered proteins. The three programs were then used to predict the structures of three orphan proteins whose crystal structures had been solved, two of which display novel folds. Finally, they were used to predict the structures of seven orphan proteins with well-identified biological functions, whose 3D structures are not known. Two proteins, which were predicted to be disordered based on their sequences, are predicted by all three structure algorithms to be extended structures. The other five were predicted to be compact structures with two exceptions in the case of AlphaFold2. All three prediction algorithms make remarkably similar and high-quality predictions for one large protein, HCO_11565, from a nematode. It is conjectured that this is due to many homologs in the taxonomically restricted family of which it is a member and to the fact that the Dali server revealed several non-related proteins with similar folds. Overall, orphan and taxonomically restricted proteins are often predicted to have compact 3D structures, sometimes with a novel fold that is a consequence of their novel sequences, which are associated with the appearance of new biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic (Tg) nonhuman primates (NHPs) are excellent potential models due to their physiological similarities with humans. In NHPs, the lentiviral vector is the only available transgenesis method, but transgene sizes are limited. The piggyBac (PB) transposon system is a DNA element sandwiched between two terminal inverted repeats (TRs) that allows transposases to introduce larger genes than lentiviral vectors. However, embryos with integrated transgenes are difficult to distinguish using this system. To address this issue, we placed the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) gene inside the TRs and the humanized kusabira orange 1 (hKO1) fluorescent protein gene with the proteolysis-promoting sequence d2PEST outside the TRs to create an indicator for gene integration using fluorescent protein expression. In HEK293T cells, hKO1 and EGFP co-expression after transfection gradually changed to decay of hKO1 expression and enhancement of EGFP expression by transposase within five days. In mouse and marmoset embryos, hKO1 expression was attenuated, while only EGFP expression was observed at the blastocyst stage. All offspring obtained through embryo transfer of EGFP-expressing embryos were Tg; thus, we established a new PB system capable of determining Tg embryos and successfully produced Tg marmosets, for the first time, in NHPs.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of mitochondrial precursor proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria in a post-translational reaction. The early processes associated with mitochondrial protein targeting remain poorly understood. Here we show that in bakers yeast, the cytosol has the capacity to transiently store matrix-destined precursors in dedicated deposits which we named MitoStores. MitoStores are strongly enhanced when protein import into mitochondria is competitively inhibited by a clogging of mitochondrial import sites, but also formed under physiological conditions when cells grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. MitoStores are enriched for a specific subset of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins, in particular those containing N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences. MitoStore formation is controlled by the heat shock proteins Hsp42 and Hsp104, potentially to suppress the toxic potential of accumulating mitochondrial precursor proteins. Thus, the cytosolic protein quality control system plays an active role during early stages in mitochondrial protein targeting by the coordinated and localized sequestration of mitochondrial precursor proteins.\n\nSummaryThe yeast cytosol can deposit precursors of mitochondrial proteins in specific granules called MitoStores. MitoStores are controlled by the cytosolic chaperone system, in particular by Hsp42 and Hsp104. MitoStore formation suppresses the toxicity arising from non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins.",

    "abstract": "Using latent variables in gene expression data can help correct spurious correlations due to unobserved confounders and increase statistical power for expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) detection. Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals (PEER) is a widely used statistical method that has been developed to remove unwanted variation and improve eQTL discovery power in bulk RNA-seq analysis. However, its performance has not been largely evaluated in single-cell eQTL data analysis, where it is becoming a commonly used technique. Potential challenges arise due to the structure of single-cell data, including sparsity, skewness, and mean-variance relationship. Here, we show by a series of analyses that this method requires additional quality control and data transformation steps on the pseudo-bulk matrix to obtain valid PEER factors. By using a population-scale single-cell cohort (OneK1K, N = 982), we found that generating PEER factors without further QC or transformation on the pseudo-bulk matrix could result in inferred factors that are highly correlated (Pearsons correlation r = 0.626[~]0.997). Similar spurious correlations were also found in PEER factors inferred from an independent dataset (induced pluripotent stem cells, N = 31). Optimization of the strategy for generating PEER factors and incorporating the improved PEER factors in the eQTL association model can identify 9.0[~]23.1% more eQTLs or 1.7%[~]13.3% more eGenes. Sensitivity analysis showed that the pattern of change between the number of eGenes detected and PEER factors fitted varied significantly for different cell types. In addition, using highly variable genes (e.g., top 2000) to generate PEER factors could achieve similar eGenes discovery power as using all genes but save considerable computational resources ([~]6.2-fold faster). We provide diagnostic guidelines to improve the robustness and avoid potential pitfalls when generating PEER factors for single-cell eQTL association analyses.",

It is less clear how proteins behave before condensates form or at concentrations at which condensation does not occur in cells. Here, we use a combination of fluorescence microscopy and photobleaching analysis to quantify phase separation of negative elongation factor (NELF) in living and stressed cells. We use the recently reported system of stress-induced condensation of NELF in human nuclei as a model to study the behaviour of proteins before condensation. We find that pre-condensate heterogeneous clusters both grow and shrink and are not freely diffusing. Unexpectedly, we also find such small dynamic clusters in unstressed cells in which condensates do not form. We provide a categorisation of small and large clusters based on their dynamics and their response to p38 kinase inhibition. Overall, our data are best explained as non-classical nucleation with a flat free-energy landscape for clusters of a range of sizes and an inhibition of condensation.",

By combining single molecule magnetic tweezer experiments, Molecular Dynamics simulations, actin bundling assays, and adhesion assembly experiments in live cells, we here discover a two-ways allosteric network within vinculin as a regulator of the talin-vinculin interaction. We directly observe a maturation process of vinculin upon talin binding which reinforces the binding to talin at a rate of 0.03 s-1. This allosteric transition can compete with force-induced dissociation of vinculin from talin only at 7-10 pN. Mimicking the allosteric activation by mutation yields a vinculin molecule that bundles actin and localizes to focal adhesions in a force-independent manner. Hence, the allosteric switch confines talin-vinculin interactions and focal adhesion build-up to intermediate force levels. The  allosteric vinculin mutant is a valuable molecular tool to further dissect the mechanical and biochemical signalling circuits at focal adhesions and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "In the research integrity literature, funding enters in two different ways: as elevating questionable research practices due to perverse incentives, and as being a potential player to incentivize researchers to behave well. Other recent studies have emphasized the importance of the latter, asking funding experts. Here, I explored how the impact of competitive research funding on science is being perceived by active researchers. More specifically, I have conducted a series of group sessions with researchers in two different countries with a different degree of competition for funding, in three disciplinary fields (medical sciences, natural sciences and the humanities), and with researchers in two different career stages (permanent versus temporary employment). Researchers across all groups experienced that competition for funding shapes science, with many unintended questionable side effects. Intriguingly, these questionable effects had little to do with the type of questionable research practices (QRPs) typically being presented in the research integrity literature. While the notion of QRPs focuses on publications and assumes that there would essentially be a correct way to do the science, researchers worried about the shaping of science via funding. According to my session participants, rather than ending up as really being wrong, this shaping could result in predictable, fashionable, short-sighted, and overpromising science. And still, this was seen as highly problematic: scientists experienced that the  projectification of science makes it more and more difficult to do any science of real importance: plunging into the unknown or addressing big issues that would need a long-term horizon to mature.",

Based on this, I developed a simple method to construct long DNA of about 40 - 50 kb from multiple PCR fragments using the bacteriophage in vitro packaging system. This method, named iPac (in vitro Packaging-assisted DNA assembly), allowed accurate and rapid construction of large plasmids and phage genomes.

Often, the differentiation of cells is governed by morphogens and intercellular signaling molecules that guide the fate of each cell, frequently using toggle-like regulatory components. Synthetic biologists have long sought to recapitulate patterned differentiation with engineered cellular communities and various methods for differentiating bacteria have been invented. Here, we couple a synthetic co-repressive toggle switch with intercellular signaling pathways to create a \"quorum-sensing toggle.\" We show that this circuit not only exhibits population-wide bistability in a well-mixed liquid environment, but also generates patterns of differentiation in colonies grown on agar containing an externally supplied morphogen. If coupled to other metabolic processes, circuits such as the one described here would allow for the engineering of spatially patterned, differentiated bacteria for use in biomaterials and bioelectronics.",

    "abstract": "The design of biomolecular feedback controllers has been identified as an important goal across a broad range of biological applications spanning synthetic biology, cell therapy, metabolic engineering, etc. This originates from the need to regulate various cellular processes in a robust and timely fashion. Recently, antithetic integral controllers found their way into synthetic biology due to the Robust Perfect Adaptation (RPA) property they endow -- the biological analogue of robust steady-state tracking. The antithetic integral motif hinges on a sequestration reaction between two molecules that annihilates their function. Here, we demonstrate that the complex resulting from the nonlinear sequestration reaction can be leveraged as an inhibitor to enhance the dynamic performance while maintaining the RPA property. We establish that this additional inhibition by the sequestration complex gives rise to a filtered Proportional-Integral (PI) controller thus offering more flexibility in shaping the dynamic response and reducing cell-to-cell variability. Furthermore, we explore the effect of various biological inhibitory mechanisms on the overall performance. The various analyses in the paper are carried out using analytical tools and are supported by numerical simulations. Finally, an experimental validation is performed using the cyberloop -- a hybrid platform where the controller is implemented in silico to control a genetic circuit in vivo.",

The LIR motif is present in the flexible region of ATG3 and adopts an uncommon {beta}-sheet structure binding to the backside of LC3. We show that the {beta}-sheet conformation is crucial for its interaction with LC3. In cellulo studies provide evidence that LIRATG3 is required for LC3 lipidation and ATG3[~]LC3 thioester formation.

    "abstract": "DNA replication introduces thousands of RNA primers into the lagging strand that need to be removed for replication to be completed. In Escherichia coli when the replicative DNA polymerase Pol III terminates at a previously synthesized RNA primer, DNA Pol I takes over and continues DNA synthesis while displacing the downstream RNA primer. The displaced primer is subsequently excised by an endonuclease, followed by the sealing of the nick by a DNA ligase. Yet how the sequential actions of Pol III, Pol I, endonuclease and ligase are coordinated is poorly defined. Here we show that each enzymatic activity prepares the DNA substrate for the next activity, creating an efficient four-point molecular handover. The cryo-EM structure of Pol I bound to a DNA substrate with both an upstream and downstream primer reveals how it displaces the primer in a manner analogous to the monomeric helicases. Moreover, we find that in addition to its flap-directed nuclease activity, the endonuclease domain of Pol I also specifically cuts at the RNA/DNA junction, thus marking the end of the RNA primer and creating an 5 end that is a suitable substrate for the ligase activity of LigA once all RNA has been removed.",
