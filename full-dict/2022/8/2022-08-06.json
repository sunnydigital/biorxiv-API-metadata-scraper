    "abstract": "Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, due to its tendency to metastasize early. Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), also known as CCCTC binding factor-Like (CTCFL), is a transcription regulator that becomes ectopically expressed in melanoma. We recently showed that BORIS contributes to melanoma phenotype switching by altering the gene expression program of proliferative melanoma cells in favor of a more invasive phenotype. However, how BORIS alters the transcriptome remains unclear. Here, ATAC-seq was used to study BORIS-mediated chromatin accessibility alterations in proliferative melanoma cells. Genes that gained promoter accessibility following ectopic BORIS expression, were enriched for melanoma-specific invasive genes as well as invasion-associated biological processes, while promoters of genes associated with proliferation show reduce accessibility. Integration of ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq data demonstrates that increased chromatin accessibility is associated with transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in tumor progression processes, and the aberrant activation of oncogenic transcription factors, while reduced chromatin accessibility and downregulated genes, were associated with repressed activity of tumor suppressors. Together, these findings indicate that BORIS mediates transcriptional reprogramming in melanoma cells by altering chromatin accessibility and gene expression, shifting the cellular transcription landscape of proliferative melanoma cells towards a pro-invasive genetic signature.\n\nSignificanceWe recently reported that BORIS contributes to melanoma phenotype switching by altering the transcriptional landscape of melanoma cells from a proliferative to an invasive state. In this study, using ATAC-Seq, we demonstrate that ectopic BORIS expression in proliferative melanoma cells leads to increased chromatin accessibility at promoters of upregulated invasion-associated genes. Importantly, by integrating the ATAC-Seq data with RNA-Seq data, we were able to identify key cancer-associated transcription factors that become aberrantly activated or repressed following ectopic BORIS expression. Taken together, this study sheds light on the mechanisms by which BORIS mediates phenotype switching in melanoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Unlike globular proteins, mutational effects on the function of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are not well-studied. Deep Mutational Scanning of a yeast surface displayed mutant library yields insights into sequence-function relationships in the CcdA IDP. The approach enables facile prediction of interface residues and local structural signatures of the bound conformation. In contrast to previous titration-based approaches which use a number of ligand concentrations, we show that use of a single rationally chosen ligand concentration can provide quantitative estimates of relative binding constants for large numbers of protein variants. This is because the extended interface of IDP ensures that energetic effects of point mutations are spread over a much smaller range than for globular proteins. Our data also provides insights into the much-debated role of helicity and disorder in partner binding of IDPs. Based on this exhaustive mutational sensitivity dataset, a model was developed to predict mutational effects on binding affinity of IDPs that form alpha-helical structures upon binding.",

    "abstract": "Adequate pain management is essential for ethical and scientific reasons in animal experiments and should completely cover the period of expected pain without the need for frequent re-application. However, current depot formulations of Buprenorphine are only available in the USA and have limited duration of action. Recently, a new microparticulate Buprenorphine formulation (BUP-Depot) for sustained release has been developed as an alternative product within Europe. Pharmacokinetics indicate a potential effectiveness for about 72h. Here, we investigated whether the administration of the BUP-Depot ensures continuous and sufficient analgesia in two mouse femoral fracture models and could therefore serve as a potent alternative to the application of Tramadol via drinking water. Both protocols were examined for analgesic effectiveness, side effects on experimental readout, and effects on fracture healing outcomes in male and female C57BL/6N mice. The BUP-Depot provided effective analgesia for 72h, comparable to the effectiveness of Tramadol in drinking water. Fracture healing outcome was not different between analgesic regimes. The availability of a Buprenorphine depot formulation for laboratory animals in Europe would be a beneficial addition for extended pain relief in mice, thereby increasing animal welfare.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute proteins play a central role in RNA silencing by forming protein-small RNA complexes responsible for the silencing process. While most Argonaute proteins have a short N-terminal region, Argonaute2 in Drosophila melanogaster (DmAgo2) harbors a long and unique N-terminal region. Previous in vitro biochemical studies have shown that the loss of this region does not impair the RNA silencing activity of the complex. However, an N-terminal mutant of Drosophila melanogaster has demonstrated abnormal RNA silencing activity. To explore the causes of this discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo studies, we investigated the biophysical properties of the region. Because the N-terminal region is highly rich in glutamine and glycine residues, which is a well-known property for prion-like domains (PrLD), the possibility of the N-terminal region functioning as a PrLD was tested. Our biochemical assays demonstrated that the N-terminal region can form aggregates that are not dissociated even in the presence of SDS. Also, the aggregates enhanced the fluorescence intensity of thioflavin-T, an amyloid detection reagent. The kinetics of the aggregation followed that of typical amyloid formation exhibiting the self-propagating activity. Further, we directly visualized the aggregation process of the N-terminal region under fluorescence microscopy and found that the aggregations took fractal or fibril shapes. Together, the results indicate that the N-terminal region is a PrLD. Many other PrLDs have been reported to modulate the function of proteins through their aggregation. Therefore, our results raise the possibility that aggregation of the N-terminal region regulates the RNA silencing activity of DmAgo2.",

    "abstract": "Representations of visual and semantic information can overlap in human visual cortex, with the same neural populations exhibiting sensitivity to low-level features (orientation, spatial frequency, retinotopic position), and high-level semantic categories (faces, scenes). It has been hypothesized that this relationship between low-level visual and high-level category neural selectivity reflects natural scene statistics, such that neurons in a given category-selective region are tuned for low-level features or spatial positions that are diagnostic of the regions preferred category. To address the generality of this \"natural scene statistics\" hypothesis, as well as how well it can account for responses to complex naturalistic images across visual cortex, we performed two complementary analyses. First, across a large set of rich natural scene images, we demonstrated reliable associations between low-level (Gabor) features and high-level semantic dimensions (indoor-outdoor, animacy, real-world size), with these relationships varying spatially across the visual field. Second, we used a large-scale fMRI dataset (the Natural Scenes Dataset) and a voxelwise forward encoding model to estimate the feature and spatial selectivity of neural populations throughout visual cortex. We found that voxels in category-selective visual regions exhibit systematic biases in their feature and spatial selectivity which are consistent with their hypothesized roles in category processing. We further showed that these low-level tuning biases are largely independent of viewed image category. Together, our results are consistent with a framework in which low-level feature selectivity contributes to the computation of high-level semantic category information in the brain.",

    "abstract": "There is a strong male bias in the prevalence of many neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. However, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain elusive. Infection during the perinatal period is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorder development. Here, we used a mouse model of early-life immune activation that reliably induces deficits in social behaviors only in males. We demonstrate that male-biased alterations in social behavior are dependent upon microglial immune signaling and are coupled to alterations in mitochondrial morphology, gene expression, and function specifically within microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain. Additionally, we show that this behavioral and microglial mitochondrial vulnerability to early-life immune activation is programmed by the male-typical perinatal gonadal hormone surge. These findings demonstrate that social behavior in males over the lifespan are regulated by microglia-specific mechanisms that are shaped by events that occur in early development.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to decode and synthesize various aspects of acoustic speech directly from intracranial measurements of electrophysiological brain activity. In order to continue progressing toward the development of a practical speech neuroprosthesis for the individuals with speech impairments, better understanding and modeling of imagined speech processes are required. The present study uses intracranial brain recordings from participants that performed a speaking task with trials consisting of overt, mouthed, and imagined speech, representing various degrees of decreasing behavioral output. Speech activity detection models are constructed using spatial, spectral, and temporal brain activity features, and the features and model performances are characterized and compared across the three degrees of behavioral output. The results indicate there is a hierarchy in which the relevant channels for the lower behavioral output modes form nested subsets of the relevant channels from the higher behavioral output modes. This provides important insights for the elusive goal of developing more effective imagined speech decoding models with respect to the better-established overt speech decoding counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Cortical reorganization and its potential pathological significance are being increasingly studied in musculoskeletal disorders such as chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. However, detailed sensory-topographic maps of the human back are lacking, and a baseline characterization of such representations, reflecting the somatosensory organization of the healthy back, is needed before exploring potential sensory map reorganization. To this end, a novel pneumatic vibrotactile stimulation method was used to stimulate paraspinal sensory afferents, while studying their cortical representations in unprecedented detail. In 41 young healthy participants, vibrotactile stimulations at 20 Hz and 80 Hz were applied bilaterally at nine locations along the thoracolumbar axis while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed. Model-based whole-brain searchlight representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to investigate the organizational structure of brain activity patterns evoked by thoracolumbar sensory inputs. A model based on segmental distances best explained the similarity structure of brain activity patterns that were located in different areas of sensorimotor cortices, including the primary somatosensory and motor cortices and parts of the superior parietal cortex, suggesting that these brain areas process sensory input from the back in a \"dermatomal\" manner. The current findings provide a sound basis for testing the \"cortical map reorganization theory\" and its pathological relevance in CLBP.",

    "abstract": "Plastids, similarly to mitochondria, are organelles of endosymbiotic origin, which retained their vestigial genomes (ptDNA). Their unique architecture, commonly referred to as the quadripartite (four-part) structure, is considered to be strictly conserved; however, the bulk of our knowledge on their variability and evolutionary transformations comes from studies of the primary plastids of green algae and land plants. To broaden our perspective, we obtained seven new ptDNA sequences from freshwater species of photosynthetic euglenids - a group which obtained secondary plastids, known to have dynamically evolving genome structure, via endosymbiosis with a green alga. Our analyses have demonstrated that the evolutionary history of euglenid plastid genome structure is exceptionally convoluted, riddled with losses and multiple subsequent regains of inverted ribosomal operon (rDNA) repeats, as well as independent acquisitions of tandemly repeated rDNA copies. Moreover, we have shown that inverted repeats in euglenid ptDNA do not share their genome stabilizing property documented in chlorophytes. We hypothesize that the degeneration of the quadripartite structure of euglenid plastid genomes is connected to the group II intron expansion. These findings challenge the current global paradigms of plastid genome architecture evolution, and underscore the often-underestimated divergence between the functionality of shared traits in primary and complex plastid organelles.",

    "abstract": "Modifying the relative proportions of macronutrients in an animals diet has noteworthy effects on its reproduction, lifelong health, and lifespan. Because of this, a wide range of animals carefully regulate their nutrient intake toward species and stage-specific targets. However, when animals are unable to reach their nutrient target from their existing food resources, they will compromise between overconsuming one nutrient and under-consuming the deficit nutrient. In this study, we used capillary feeding (CAFE) assays to understand the rules of compromise of adult fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) of different sex, mating status, and age when constrained to single diets. We found that young male and female D. melanogaster compromised by consuming more food on diets with low protein to carbohydrate (P:C) ratios compared to diets with high P:C ratios. Further, young male and female flies varied their carbohydrate intake significantly more than their protein intake, and female flies varied their carbohydrate intake significantly more than males. To test for effects of mating status on nutrient intake, we compared food intake of young mated and virgin females. We found that both virgin and mated females compromised by consuming more food on the low P:C diet compared to high P:C diets; however, mated females consumed more food than virgin females. As flies aged, they decreased their overall food intake and showed more modest alterations in their food intake across varying P:C diets. Further, mated females ceased to compromise for the protein deficit at a younger age than males. These findings provide new understanding about differences in protein leveraging behaviour across sexes, and how these behaviours change with age.\n\nHighlightsO_LIYoung fruit flies exhibit protein leveraging behaviour, varying their carbohydrate consumption more than protein\nC_LIO_LIYoung mated female flies vary their carbohydrate consumption significantly more than young males\nC_LIO_LIBoth virgin and mated female flies balance their nutrient intake similarly\nC_LIO_LIAs flies age, their ability to protein leverage declines, and this occurs faster in female flies\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe clinical manifestations of Parkinsons disease (PD) are characterized by heterogeneity in age at onset, disease duration, rate of progression, and the constellation of motor versus non-motor features. There is an unmet need for the characterization of distinct disease subtypes as well as improved, individualized predictions of the disease course. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to address this critical need.\n\nMethods and FindingsWe used unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the Parkinsons Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) (n = 294 cases) to identify patient subtypes and to predict disease progression. The resulting models were validated in an independent, clinically well-characterized cohort from the Parkinsons Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) (n = 263 cases). Our analysis distinguished three distinct disease subtypes with highly predictable progression rates, corresponding to slow, moderate, and fast disease progression. We achieved highly accurate projections of disease progression five years after initial diagnosis with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.95 {+/-} 0.01 for the slower progressing group (PDvec1), 0.87 {+/-} 0.03 for moderate progressors, and 0.95 {+/-} 0.02 for the fast progressing group (PDvec3). We identified serum neurofilament light (Nfl) as a significant indicator of fast disease progression among other key biomarkers of interest. We replicated these findings in an independent validation cohort, released the analytical code, and developed models in an open science manner.\n\nConclusionsOur data-driven study provides insights to deconstruct PD heterogeneity. This approach could have immediate implications for clinical trials by improving the detection of significant clinical outcomes that might have been masked by cohort heterogeneity. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, clinical trial design, allocation of healthcare resources, and ultimately individualized patient care.",

    "abstract": "The bacterium Escherichia coli initiates replication once per cell cycle at a precise volume per origin and adds an on average constant volume between successive initiation events, independent of the initiation size. Yet, a molecular model that can explain these observations has been lacking. Experiments indicate that E. coli controls replication initiation via titration and activation of the initiator protein DnaA. Here, we study by mathematical modelling how these two mechanisms interact to generate robust replication-initiation cycles. We first show that a mechanism solely based on titration generates stable replication cycles at low growth rates, but inevitably causes premature reinitiation events at higher growth rates. In this regime, the DnaA activation switch becomes essential for stable replication initiation. Conversely, while the activation switch alone yields robust rhythms at high growth rates, titration can strongly enhance the stability of the switch at low growth rates. Our analysis thus predicts that both mechanisms together drive robust replication cycles at all growth rates. In addition, it reveals how an origin-density sensor yields adder correlations.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins is thought to be a primary driving force for the formation of membraneless organelles, which control a wide range of biological functions from stress response to ribosome biogenesis. LLPS of proteins in cells is primarily, though not exclusively, driven by intrinsically disordered (ID) domains. Accurate identification of ID regions (IDRs) that drive phase separation is important for testing the underlying mechanisms of phase separation, identifying biological processes that rely on phase separation, and designing sequences that modulate phase separation. To identify IDRs that drive phase separation, we first curated datasets of folded, ID, and phase-separating (PS) ID sequences. We then used these sequence sets to examine how broadly existing amino acids scales can be used to distinguish between the three classes of protein regions. We found that there are robust property differences between the classes and, consequently, that numerous combinations of amino acid property scales can be used to make robust predictions of LLPS. This result indicates that multiple, redundant mechanisms contribute to the formation of phase-separated droplets from IDRs. The top-performing scales were used to further optimize our previously developed predictor of PS IDRs, ParSe. We then modified ParSe to account for interactions between amino acids and obtained reasonable predictive power for mutations that have been designed to test the role of amino acid interactions in driving LLPS.",

    "abstract": "While Parkinsons disease (PD) remains clinically defined by cardinal motor symptoms resulting from nigrostriatal degeneration, it is now appreciated that PD consists of multiple pathologies, but it is unclear which occurs first and which are responsible for the nigrostriatal degeneration. For the past number of years, we have been studying a well-characterized cohort of subjects with motor impairment that we have termed mild motor deficits (MMD). Motor deficits were determined on a modified and validated Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), but they occur to a degree insufficient to diagnose PD. We consider this population to have prodromal PD. However, in past studies, cases in this cohort had a selection bias as both a clinical syndrome in between no motor deficits and PD, plus nigral Lewy pathology as defined post-mortem, were required for inclusion. Therefore, in this study, we only based inclusion on a clinical phenotype intermediate between no motor impairment and PD. Then, we divided this group further based upon whether or not they had a synucleinopathy. Here we demonstrate that loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, loss of putamenal dopaminergic innervation, loss of TH-phenotype in the substantia nigra and putamen, and changes in axonal transport occur equally in groups with and without nigral alpha-synuclein aggregates. Indeed, the common feature of these two groups is that both have similar degrees of AT8-expressing phospho-tau, a pathology not seen in the nigrostriatal system of aged-matched controls. These finding were confirmed with early (CP13) and late (PHF1) tau markers. This suggests that the initiation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration occurs independently of alpha-synuclein aggregation and is likely tau mediated.",

The latter is considered particularly important for long-term synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, yet underlying mechanisms including the identity of the key SNARE proteins remain elusive. Here, we investigate the role of neuronal Synaptosomal-Associated Protein-23 (SNAP-23) by analyzing pyramidal-neuron specific SNAP-23 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. SNAP-23 immunostaining in postsynaptic spines was effectively decreased in the SNAP-23 cKO hippocampus. Electrophysiological analysis of SNAP-23 deficient neurons using acute hippocampal slices showed normal basal neurotransmission in CA3-CA1 synapses with unchanged AMPA and NMDA currents. Nevertheless, we found theta-burst stimulation induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was vastly diminished in SNAP-23 cKO. Moreover, unlike syntaxin-4 cKO mice in which both basal neurotransmission and LTP decrease manifested changes in a broad set of behavioral tasks, deficits of SNAP-23 cKO is more limited to spatial memory. Our data reveal that neuronal SNAP-23 is selectively crucial for synaptic plasticity and spatial memory without affecting basal glutamate receptor function.",

We sought to explore whether the urinary proteome could reflect the pregnancy process.

The urinary proteome was profiled by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and differential proteins were obtained by comparing the 0 d (GD 1 d) of the same group at each time point within the two groups. Through the analysis of the enriched pathways of differentially expressed proteins in the pregnant group, during the period from fertilization to implantation, many pathways related to embryo implantation and trophoblast differentiation were enriched on GD 1 d, GD 4 d and GD 7 d. In addition, the developmental process of the fetal rat heart such as heart looping and endocardial cushion formation, are consistent with the timing of previous studies; the developmental process of the lung and the development of the rat embryo alveoli before birth are consistent with the reported timing; and the developmental time of the rat embryo pancreas is also during the period of pancreatic cell proliferation and differentiation. These processes were enriched only in the pregnancy group and not in the control group. Furthermore, coagulation-associated pathways were found to be increasingly prominent before labor, which is consistent with the previously reported trend of increasing coagulation function during pregnancy. Our results indicated urinary proteome can reflect some embryonic developmental and maternal changes in rat pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Genome rearrangements are prevalent across the tree of life and even within species. After two decades of research, various suggestions have been proposed to explain which features of the genome are associated with rearrangements and the breakpoints between rearranged regions. These include: recombination rate, GC content, repetitive DNA content, gene density, and markers of chromatin conformation. Here, we use a set of six aligned rodent genomes to identify regions that have not been rearranged and characterize the breakpoint regions where rearrangements have occurred. We found no strong support for any of the expected correlations between breakpoint regions and a variety of genomic features previously identified. These results call into question the utility and repeatability of identifying chromatin characteristics associated with rearranged regions of the genome and suggest that perhaps a different explanation is in order. We analyzed rates of karyotypic evolution in each of the six lineages and found that the Mongolian gerbil genome has had the most rearrangements. That gerbils exhibit very rapid sequence evolution at a number of key DNA repair genes suggests an alternative hypothesis for patterns of genome rearrangement: karyotypic evolution may be driven by variation at a few genes that control the repair pathway used to fix double-stranded DNA breaks. Such variation may explain the heterogeneity in the rates of karyotypic evolution across species. While currently only supported by circumstantial evidence, a systematic survey of this hypothesis is now warranted.",

    "abstract": "Drug-target protein interaction (DTI) identification is fundamental for drug discovery and drug repositioning, because therapeutic drugs act on disease-causing proteins. However, the DTI identification process often requires expensive and time-consuming tasks, including biological experiments involving large numbers of candidate compounds. Thus, a variety of computation approaches have been developed. Of the many approaches available, chemo-genomics feature-based methods have attracted considerable attention. These methods compute the feature descriptors of drugs and proteins as the input data to train machine and deep learning models to enable accurate prediction of unknown DTIs. In addition, attention-based learning methods have been proposed to identify and interpret DTI mechanisms. However, improvements are needed for enhancing prediction performance and DTI mechanism elucidation. To address these problems, we developed an attention-based method designated the interpretable cross-attention network (ICAN), which predicts DTIs using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System of drugs and amino acid sequences of target proteins. We optimized the attention mechanism architecture by exploring the cross-attention or self-attention, attention layer depth, and selection of the context matrixes from the attention mechanism. We found that a plain attention mechanism that decodes drug-related protein context features without any protein-related drug context features effectively achieved high performance. The ICAN outperformed state-of-the-art methods in several respects and revealed with statistical significance that some weighted sites in the cross-attention weight represent experimental binding sites, thus demonstrating the high interpretability of the results.\n\nKey pointsWe created the interpretable cross-attention network (ICAN), which is composed of nn.Embedding of FCS label-encoding vectors of SMILES of drugs and AA sequences of target proteins, cross-attention mechanisms, and a CNN output layer.\n\nICAN decoded drug-related protein context features without any protein-related drug context features, achieving high prediction performance despite the plain attention mechanism.\n\nIn comparison with seven state-of-the-art methods, ICAN provided the highest PRAUC for the imbalanced datasets (DAVIS and BindingDB).\n\nStatistical analysis of attention-weight matrixes revealed that some weighted attention sites corresponded to experimental binding sites, demonstrating the high interpretability achievable with ICAN.",

    "abstract": "Most cell type-specific genes are regulated by the interaction of enhancers with their promoters. The identification of enhancers is not trivial as enhancers are diverse in their characteristics and dynamic in their interaction partners. Currently, enhancer-associated features such as histone modifications, co-activators or bi-directional transcription are used in lieu of any definitive and universal enhancer feature. We present Esearch3D, a new approach that leverages network theory approaches to identify active enhancers. Our work is based on the fact that enhancers act as a source of regulatory information to increase the rate of transcription of their target genes and that the flow of this information is mediated by the folding of chromatin in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space between the enhancer and the target gene promoter. Esearch3D reverse engineers this flow of information to calculate the likelihood of enhancer activity in intergenic regions by propagating the transcription levels of genes across 3D-genome networks. Regions predicted to have high enhancer activity are shown to be enriched in annotations indicative of enhancer activity. These include: enhancer-associated histone marks, bi-directional CAGE-seq, STARR-seq, P300 and RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Esearch3D successfully leverages the relationship between chromatin architecture and global transcription and represents a novel approach to predict active enhancers and understand the complex underpinnings of regulatory networks.

    "abstract": "Microbial specialised metabolism is full of valuable natural products that are applied clinically, agriculturally, and industrially. The genes that encode their biosynthesis are often physically clustered on the genome in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Many BGCs consist of multiple groups of co-evolving genes called sub-clusters that are responsible for the biosynthesis of a specific chemical moiety in a natural product. Sub-clusters therefore provide an important link between the structures of a natural product and its BGC, which can be leveraged for predicting natural product structures from sequence, as well as for linking chemical structures and metabolomics-derived mass features to BGCs.\n\nWhile some initial computational methodologies have been devised for sub-cluster detection, current approaches are not scalable, have only been run on small and outdated datasets, or produce an impractically large number of possible sub-clusters to mine through.\n\nHere, we constructed a scalable method for unsupervised sub-cluster detection, called iPRESTO, based on topic modelling and statistical analysis of co-occurrence patterns of enzyme-coding protein families. iPRESTO was used to mine sub-clusters across 150,000 prokaryotic BGCs from antiSMASH-DB. After annotating a fraction of the resulting sub-cluster families, we could predict a substructure for 16% of the antiSMASH-DB BGCs. Additionally, our method was able to confirm 83% of the experimentally characterised sub-clusters in MIBiG reference BGCs. Based on iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters, we could correctly identify the BGCs for xenorhabdin and salbostatin biosynthesis (which had not yet been annotated in BGC databases), as well as propose a candidate BGC for akashin biosynthesis. Additionally, we show for a collection of 145 actinobacteria how substructures can aid in linking BGCs to molecules by correlating iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters to MS/MS-derived Mass2Motifs substructure patterns.\n\nThis work paves the way for deeper functional and structural annotation of microbial BGCs by improved linking of orphan molecules to their cognate gene clusters, thus facilitating accelerated natural product discovery.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this work, we introduce iPRESTO, a tool for scalable unsupervised sub-cluster detection in biosynthetic gene clusters. This detection is important because these biosynthetic hotspots encode many products useful for humanity, such as antibiotics, antitumor agents, or herbicides. Recent technological developments have made identification of biosynthetic loci in genomes straightforward. Yet, methods to connect these inferred biosynthetic genes to the final chemical structures of their cognate metabolites are largely lacking. Being able to reliably predict parts of the final product would constitute a real step forward in natural product genome mining. Therefore, we focussed on constructing a tool to systematically detect and annotate small regions called sub-clusters, which code for the biosynthesis of substructures in the final product, across all genomically inferred biosynthetic diversity. iPRESTO makes it possible to query unknown biosynthetic regions and infer which substructures are present in their metabolic products. This will facilitate more effective prioritization of chemical novelty, as well as linking activities from bioassays and microbiome-associated phenotypes to the metabolites responsible for them.",

    "abstract": "Bimodality of gene expression, as a mechanism generating phenotypic diversity, enhances the survival of cells in a fluctuating environment. Growing experimental evidence suggests that silent transcription intervals and translational bursting play important roles in regulating phenotypic switching. Characterizing these kinetics is challenging. Here, we develop an interpretable and tractable model, the generalized telegraph model (GTM), which considers silent transcription intervals described by a general waiting-time distribution and translational bursting characterized by an arbitrary distribution. Using methods of queuing theory, we derive analytical expressions of all moment statistics and distribution of protein counts. We show that non-exponential inactive times and translational bursting can lead to two nonzero bimodalities that cannot be captured in the classical telegraph model (CTM). In addition, we find that both silent-intervals noise and translational burst-size noise can amplify gene expression noise, as well as induce diverse dynamic expressions. Our results not only provide an alternative mechanism for phenotypic switching driven by silent transcription intervals and translational bursting, but also can be used to infer complex promoter structures based on experimental data.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEUnderstanding how phenotypic diversity arises among isogenic cell populations is a fundamental problem in biology. Previous studies have shown that the bimodality of gene expression contributing to phenotypic variations is mostly caused by the intrinsic or extrinsic regulations of underlying systems. It is unclear whether bimodality occurs in the absence of these regulations. The CTM has made great success in interpreting many experimental phenomena, but it cannot capture the bimodal distributions with two nonzero peaks that have been demonstrated in experiments. In particular, recent single-cell studies have shown non-exponential inactive periods and non-geometric translational bursting in gene expression. How to model these kinetics is challenging. We develop a stochastic gene model, namely the GTM, to model the silent transcription intervals by a general waiting-time distribution and translational bursting by an arbitrary distribution. By mapping the GTM into a queuing model, we derive the steady-state distribution of gene products that can be used for analyzing phenotypic switching. We find that non-exponential inactive times and translational bursting can lead to two nonzero bimodalities that cannot be captured in the CTM. These results indicate that both silent transcription intervals and translational bursting have important roles in controlling cell phenotypic variations in fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "Developing neurons become spontaneously active while growing blood vessels begin to irrigate their surroundings. However, surprising little is known about early interactions between neural activity and angiogenesis. In the neonatal mouse retina, spontaneous waves of impulses sweep across the ganglion cell layer (GCL), just underneath the growing superficial vascular plexus. We discovered clusters of transient auto-fluorescent cells in the GCL, forming an annulus that co-localizes with the frontline of the growing plexus. Blood vessel density is highest within cluster areas, suggesting their involvement in angiogenesis. Once the clusters and blood vessels reach the retinal periphery by the end of the first postnatal week, the clusters disappear, eliminated by microglial phagocytosis. Electrical imaging suggests that they have their own electrophysiological signature. Blocking Pannexin1 (PANX1) hemi-channels with probenecid blocks the waves and the fluorescent clusters disappear following prolonged exposure to the drug. Spontaneous waves initiation points follow a developmental center-to-periphery progression similar to the cluster cells. We suggest that these transient cells are specialized, hyperactive neurons residing in the GCL. They generate spontaneous activity hotspots, thereby triggering waves through purinergic paracrine signaling via PANX1 hemi-channels. The strong activity generated around these hotspots triggers angiogenesis, attracting new blood vessels that provide local oxygen supply. Signaling through PANX-1 attracts microglia that establish contact with these cells, eventually leading to their elimination by phagocytosis. These cluster cells may provide the first evidence that specialized transient neuronal populations guide angiogenesis in the developing CNS through neural activity.",

    "abstract": "Non-human primates have an important translational value given their close phylogenetic relationship to humans. Studies in these animals remain essential for evaluating efficacy and safety of new therapeutic approaches, particularly in aging primates that display Alzheimers disease (AD) -like pathology. With the objective to improve amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) targeting immunotherapy, we investigated the safety and efficacy of an active immunisation with an A{beta} derivative, K6A{beta}1-30-NH2, in old non-human primates. Thirty-two aged (4-10 year-old) mouse lemurs were enrolled in the study, and received up to four subcutaneous injections of the vaccine in alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone.\n\nEven though antibody titres to A{beta} were not high, pathological examination of the mouse lemur brains showed significant reduction in intracellular A{beta} without inflammatory or haemorrhagic changes. Moreover, a trend for cognitive improvement was observed in the vaccinated primates, which was probably linked to A{beta} clearance. This A{beta} derivative vaccine appeared to be safe as a prophylactic measure based on the brain analyses and because it did not appear to have detrimental effects on the general health of these old animals.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are the functional and evolutionary units of cells. On their surface, proteins are sculpted into numerous concavities and bulges, offering unique microenvironments for ligand binding or catalysis. The dynamics, size, and chemical features of these cavities are essential for the mechanistic understanding of protein function.\n\nHere we present CaviDB (https://www.cavidb.org), a novel database of cavities and their features in known protein structures, which integrates the results from commonly used software for cavities detection with protein features obtained from sequence, structure, and function analyses. Additionally, each protein in CaviDB is associated with its corresponding conformers which help to analyze conformational changes in cavities as well. We were able to characterize a total number of 16,533,339 cavities, 62,0431 of them predicted as druggable targets. CaviDB contains 276,432 different proteins, with information about all their conformers. It also offers the capability to compare cavities and their features from different conformational states of the protein. Furthermore, we have recently added the available models from the AlphaFold database versions 2 and 3, which allow further cavity explorations and comparisons.\n\nEach entry information is organized in sections, highlighting the general cavities descriptors, including the inter-cavities contacts, activated residues per cavity, the information about druggable cavities, and the global protein descriptors. The data retrieved by the user can be downloaded in a format that is easy to parse and integrate with custom pipelines for protein analysis.\n\nCaviDB aims to offer a comprehensive database for use not only in different aspects of drug design and discovery but also to better understand the basis of the protein structure-function relationship better. With its unique approach, CaviDB provides an essential resource for the wide community of bioinformaticians in particular and biologists in general.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid hormone (T3) and its nuclear receptors (TR) are important regulators of energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis, notably through their action in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, T3 acts in many other peripheral and central tissues which are also involved in energy expenditure. The general picture of how T3 regulates BAT thermogenesis is currently not fully established, notably due to the absence of extensive omics analyses and the lack of specific mice model. Here, we first used transcriptome and cistrome analyses to establish the list of T3/TR direct target genes in brown adipocytes. We then developed a novel model of transgenic mice, in which T3-signaling is specifically suppressed in brown adipocytes at adult stage. We addressed the capacity of these mice to mount a thermogenic response when challenged by either a cold exposure or a high-fat diet, and analyzed the associated changes in BAT transcriptome. We conclude that T3 plays a crucial role in the thermogenic response of the BAT, controlling the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and regulating BAT proliferation. The resulting picture provides an unprecedented view on the pathways by which T3 activates energy expenditure through an efficient adaptive thermogenesis in the BAT.\n\nSignificance StatementThyroid hormones (TH) increase energy expenditure by regulating the expression of target genes in many metabolic tissues. Among them, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates biochemical energy into heat production to notably prevent hypothermia during cold exposure. Hypothyroid mice display inefficient BAT thermogenesis suggesting that TH are crucial for this process. Here, we eliminated TH signaling specifically in brown adipocytes and expose the mice to different physiological stressors. We showed that TH signaling is crucial for BAT thermogenesis as it controls the expression of genes involved in proliferation and in the metabolism of lipids and glucose, the main energy resources for BAT thermogenesis. This study provides an unprecedented view on the pathways by which T3 activates energy expenditure the BAT.",

    "abstract": "Drought is one of the most common abiotic constraints on the quality and productivity of crops on a global scale. Despite the rapidly updating information on circRNAs (circular RNAs), their roles in the anti-drought regulation of sugar beet are least understood. As a newly recognized class of non-coding RNAs, circRNAs exert crucial effects on miRNA (microRNA) functionality, as well as on transcriptional regulation. To clarify the mechanism of how circRNAs of sugar beet respond to drought stress, deep sequencing was employed to characterize these circRNAs in a genome-wide manner under drought treatment. Our results identify a total of 17 differentially expressed circRNAs. As revealed by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology outcomes, circRNAs were found capable and involved in drought-responsive events. Utilizing the target genes exhibiting direct/indirect associations with drought resistance, we established a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA meshwork based on the circRNAs that were expressed differentially. The probable sponge functions of novel_circ_0000442 and novel_circ_0000443 were exerted by targeting ath-miR157d. This helped regulate the expression of relevant target genes, including BVRB_1 g004570, BVRB_1 g005450, and BVRB_1 g005790, that were involved in drought response. Apart from offering novel understandings of anti-drought mechanisms, our findings lay a basis for probing deeper into the intricate regulatory networks of sugar beet genes.",

    "abstract": "Brain oscillations are prevalent in all species and are involved in numerous perceptual operations. Alpha oscillations are thought to facilitate processing through the inhibition of task-irrelevant networks, while beta oscillations are linked to the reactivation of content representations. Can the proposed functional role of alpha and beta oscillations be generalized from low-level operations to higher-level cognitive processes? Here we address this question focusing on naturalistic spoken language processing. Twenty-two (18 female) Dutch native speakers listened to stories in spoken Dutch and French while magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. We used dependency parsing to identify three dependency states at each word, as the number of (1) newly opened dependencies, (2) dependencies that remained open, and (3) resolved dependencies. We then constructed linear forward models to predict alpha and beta power from the dependency features. Results showed that dependency features predict alpha and beta power in language-related regions beyond low-level linguistic features. Left temporal, fundamental language regions are involved in language comprehension in the alpha band, while frontal and parietal, higher-order language regions, and motor regions are mostly involved in the beta band. Critically, alpha and beta band dynamics seem to subserve language comprehension tapping into syntactic structure building and semantic composition by providing low-level mechanistic operations for inhibition and reactivation processes. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of alpha and beta oscillations during naturalistic language processing, providing evidence for the generalizability of these dynamics from perceptual to complex linguistic processes.\n\nSignificance StatementPrior research identified the functional role of alpha and beta oscillations in basic perceptual and motor functions. However, it remains unclear whether their proposed role can be generalized to higher-level processes during language comprehension. Here, we found that high-level syntactic features predict alpha and beta power in language-related regions beyond low-level linguistic features when listening to comprehensible naturalistic speech. Our work contributes to the debate about whether the functional roles of brain oscillations are domain-general or depend on the task at hand. We offer experimental findings that integrate a neuroscientific framework on the role of brain oscillations as \"building blocks\" with language comprehension as a compositional process, and novel evidence regarding the encoding of higher-level syntactic operations in the brain. This supports the view of a domain-general role of cortical oscillations across the hierarchy of cognitive functions, from low-level sensory operations to complex linguistic processes.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with changes in functional brain connectivity. Yet, typical analyses of functional connectivity, such as spatial ICA for resting-state data, often ignore sources of between-subject variability, which may be crucial for identifying functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD. Typically, methods like spatial ICA will identify a single component to represent a network like the default mode network (DMN), even if groups within the data show differential DMN coactivation. To address this gap, this project applies a tensorial extension of ICA (tensorial ICA)--which explicitly incorporates between-subject variability--to identify functionally connected networks using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Data from the HCP included individuals with a diagnosis of MDD, a family history of MDD, and healthy controls performing a gambling and social cognition task. Based on evidence associating MDD with blunted neural activation to rewards and social stimuli, we predicted that tensorial ICA would identify networks associated with reduced spatio-temporal coherence and blunted social and reward-based network activity in MDD. Across both tasks, tensorial ICA identified three networks showing decreased coherence in MDD. All three networks included ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and cerebellum and showed different activation across the conditions of their respective tasks. However, MDD was only associated with differences in task-based activation in one network from the social task. Additionally, these results suggest that tensorial ICA could be a valuable tool for understanding clinical differences in relation to network activation and connectivity.",

They have neurogenic and immune-modulatory properties and showed therapeutic potential in animal models of spinal cord trauma, hearing loss, Parkinsonss disease, amnesia, and peripheral nerve injury.\n\nIn this paper we designed a protocol that meet the requirements set by human health agencies to manufacture these stem cells for clinical applications.\n\nOnce purified, OE-MSCs can be used per se or expanded in order to get the extracellular vesicles (EV) they secrete. A protocol for the extraction of these vesicles was validated and the EV from the OE-MSC were functionally tested on an in vitro model.\n\nNasal mucosa biopsies from three donors were used to validate the manufacturing process of clinical grade OE-MSC. All stages were performed by expert staff of the cell therapy laboratory according to aseptic handling manipulations, requiring grade A laminar airflow. Enzymatic digestion provides more rapidly a high number of cells and is less likely to be contaminated. Foetal calf serum was replaced with human platelet lysate and allowed stronger cell proliferation, with the optimal percentage of platelet lysate being 10%. Cultivated OE-MSCs are sterile, highly proliferative (percentage of CFU-F progenitors was 15,5%) and their maintenance does not induce chromosomal rearrangement (karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis were normal). These cells express the usual phenotypic markers of OE-MSC. Purification of the EVs was performed with ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. Purified vesicles expressed the recognized markers of EVs (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (\"MISEV\") guidelines) and promoted cell differentiation and neurite elongation in a model of neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line.\n\nWe developed a safer and more efficient manufacturing process for clinical-grade olfactory stem cells, these cells can now be used in humans. A phase I clinical trial will begin soon.An efficient protocol for the purification of the OE-MSC EVs have been validated. These EVs exert neurogenic properties in vitro. More studies are needed to understand the exact mechanisms of action of these EVs and prove their efficacy and safety in animal models.",

    "abstract": "Despite successes in tracking single molecules in vitro, the extension of active-feedback single-particle methods to tracking rapidly diffusing and unconfined proteins in live cells has not been realized. Since existing active-feedback localization methods localize particles in real time assuming zero background, they are ill-suited to track in the inhomogeneous background environment of a live cell. Here, we develop a windowed estimation of signal and background levels which uses recent data to estimate the current particle brightness and background intensity. These estimates facilitate recursive Bayesian position estimation, improving upon current Kalman-based localization methods. Combined, online Bayesian and windowed estimation of background and signal (COBWEBS) surpasses existing localization methods. Simulations demonstrate improved localization accuracy and responsivity in a homogenous background for selected particle and background intensity combinations. Improved or similar performance of COBWEBS tracking extends to the majority of signal and background combinations explored. Furthermore, improved tracking durations are demonstrated in the presence of heterogeneous backgrounds for multiple particle intensities, diffusive speeds, and background patterns. COBWEBS can accurately track particles in the presence of high and non-uniform backgrounds including intensity changes of up to three-fold that of the particles intensity, making it a prime candidate for advancing active-feedback single-fluorophore tracking to the cellular interior.",

    "abstract": "Transient protein-protein interactions occur frequently under the crowded conditions encountered in biological environments, yet they remain poorly understood. Here, tryptophan-cysteine quenching is introduced as an experimental approach that is ideally suited to characterize such interactions between proteins with minimal labeling due to its sensitivity to nano- to microsecond dynamics on sub-nanometer length scales. The experiments are paired with computational modeling at different resolutions including fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to provide interpretation of the experimental observables and add further insights at the molecular level. This approach is applied to model systems, villin variants and the drkN SH3 domain, in the presence of protein G crowders. It is demonstrated that Trp-Cys quenching experiments are able to not only distinguish between overall attractive and repulsive interactions between different proteins, but they can also discern variations in interaction preferences at different protein surface locations. The close integration between experiment and simulations also provides an opportunity to evaluate different molecular force fields for the simulation of concentrated protein solutions.\n\nSignificance StatementBiological environments typically involve a variety of different proteins at very high concentrations where non-specific interactions are unavoidable. These interactions may go beyond simple crowding effects and involve transient contacts that may impact structure, dynamics, and ultimately function of proteins in vivo. While computer simulations have partially characterized such interactions, experimental data remain limited because established techniques are generally not well-suited to the characterization of dynamic processes on microsecond time and nanometer length scales. Tryptophan quenching by cysteine is introduced here as a new approach for studying transient protein encounters under concentrated conditions with the support of computational modeling. The study demonstrates that such experiments can resolve not just differences between different proteins but also residue-specific interaction preferences.",

    "abstract": "Spatial properties of tumor growth have profound implications for cancer progression, therapeutic resistance and metastasis. Yet, how spatial position governs tumor cell division remains difficult to evaluate in clinical tumors. Here, we demonstrate that elevated cellular growth rates on the tumor periphery leave characteristic patterns in the genomes of cells sampled from different parts of a tumor, which become evident when they are used to construct a tumor phylogenetic tree. Namely, rapidly-dividing peripheral lineages branch more extensively and acquire more mutations than slower-dividing lineages in the tumor center. We develop a Bayesian state-dependent evolutionary phylodynamic model (SDevo) that quantifies these patterns to infer the differential cell division rates between peripheral and central cells jointly from the branching and mutational patterns of single-time point, multi-region sequencing data. We validate this approach on simulated tumors by demonstrating its ability to accurately infer spatially-varying birth rates under a range of growth conditions and sampling strategies. We then show that SDevo outperforms state-of-the-art, non-cancer multi-state phylodynamic methods which ignore differential mutational acquisition. Finally, we apply SDevo to multi-region sequencing data from clinical hepatocellular carcinomas and find evidence that cells on the tumor edge divide 3-6x faster than those in the center. As multi-region and single-cell sequencing increase in resolution and availability, we anticipate that SDevo will be useful in interrogating spatial restrictions on tumor growth and could be extended to model non-spatial factors that influence tumor progression, including hypoxia and immune infiltration.",

    "abstract": "Development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers that bind with high-affinity to 4{beta}2-type nicotinic receptors (4{beta}2Rs) allows for in vivo investigations of the mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction and smoking cessation. One challenge associated with preclinical PET imaging involves the lack of true tissue reference regions free of specific tracer binding in the rodent brain, impeding accurate quantification of the tracer binding potential. Here, we investigate the use of an image-derived arterial input function for kinetic analysis of radiotracer binding in male and female mice. Two radiotracers were explored in this study: 2-[18F]FA85380 (2-FA), which displays similar pKa and binding affinity to the smoking cessation drug varenicline (Chantix), and [18F]Nifene, which displays similar pKa and binding affinity to nicotine. For both radiotracers, time-activity curves of the left ventricle of the heart displayed similar standardized uptake values (SUVs) across wild type mice, mice lacking the {beta}2 subunit for tracer binding, and acute nicotine-treated mice, whereas typical reference tissue SUVs displayed high variation between groups. Binding potential values estimated from a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) fit of the data with the image-derived input function were significantly higher than estimates from reference tissue-based estimations. Rate constants of radiotracer dissociation were very slow for 2-FA and very fast for Nifene, similar to the in vitro dissociation rates reported for varenicline and nicotine, respectively. We conclude that use of an image-derived input function for kinetic modeling of nicotinic PET ligands improves quantification compared to reference tissue-based methods, and that the chemical properties of 2-FA and Nifene are suitable to study receptor response to nicotine addiction and smoking cessation therapies.",

    "abstract": "Temporal envelope fluctuations are abundant in nature and are critical for perception of complex sounds. While psychophysical sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) processing studies have characterized the perception of SAM, and neurophysiological studies report a subcortical transformation from temporal to rate-based code, no studies have characterized this transformation in unanesthetized animals or in nonhuman primates. To address this, we recorded single-unit responses and compared derived neurometric measures in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and inferior colliculus (IC) to psychometric measures of modulation frequency (MF) discrimination in macaques. IC and CN neurons often exhibited tuned responses to SAM in their rate and spike-timing. Neurometric thresholds spanned a large range (2-200 Hz {Delta} MF). The lowest 40% of IC thresholds were less than or equal to psychometric thresholds, regardless of which code was used, while CN thresholds were greater than psychometric thresholds. Discrimination at 10-20 Hz could be explained by indiscriminately pooling 30 units in either structure, while discrimination at higher MFs was best explained by more selective pooling. This suggests that pooled brainstem activity was sufficient for AM discrimination. Psychometric and neurometric thresholds decreased as a function of stimulus duration, but IC and CN thresholds were greater and more variable than behavior at durations less than 500 ms. This slower subcortical temporal integration compared to behavior was consistent with a drift diffusion model which reproduced individual differences in performance and can constrain future neurophysiological studies of temporal integration. These measures provide an account of AM perception at the neurophysiological, computational, and behavioral levels.\n\nSignificance statementListening in everyday environments tasks the brain with extracting information from sound envelopes. This process involves both sensory encoding and decision-making. Different neural codes for envelope representation have been well characterized in the auditory midbrain and cortex, but studies of the brainstem have usually been conducted in anesthetized rodents or cats. Moreover, these candidate neural codes have been studied in isolation from the decision-making process. In this study, we found that population activity in the primate subcortical auditory system contains sufficient information for discriminating sound envelope and applied a biologically plausible model of decision-making to sound envelope discrimination performance from rhesus macaques, a species with great phylogenetic and perceptual similarity to humans.",

    "abstract": "In humans, an acutely traumatic experience can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is often characterized by changes in anxiety and motivation months after trauma. There are few demonstrations of the persistent motivational effects of an acute stressor in rodent approaches to PTSD. In two experiments, we evaluated the persistent effects of a battery of footshocks in one context on appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, instrumental learning, and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) in a different context. A battery of footshocks before appetitive training caused deficits in single-outcome PIT in male Long Evans rats. The same battery of footshocks after appetitive training, but before testing had little effect on single-outcome PIT, but there were some qualitative deficits. Although males showed more generalized fear from the aversive to the appetitive context compared to females, there were no effects of shock on sensory-specific PIT in male or female rats. In general females showed less evidence for sensory-specific PIT compared to males, who showed robust sensory-specific PIT, with clear extinction and spontaneous recovery of the sensory-specific PIT effect across test sessions. These findings show that (a) an acute trauma can have persistent effects on general motivational processes and (b) sensory-specific PIT is a useful approach for exploring sex differences in strategies for instrumental learning. We discuss implications for current approaches to stress and motivation in preclinical and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExposure to elevated interleukin (IL)-6 levels in utero is consistently associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders with a putative neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum condition (ASC). Although rodent models provide causal evidence for this association, we lack a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms in human model systems. To close this gap, we characterised the response of hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (MGL) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to IL-6 in monoculture.\n\nResultsWe observed that human forebrain NPCs did not respond to acute IL-6 exposure in monoculture at both a protein and transcript level due to the absence of IL-6Ra expression and sIL-6Ra secretion. By contrast, acute IL-6 exposure resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation and increased IL-6, JMJD3 and IL-10 expression in MGL, confirming activation of canonical IL-6R signalling. Bulk RNAseq identified 156 upregulated genes (FDR <0.05) in MGL following acute IL-6 exposure, including IRF8, REL, HSPA1A/B and OXTR, which significantly overlapped with an upregulated gene set from post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with schizophrenia. Acute IL-6 stimulation significantly increased MGL motility suggestive of a gain of surveillance function, consistent with gene ontology pathways highlighted from the RNAseq data. Finally, MGLs displayed elevated CCL1, CXCL1, MIP-1A/B, IL-8, IL-13, IL-16, IL-18, MIF and Serpin-E1 secretion post 3h and 24h IL-6 exposure.\n\nConclusionOur data provide evidence for cell specific effects of acute IL-6 exposure in a human model system and strongly suggest microglia-NPC co-culture models are required to study how IL-6 influences human cortical neural progenitor cell development in vitro.",

During infant mouse colonization, >35-fold reduction in diversity and expansion of a single clonal lineage was observed within 1 day post-inoculation. This loss of diversity was not due to immune factors, host microbiota or exclusively because of genetic drift. Rather, it required the expression of blp bacteriocins induced by the BlpC-quorum sensing pheromone. This points towards the role of intra-strain competition whereby the subpopulation reaching a quorum eliminates others that have yet to activate the blp locus. We show that this loss of diversity also restricts the number of unique clones that could establish colonization during transmission between hosts. Moreover, we show that genetic variation in the blp locus is associated with transmissibility in the human population. We posit this is due to its importance in clonal selection and its role as a selfish element.",

Failure of normal alveolar repair mechanisms can lead to loss of alveolar structure (emphysema) or development of fibrosis, depending on the type and severity of injury. To test if {beta}1-containing integrins are required during repair following acute injury, we administered E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by intratracheal injection to mice with a post-developmental deletion of {beta}1 integrin in AT2 cells. While control mice recovered from LPS injury without structural abnormalities, {beta}1-deficient mice had more severe inflammation and developed emphysema. In addition, recovering alveoli were repopulated with an abundance of rounded epithelial cells co-expressing type 2, type 1, and mixed intermediate cell state markers, with few mature type 1 cells. {beta}1-deficient AT2 cells showed persistently increased proliferation after injury, which was blocked by inhibiting NF-{kappa}B activation in these cells. Lineage tracing experiments revealed that {beta}1-deficient AT2 cells failed to differentiate into mature type 1 alveolar epithelial cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that functional alveolar repair after injury with terminal alveolar epithelial differentiation requires {beta}1-containing integrins.",

    "abstract": "Proper muscle contraction requires the assembly and maintenance of sarcomeres and myofibrils. While the protein components of myofibrils are generally known, less is known about the mechanisms by which they individually function and together synergize for myofibril assembly and maintenance. For example, it is unclear how the disruption of actin filament (F-actin) regulatory proteins leads to the muscle weakness observed in myopathies. Here, we show that knockdown of Drosophila Tropomodulin (Tmod) results in several myopathy-related phenotypes, including reduction of muscle cell (myofiber) size, increased sarcomere length, disorganization and misorientation of myofibrils, ectopic F-actin accumulation, loss of tension-mediating proteins at the myotendinous junction, and misshaped and internalized nuclei. Our findings support and extend the tension-driven self-organization myofibrillogenesis model. We show that, like its mammalian counterpart, Drosophila Tmod caps F-actin pointed-ends, and this activity is critical for cellular processes in different locations within the myofiber that directly and indirectly contribute to the maintenance of muscle function. Our findings provide significant insights to the role of Tmod in muscle development, maintenance, and disease.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTDrosophila Tropomodulin knockdown in larval myofibers results in myopathy-related phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis responding to nitrogen (N) fertilization in crop production is a long-standing research topic in plant breeding and genetics. Albeit years of continuous efforts, the genetic architecture parameters, such as heritability, polygenicity, and mode of selection, underlying the N responses in maize remain largely unclear. In this study, about n = 230 maize inbred lines were phenotyped under high N (HN) and low N (LN) conditions for two consecutive years to obtain six yield-related traits. Heritability analyses suggested that traits highly responsive to N treatments were less heritable. Using publicly available SNP genotypes, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify n = 231 and n = 139 trait-associated loci (TALs) under HN and LN conditions, respectively, and n = 162 TALs for N-responsive (NR) traits. Furthermore, genome-wide complex trait Bayesian (GCTB) analysis, a method complementary to GWAS, was performed to estimate genetic parameters, including genetic polygenicity and the mode of selection (S). GCTB results suggested that the NR value of a yield component trait was highly polygenic and that four NR traits exhibited negative correlations between SNP effects and their minor allele frequencies (or the S value < 0) -- a pattern consistent with negative selection to purge deleterious alleles. This study reveals the complex genetic architecture underlying N responses for yield-related traits and provides insights into the future direction for N resilient maize development.",

    "abstract": "Anophthalmia (missing eye) describes a failure of early embryonic ocular development. Mutations in a relatively small set of genes account for 75% of bilateral anophthalmia cases, yet 25% of families currently are left without a molecular diagnosis. Here we report our experimental work that aimed to uncover the developmental and genetic basis of the anophthalmia characterising the X-linked Ie (eye-ear reduction) X-ray induced allele in mouse that was first identified in 1947. Histological analysis of the embryonic phenotype showed failure of normal eye development after the optic vesicle stage with particularly severe malformation of the ventral retina. Linkage analysis mapped this mutation to a [~] 6Mb region on the X chromosome. Short and long read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of affected and unaffected male littermates confirmed the Ie linkage but identified no plausible causative variants or structural rearrangements. These analyses did reduce the critical candidate interval and revealed evidence of multiple variants within the ancestral DNA, although none were found that altered coding sequences or that were unique to Ie. To investigate early embryonic events at a genetic level, we then generated mouse ES cells derived from male Ie embryos and wild type littermates. RNA-seq and accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) data generated from cultured optic vesicle organoids did not reveal any large differences in gene expression or accessibility of putative cis-regulatory elements between Ie and wild type. However, an unbiased TF-footprinting analysis of accessible chromatin regions did provide evidence of a genome-wide reduction in binding of transcription factors associated with ventral eye development in Ie, and evidence of an increase in binding of the Zic-family of transcription factors, including Zic3, which is located within the Ie-refined critical interval. We conclude that the refined Ie critical region at chrX: 56,145,000-58,385,000 contains multiple genetic variants that may be linked to altered cis regulation but does not contain a convincing causative mutation. Changes in the binding of key transcription factors to chromatin causing altered gene expression during development, possibly through a subtle mis-regulation of Zic3, presents a plausible cause for the anophthalmia phenotype observed in Ie, but further work is required to determine the precise causative allele and its genetic mechanism.",

Computed tomography (CT) can be used to assess muscle health through measures of muscle cross-sectional area and density loss associated with fat infiltration. However, there are limited opportunities to measure muscle density in clinically acquired CT scans because a density calibration phantom, allowing for the conversion of CT Hounsfield units into density, is typically not included within the field-of-view. For bone density analysis, internal density calibration methods use regions of interest within the scan field-of-view to derive the relationship between Hounsfield units and bone density, but these methods have yet to be adapted for muscle density analysis. The objective of this study was to design and validate a CT internal calibration method for muscle density analysis.\n\nMethodologyWe CT scanned 10 bovine muscle samples using two scan protocols and five scan positions within the scanner bore. The scans were calibrated using internal calibration and a reference phantom. We tested combinations of internal calibration regions of interest (e.g., air, blood, bone, muscle, adipose).\n\nResultsWe found that the internal calibration method using two regions of interest, air and adipose or blood, yielded accurate muscle density values (< 1% error) when compared with the reference phantom. The muscle density values derived from the internal and reference phantom calibration methods were highly correlated (R2 > 0.99). The coefficient of variation for muscle density across two scan protocols and five scan positions was significantly lower for internal calibration (mean = 0.33%) than for Hounsfield units (mean = 6.52%). There was no difference between coefficient of variation for the internal calibration and reference phantom methods.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed an internal calibration method to produce accurate and reliable muscle density measures from opportunistic computed tomography images without the need for calibration phantoms.",

    "abstract": "Deriving biological insights from genomic data commonly requires comparing attributes of selected genomic loci to a null set of loci. The selection of this null set is non trivial, as it requires careful consideration of potential covariates, a problem that is exacerbated by the non-uniform distribution of genomic features including genes, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. Propensity score-based covariate matching methods allow selection of null sets from a pool of possible items while controlling for multiple covariates; however, existing packages do not operate on genomic data classes and can be slow for large data sets making them difficult to integrate into genomic workflows. To address this, we developed matchRanges, a propensity score-based covariate matching method for the efficient and convenient generation of matched null ranges from a set of background ranges within the Bioconductor framework.",

Pre-trained models give good predictive accuracy at low data and Bayesian optimization guides the choice of which sequences to test. Pre-trained sequence models also remove the common requirement of having a list of possible experiments. Any sequence can be considered. We show significantly fewer labeled sequences are required for three sequence design tasks, including creating novel peptide inhibitors with AlphaFold.

    "abstract": "Tensiomyography is a non-invasive method of evaluating neuromuscular function through skeletal muscle contraction. The objective of this study was to compare the thigh muscle characteristics of older and young women using tensiomyography. Nineteen older and fifteen young women without musculoskeletal diseases were included. For the quadriceps, the bilateral vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF) and for the hamstrings, the bilateral semitendinosus (ST) and biceps femoris (BF) were measured. Result variables--maximal displacement (Dm), contraction time (Tc), and contraction velocity (Vc)--were compared. Dm values of the hamstrings of both legs and their summed values were significantly smaller in older women than in young women; no difference was found in the Dm values of the quadriceps. Tc and Vc of the hamstrings, VM, and VL were longer and slower, respectively, in older women than in young women. There were no significant differences in the Dm, Tc, or Vc of the RF between older and young women. Decreased Dm of the hamstrings in older women occurred due to changes in muscle function, but not muscle mass. The changes in the Tc of the hamstrings, VM, and VL indicate that type II muscle fibers were converted to type I in older women. There was no difference in RF between older and young women, implying that the RF is not affected by age. Our findings indicate that resistance exercises, which preserve the type II fibers, and flexibility exercises, which reduce stiffness, are appropriate for the lower extremity in older women.",

    "abstract": "The downy mildew disease caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is a serious threat for grapevine and can cause enormous yield losses in viticulture. The quantitative trait locus Rpv12, mediating resistance against P. viticola, was originally found in Asian Vitis amurensis. This locus and its genes were analyzed here in detail. A haplotype-separated genome sequence of the diploid Rpv12-carrier Gf.99-03 was created and annotated. The defense response against P. viticola was investigated in an infection time-course RNA-Seq experiment, revealing approximately 600 up-regulated Vitis genes during host-pathogen interaction. The Rpv12 regions of the resistance conferring and the sensitivity encoding Gf.99-03 haplotypes were structurally and functionally compared to each other. Two different clusters of resistance-related genes were identified within the Rpv12 locus. One cluster carries a set of four differentially expressed genes with three ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6-like genes. The other cluster carries a set of six resistance gene analogues related to qualitative pathogen resistance. The Rpv12 locus and its candidate genes for P. viticola resistance provide a precious genetic resource for P. viticola resistance breeding. Newly developed co-segregating simple sequence repeat markers in close proximity to the R-genes enable its improved applicability in marker-assisted grapevine breeding.",

The PSI-IsiA structure lacks a PsaL subunit; instead, a C-terminal domain of IsiA2 is inserted at the position of PsaL, which inhibits the oligomerization of PSI, leading to the formation of a monomer. Furthermore, excitation-energy transfer from IsiAs to PSI appeared with a time constant of 55 ps. These findings provide novel insights into both the molecular assembly of the Anabaena IsiA family and the functional roles of IsiAs.",

The fungal genome encodes a single MIF protein (MoMIF1) that, unlike the human homolog, harbors multiple low-complexity regions (LCRs) and is unique to Ascomycota. Following infection, MoMIF1 is expressed in the biotrophic phase of the fungus, and is strongly down-regulated during subsequent necrotrophic growth in leaves and roots. We show that MoMIF1 is secreted during plant infection, affects the production of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid and inhibits plant cell death. Our results show that MoMIF1 is a novel key regulator of fungal virulence that maintains the balance between biotrophy and necrotrophy during the different phases of fungal infection.",

This regularity benefit is commonly interpreted to emerge from a mechanism that detects and subsequently exploits the regularity as it would be impossible for irregular events. Here, in the temporal domain, we show that this interpretation overlooks the influence of learning various time-related factors that contribute to the regularity benefit. Instead of only learning the temporal regularity, participants exploited the temporal properties of targets that we initially considered as irregular and uninformative. Participants temporally prepared, in parallel, for different actions to perform and locations to attend, irrespective of targets regularity. In fact, this temporal preparation explained regularity benefits without assuming statistical learning of the regular target. Using a computational model, fMTP, we illustrate that such adaptation can arise from associative memory processes underlying temporal preparation.",

    "abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a key kinase involved in the induction of long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse. Therefore, elucidating the dynamics of ERK activation after LTF-inducing protocols is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal and synaptic plasticity. ERK activation has rich dynamic features. After a single stimulus, activation peaks 45-minute later and declines rapidly, but after two stimuli spaced 45 min apart, activation persists (Kopec et al. 2015). However, little is known about possible changes in ERK activation for periods beyond 3 h. Given its key role in long-term learning, understanding the dynamics of ERK at 3 h and beyond might provide insights into new protocols that could enhance memory retention. Three different protocols that induce LTF were used to probe the dynamics of ERK activation. The first, termed the Standard protocol, consists of five 5-min pulses of serotonin (5-HT) with regular interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 20 min. The second, termed the Enhanced protocol, consists of five pulses of 5-HT with irregular ISIs identified with the use of computer simulations. This protocol induces greater and longer-lasting LTF than the Standard protocol. A third protocol, termed the two-pulse protocol, consists of just two 5-min pulses of 5-HT with an ISI of 45 min. Immunofluorescence revealed complex patterns of ERK activation up to 24 h after 5-HT treatment. The Standard and two-pulse protocols led to an immediate increase in active, phosphorylated ERK (pERK), which decayed within 5 h post treatment. A second wave of increased pERK was detected at 18 h post treatment. This late phase was blocked by RpcAMP (an inhibitor of protein kinase A), and by TrkB Fc and TGF-{beta} RII F antagonists. The latter two are chimeras that act via receptor sequestration. These results suggest that complex interactions among kinase pathways and growth factor cascades contribute to the late increase of ERK activity after different LTF-inducing protocols. Interestingly, ERK activity returned to basal levels 24 h after the Standard or two-pulse protocol, but remained elevated 24 h after the Enhanced protocol. This finding may help explain, in part, why the Enhanced protocol is superior to the Standard protocol in inducing long-lasting LTF.",

The specificity of TCR:peptide-MHC interactions thus underlies nearly all adaptive immune responses. Despite intense interest, generalizable predictive models of TCR:peptide-MHC specificity remain out of reach; two key barriers are the diversity of TCR recognition modes and the paucity of training data. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction achieved by deep neural networks, we evaluated structural modeling as a potential avenue for prediction of TCR epitope specificity. We show that a specialized version of the neural network predictor AlphaFold can generate models of TCR:peptide-MHC interactions that can be used to discriminate correct from incorrect peptide epitopes with substantial accuracy. Although much work remains to be done for these predictions to have widespread practical utility, we are optimistic that deep learning-based structural modeling represents a path to generalizable prediction of TCR:peptide-MHC interaction specificity.",

Geobacter sp. are the keystone organisms in electrogenic biofilms, as their respiration consumes fermentation products produced by other organisms and reduces a terminal electron acceptor e.g. iron oxide or an electrode. To respire extracellular electron acceptors with a wide range of redox potentials, G. sulfurreducens has a complex network of respiratory proteins, many of which are membrane-bound3-5. We have identified intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) structures in G. sulfurreducens. This ICM is an invagination of the inner membrane that has folded and organized by an unknown mechanism, often but not always located near the tip of a cell. Using confocal microscopy, we can identify that at least half of the cells contain an ICM when grown on low potential anode surfaces, whereas cells grown at higher potential anode surfaces or using fumarate as electron acceptor had significantly lower ICM frequency. 3D models developed from cryo-electron tomograms show the ICM to be a continuous extension of the inner membrane in contact with the cytoplasmic and periplasmic space. The differential abundance of ICM in cells grown under different thermodynamic conditions supports the hypothesis that it is an adaptation to limited energy availability, as an increase in membrane-bound respiratory proteins could increase electron flux. Thus, the ICM provides extra inner-membrane surface to increase the abundance of these proteins. G. sulfurreducens is the first Thermodesulfobacterium or metal-oxide reducer found to produce ICMs.",

    "abstract": "Compost teas (CTs) are fermented watery compost extracts that can be made with a wide variety of organic ingredients. These extracts are applied on plants to promote plant growth and increase protection against pathogens. Several studies have shown that the live micro-organisms present in these teas play an important role in plant protection. Still, our knowledge on the identity and functionality of bacterial communities in CTs remains limited. Moreover, CTs are a heterogeneous group, as various combinations of ingredients, fermentation parameters and application guidelines are possible and little is known on the current practices in commercially available products. Consequently, also the microbial communities in these commercially available CTs are unknown. Here, we surveyed 68 CTs on ingredients, claims and guidelines regarding preparation and application. This revealed that most products were sold in dried form which needed to be rehydrated by the customers. Moreover, kelp, humic acid, sugar and molasses, were common ingredients. Additionally, we investigated the bacterial communities of eight products, covering different ingredients and preparations, using sequencing and culture-based techniques. Bacterial communities were remarkably similar at genus level, with Pseudomonas, Massilia, Comamonas, Chryseobacterium, Brevundimonas and Acinetobacter as most prevalent genera. The genus Pseudomonas was more abundant in CTs that were prepared without aeration. Moreover, differences between liquid and dry products revealed the importance of formulation to secure the viability of the desired microbes. This study has given insight in common practices in CTs on the market, their microbial composition, and highlighted several discrepancies with current literature.\n\nImportanceCompost teas are fermented watery compost extracts which are used in professional and amateur horticulture to promote plant growth and suppress plant diseases. Beneficial microbes present in these extracts are suggested to play an important role in the mode of action. However, little is known on the identity and functionality of the bacteria in compost teas. Moreover, compost teas are a heterogeneous group of products that can be made with numerous combinations of ingredient and fermentation parameters and little is known on current practices in products available on the market. Therefore, we surveyed these practices in 68 commercial products and for a subset of these, we explored their bacterial communities using both culture dependent and independent techniques. This study has unveiled the common practices on the market, their microbial communities, and highlighted several discrepancies between commercial practices and scientific research.",

    "abstract": "Eilat virus (EILV) is an insect-specific alphavirus that has the potential to be developed into a tool to combat mosquito-borne pathogens. However, its mosquito host range and transmission routes are not well understood. Here we fill this gap by investigating EILVs host competence and tissue tropism in five mosquito species: Aedes aegypti, Culex tarsalis, Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles stephensi, and Anopheles albimanus. Of the tested species, Cx. tarsalis was the most competent host for EILV. The virus was found in Cx. tarsalis ovaries, but no vertical or venereal transmission was observed. Culex tarsalis also transmitted EILV via saliva, suggesting the potential for horizontal transmission between an unknown vertebrate or invertebrate host. We found that reptile (turtle and snake) cells lines were not competent for EILV infection. We tested a potential invertebrate host (Manduca sexta caterpillars) but found they were not susceptible to EILV infection. Together, our results suggest that EILV could be developed as a tool to target pathogenic viruses that use Culex tarsalis as a vector. Our work sheds light on the infection and transmission dynamics of a poorly understood insect-specific virus and reveals it may infect a broader range of mosquito species than previously recognized.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe recent discovery of insect-specific alphaviruses presents opportunities both to study the biology of virus host range and to develop them into tools against pathogenic arboviruses. Here we characterize the host range and transmission of Eilat virus in five mosquito species. We find that Culex tarsalis--a vector of harmful human pathogens including West Nile Virus--is a competent host of Eilat virus. However, how this virus is transmitted between mosquitoes remains unclear. We find that Eilat virus infects the tissues necessary for both vertical and horizontal transmission--a crucial step in discerning how Eilat virus maintains itself in nature.",

    "abstract": "Vascular Endothelial Cells (EC) plasticity is key to homeostasis and its disruption is a hallmark of diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. The EC lineage has evolved to address in parallel sensor and actuator functions. This ability is reflected in remarkable phenotypical heterogeneity of EC across different tissues, within the same tissue, and within the same vascular bed as demonstrated by single cell image analysis and transcriptomics studies. However, how the molecular signalling dynamics in EC could generate and maintain such heterogeneity in different contexts is still largely unexplored. Recently we reported that confluent EC have spatially heterogeneous NOTCH signalling pathway (NSP) levels in vitro as confirmed from analysis of available OMICS databases. Here, we show that spatial heterogeneity of NSP levels is a feature of aortic murine endothelia in vivo and recapitulated by human EC in culture despite absence of signalling from mural cells. We study lateral induction and inhibition, cis-interactions and signalling, and target genes autoregulation in NSP. Using mathematical models and experimental observations we report that NSP dynamics can generate stable, periodic, and asynchronous oscillations of the NSP target HES1. Importantly, we observe that cell contact dependent NSP signal oscillations is the most likely parsimonious mechanistic hypothesis justifying observed spatial heterogeneity in endothelia. We propose that NSP is sufficient to enable individual EC in monolayers to acquire different phenotypes dynamically explaining robustness of quiescent endothelia in performing parallel functions.",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton is a ubiquitous participant in cellular functions that maintain viability, but how it controls programmed cell death processes is not well understood. Here we show that in response to DNA damage, human cells form juxtanuclear F-actin-rich territories that coordinate the organized progression of apoptosome assembly to caspase activation. These cytoskeletal compartments are created by the actin nucleation factors JMY, WHAMM, and the Arp2/3 complex, and they exclude proteins that inhibit JMY and WHAMM activity. Within the territories, JMY localization overlaps with punctate structures containing the core apoptosome components cytochrome c and Apaf-1. The F-actin-rich areas also encompass initiator caspase-9 and clusters of a cleaved form of executioner caspase-3, while restricting accessibility of the caspase inhibitor XIAP. The clustering and potency of caspase-3 activation are positively regulated by the amount of actin polymerized by JMY and WHAMM. These results indicate that JMY-mediated actin reorganization functions in apoptotic signaling by coupling the biogenesis of apoptosomes to the localized processing of caspases.",

    "abstract": "Echinoderm embryos have been model systems for cell and developmental biology for over 150 years, in good part because of their optical clarity. Discoveries that shaped our understanding of fertilization, cell division and cell differentiation were only possible because of the transparency of sea urchin eggs and embryos, which allowed direct observations of intracellular structures. More recently, live imaging of sea urchin embryos, coupled with fluorescence microscopy, has proven pivotal to uncovering mechanisms of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell migration and gastrulation. However, live imaging has mainly been performed on sea urchin embryos, while echinoderms include numerous experimentally tractable species that present interesting variation in key aspects of morphogenesis, including differences in embryo compaction and mechanisms of blastula formation. The study of such variation would allow us not only to understand how tissues are formed in echinoderms, but also to identify which changes in cell shape, cell-matrix and cell-cell contact formation are more likely to result in evolution of new embryonic shapes.\n\nHere we argue that adapting live imaging techniques to more echinoderm species will be fundamental to exploit such an evolutionary approach to the study of morphogenesis, as it will allow measuring differences in dynamic cellular behaviors - such as changes in cell shape and cell adhesion - between species. We briefly review existing methods for live imaging of echinoderm embryos and describe in detail how we adapted those methods to allow long-term live imaging of several species, namely the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus and the sea stars Patiria miniata and Patiriella regularis. We outline procedures to successfully label, mount and image early embryos for 10-16 hours, from cleavage stages to early blastula. We show that data obtained with these methods allows 3D segmentation and tracking of individual cells over time, the first step to analyze how cell shape and cell contact differ among species.\n\nThe methods presented here can be easily adopted by most cell and developmental biology laboratories and adapted to successfully image early embryos of additional species, therefore broadening our understanding of the evolution of morphogenesis.",

We uncovered the genetic, cell signaling and metabolic processes underlying specification of the progenitors and how they contribute to subtypes of endothelial and interstitial embryonic and postnatal valvular cells. Using clonal genetic tracing with multicolor reporter, we describe specific modes of growth of endocardial cell-derived clones which build up in a proper manner functional valve leaflets.\n\nOur data reveal how both genetic and metabolic specification mechanisms specifically drive the fate of a subset of endocardial cells toward valve progenitors and their distinct clonal contribution to the formation of the valve.",

Germline Kif17 deletion in mice results in cerebellar hypoplasia due to reduced CGNP proliferation, a consequence of decreased HH pathway activity mediated through decreased Sonic HH (SHH) protein. Notably, Purkinje cell-specific Kif17 deletion phenocopies Kif17 germline mutants. Surprisingly, CGNP-specific Kif17 deletion results in the opposite phenotype- increased CGNP proliferation and HH target gene expression due to altered GLI transcription factor processing. Together these data identify KIF17 as a key regulator of HH-dependent cerebellar development, with dual and opposing roles in HH-producing Purkinje cells and HH-responding CGNPS.\n\nTeaserDuring cerebellar development, the KIF17 microtubule motor performs opposing roles in HH-producing and HH-responding cells.",

    "abstract": "The role of intraspecific variability (IV) in shaping community dynamics and species coexistence has been intensively discussed over the past decade and modelling studies have played an important role in that respect. However, these studies often implicitly assume that IV can be represented by independent random draws around speciesspecific mean parameters. This major assumption has largely remained undiscussed, although a great part of observed IV is structured in space or time, in particular when environmental dimensions that influence individual performance are imperfectly characterised or unobserved in the field. To test the impact of this strong assumption on the outcome of community dynamics models, we designed a simulation experiment where we varied the level of knowledge of the environment in virtual communities, resulting in different relative importance of explained vs unexplained individual variation in performance. We used a community dynamics simulator to generate communities where the unexplained individual variation is, or is not, added as an unstructured random noise. Communities simulated with unstructured IV never reached the community diversity and composition of those where all the variation was explained and structured (perfect knowledge model). This highlights that incorporating unstructured IV (i.e. a random noise) to account for unexplained (but structured) variation can lead to incorrect simulations of community dynamics. In addition, the effects of unstructured IV on community diversity and composition depended on the relative importance of structured vs unstructured IV, i.e. on the level of knowledge of the environment, which may partly explain the contrasting results of previous studies on the effect of IV on species coexistence. In particular, the effect of unstructured IV on community diversity was positive when the proportion of structured IV vs unstructured IV in the model was low, but negative when this proportion was high. This is because unstructured random noise can either limit the competitive exclusion of inferior competitors in low dimensions or destabilise thigh niche partitioning in high dimension. Our study suggests that it is crucial to account for the sources and structure of observed IV in real communities to better understand its effect on community assembly and properly include it in community dynamics models.",

The in vivo retrotransposition capacity of an L1 copy is defined by both its sequence integrity and epigenetic status, including DNA methylation of the monomeric units constituting young mouse L1 promoters. Locus-specific L1 methylation dynamics during development may therefore elucidate and explain spatiotemporal niches of endogenous retrotransposition, but remain unresolved. Here, we interrogate the retrotransposition efficiency and epigenetic fate of source (donor) L1s, identified as mobile in vivo. We demonstrate that promoter monomer loss consistently attenuates the relative retrotransposition potential of their offspring (daughter) L1 insertions. We also observe that most donor/daughter L1 pairs are efficiently methylated upon differentiation in vivo and in vitro. We employ Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing to resolve L1 methylation genome-wide and with locus-specific resolution, revealing a distinctive \"smile\" pattern in methylation levels across the L1 promoter region and thereby elucidating a molecular mechanism potentially underpinning L1 promoter shortening.

    "abstract": "A birds wings are articulated to its body via highly mobile shoulder joints. The wings possess an impressive range of motion, which allows for movements that can modulate the production of aerodynamic load in flight. This is crucial for stability and control--particularly in gusty or turbulent environments. In this study, we develop a dynamics model to examine how a bird-scale gliding aircraft can use wing-root hinges (analogous to avian shoulder joints) to reject the initial impact of a strong upward gust. Our idea requires that the spanwise centre of pressure and the centre of percussion of the hinging wing start, and stay, in good initial alignment (the centre of percussion here is related to the idea of a  sweet spot on a bat, as in cricket or baseball). We propose a method for achieving this rejection passively, for which the essential ingredients are: (i) well-considered lift and mass distributions; (ii) constant-torque hinges; and (iii) a wing whose sections stall softly. When configured correctly, the gusted wings will first pivot on their hinges without disturbing the fuselage of the aircraft, affording time for other corrective actions to engage. We expect this system to enhance the control of aircraft that fly in gusty conditions.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes have emerged as key players in cell-to-cell communication in both physiological and pathological processes in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Thus far, the intracellular pathways involved in uptake and trafficking of exosomes within different cell types of the brain (microglia and astrocytes) are poorly understood. In our study, the endocytic processes and subcellular sorting of exosomes were investigated in primary glial cells, particularly linked with the exosome-associated -synuclein (-syn) transmission. Mouse microglia and astrocytic primary cultures were incubated with DiI-stained mouse brain-derived exosomes. The internalization and trafficking pathways were analysed in cells treated with pharmacological reagents that block the major endocytic pathways. Brain-derived exosomes were internalized by both glial cell types; however, uptake was more efficient in microglia than in astrocytes. Colocalization of exosomes with early and late endocytic markers (Rab5, Lamp1) indicated that exosomes are sorted to endolysosomes for subsequent processing. Treatment with Cytochalasin D, that blocks actin-dependent phagocytosis and/or macropinocytosis, inhibited exosome entry into glial cells, whereas treatment with inhibitors that strip off cholesterol from the plasma membrane, induced uptake, however differentially altered endosomal sorting. Exosome-associated fibrillar -Syn was efficiently internalized and detected in Rab5- and Lamp1-positive compartments within microglia. Our study strongly suggests that exosomes enter glial cells through an actin network-dependent endocytic pathway and are sorted to endolysosomes for subsequent processing. Further, brain-derived exosomes are capable of mediating cell-to-glia transmission of pathological -Syn that is also targeted to the endosomal pathway, suggesting a possible beneficial role in microglia-mediated clearance of toxic protein aggregates, present in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsHepatocyte sources that are expandable in vitro are required for liver regenerative medicine and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the physiological functions of the liver. Liver ductal organoids (LDOs) comprise liver tissue stem cells with a bipotential capacity to differentiate into hepatocyte and cholangiocyte lineages, and can thus serve as a hepatocyte source. However, using current differentiation methods LDOs differentiate into immature hepatocytes while retaining strong cholangiocyte characteristics. We thus investigated an alternative differentiation method for LDOs to achieve hepatocyte maturation.\n\nMethodsWe extracted 12 candidate transcription factors to induce hepatocyte differentiation by comparing their gene expression in LDOs and liver tissues. After evaluating the effects of these transcription factors on LDOs, we analyzed the comprehensive gene expression profile, protein expression, and hepatic function in the transduced organoids.\n\nResultsWe identified a combination of four transcription factors, Hnf4a, Foxa1, Prox1, and Hlf, which upregulated hepatic lineage markers and downregulated cholangiocyte markers. Differentiation-induced LDOs showed more hepatocyte-specific characteristics than those with the conventional method, enhancing the transition from cholangiocyte to hepatocyte lineage and hepatic functions, such as liver-specific protein synthesis, lipid droplet deposition, and ammonia detoxification.\n\nConclusionTransduction of the four transcription factors (Hnf4a, Foxa1, Prox1, Hlf) is a promising strategy to promote the differentiation of LDOs to obtain mature hepatocyte-like cells with better functionality.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged water stress can reduce plant growth and fitness and may shift rhizoplane microbial communities. Although drought affects microbial structure of many plant species, it is still poorly understood whether closely related plant species host distinct microbial communities or respond similarly to drought. To explore this question, eight members of the Streptanthus clade with varying affinity to serpentine were subjected to three watering regimes. Rhizoplane bacterial communities were described using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and we explored the impact of watering treatment and plant species on alpha diversity, differential abundance, and beta diversity of soil bacterial communities. Among most plant species, reduced watering also reduced alpha diversity, but plant species did not strongly impact alpha diversity. Drought treatment reduced microbial community dissimilarity among samples: bacterial communities were more similar when plants received less water. Watering altered the relative abundance of bacterial genera within Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria, which responded similarly in the rhizoplane of most plant species. These results suggest that prolonged water stress in Streptanthus spp. can result in convergent microbial communities among plant species. We suggest the functional consequences of these shifts be examined to assess effects on plant and microbial fitness under drought conditions.",

    "abstract": "When faced with navigating back somewhere we have been before we might either retrace our steps or seek a shorter path. Both choices have costs. Here, we ask whether it is possible to characterize formally the choice of navigational plans as a bounded rational process that trades off the quality of the plan (e.g., its length) and the cognitive cost required to find and implement it. We analyze the navigation strategies of two groups of people that are firstly trained to follow a \"default policy\" taking a route in a virtual maze and then asked to navigate to various known goal destinations, either in the way they want (\"Go To Goal\") or by taking novel shortcuts (\"Take Shortcut\"). We address these wayfinding problems using InfoRL: an information-theoretic approach that formalizes the cognitive cost of devising a navigational plan, as the informational cost to deviate from a well-learned route (the \"default policy\"). In InfoRL, optimality refers to finding the best trade-off between route length and the amount of control information required to find it. We report five main findings. First, the navigational strategies automatically identified by InfoRL correspond closely to different routes (optimal or suboptimal) in the virtual reality map, which were annotated by hand in previous research. Second, people deliberate more in places where the value of investing cognitive resources (i.e., relevant goal information) is greater. Third, compared to the group of people who receive the \"Go To Goal\" instruction, those who receive the \"Take Shortcut\" instruction find shorter but less optimal solutions, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of finding optimal shortcuts. Fourth, those who receive the \"Go To Goal\" instruction modulate flexibly their cognitive resources, depending on the benefits of finding the shortcut. Finally, we found a surprising amount of variability in the choice of navigational strategies and resource investment across participants. Taken together, these results illustrate the benefits of using InfoRL to address navigational planning problems from a bounded rational perspective.",

    "abstract": "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a molecular machine that Gram-negative bacteria have adapted for multiple functions, including interbacterial competition. Bacteria use the T6SS to deliver protein effectors into adjacent cells to kill rivals and establish niche dominance. Central to T6SS mediated bacterial competition is an arms race to acquire diverse effectors to attack and neutralize target cells. The peptidoglycan has a central role in bacterial cell physiology, and effectors that biochemically modify peptidoglycan structure effectively induce cell death. One such T6SS effector is Tlde1a from Salmonella Typhimurium. Tlde1a functions as an LD-carboxypeptidase to cleave tetrapeptide stems and as an LD-transpeptidase to exchange the terminal D-alanine of a tetrapeptide stem with a noncanonical D-amino acid. To understand how Tlde1a exhibits toxicity at the molecular level, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of Tlde1a alone and in complex with D-amino acids. Our structural data revealed that Tlde1a possesses a unique LD-transpeptidase fold consisting of a dual pocket active site with a capping subdomain. This includes an exchange pocket to bind a D-amino acid for exchange and a catalytic pocket to position the D-alanine of a tetrapeptide stem for cleavage. Toxicity assays in Escherichia coli and in vitro peptidoglycan biochemical assays with Tlde1a variants, correlate Tlde1a molecular features directly to its biochemical functions. We observe that the LD-carboxypeptidase and LD-transpeptidase activities of Tlde1a are both structural and functionally linked. Overall, our data highlights how an LD-transpeptidase fold has been structurally altered to create a toxic effector in the T6SS arms race.",

    "abstract": "The integration of functional responses in the human spinal cord into the nervous system is not well understood. Herein we demonstrate the first in-human functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) of spinal cord response to epidural electrical stimulation. fUSI is a minimally invasive neuroimaging technique that can record blood flow at a level of spatial and temporal precision not previously achieved in the human spinal cord. By leveraging fUSI and epidural electrical spinal cord stimulation in patients who underwent surgery, we recorded and characterized for the first-time hemodynamic responses of the human spinal cord to an electrical neuromodulatory intervention commonly used for treating pain, and increasingly used for sensory-motor and autonomic functions. We found that the hemodynamic response to epidural stimulation reflects a spatiotemporal modulation of the spinal cord circuitry not previously recognized. The impact of this analytical capability is significant for several reasons. It offers a mechanism to assess blood flow changes with a new level of precision which can be obtained in real time under in vivo conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate that fUSI can successfully decode the spinal cord state in a single trial, which is of fundamental importance for developing real-time closed-loop neuromodulation systems. Also, we show that spinal cord hemodynamic changes due to epidural electrical stimulation occur primarily at the level of small vessels. Overall, our work is a critical step towards developing a vital technique to study spinal cord function and understand the potential effects of clinical neuromodulation for spinal cord and other neurological disorders.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe first in-human quantitative evaluation of spinal cord hemodynamics using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI).",

Most of the existing methods for single cell atlas analysis use cells as the reference unit to combine datasets. However, such methods suffer from the inability to effectively integrate cross-modality data, hindering downstream gene-based analysis, and loss of genuine biological variations. Here we present a new data integration method, GIANT, which is for the first time designed for the atlas-scale analysis from the gene perspective. GIANT first converts datasets from different modalities into gene graphs, and then recursively embeds genes in the graphs into a latent space without additional alignment. Applying GIANT to the HuBMAP datasets creates a unified gene embedding space across multiple human tissues and data modalities, where gene representations reflect the functions of genes in their cells. Further evaluations demonstrate the usefulness of GIANT in discovering diverse gene functions, and underlying gene regulations in cells of different tissues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo achieve replicative immortality, most cancers develop a telomere maintenance mechanism, such as reactivation of telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). There are limited data on the prevalence and clinical significance of ALT in pediatric brain tumors, and ALT-directed therapy is not available.\n\nMethodsWe performed C-circle analysis (CCA) on 579 pediatric brain tumors that had corresponding tumor/normal whole genome sequencing through the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA). We detected ALT in 6.9% (n=40/579) of these tumors and completed additional validation by ultrabright telomeric foci in situ on a subset of these tumors. We used CCA to validate TelomereHunter for computational prediction of ALT status and focus subsequent analyses on pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) Finally, we examined whether ALT is associated with recurrent somatic or germline alterations.\n\nResultsALT is common in pHGG (n=24/63, 38.1%), but occurs infrequently in other pediatric brain tumors (<3%). Somatic ATRX mutations occur in 50% of ALT+ pHGG and in 30% of ALT-pHGG. Rare pathogenic germline variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes are significantly associated with an increased occurrence of ALT. Conclusions: We demonstrate that ATRX is mutated in only a subset of ALT+ pHGG, suggesting other mechanisms of ATRX loss of function or alterations in other genes may be associated with the development of ALT in these patients. We show that germline variants in MMR are associated with development of ALT in patients with pHGG.\n\nKey PointsATRX alterations are frequent, but not required, for an ALT phenotype in pHGGs\n\npHGG patients with germline mismatch repair variants have higher rate of ALT + tumors TelomereHunter is validated to predict ALT in pHGGs\n\nImportance of the StudyWe performed orthogonal molecular and computational analyses to detect the presence of alternative lengthening of telomeres in a highly characterized cohort of pediatric brain tumors. We demonstrate that many pHGG utilize ALT without a mutation in ATRX, suggesting either loss of function of ATRX via an alternative mechanism or an alternate means of development of ALT. We show that germline variants in MMR genes are significantly associated with ALT in pHGG. Our work adds to the biological understanding of the development of ALT and provides an approach to stratify patients who may benefit from future ALT-directed therapies in this patient population.",

However, the role of m6A-mediated gene regulation after drug treatment or resistance is poorly understood. Here, we report that m6A modification of mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13) determines the sensitivity of cancer cells to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)- targeting chemotherapeutic agent rapamycin. mTORC1 induces m6A modification of MAPK13 mRNA at its 3 untranslated region (3UTR) through methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-METTL14-Wilms tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) methyltransferase complex, thereby stimulating its mRNA degradation via an m6A reader protein YTH domain family protein 2 (YTHDF2). Rapamycin blunts this process and stabilizes MAPK13. Unexpectedly, MAPK13 silencing suppresses cell growth and enhances rapamycins anti-cancer effects, suggesting that MAPK13 is an oncogenic gene activated by rapamycin via a feedback regulation. Together, our data indicate that rapamycin-mediated MAPK13 mRNA stabilization may confer drug resistance, and it can thus be a therapeutic target to sensitize cancer cells to rapamycin.",

    "abstract": "Early events associated with chronic inflammation and cancer involve significant remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which greatly affects its composition and functional properties. Using lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), a chronic inflammation-associated cancer (CIAC), we optimized a robust proteomic pipeline to discover potential biomarker signatures and protein changes specifically in the stroma. We combined ECM enrichment from fresh human tissues, data-independent acquisition strategies, and stringent statistical processing to analyze  Tumor and matched adjacent histologically normal ( Matched Normal) tissues from patients with LSCC. Overall, 1,802 protein groups were quantified with at least two unique peptides, and 56% of those proteins were annotated as  extracellular. Confirming dramatic ECM remodeling during CIAC progression, 529 proteins were significantly altered in the  Tumor compared to  Matched Normal tissues. The signature was typified by a coordinated loss of basement membrane proteins and small leucine-rich proteins. The dramatic increase in the stromal levels of SERPINH1/heat shock protein 47, that was discovered using our ECM proteomic pipeline, was validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of  Tumor and  Matched Normal tissues, obtained from an independent cohort of LSCC patients. This integrated workflow provided novel insights into ECM remodeling during CIAC progression, and identified potential biomarker signatures and future therapeutic targets.\n\nStatement of significance of the studyThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex scaffolding network composed of glycoproteins, proteoglycans and collagens, which binds soluble factors and, most importantly, significantly impacts cell fate and function. Alterations of ECM homeostasis create a microenvironment promoting tumor formation and progression, therefore deciphering molecular details of aberrant ECM remodeling is essential. Here, we present a multi-laboratory and refined proteomic workflow, featuring i) the prospective collection of tumor and matched histologically normal tissues from patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, ii) the enrichment for ECM proteins, and iii) subsequent label-free data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based quantification. DIA is a powerful strategy to comprehensively profile and quantify all detectable precursor ions contained in the biological samples, with high quantification accuracy and reproducibility. When combined with very stringent statistical cutoffs, this unbiased strategy succeeded in capturing robust and highly confident proteins changes associated with cancer, despite biological variability between individuals. This label-free quantification workflow provided the flexibility required for ongoing prospective studies. Discussions with clinicians, surgeons, pathologists, and cancer biologists represent an opportunity to interrogate the DIA digitalized maps of the samples for newly formulated questions and hypotheses, thus gaining insights into the continuum of the disease and opening the path to novel ECM-targeted therapies.",

Here we study the effects of ELS and dietary PUFA ratio on hippocampal mRNA and miRNA expression in adulthood, both under basal and inflammatory conditions.\n\nMale mice were exposed to chronic ELS by the limiting bedding and nesting material paradigm from postnatal day(P)2 to P9, and provided with a diet containing a high (15:1.1) or low (1.1:1) {omega}6 linoleic acid to {omega}3 alpha-linolenic acid ratio from P2 to P42. At P120, memory was assessed using the object location task. Subsequently, a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection was given and 24 hours later hippocampal genome-wide mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression was measured using microarray.\n\nAn integrated miRNA - mRNA analysis revealed that ELS and early diet induced miRNA driven mRNA expression changes into adulthood. Under basal conditions both ELS and the diet affected molecular pathways related to hippocampal plasticity, with a low {omega}6/{omega}3 ratio diet specific activation of molecular pathways associated with improved hippocampal plasticity and learning and memory in mice previously exposed to ELS (e.g., CREB signaling and endocannabinoid neuronal synapse pathway). LPS induced miRNA and mRNA expression was strongly influenced by both ELS and early diet. In mice fed the high {omega}6/{omega}3 diet, LPS increased miRNA expression leading to activation of inflammatory pathways. In contrast, in mice fed the low {omega}6/{omega}3 diet, LPS reduced miRNA expression and altered target mRNA expression ultimately leading to limited activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and inhibition of pathways associated with hippocampal plasticity which was especially apparent in mice previously exposed to ELS.\n\nThis data provides molecular insights into how the low {omega}6/{omega}3 diet during development could exert its long-lasting beneficial effects on hippocampal plasticity and learning and memory especially in a vulnerable population exposed to stress early in life, providing the basis for the development of intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by poor dim light vision, myopia, and nystagmus, that is caused by mutations in genes critical for signal transmission between photoreceptors and depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). One such gene, LRIT3, is required for assembly of the post-synaptic signaling complex (signalplex) at the dendritic tips of DBCs, although the number of signalplex components impacted is greater in cone DBCs than in rod bipolar cells. This difference raises the possibility that LRIT3 is expressed both pre- and post-synaptically at cone terminals. Here we show that rAAV-mediated expression of LRIT3 in cones results in robust rescue of cone DBC signalplex components and restores downstream visual function, as measured by the light adapted ERG b-wave and electrophysiological recordings of BCs and RGCs. These data show that LRIT3 successfully restores function to cone DBCs in a trans-synaptic manner, potentially paving the way for therapeutic intervention in LRIT3-associated cCSNB.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOne characteristic of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is compulsive drinking, or drinking despite negative consequences. When quinine is used to model such aversion-resistant drinking, female rodents typically are more resistant to punishment than males. Using an operant response task where C57BL/6J responded for ethanol (EtOH) mixed with quinine, we previously demonstrated that female mice tolerate higher concentrations of quinine in EtOH than males. Here, we aimed to determine if this female vulnerability to aversion-resistant drinking behavior is similarly observed when footshock punishment is used.\n\nMethodsMale and female C57BL/6J mice were trained to respond for 10% EtOH in an operant task on a fixed ratio 3 schedule. After consistent responding, mice were tested in a punishment session using either a 0.25 mA or 0.35 mA footshock. To assess footshock sensitivity, a subset of mice underwent a flinch, jump, vocalize test in which behavioral responses to increasing amplitudes of footshock (0.05 - 0.95 mA) were assessed. In a separate cohort of mice, males and females were trained to respond for 2.5% sucrose and responses were punished using a 0.25 mA footshock.\n\nResultsMales and females continued to respond for 10% EtOH when paired with a 0.25 mA footshock. Females alone continued to respond for EtOH when a 0.35 mA footshock was delivered. Both males and females reduced responding for 2.5% sucrose when punished with a 0.25 mA footshock. Finally, footshock sensitivity in the flinch, jump, vocalize test did not differ by sex.\n\nConclusionsFemales continue to respond for 10% EtOH despite a 0.35 mA footshock and this behavior is not due to differences in footshock sensitivity between males and females. These results suggest that female C57BL/6J mice are generally more resistant to punishment in an operant self-administration paradigm. These results add to the literature characterizing aversion-resistant alcohol drinking behaviors in females.",

In this study, we constructed a comprehensive panel of pseudoviruses (PsVs), including wild-type, Delta, BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.2.3.1, BA.2.10.1, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.13, BA.2.75 and BA.4/BA.5, with accumulate coverage reached 91% according to the proportion of sequences deposited in GISAID database since Jan 1st, 2022. We collected serum samples from healthy adults at day14 post homologous booster with BBIBP-CorV, or heterologous booster with ZF2001, primed with two doses of BBIBP-CorV, or from convalescents immunized with three-dose inactivated vaccines prior to infection with Omicron BA.2, and tested their neutralization activity on this panel of PsVs. Our results demonstrated that all Omicron sub-lineages showed substantial evasion of neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination and infection, although BA.2.75 accumulated the largest number of mutations in its spike, BA.4 and BA.5 showed the strongest serum escape. However, BA.2 breakthrough infection could remarkably elevated neutralization titers against all different variants, especially titers against BA.2 and its derivative sub-lineages.",

    "abstract": "NF-{kappa}B-Inducing Kinase (NIK), which is essential for the activation of the noncanonical NF-{kappa}B pathway, regulates diverse processes in immunity, development, and disease. While recent studies have elucidated important functions of NIK in adaptive immune cells and cancer cell metabolism, the role of NIK in metabolic-driven inflammatory responses in innate immune cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that NIK-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibit defects in mitochondrial-dependent metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which impairs the acquisition of a pro-repair, anti-inflammatory phenotype. Subsequently, NIK-deficient mice exhibit skewing of myeloid cells characterized by aberrant eosinophil, monocyte, and macrophage cell populations in the blood, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. Furthermore, NIK-deficient blood monocytes display hyperresponsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and elevated TNF production ex vivo. These findings suggest that NIK governs metabolic rewiring, which is critical for balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory myeloid immune cell function. Overall, our work highlights a previously unrecognized role for NIK as a molecular rheostat that fine-tunes immunometabolism in innate immunity and suggests that metabolic dysfunction may be an important driver of inflammatory diseases caused by aberrant NIK expression or activity.\n\nKey PointsO_LINIK-deficient macrophages exhibit impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation\nC_LIO_LINIK-deficient mice have more inflammatory myeloid cells in blood and bone marrow\nC_LIO_LINIK-dependent metabolic rewiring shapes pro- and anti-inflammatory innate immunity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Citrobacter rodentium is an attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen used to model enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections in mice. During colonization, C. rodentium must adapt to stresses in the gastrointestinal tract such as antimicrobial peptides, pH changes, and bile salts. The Cpx envelope stress response (ESR) is a two-component system used by some bacteria to remediate stress by modulating gene expression and is necessary for C. rodentium pathogenesis in mice. Here, we utilized simulated colonic fluid (SCF) to mimic the gastrointestinal environment which we show strongly induces the Cpx ESR and highlights a fitness defect specific to the {Delta}cpxRA mutant. While investigating genes in the Cpx regulon that may contribute to C. rodentium pathogenesis, we found that the absence of the Cpx ESR resulted in higher expression of the LEE master regulator, ler, and the genes yebE, ygiB, bssR, and htpX relied on CpxRA for proper expression. We then determined that CpxRA and select gene mutants were essential for proper growth in SCF when in the presence of extraneous stressors and in competition. Although none of the Cpx-regulated gene mutants exhibited marked virulence phenotypes in vivo, the {Delta}cpxRA mutant had reduced colonization and attenuated virulence, as previously determined, which replicated the in vitro growth phenotypes specific to SCF. Overall, these results indicate that the {Delta}cpxRA virulence defect is not due to any single Cpx regulon gene examined. Instead, attenuation may be the result of defective growth in the colonic environment resulting from the collective impact of multiple Cpx-regulated genes.",

    "abstract": "Synonymous codons were originally viewed as interchangeable with no phenotypic consequences. However, over the years a substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that some synonymous substitutions can perturb a variety of gene expression and protein homeostasis mechanisms, including translational efficiency, translational fidelity and co-translational folding of the encoded protein. To date, synonymous codon-derived perturbations have largely focused on effects within a single gene. Here we show that synonymous codon substitutions made far within an E. coli plasmid-encoded protein coding sequence frequently led to significant upregulation of a neighboring, upstream gene. Notably, in four out of nine synonymously recoded sequences, significant upregulation of the upstream gene arose due to cryptic transcription of the anti-sense strand. Surprisingly, cryptic transcription of the upstream gene readily bypassed its native transcriptional repression mechanism. Even more surprisingly, translation of this upstream gene correlates closely with the subset of its mRNA transcribed from the cryptic internal promoter, rather than its total mRNA level. These results suggest that synonymous codons in bacteria may be under selection to both preserve the amino acid sequence of the encoded gene while also avoiding internal sequence elements that significantly perturb transcriptional and translational regulation of neighboring genes.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically regulate proteins and biological pathways, typically through the combined effects of multiple PTMs. Lysine residues are targeted for various PTMs, including malonylation and succinylation. However, PTMs offer specific challenges to mass spectrometry-based proteomics during data acquisition and processing. Thus, novel and innovative workflows using data-independent acquisition (DIA) ensure confident PTM identification, precise site localization, and accurate and robust label-free quantification. In this study, we present a powerful approach that combines antibody-based enrichment with comprehensive DIA acquisitions and spectral library-free data processing using directDIA (Spectronaut). Identical DIA data can be used to generate spectral libraries and comprehensively identify and quantify PTMs, reducing the amount of enriched sample and acquisition time needed, while offering a fully automated workflow. We analyzed brains from wild-type and Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5)-knock-out mice, and discovered and quantified 466 malonylated and 2,211 succinylated peptides. SIRT5 regulation remodeled the acylomes by targeting 171 malonylated and 640 succinylated sites. Affected pathways included carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms, synaptic vesicle cycle, and neurodegenerative diseases. We found 48 common SIRT5-regulated malonylation and succinylation sites, suggesting potential PTM crosstalk. This innovative and efficient workflow offers deeper insights into the mouse brain lysine malonylome and succinylome.\n\nStatement of significance of the studyPost-translational modifications (PTMs) are key regulators of protein structure, functions, and interactions. A great variety of PTMs have been discovered, including lysine acylation, such as acetylation, malonylation, and succinylation. Lysine acylation is understudied, particularly in the brain, and analysis by mass spectrometry-based proteomics faces significant challenges. In this study, we present a robust and efficient workflow to investigate proteome-wide PTM remodeling combining affinity PTM enrichment and a novel spectral library-free data-independent acquisition (DIA) approach. The strength of label-free DIA becomes evident with the collection of comprehensive information by tandem mass spectrometry for all detectable precursor ions of all biological samples, and the highly accurate quantitative information that can subsequently be retrieved with time-efficient and straightforward library-free strategies. More importantly, this enables confident identification of PTM sites and differentiation of PTM isomers. We applied this workflow to decipher the malonylome and succinylome remodeling and cross-talk in brains from wild-type and Sirt5(-/-) mice, taking advantage of the demalonylase and desuccinylase activities of SIRT5, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent sirtuin. Interestingly, 10 malonylated proteins and 33 succinylated proteins targeted by SIRT5 are involved in the Parkinsons disease pathway, including subunit beta of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (Camk2b) and protein DJ-1 (Park7).",
