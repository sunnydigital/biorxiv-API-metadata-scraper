    "abstract": "Elucidating how species accumulate in diversity hotspots is an ongoing debate in evolutionary biology. The paramo, in the Northern Andes, has remarkably high indices of plant diversity, endemicity, and diversification rates. A hypothesis for explaining such indices is that allopatric speciation is high in the paramo given its island-like distribution; an alternative hypothesis is that the altitudinal gradient of the Andean topography provides a variety of niches that drive vertical parapatric ecological speciation. A formal test for evaluating the relative roles of allopatric speciation and parapatric ecological divergence is lacking. The main aim of our study is to test which kind of speciation is more common in an endemic paramo genus. We developed a framework incorporating phylogenetics, species distributions, and a morpho-ecological trait (leaf area) to compare sister species and infer whether allopatric or parapatric ecological divergence caused their speciation. We applied our framework to the species-rich genus Linochilus (63 spp.) and found that the majority of recent speciation events in it (12, 80%) have been driven by allopatric speciation, while a smaller fraction (1, 6.6%) is attributed to parapatric ecological divergence; two pairs produced inconclusive results (13.3%). We conclude that paramo autochthonous diversification is primarily driven by allopatric speciation.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive plasticity allows populations to cope with environmental variation but is expected to fail as conditions become unfamiliar. In novel conditions, populations may instead rely on rapid adaptation to increase fitness and avoid extinction. Adaptation should be fastest when both plasticity and selection occur in directions of the multivariate phenotype that contain abundant genetic variation. However, tests of this prediction from field experiments are rare. Here, we quantify how additive genetic variance in a multivariate phenotype changes across an elevational gradient, and test whether plasticity and selection align with genetic variation. We do so using two closely related, but ecologically distinct, sister species of Sicilian daisy (Senecio, Asteraceae) adapted to high and low elevations on Mount Etna. Using a paternal half-sibling breeding design, we generated and then reciprocally planted c.19,000 seeds of both species, across an elevational gradient spanning each species native elevation, and then quantified mortality and five leaf traits of emergent seedlings. We found that genetic variance in leaf traits changed more across elevations than between species. The high-elevation species at novel lower elevations showed changes in the distribution of genetic variance among the leaf traits, which reduced the amount of genetic variance in the directions of selection and the native phenotype. By contrast, the low-elevation species mainly showed changes in the amount of genetic variance at the novel high elevation, and genetic variance was concentrated in the direction of the native phenotype. For both species, leaf trait plasticity across elevations was in a direction of the multivariate phenotype that contained a moderate amount of genetic variance. Together, these data suggest that where plasticity is adaptive, selection on genetic variance for an initially plastic response could promote adaptation. However, large environmental effects on genetic variance are likely to reduce adaptive potential in novel environments.",

    "abstract": "Conodont elements have high rates of morphological evolution, but the drivers of this disparity are debated. Positive allometric relationships between dimensions of food-processing surfaces and entire P1 elements have been used in to argue that these elements performed mechanical digestion. If involved in food processing, the surface of the element should grow at a rate proportional to the increase in energy requirements of the animal. This inference of function relies on the assumption that the energy requirements of the animal grew faster ({cong} mass0.75) than the tooth area ({cong} mass0.67). We re-evaluate this assumption based on metabolic rates across animals, and calculate the allometry in platform-bearing P1 elements of Late Triassic co-occurring taxa, Metapolygnathus communisti and Epigondolella rigoi, using 3D models of ontogenetic series. Positive allometry is found in platform and element dimensions in both species, supporting a grasping-tooth hypothesis, based on the assumption that metabolic rate in conodonts scaled with body mass similarly to that in fish and ectoterms. We also calculate the curvature of P1 platform surface using the Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) as a proxy for diet.DNE values increase with body mass, supporting the assumption that conodont metabolic rates increased faster than mass0.67. We finally find that adults in both taxa differ in their food bases, which supports trophic diversification as an important driver of the remarkable disparity of conodont elements.",

    "abstract": "The central nervous system modulates heart function on a beat-to-beat basis via increasingly understood mechanisms. Conversely, whether and how humoral/functional cardiac variations shape brain activity and adaptive behavior remains unclear. This study shows that mice overexpressing adenylyl cyclase type 8 in myocytes (TGAC8), characterized by persistently elevated heart rate/contractility, also display increased locomotion. This effect is sustained by enhanced gamma rhythms, as evidenced by simultaneous behavioral and EEG/ECG monitoring. These changes are specific because they are not paralleled by other modifications, such as heightened anxiety-like behavior. In unison, TGAC8 mice hippocampus exhibits upregulated GABA-A receptors, whose activation chiefly accounts for gamma activity generation. Moreover, the Granger causality analysis between ECG and EEG attests to the causal involvement of the autonomic component of the heartbeat in shaping EEG gamma oscillations in a bottom-up modality. Mechanistically, TGAC8 harbors elevated circulating dopamine/DOPA levels of cardiac origin and upregulated hippocampal D5 dopamine receptor levels. In synergy with the GABA-A receptor, D5 activation favors hippocampal inhibitory currents that drive EEG gamma oscillations. These studies, therefore, inform how heart-initiated functional and/or humoral modifications reverberate back to the brain to modulate specific primary adaptive responses, such as locomotion.\n\nSignificanceThe brain is continuously aware of the functional status of many bodily organs, modulating, for instance, the hearts activity beat-by-beat. Conversely, how cardiac activity modifications impact brain function and behavior is less understood. We disclose that augmenting myocyte adenyl cyclase 8 (AC8) activity in mice increases their locomotion. Elevated cardiac AC8 levels lead to higher circulating dopamine and DOPA, hormones crucially involved in movement control, and increased expression of the hippocampuss GABA-A and D5 receptors; the activation of the latter modifies hippocampal gamma oscillations shaping locomotor activity. Thus, the brain interprets changes in myocardial AC8 activity as a \"sustained exercise-like\" situation and responds by activating areas commanding to increase locomotion.",

    "abstract": "We report the discovery of a novel unimolecular glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor dual agonist that exhibits potent glycemic control and weight loss in diet-induced obese mice. The dual agonism of GLP-1 and GIP receptor was achieved by replacing the tryptophan cage of exendin-4 with the C-terminal undecapeptide sequence of oxyntomodulin along with a single amino acid substitution from histidine to tyrosine at the amino terminus of the peptide. The structural modification places lysine 30 of the novel incretin agonist in frame with the corresponding lysine residue in the native GIP sequence. The novel incretin receptor dual agonist, named I-M-150847, induces rapid redistribution of GLP-1R at the plasma membrane following activation ensuring the maintenance of the receptor in a sensitized state. I-M-150847 promotes glucose-stimulated insulin exocytosis in cultured pancreatic beta cells and augments insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in mouse adipocytes. Chronic administration of I-M-150847 enhances insulin sensitivity, improves glycemic control, and achieves significant weight loss relative to the control or exendin-4-treated DIO-mice demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of dual agonist in ameliorating type 2 Diabetes and Obesity.\n\nSignificance statement.O_LIReplacement of the Trp-cage with the C-terminal oxyntomodulin undecapeptide along with the tyrosine substitution at the amino terminus converts the selective GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 to a novel GLP-1R and GIPR dual agonist I-M-150847.\nC_LIO_LIThe GLP-1R and GIPR dual agonist I-M-150847 induces the expeditious redistribution of GLP-1R at the plasma membrane following initial activation thereby maintaining the receptor in a sensitized state.\nC_LIO_LIThe incretin receptor dual agonist I-M-150847 enhances insulin sensitivity and delivers superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to exendin-4 in the rodent model of diabetes and obesity.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471325v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e27480org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4e88acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eee9e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3e41c9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In 2001, the bacterium V. aesturianus francensis emerged as a pathogen that causes adult oyster mortality in France and Ireland. Its impact on oyster aquaculture has increased in Europe since its reemergence in 2012. To better understand the evolutionary mechanisms leading to the emergence and persistence over time of this pathogen, we conducted a survey of mollusk diseases through national reference laboratories (NRLs) across Europe. We analyzed 54 new genomes of V. aestuarianus (Va) isolated from multiple environmental compartments since 2001, in areas with and without bivalve mortalities. We used a combination of comparative genomics and population genetics approaches to show that Va francensis lineages have undergone clonal expansion in Europe, likely after a recent selective bottleneck. Low mutation and recombination rates may have selected particular virulent genotypes. Furthermore, we identified a specific cus-cop-containing island conferring copper resistance to Va francensis whose acquisition may have favored the emergence of pathogenic lineages adapted to oysters.",

    "abstract": "A common motif in biology is the arrangement of cells into tube-like sheets, which further transform into more complex shapes. Traditionally, analysis of the dynamic surfaces of growing tissues has relied on inspecting static snapshots, live imaging of cross-sections, or tracking isolated cells in 3D. However, capturing the interplay between in-plane and out-of-plane behaviors requires following the full surface as it deforms and integrating cell-scale motions into collective, tissue-scale deformations. The advent of methods for whole-organ live imaging ushers the need for in toto analysis methods to understand these collective tissue dynamics. Here, we introduce an approach that builds in toto maps of surface deformation by following tissue parcels in the material frame of reference. Mapping the full 3D surface to 2D images such that the tissue motion in 2D is minimal enables the user to easily follow the tissue and discern its 3D motion. We then provide a computational framework for linking in-plane and out-of-plane behaviors and decomposing complex deformation maps into elementary contributions. The Tube-like sUrface Lagrangian Analysis Resource (TubULAR) provides an open-source MATLAB implementation whose functionality is accessible either as a standalone toolkit or as an extension of the ImSAnE package used in the developmental biology community. We underscore the power of our approach by analyzing shape change in the embryonic Drosophila midgut and beating zebrafish heart. Following deformations in the tissue/material frame reveals the signatures of tissue flow and a reduced-dimensional mode decomposition of the dynamics. The method naturally generalizes to in vitro and synthetic systems and provides ready access to the mechanical mechanisms relating genetic patterning to organ shape change.",

    "abstract": "Military Deployment to Southwest Asia and Afghanistan and exposure to toxic airborne particulates has been associated with an increased risk of developing respiratory disease, collectively termed deployment-related respiratory diseases (DRRD). Our knowledge about how particulates mediate respiratory disease is limited, precluding the appropriate recognition or management. Central to this limitation is the lack of understanding of how exposures translate into dysregulated cell identity with dysregulated transcriptional programs. The small airway epithelium is involved in both the pathobiology of DRRD and fine particulate matter deposition. To characterize small airway epithelial cell epigenetic and transcriptional responses to Afghan desert particulate matter (APM) and investigate the functional interactions of transcription factors that mediate these responses, we applied two genomics assays, the assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) and Precision Run-on sequencing (PRO-seq). We identified activity changes in a series of transcriptional pathways as candidate regulators of susceptibility to subsequent insults, including signal-dependent pathways, such as loss of cytochrome P450 or P53/P63, and lineage-determining transcription factors, such as GRHL2 loss or TEAD3 activation. We further demonstrated that TEAD3 activation was unique to APM exposure despite similar inflammatory responses when compared with wood smoke particle exposure and that P53/P63 program loss was uniquely positioned at the intersection of signal-dependent and lineage-determining transcriptional programs. Our results establish the utility of an integrated genomics approach in characterizing responses to exposures and identify genomic targets for the advanced investigation of the pathogenesis of DRRD.",

We find that {gamma} events are selectively associated with enhanced visual encoding by V1 neurons and {gamma} event rate increases prior to visually-cued behavior, accurately predicting single trial visual detection. This relationship between {gamma} events and behavior is sensory modality-specific and rapidly modulated by changes in task objectives.

    "abstract": "Considerable evidence highlights the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a key region for hierarchical (i.e., multi-level) learning. In a previous electroencephalography (EEG) study we found that the low-level prediction errors (PEs) were encoded by frontal theta oscillations (4-7Hz), centered on right DLPFC (rDLPFC). However, the causal relationship between frontal theta oscillations and hierarchical learning remains poorly understood. To investigate this question, in the current study, participants received theta (6Hz) and sham high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) over the rDLPFC, while performing the probabilistic reversal learning task. Behaviorally, theta tACS induced a significant reduction in accuracy for the stable environment, but not for the volatile environment, relative to the sham condition. Computationally, we implemented a combination of a hierarchical Bayesian learning and a decision model. Theta tACS induced a significant increase in low-level (i.e., probability-level) learning rate and uncertainty of low-level estimation relative to sham condition. Instead, the temperature parameter of the decision model, which represents (inverse) decision noise, was not significantly altered due to theta stimulation. These results indicate that theta frequency may modulate the (low-level) learning rate. Furthermore, environmental features (e.g., its stability) may determine whether learning is optimized as a result.",

    "abstract": "Humans make a number of choices when they walk, such as how fast and for how long. The preferred steady walking speed seems chosen to minimize energy expenditure per distance traveled. But the speed of actual walking bouts is not only steady, but rather a time-varying trajectory, which can also be modulated by task urgency or an individuals movement vigor. Here we show that speed trajectories and durations of human walking bouts are explained better by an objective to minimize Energy and Time, meaning the total work or energy to reach destination, plus a cost proportional to bout duration. Applied to a computational model of walking dynamics, this objective predicts dynamic speed vs. time trajectories with inverted U shapes. Model and human experiment (N = 10) show that shorter bouts are unsteady and dominated by the time and effort of accelerating, and longer ones are steadier and faster due to energy-per-distance. Individual-dependent vigor may be characterized by the energy one is willing to spend to save a unit of time, which explains why some may walk faster than others, but everyone may have similar-shaped trajectories due to similar walking dynamics. Tradeoffs between energy and time costs can predict transient, steady, and vigor-related aspects of walking.",

    "abstract": "A birds wings are articulated to its body via highly mobile shoulder joints. The wings possess an impressive range of motion, which allows for movements that can modulate the production of aerodynamic load in flight. This is crucial for stability and control--particularly in gusty or turbulent environments. In this study, we develop a dynamics model to examine how a bird-scale gliding aircraft can use wing-root hinges (analogous to avian shoulder joints) to reject the initial impact of a strong upward gust. Our idea requires that the spanwise centre of pressure and the centre of percussion of the hinging wing start, and stay, in good initial alignment (the centre of percussion here is related to the idea of a  sweet spot on a bat, as in cricket or baseball). We propose a method for achieving this rejection passively, for which the essential ingredients are: (i) well-considered lift and mass distributions; (ii) constant-torque hinges; and (iii) a wing whose sections stall softly. When configured correctly, the gusted wings will first pivot on their hinges without disturbing the fuselage of the aircraft, affording time for other corrective actions to engage. We expect this system to enhance the control of aircraft that fly in gusty conditions.",

Here, we present an ensemble of cryo-EM structures of human TRiC throughout its ATPase cycle, with three of them revealing endogenously engaged tubulin in different folding stages. Our structural and XL-MS analyses suggested a gradual upward translocation and stabilization of tubulin within the TRiC chamber accompanying TRiC ring closure. Remarkably, in the closed TRiC-tubulin-S3 map resolved to 3.1-[A]-resolution, we captured a near-natively folded tubulin. We found the near-natively folded tubulin engaging through its N and C domains mainly with the A and I domains of the CCT3/6/8 subunits through electrostatic and hydrophilic interactions, while the tubulin I domain was found to remain dynamic. Moreover, we also showed the potential role of TRiC C-terminal tails in substrate stabilization and folding. Our study delineates the pathway and molecular mechanism of TRiC-mediated tubulin folding conjugated with TRiC ATPase cycle, and may also inform the design of therapeutic agents targeting TRiC-tubulin interactions.",

    "abstract": "Inbred mouse lines vary in their ability to mount protective antiretroviral immune responses, and even closely related strains can exhibit opposing phenotypes upon retroviral infection. Here, we found that 129S mice inherit a previously unknown mechanism for the production of anti-murine leukemia virus (MLV) antibodies and control of infection. The resistant phenotype is controlled by two dominant loci that are independent from known MLV-resistance genes. We also show that production of anti-MLV antibodies in 129S7, but not 129S1 mice is independent of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) signaling. Thus, our data indicate that 129S mice inherit an unknown mechanism for control of MLV infection and demonstrate that there is genetic variability in 129S substrains that affects their ability to mount antiviral immune responses.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the genetic basis for production of protective antiviral immune responses is crucial for the development of novel vaccines and adjuvants. Additionally, characterizing the genetic and phenotypic variability in inbred mice has implications for the selection of strains for targeted mutagenesis, choice of controls, and for broader understanding of the requirements for protective immunity.",

    "abstract": "Protein fold classification reveals key structural information about proteins that is essential for understanding their function. While numerous approaches exist in the literature that classifies protein fold from sequence data using machine learning, there is hardly any approach that classifies protein fold from the secondary or tertiary structure data using deep learning. This work proposes a novel protein fold classification technique based on graph neural network and protein topology graphs. Protein topology graphs are constructed according to definitions in the Protein Topology Graph Library from protein secondary structure level data and their contacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that applies graph neural network for protein fold classification. We analyze the SCOPe 2.07 data set, a manually and computationally curated database that classifies known protein structures into their taxonomic hierarchy and provides predefined labels for a certain number of entries from the Protein Data Bank. We also analyze the latest version of the CATH data set. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy is at around 82% - 100% under certain settings. Due to the rapid growth of structural data, automating the structure classification process with high accuracy using structural data is much needed in the field. This work introduces a new paradigm of protein fold classification that meets this need. The implementation of the model for protein fold classification and the datasets are available here https://github.com/SuriDipannitaSayeed/ProteinFoldClassification.git\n\nAuthor summaryClassification of protein structures is traditionally done using manual curation, evolutionary relationship, or sequence comparison-based methods. Applying machine learning and deep learning to protein structure classification is a comparatively new trend that holds great promises for automating the structure classification process. Advance deep learning technique like Graph Neural Network is still unexplored in this respect. SCOP and CATH are two traditional databases that provide the hierarchical taxonomic classification of protein structures. This work provides a novel computational approach that classifies protein folds in SCOP and CATH with graph neural network, performing a graph classification task.",

Since the recent break-through of novel folding methods, the amount of available structural data is increasing, closing the gap between data-driven sequence-based and structure-based methods. In this work, we focus on the inverse folding problem that consists in predicting an amino-acid primary sequence from protein 3D structure. For this purpose, we introduce a simple Transformer model from Natural Language Processing augmented 3D-structural data. We call the resulting model PeTriBERT: Proteins embedded in tridimensional representation in a BERT model. We train this small 40-million parameters model on more than 350 000 proteins sequences retrieved from the newly available AlphaFoldDB database. Using PetriBert, we are able to in silico generate totally new proteins with a GFP-like structure. These 9 of 10 of these GFP structural homologues have no ressemblance when blasted on the whole entry proteome database. This shows that PetriBert indeed capture protein folding rules and become a valuable tool for de novo protein design.",

    "abstract": "Increased neurofilament levels in biofluids, commonly used as a proxy for axonal degeneration in the brain, have been found in Parkinsons disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and correlate with MRI biomarkers. The aim of the current study was to unravel the regional distribution of cortical neurofilaments and their association with pathology load and MRI measures of atrophy and diffusivity in the post-mortem brain.\n\nUsing a within-subject post-mortem MRI-pathology approach, we included 9 PD, 12 PDD/DLB and 18 age-matched control donors. Cortical thickness and mean diffusivity (MD) metrics were extracted respectively from 3DT1 and DTI at 3T in-situ MRI. After autopsy, pSer129 alpha-synuclein (pSer129-Syn), p-tau, and amyloid-beta, together with neurofilament light-chain (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament medium- and heavy-chain (p-NfM/H) immunoreactivity were quantified in 7 cortical regions, and studied in detail with confocal-laser scanning microscopy. The correlations between MRI and pathological measures were studied using linear mixed models.\n\nCompared to controls, p-NfM/H immunoreactivity was increased in all cortical regions in PD and PDD/DLB, whereas NfL immunoreactivity was mainly increased in the parahippocampal and entorhinal cortex in PDD/DLB. NfL-positive neurons showed degenerative morphological features and axonal fragmentation. Increased p-NfM/H correlated with p-tau load, and NfL correlated with pSer129-Syn but more strongly with p-tau load in PDD/DLB. Lastly, neurofilament immunoreactivity correlated with cortical thinning in PD and with increased cortical MD in PDD/DLB.\n\nTaken together, increased neurofilament immunoreactivity suggests underlying axonal injury and neurofilament accumulation in morphologically altered neurons with increasing pathological burden. Importantly, we demonstrate that such neurofilament markers at least partly explain MRI measures that are associated with the neurodegenerative process.",

    "abstract": "Allelic imbalance (AI) of gene expression in heterozygous individuals is a hallmark of cis-genetic regulation, revealing mechanisms underlying the association of non-coding genetic variation with downstream traits, as in GWAS. Most methods for detecting AI from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data examine allelic expression per exonic SNP, which may obscure imbalance in expression of individual isoforms. Detecting AI at the isoform level requires accounting for inferential uncertainty (IU) of expression estimates, caused by multi-mapping of RNA-seq reads to isoforms and alleles. Swish, a method developed previously for differential transcript expression accounting for IU, can be applied in a paired setting to detect AI. However, in AI analysis, most transcripts will have high IU across alleles such that even methods like Swish will lose power. Our proposed method, SEESAW, offers AI analysis at various level of resolution, including gene level, isoform level, and optionally aggregating isoforms within a gene based on their transcription start site (TSS). This TSS-based aggregation strategy strengthens the signal for transcripts that may have high IU with respect to allelic quantification. SEESAW is primarily designed for experiments with multiple replicates or conditions of organisms with the same genotype, as in an F1 cross or time course experiments of cell lines. Additionally, we introduce a new test for detecting AI that changes across a continuous covariate, as in a time course experiment. The SEESAW suite of methods is evaluated both on simulated data and applied to an RNA-seq dataset of differentiating F1 mouse osteoblasts.",

Continuous long-read sequencing of oropharyngeal cancers and cancer cell lines revealed a unique form of structural variation, i.e., heterocateny, characterized by diverse, interrelated, and repetitive patterns of concatemerized virus and host DNA segments within a cancer. Unique breakpoint sequences shared across structural variants facilitated stepwise reconstruction of their evolution from a common molecular ancestor. This analysis revealed that virus and virus-host concatemers are unstable and, upon insertion into and excision from chromosomes, facilitate capture, amplification, and recombination of host DNA and chromosomal rearrangements. Evidence of heterocateny was detected in extrachromosomal and intrachromosomal DNA. The data indicate that heterocateny is driven by the dynamic, aberrant replication and recombination of an oncogenic DNA virus, thereby extending known consequences of HPV integration to include promotion of intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution.",

    "abstract": "Tumour-necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors (TRAIL-R1 and -R2) are appealing therapeutic targets to eradicate tumours specifically via caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, resistance is often observed and TRAIL-R activation can even activate pro-tumorigenic non-canonical signalling pathways. Previously, we found that TRAIL-induced RIPK1-Src-STAT3 signalling was mediating cell migration and invasion in resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, the contribution of Src in TRAIL signalling in NSCLC cell lines was further examined. TRAIL sensitive H460 and resistant A549 NSCLC cells showed distinct time-dependent rhTRAIL-induced Src phosphorylation patterns with early activation in A549 cells. Pharmacological Src inhibition as well as shRNA knockdown or CRISPR/CAS9-dependent knockout of Src expression did not alter sensitivity to rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Silencing of secondary complex proteins showed that TRADD, but not TRAF2, FADD nor caspase-8, was required for Src activation in A549 cells. Possible mediators of Src-dependent rhTRAIL signalling were identified by Src co-IP-LC-mass spectrometric analyses. In A549 cells the number of Src-interacting proteins increased after rhTRAIL treatment, whereas protein numbers decreased in H460 cells. In rhTRAIL treated A549 cells, Src biding proteins included components of the RAF-MEK1/2-ERK, Wnt and SMAD3 signalling pathways. Functional analyses showed that Src mediated phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK, prevented phosphorylation of SMAD3 and was required for nuclear translocation of ERK and {beta}-catenin in A549 cells. Clonogenic growth of both Src proficient and deficient A549 cells was not affected by rhTRAIL exposure, although Src depletion and MEK1/2 inhibition reduced colony size and numbers significantly. In conclusion, rhTRAIL-induced and Src dependent MEK/ERK, SMAD3 and {beta}-catenin signalling may contribute to the known pro-tumorigenic effects of rhTRAIL in resistant NSCLC cells. However, this needs to be further examined, as well as the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways when combined with TRAIL receptor agonists.",

    "abstract": "Linked-read sequencing technologies generate high base quality reads that contain extrapolative information on long-range DNA connectedness. These advantages of linked-read technologies are well known and has been demonstrated in many human genomic and metagenomic studies. However, existing linked-read analysis pipelines (e.g., Long Ranger) were primarily developed to process sequencing data from the human genome and are not suited for analyzing metagenomic sequencing data. Moreover, linked-read analysis pipelines are typically limited to one specific sequencing platform. To address these limitations, we present the Linked-Read ToolKit (LRTK), a unified and versatile toolkit for platform agnostic processing of linked-read sequencing data from both human genomes and metagenomes. LRTK provides functions to perform linked-read simulation, barcode error correction, read cloud assembly, barcode-aware read alignment, reconstruction of long DNA fragments, taxonomic classification and quantification, as well as barcode-assisted genomic variant calling and phasing. LRTK has the ability to process multiple samples automatically, and provides the user with the option to generate reproducible reports during processing of raw sequencing data and at multiple checkpoints throughout downstream analysis. We applied LRTK on two benchmarking and three real linked-read data sets from both the human genome and metagenome. We showcase LRTKs ability to generate comparative performance results from the preceding benchmark study and to report these results in publication-ready HTML document plots. LRTK provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.",

    "abstract": "As genetic code expansion advances beyond L--amino acids to backbone modifications and new polymerization chemistries, the field faces an increasingly broad challenge to discover what the ribosome can accommodate. Although the E. coli ribosome tolerates non-L--amino acids in vitro, few structural insights are available, and the boundary conditions for efficient bond formation are unknown. We describe a 2.1 [A] cryo-EM structure of the E. coli ribosome containing well-resolved -amino acid monomers coupled with a computational approach for which energy surface minima produced by metadynamics trend in agreement with established incorporation efficiencies. Reactive monomers across diverse structural classes favor a conformational space characterized by an A-site nucleophile to P-site carbonyl distance of < 4 [A] and a Burgi-Dunitz angle of 90-110{degrees}. Monomers whose free energy minima fall outside these regions do not react. Application of this model should accelerate the in vivo and in vitro ribosomal synthesis and application of sequence-defined, non-peptide heterooligomers.",

However, how sensory and contextual effects on pain are served by the brain is not fully understood so far. To address this question, we applied brief painful stimuli to 40 healthy human participants and independently varied stimulus intensity and expectations. Concurrently, we recorded electroencephalography. We assessed local oscillatory brain activity and inter-regional functional connectivity in a network of six brain regions playing key roles in the processing of pain. We found that sensory information predominantly influenced local brain oscillations. In contrast, expectations exclusively influenced inter-regional connectivity. Specifically, expectations altered connectivity at alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies from prefrontal to somatosensory cortex. Moreover, discrepancies between sensory information and expectations, i.e., prediction errors, influenced connectivity at gamma (60-100 Hz) frequencies. These findings reveal how fundamentally different brain mechanisms serve sensory and contextual effects on pain.\n\nTeaserSensory and expectation effects on pain are implemented by fundamentally different brain mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP) is an adverse effect observed in up to 80% of cancer patients upon treatment with cytostatic drugs including paclitaxel and oxaliplatin. CIPNP can be so severe that it limits dose and choice of chemotherapy, and has a significant negative consequences on the quality of life of survivors. Current treatments for CIPNP are limited and unsatisfactory. TRPM3 is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel functionally expressed in peripheral sensory neurons involved in the detection of thermal stimuli. Here, we focus on the possible involvement of TRPM3 in acute oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia and cold hypersensitivity. In vitro calcium microfluorimetry and whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that TRPM3 is functionally upregulated in both heterologous and homologous expression systems after acute (24h) oxaliplatin treatment, while direct application of oxaliplatin was without effect. In vivo behavioral studies using an acute oxaliplatin model for CIPNP showed the development of cold and mechano-hypersensitivity in control mice, which was lacking in TRPM3 deficient mice. In addition, the levels of pERK, a marker for neuronal activity, were significantly reduced in DRG neurons derived from TRPM3 deficient mice compared to control after oxaliplatin administration. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of a TRPM3 antagonist, isosakuranetin, effectively reduced the oxaliplatin-induced pain behavior in response to cold and mechanical stimulation in mice with an acute form of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. In summary, TRPM3 thus represents a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients undergoing chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The brain mechanism of embodiment in a virtual body has grown a scientific interest recently, with a particular focus on providing optimal virtual reality (VR) experiences. Disruptions from an embodied state to a less- or non-embodied state, denominated Breaks in Embodiment (BiE), are however rarely studied despite their importance for designing interactions in VR. Here we use electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor the brains reaction to a BiE, and investigate how this reaction depends on previous embodiment conditions. The experimental protocol consisted of two sequential steps; an induction step where participants were either embodied or non-embodied in an avatar, and a monitoring step where, in some cases, participants saw the avatars hand move while their hand remained still. Our results show the occurrence of error-related potentials linked to observation of the BiE event in the monitoring step. Importantly, this EEG signature shows amplified potentials following the non-embodied condition, which is indicative of an accumulation of errors across steps. These results provide neurophysiological indications on how progressive disruptions impact the expectation of embodiment for a virtual body.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Arctic Ocean receives massive freshwater input and a correspondingly large amount of humic-rich organic matter of terrestrial origin. Global warming, permafrost melt, and a changing hydrological cycle will contribute to an intensification of terrestrial organic matter release to the Arctic Ocean. Although considered recalcitrant to degradation due to complex aromatic structures, humic substances can serve as substrate for microbial growth in terrestrial environments. However, the capacity of marine microbiomes to process aromatic-rich humic substances, and how this processing may contribute to carbon and nutrient cycling in a changing Arctic Ocean, is relatively unexplored. Here, we used a combination of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to assess the prevalence and diversity of metabolic pathways and bacterial taxa involved in aromatic compound degradation in the salinity-stratified summer waters of the Canada Basin in the western Arctic Ocean.\n\nResultsCommunity-scale meta-omics profiling revealed that 22 complete pathways for processing aromatic compounds were present and expressed in the Canada Basin, including those for aromatic ring fission and upstream funnelling pathways to access diverse aromatic compounds of terrestrial origin. A phylogenetically diverse set of functional marker genes and transcripts were associated with fluorescent dissolved organic matter, a component of which is of terrestrial origin. Pathways were common throughout global ocean microbiomes, but were more abundant in the Canada Basin. Genome-resolved analyses identified 12 clades of Alphaproteobacteria, including Rhodospirillales, as central contributors to aromatic compound processing. These genomes were mostly restricted in their biogeographical distribution to the Arctic Ocean, and were enriched in aromatic compound processing genes compared to their closest relatives from other oceans.\n\nConclusionOverall, the detection of a phylogenetically diverse set of genes and transcripts implicated in aromatic compound processing supports the view that Arctic Ocean microbiomes have the capacity to metabolize humic substances of terrestrial origin. In addition, the demonstration that bacterial genomes replete with aromatic compound degradation genes exhibit a limited distribution outside of the Arctic Ocean suggests that processing humic substances is an adaptive trait of the Arctic Ocean microbiome. Future increases in terrestrial organic matter input to the Arctic Ocean may increase the prominence of aromatic compound processing bacteria and their contribution to Arctic carbon and nutrient cycles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeep-sea harbor enormous viruses, yet their diversity and interactions with hosts in hydrothermal ecosystem are largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the viral composition, distribution, host preference and metabolic potential in different inhabits of global hydrothermal vents.\n\nResultsFrom 34 samples of eight vent sites, a total of 4,662 viral populations were recovered from the metagenome assemblies, encompassing diverse phylogenetic groups and defining many novel lineages. Apart for the abundant unclassified viruses, tailed phages are most predominant across the global hydrothermal vents, while single-stranded DNA viruses including Microviridae and small eukaryotic viruses also constitute a significant part of the viromes. These viral populations were grouped into 1,138 genus-level clusters by protein-sharing network analysis. More than half were exclusively of hydrothermal origin, reflecting the remarkable novelty of hydrothermal viruses. Among the typical niches, vent plumes own the largest number of viral clusters compared to diffuse flows and sediments. Moreover, merely 11% of the viral populations can be linked to specific hosts, which are the key microbial taxa of hydrothermal habitats, such as Gammaproteobacteria and Campylobacteraeota. Intriguingly, vent viromes shared some metabolic features in common that they encode auxiliary genes extensively involved in metabolisms of carbohydrate, amino acid, cofactors and vitamins. Specifically in plume viruses, various auxiliary genes related with the methane, nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms were observed, indicating their contribution to hosts energy conservation. Moreover, the prevalence of sulfur relay pathway genes notified the significant role of vent virus in stabilizing tRNA structure, which promotes hosts adaptation to the steep environmental gradients.\n\nConclusionsThe deep-sea hydrothermal systems reserve an untapped viral diversity with novelty. They may affect both vent prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities, and modulate host metabolisms related to vent adaptability. More explorations are needed to depict global vent virus diversity and their role in the unique ecosystem.",

Understanding the impact of individual donor genetic backgrounds on reprogramming ability would allow researchers to harness these genetic differences and increase the efficiency of the reprogramming process. To better understand the genetic basis of reprogramming cells into iPSCs, we present Induction of Pluripotency from Pooled Cells (iPPC) - an efficient, scalable, and reliable reprogramming procedure. Using our deconvolution algorithm that employs low-coverage pooled sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we estimate individual donor proportions of cell lines within large cohorts. With iPPC, we concurrently reprogrammed over one hundred donor LCLs into iPSCs and found strong correlations of individual donors reprogramming ability across multiple experiments. We note that individual donors reprogramming ability remains consistent across both same-day replicates and multiple experimental runs, and that the expression of certain immunoglobulin precursor genes (IGLV10-54, IGLV3-9, IGLV1-17, IGLV1-6, and IGLV3-1) may impact reprogramming ability. Our process enables a multiplex framework to study the reprogramming ability of different donor cells into iPSCs and also provides a reliable method along with a pooled library of donor iPSCs for downstream research and investigation of other in-vitro phenotypes.",

Administration of Gly-Low reduced food consumption, lowered body weight, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased survival in both leptin receptor-deficient (Leprdb) and wild-type C57B6/J mice. Unlike caloric restriction, Gly-Low modulated hypothalamic signaling by upregulating mTOR pathway signaling to inhibit ghrelin-mediated hunger response. Gly-Low also slowed hypothalamic aging and increased survival when administered as a late-life intervention, suggesting its potential benefits in ameliorating age-associated decline by inducing voluntary caloric restriction and reducing glycation.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=171 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503411v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e89dc6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce3ce3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff75a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1853bf8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Despite the increasing feasibility of genetic association studies on fitness components, there are a few methods to uncover the loci underlying FDS. Based on a simplified model of pairwise genotype-genotype interactions, we propose a linear regression that can infer FDS from observed fitness. The key idea behind our method is the inclusion of genotype similarity as a pseudo-trait in selection gradient analysis. Single-locus analysis of Arabidopsis and damselfly data could detect known negative FDS on visible polymorphism that followed Mendelian inheritance with complete dominance. By extending the singlelocus analysis to genome-wide association study (GWAS), our simulations showed that the regression coefficient of genotype similarity can distinguish negative or positive FDS without confounding other forms of balancing selection. Field GWAS of the branch number further revealed that negative FDS, rather than positive FDS, was enriched among the top-scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Arabidopsis thaliana. These results showed the wide applicability of our method for FDS on both visible polymorphism and genome-wide SNPs.

    "abstract": "Plant pathogens respond to selection pressures exerted by disease management strategies. This can lead to fungicide resistance and/or the breakdown of disease-resistant cultivars, each of which significantly threaten food security. Both fungicide resistance and cultivar breakdown can be characterised as qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative (monogenic) resistance/breakdown involves a step change in the characteristics of the pathogen population with respect to disease control, often caused by a single genetic change. Quantitative (polygenic) resistance/breakdown instead involves multiple genetic changes, each causing a smaller shift in pathogen characteristics, leading to a gradual alteration in the effectiveness of disease control over time. Although resistance/breakdown to many fungicides/cultivars currently in use is quantitative, the overwhelming majority of modelling studies focus on the much simpler case of qualitative resistance. Further, those very few models of quantitative resistance/breakdown which do exist are not fitted to field data. Here we present a model of quantitative resistance/breakdown applied to Zymoseptoria tritici, which causes Septoria leaf blotch, the most prevalent disease of wheat worldwide. Our model is fitted to data from field trials in the UK and Denmark. For fungicide resistance, we show that the optimal disease management strategy depends on the timescale of interest. Greater numbers of fungicide applications per year lead to greater selection for resistant strains, although over short timescales this can be offset by the increased control offered by more sprays. However, over longer timescales higher yields are attained using fewer fungicide applications per year. Deployment of disease-resistant cultivars is not only a valuable disease management strategy, but also offers the secondary benefit of protecting fungicide effectiveness by delaying the development of fungicide resistance. However, disease-resistant cultivars themselves erode over time. We show how an integrated disease management strategy with frequent replacement of disease-resistant cultivars can give a large improvement in fungicide durability and yields.\n\nAuthor SummaryPlant pathogens pose a major threat to crop yields. The two most common forms of pathogen control, namely use of fungicides and deployment of disease resistant cultivars, are threatened by pathogen evolution causing fungicide resistance or erosion/breakdown of cultivar control. There are two categories of resistance/breakdown; qualitative or quantitative. Although resistance to many cultivars and the most common fungicides is quantitative, the mathematical modelling literature focuses almost exclusively on qualitative resistance, for simplicity or due to lack of appropriate data required to fit a model of quantitative resistance. In this study we present the first model focusing on both quantitative fungicide resistance and cultivar breakdown to be fitted to field data. We use the disease of wheat, Septoria leaf blotch, as a case study. After fitting our model to field trial data from the UK and Denmark, we use it to demonstrate how to design sustainable disease management strategies that optimise yield. We show that combining resistant cultivars with fungicide applications can prolong the effectiveness of both strategies, but that the optimal number of fungicide applications depends on the timescale of interest. Over short timescales, the optimal strategy uses more fungicide applications per year than over longer timescales.",

To further broaden our knowledge in this area, we screened 2645 polypeptides derived from 78 biologically relevant proteins and identified eight native peptide substrates (named VP1[~]VP8) for bacterial Hsp70 DnaK. Consistent with previous findings, the amino acid distribution in VP1[~]VP8 were enriched in aliphatic and basic residues, and most of their residues were buried in folded proteins as well. Besides, the substrate binding properties for seven polypeptides were largely the same as observed in NR, suggesting their conserved binding mode to DnaK. However, VP5, which contains more percentage of positively charged residues, demonstrates divergent substrate binding properties during in-vitro biochemical studies. Moreover, VP5 efficiently inhibits the refolding activity of DnaK and bacterial viability, implying its potential to be a good lead peptide for antibacterial drug development.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and lethal form of pancreatic cancer, characterised by stromal remodelling, elevated matrix stiffness and high metastatic rate. Retinoids, compounds derived from vitamin A, have a history of clinical use in cancer for their anti-proliferative and differentiation effects, and more recently have been explored as anti-stromal therapies in PDAC for their ability to induce mechanical quiescence in cancer associated fibroblasts. Here we demonstrate that retinoic acid receptor {beta} (RAR-{beta}) transcriptionally represses myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2) expression, a key regulatory component of the contractile actomyosin machinery. In turn, MLC-2 downregulation results in decreased cytoskeletal stiffness and traction force generation, impaired response to mechanical stimuli via mechanosensing and reduced ability to invade through the basement membrane.",

    "abstract": "Adenine base editors (ABEs) catalyze A-to-G transitions showing broad applications, but their bystander mutations and off-target editing effects raise the concerns of safety issues. Through structure-guided engineering, we found ABE8e with an N108Q mutation reduced both adenine and cytosine bystander editing, and introduction of an additional L145T mutation (ABE9), further refined the editing window to 1-2nt with eliminated cytosine editing. Importantly, ABE9 induced very minimal RNA and undetectable Cas9-independent DNA off-target effects, which mainly installed desired single A-to-G conversion in mouse and rat embryos to efficiently generate disease models. Moreover, ABE9 accurately edited A5 position of the protospacer sequence in pathogenic homopolymeric adenosine sites (up to 342.5-fold precision than ABE8e) and was further confirmed through a library of guide RNA-target sequence pairs. Due to the minimized editing window, ABE9 could further broaden the targeting scope for precise correction of pathogenic SNVs when fused to Cas9 variants with expanded PAM compatibility.",

EAATs achieve million-fold transmitter gradients by symporting it with three sodium ions and a proton and counter-transporting a potassium ion via an elevator mechanism. Despite the availability of structures, the symport and antiport mechanisms remain unclear. We report high-resolution Cryo-EM structures of human EAAT3 bound to the neurotransmitter glutamate with symported ions, potassium ions, sodium ions alone, or in the absence of ligands. We show that an evolutionarily conserved occluded translocation intermediate has a dramatically higher affinity for the neurotransmitter and the counter-transported potassium ion than outward- or inward-facing transporters and plays a crucial role in ion coupling. We propose a comprehensive ion coupling mechanism involving a choreographed interplay between bound solutes, conformations of conserved amino acid motifs, and movements of the gating hairpin and the substrate-binding domain.",

Using total internal reflection and transient amyloid binding super-resolution microscopy, our study analyses elongation of single PrP fibrils to reveal polymorphic populations, featuring structural and dynamic heterogeneity similar to prion strains, which were previously hidden in ensemble measurements. PrP fibrils elongated along a preferred direction by an intermittent  stop- and-go mechanism. Fibrils fell into three main populations, which each displayed distinct elongation mechanisms incorporating different monomer structures and which maintained their properties even under elongation conditions favouring a different fibril type. Elongation of RML and ME7 prion rods likewise exhibited unique kinetic features. The discovery of polymorphic fibril populations of amyloid and prions growing in competition suggests that prions may present as quasispecies of structural isomorphs and that the replication environment may tilt the balance between prion isomorphs and amyloid species.\n\nHighlightsO_LISynthetic prion fibril populations contain structurally distinct fibril types\nC_LIO_LIFibril types faithfully elongate by different mechanisms\nC_LIO_LIFibril types compete for substrate depending on environment\nC_LIO_LIFibril populations model quasi-species behavior of prion strains\nC_LI\n\neTOCReplication of different prion strains causes distinct disease phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Amyloid deposition of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a unifying theme in a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases. Disease-associated missense mutations in tau are associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and enhance tau aggregation propensity. However, the molecular mechanism of how mutations in tau promote tau assembly into amyloids remains obscure. There is a need to understand how tau folds into pathogenic conformations to cause disease. Here we describe the structural mechanism for how an FTD-tau S320F mutation drives spontaneous aggregation. We use recombinant protein and synthetic peptide systems, computational modeling, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and cell models to investigate the mechanism of spontaneous aggregation of the S320F FTD-tau mutant. We discover that the S320F mutation drives the stabilization of a local hydrophobic cluster which allosterically exposes the 306VQIVYK311 amyloid motif. We identify a suppressor mutation that reverses the S320F aggregation phenotype through the reduction of S320F-based hydrophobic clustering in vitro and in cells. Finally, we use structure-based computational design to engineer rapidly aggregating tau sequences by optimizing nonpolar clusters in proximity to the S320 site revealing a new principle that governs the regulation of tau aggregation. We uncover a mechanism for regulating aggregation that balances transient nonpolar contacts within local protective structures or in longer-range interactions that sequester amyloid motifs. The introduction of a pathogenic mutation redistributes these transient interactions to drive spontaneous aggregation. We anticipate deeper knowledge of this process will permit control of tau aggregation into discrete structural polymorphs to aid design of reagents that can detect disease-specific tau conformations.",

    "abstract": "Tip-links as gating-spring in the mechanotransduction in hearing is still a debate. While the molecular elasticity of individual tip-link proteins warrants its candidature, the apparent rigidity from the heterotetrameric tip-links assembly refutes the claim. Using force-clamp experiments and simulations, we report that the heterotetrameric assembly is the natural selection for the gating-springs. Tip-links follow slip-ideal-slip bonds with increasing force. While in slip, the complex dissociates monotonously, ideal-bond interface responds indifferently to various auditory inputs. Insensitivity to forces renders tip-links as low-force pass filter, characteristic of gating-spring. Individual tip-links, however, forms slip-catch-slip bonds under tension. While catch bonds turn stronger with force from loud sound, our Langevin dynamics indicated the transition from slip-catch to slip-ideal bonds as cooperative effect of the dimers of individual protein complexes in tip-links. From molecular dynamics, we deciphered the molecular mechanism of catch bonds and its importance in deafness.",

For multi-modal data, we propose a computational workflow to jointly analyze datasets from cell lines. The workflow comprises a novel probabilistic data integration method, named POPLS-DA, for omics data.\n\nThe workflow is motivated by a study on synucleinopathies where transcriptomics, proteomics, and drug screening data are measured in affected LUHMES cell lines and controls. The aim is to highlight potentially druggable pathways and genes involved in synucleinopathies. First, POPLS-DA is used to prioritize genes and proteins that best distinguish cases and controls. For these genes an integrated interaction network is constructed, where the drug screen data is incorporated to highlight druggable genes and pathways in the network. Finally functional enrichment analyses are performed to identify clusters of synaptic and lysosome-related genes and proteins targeted by the protective drugs.\n\nWe found that HSPA5, a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, was one of the most targeted genes by the validated drugs, in particular by AT1-blockers. HSPA5 and AT1-blockers have been previously linked to -synuclein pathology and Parkinsons disease, showing the relevance of our findings.\n\nOur computational workflow identified new directions for therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies. An implementation based on R and markdown is freely available online.\n\nAuthor summaryWe present a computational workflow that combines the analysis of different types of data measured in cell line studies with non-overlapping samples. We apply the workflow to measurements of gene expression, protein abundances, and a screening of a wide range of FDA-approved drugs. These different types of data are obtained from LUHMES brain cells and jointly analyzed to discover new treatment options in synucleinopathies, such as Parkinsons disease. Our workflow includes a new probabilistic method, named POPLS-DA. POPLS-DA combines the analysis of the genes and proteins to pinpoint a set of relevant genes and proteins that can distinguish affected and non-affected cells. Furthermore, we constructed a network that connects together the relevant genes and proteins that interact with each other. We incorporate the drug screening data to highlights which part of the network is relevant to the disease and druggable. Through additional analysis of the functionality, we discovered that the genes and proteins that are targeted by protective drugs share relevant properties, namely they are synaptic and lysosome related genes. Notably, we found that a specific type of drugs, namely AT1-blockers such as Telmisartan, are protective and target the network of relevant genes and proteins. These drugs are approved by the FDA and readily available to further investigate its potential in treating synucleinopathies. We further found that a gene named HSPA5, a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, is highly targeted by the protective drugs. This gene has been linked to Parkinsons disease in previous scientific literature. Our computational workflow and the implementation in R and markdown are freely available online.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the structural connectivity of key brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical regions is essential to the development of therapeutic neuromodulation for depression, chronic pain, addiction, anxiety and movement disorders. Several brainstem nuclei have been identified as the primary central nervous system (CNS) source of important monoaminergic ascending fibers including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. However, due to practical challenges to their study, there is limited data regarding their in vivo anatomic connectivity in humans.\n\nObjectiveTo evaluate the structural connectivity of the following brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical areas: locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Additionally, to develop a group average atlas of these limbic brainstem structures to facilitate future analyses.\n\nMethodsEach nucleus was manually masked from 197 Human Connectome Project (HCP) structural MRI images using FSL software. Probabilistic tractography was performed using FSLs FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Connectivity with limbic cortical regions was calculated and compared between brainstem nuclei. Results were aggregated to produce a freely available MNI structural atlas of limbic brainstem structures.\n\nResultsA general trend was observed for a high probability of connectivity to the amygdala, hippocampus and DLPFC with relatively lower connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and insula. The locus coeruleus and nucleus tractus solitarius demonstrated significantly greater connectivity to the DLPFC than amygdala while the periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral tegmental area did not demonstrate a significant difference between these two structures.\n\nConclusionMonoaminergic and other modulatory nuclei in the brainstem project widely to cortical limbic regions. We describe the structural connectivity across the several key brainstem nuclei theorized to influence emotion, reward, and cognitive functions. An increased understanding of the anatomic basis of the brainstems role in emotion and other reward-related processing will support targeted neuromodulatary therapies aimed at alleviating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe brainstem plays a key role in the processing of emotional stimuli and is intricately linked with the limbic system.\nC_LIO_LIAnatomic data for these connections is limited in humans\nC_LIO_LIWe describe the structural connectivity of five brain stem nuclei (locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius) in relation to limbic circuits\nC_LIO_LIOur results present a comprehensive delineation of the brainstem-limbic structural connectivity of these nuclei and are compiled into a freely available tractographic atlas\nC_LIO_LIApplications include future targeting of these structures for neuropsychiatric conditions\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Vulnerability to develop cocaine use disorder depends upon an unpredictable combination of genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Early life adversity and adolescence are critical non-genetic risk factors, and haplotypes of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) genes are among genetic variations increasing the risk of drug-related problems. However, data on the interactions between inheritable risk factors and early life stress (ES) with respect to predisposition to cocaine abuse are limited. Here, we show that a mouse model containing both genetic (low-activity alleles of the MAO A gene; MAOANeo) and environmental (i.e., ES) variables displays a long lasting increased sensitivity to repeated in vivo cocaine psychomotor stimulant actions associated with a reduction of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-dependent form of short-term plasticity, also becomes readily expressed by dopamine neurons from MAOANeoES mice treated repeatedly with cocaine. Activation of either dopamine D2 or CB1 receptors is required for cocaine-induced DSI expression, decreased GABA synaptic efficacy, and hyperlocomotion. Next, in vivo pharmacological enhancement of 2-AG signaling during repeated cocaine exposure occludes its actions both in vivo and ex vivo. This data extends our knowledge of the multifaceted sequelae imposed by this gene by environment interaction in VTA dopamine neurons of male pre-adolescent mice, contributing to our understanding of neural mechanisms of vulnerability for early onset cocaine use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Class Ia/b CFTR variants cause severe cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease in ~10% of CF patients and are untreatable with small molecule pharmaceuticals. Genetic replacement strategies offer a potential cure for all patients but so far, have displayed limited efficiency in vivo.\n\nWe hypothesised that increasing protein abundance and/or activity of introduced CFTRs would more effectively restore function to CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE) in the presence of CF sputum (CFS) than wildtype (WT)-CFTR. We investigated codon optimised CFTR (hCAI), increased open probability CFTR (K978C) and codon optimised plus K978C (h^K978C) as candidates for gene therapy. Transfection of HEK293T with hCAI and h^K978C produced ~10-fold more CFTR protein than WT or K978C CFTRs. hCAI and h^K978C also displayed ~4-fold greater anion transport than WT in a halide-sensitive YFP quenching assay. However, functionality of modified CFTR cDNAs expressed in CFBE were profoundly different. 10% transduction of CFBE with K978C, compared to 22% transduction with WT, restored Cl- transport to similar levels as that recorded from non-CF cells. K978C increased ASL height and pH more effectively than WT-CFTR, while hCAI and h^K978C had limited impact. Further investigation indicated that codon optimised CFTRs mis-localised in CFBE and compromised vectoral Cl- transport.\n\nThese data provide further evidence that codon optimised CFTR cDNAs may be unsuitable for gene therapy practices that employ high activity promoters. However, increased activity CFTR cDNAs such as K978C, that potentially mimic the effect of potentiators, may provide more potent recovery of function than WT-CFTR cDNA in CF airways.\n\nSignificance StatementCystic fibrosis (CF) disease is associated with genetic malfunction of the Cl- channel CFTR, leading to dehydration and decreased pH in the fluid lining the airways. Replacement of CFTR by gene therapy/gene editing offers potential therapeutic benefit but efficiency is poor. We show that gain of activity K978C CFTR under the control of a high activity promoter fully restored Cl- transport, hydration and pH to CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE) in the presence of CF sputum and more efficiently than wild type CFTR. Codon optimised forms of CFTR were much less effective and proteins were mis-localised/mis-processed in CFBE. Thus, K978C could offer improved therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic RNA processing factor Y14 participates in double-strand break (DSB) repair via its RNA-dependent interaction with the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) complex. We identified the long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1 as a candidate that mediates this interaction. HOTAIRM1 localized to DNA damage sites induced by ionizing radiation. Depletion of HOTAIRM1 delayed the recruitment of DNA damage response and repair factors to DNA lesions and reduced DNA repair efficiency. Identification of the HOTAIRM1 interactome revealed a large set of RNA processing factors including mRNA surveillance factors. The surveillance factors Upf1 and SMG6 localized to DNA damage sites in a HOTAIRM1-dependent manner. Depletion of Upf1 or SMG6 increased the level of DSB-induced non-coding transcripts at damaged sites, indicating a pivotal role for Upf1/SMG6-mediated RNA degradation in DNA repair. We conclude that HOTAIRM1 serves as an assembly scaffold for both DNA repair and RNA processing factors that act in concert to repair DSBs.",

    "abstract": "Ageing affects many phenotypic traits, but its consequences for social behaviour have only recently become apparent. Social networks emerge from associations between individuals. The changes in sociality that occur as individuals get older are thus likely to impact network structure, yet this remains unstudied. Here we use empirical data from free-ranging rhesus macaques and an agent-based model to test how age-based changes in social behaviour feed up to influence: (1) an individuals level of indirect connectedness in their network; and (2) overall patterns of network structure. Our empirical analyses revealed that female macaques became less indirectly connected as they aged for some, but not all network measures examined, suggesting that indirect connectivity is affected by ageing, and that ageing animals can remain well integrated in some social contexts. Surprisingly, we did not find evidence for a relationship between age distribution and the structure of female macaque networks. We used an agent-based model to gain further understanding of the link between age-based differences in sociality and global network structure, and under which circumstances global effects may be detectable. Overall, our results suggest a potentially important and underappreciated role of age in the structure and function of animal collectives, which warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Alphaviruses are emerging positive stranded RNA virus which replicate and transcribe their genomes in membranous organelles formed in the cell cytoplasm. The non-structural protein 1 (nsP1) is responsible for RNA capping and the gating of replication organelles by assembling into monotopic membrane-associated dodecameric pores (Jones R. et al. Nature 2021). The capping path is unique for Alphavirus; beginning with the N7 methylation of a GTP molecule, followed by the covalent linkage of a m7GMP group to a conserved histidine in nsP1 and the transfer of this cap structure to a diphosphate RNA (Ahola T. et al. PNAS 1995). Here we provide structural snapshots of different stages of the reaction pathway showing how nsP1 pores recognize the substrates of the methyl-transfer reaction, GTP and SAM, how it reaches a metastable post-methylation state with SAH and m7GTP in the active site, the subsequent covalent transfer of m7GMP to nsP1 and post-reaction conformational changes triggering the opening of the pore. In addition, we biochemically characterize the capping reaction, demonstrating specificity for the RNA substrate and the reversibility of the cap transfer resulting in decapping activity and the release of intermediates of the reaction. Our data identify the molecular determinants allowing each pathway transition, provide explanation for the need for the SAM methyl donor all along the pathway and new clues about the conformational rearrangements associated to the enzymatic activity of nsP1. Together our results set new ground for the structural and functional understanding of alphavirus RNA-capping and the design of antivirals.\n\nSignificance statementHere we present biochemical and structural characterization of the capping pathway carried out by the Chikungunya virus nsP1 capping pores. We provide five Cryo-EM structures representative of the different steps of the reaction. These structures reveal the molecular determinants and dynamics associated with the alphavirus capping process. In addition, we biochemically show the RNA capping specificity and the reversibility of the reaction which allow nsP1 to cap and decap RNAs and to release intermediates of the reaction. These data provide a new biochemical clues on the enzymatic activity of nsP1 capping pores and a new structural landscape that will be instrumental for the design of effective antivirals targeting the viral RNA capping for blocking the infection.",

    "abstract": "Color variation is a frequent evolutionary substrate for camouflage in small mammals but the underlying genetics and evolutionary forces that drive color variation in natural populations of large mammals are mostly unexplained. The American black bear, Ursus americanus, exhibits a range of colors including the cinnamon morph which has a similar color to the brown bear, U. arctos, and is found at high frequency in the American southwest. Reflectance and chemical melanin measurements showed little distinction between U. arctos and cinnamon U. americanus individuals. We used a genome-wide association for hair color as a quantitative trait in 151 U. americanus individuals and identified a single major locus (P < 10-13). Additional genomic and functional studies identified a missense alteration (R153C) in Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) that impaired protein localization and decreased pigment production. Population genetic analyses and demographic modeling indicated that the R153C variant arose 9.36kya in a southwestern population where it likely provided a selective advantage, spreading both northwards and eastwards by gene flow. A different TYRP1 allele, R114C, contributes to the characteristic brown color of U. arctos, but is not fixed across the range.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe cinnamon morph of American black bears and brown bears have different missense mutations in TYRP1 that account for their similar coloration\nC_LIO_LITYRP1 variants in American black bears and brown bears are loss-of-function alleles associated with impaired protein localization to melanosomes\nC_LIO_LIIn American black bears, the variant causing the cinnamon morph arose 9,360 years ago in the western lineage where it provides an adaptive advantage, and has spread northwards and eastwards by migration\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Beyond its role as the queen electrolyte, chloride can also serve as an allosteric regulator or even a signaling ion. To illuminate this essential anion across such a spectrum of biological processes, researchers have relied on fluorescence imaging with genetically encoded sensors. In large part, these have been derived from the green fluorescent protein found in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. However, a standalone sensor with a turn-on intensiometric response at physiological pH has yet to be reported. Here, we address this technology gap by building on our discovery of mNeonGreen (mNG) derived from lanYFP found in the cephalochordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum. Targeted engineering of two non-coordinating residues in the chloride binding pocket of mNG unlocks the ChlorON series. In vitro spectroscopy reveals that the binding of chloride tunes the chromophore environment to give rise to the turn-on response. We further showcase how this unique sensing mechanism can be exploited for directly imaging labile chloride in living cells with spatial and temporal resolution, accelerating the path forward for fundamental and translational aspects of chloride biology.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=61 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503807v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@36cc4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d9dccborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ec0fforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@80c9db_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The 3 major classes of soil transmitted helminths (whipworm, hookworm and Ascaris) affect 1.5 billion people worldwide mostly in poor countries, where they have adverse effects on child development, nutrition, and the work capacity of adults. Although there are drugs effective on Ascaris, notably the benzimidazoles, those same drugs show poor efficacy particularly against whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) and to a certain extent hookworm. Parasitic nematodes also infect farm livestock and companion animals. Resistance to currently deployed human and veterinary anthelmintic drugs is a growing problem. Therefore, new chemical anthelmintic lead compounds are urgently needed. One of the fastest routes to a novel therapeutic lead is to screen libraries of drugs which are either already approved for human use or have already been part of clinical trials. We have pursued this approach to anthelmintic lead discovery using an invertebrate automated phenotyping platform (INVAPP) for screening chemicals and the well-established nematode genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The 400 compound Medicines for Malaria Pandemic Response Box library was screened with each compound tested initially at 1.0 x 10-4 M. We identified 6 compounds (MMV1593515 (vorapaxar), MMV102270 (diphyllin), MMV1581032 (ABX464), MMV1580796 (rubitecan), MMV1580505 and MMV1593531) active in both an L1-L4 growth / motility assay and in an L4 motility assay. For vorapaxar, an EC50 of 5.7 x 10-7 M was observed, a value comparable to some commercial anthelmintics. Although not a parasite, the ease with which high-throughput screens can be pursued on the free-living nematode C. elegans makes this a useful approach to identify chemical leads and complement the often lower-throughput experiments on parasitic nematode models.",

We also specifically assessed modulation of parvalbumin interneuron activity.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a brain-wide analysis of c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activity, in mice that received LI-rTMS to visual cortex. Mice received single or multiple sessions of excitatory 10Hz LI-rTMS with custom rodent coils or were sham controls. We assessed changes to c-Fos positive cell densities and c-Fos/parvalbumin co-expression. Peak c-Fos expression corresponded with activity during rTMS. We also assessed functional connectivity changes using brain-wide c-Fos-based network analysis.\n\nResultsLI-rTMS modulated c-Fos expression in cortical and subcortical regions. c-Fos density changes were most prevalent with acute stimulation, however chronic stimulation decreased parvalbumin interneuron activity, most prominently in the amygdala and striatum. LI-rTMS also increased anti-correlated functional connectivity, with the most prominent effects also in the amygdala and striatum following chronic stimulation.\n\nConclusionLI-rTMS induces changes in c-Fos expression that suggest modulation of neuronal activity and functional connectivity throughout the brain. Our results suggest that LI-rTMS promotes anticorrelated functional connectivity, possibly due to decreased parvalbumin interneuron activation induced by chronic stimulation.

To fill this gap, we recorded - in three human participants whose hands were paralyzed as a result of a spinal cord injury - the responses evoked in the hand and arm representations of primary motor cortex (M1) while we delivered ICMS to the somatosensory cortex (S1). We found that ICMS of S1 activated some M1 neurons at short, fixed latencies, locked to each pulse in a manner consistent with monosynaptic activation. However, most of the changes in M1 firing rates were much more variable in time, suggesting a more indirect effect of the stimulation. The spatial pattern of M1 activation varied systematically depending on the stimulating electrode: S1 electrodes that elicited percepts at a given hand location tended to activate M1 neurons with movement fields at the same location. However, the indirect effects of S1 ICMS on M1 were strongly context dependent, such that the magnitude and even sign relative to baseline varied across tasks. We tested the implications of these effects for brain-control of a virtual hand, in which ICMS was used to convey tactile feedback about object interactions. While ICMS-evoked activation of M1 disrupted decoder performance, this disruption could be minimized with biomimetic stimulation, which emphasizes contact transients at the onset and offset of grasp, reduces sustained stimulation, and has been shown to convey useful contact-related information.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWMotor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortex play a critical role in motor control but the nature of the signaling between these structures is not known. To fill this gap, we recorded from M1 while delivering intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to S1 of three human participants, whose hands were paralyzed by spinal cord injury. We found that ICMS activates M1 and that the motor fields of activated M1 neurons match the sensory fields of the stimulated S1 electrodes. These findings have important implications for using ICMS to convey tactile feedback for brain-controlled bionic hands. Indeed, the ICMS-evoked M1 activity worsens control of the hand.

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) are a valuable model to investigate host-pathogen interactions of hepatitis viruses in a mature and authentic environment. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of HLCs to the Hepatitis D Virus (HDV), a virus that in co-infection with HBV is responsible for the most severe form of viral hepatitis. Cells undergoing hepatic differentiation became susceptible to HDV infection after acquiring expression of the Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), the receptor mediating HBV and HDV entry. Inoculation of mature HLCs with HDV lead to increasing amounts of intracellular HDV RNA and accumulation of the HDV antigen in the cells. The infection was abrogated when using known entry inhibitors targeting NTCP or by disrupting genome replication using the nucleoside analogue Ribavirin. Upon infection, the HLCs mounted an innate immune response based on induction of the interferons IFNB and L, but not IFNA, and were associated with an upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. The intensity of this immune response positively correlated with the level of viral replication and was dependant on both the JAK/STAT and NF{kappa}B pathway activation. Importantly, neither this innate immune response nor an exogenous treatment of IFN2b inhibited HDV replication.

    "abstract": "The limited efficacy of immunotherapies against glioblastoma illustrates the urgent need to better understand the interactions between the central nervous system and the immune system. Here, we showed that a protective response to CTLA-4 therapy depended on a mutualistic relationship between microglia and CD4+ T cells. Suppression of gliomas by CD4+ T cells did not require tumor-intrinsic MHC-II expression, but rather was dependent on the selective expression of MHC-II and antigen presentation by local microglia that in turn, sustained CD4+ T cell tumoricidal effector functions. CD4+ T cell secretion of IFN{gamma} made the glioma cells vulnerable to enhanced tumor surveillance and phagocytosis by microglia via the AXL/MER tyrosine kinase receptors that were necessary for tumor suppression. This work illustrates a novel partnership between CD4+ T cells and microglia that unleashes the tumoricidal properties of microglia that can be harnessed to improve immunotherapies for glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) are a ubiquitous component of microbial communities and dominate the first stage of nitrification in some soils. While we are beginning to understand soil virus dynamics, we have no knowledge of the composition or activity of those infecting nitrifiers or their potential to influence processes. This study aimed to characterise viruses having infected autotrophic AOA in two nitrifying soils of contrasting pH by following transfer of assimilated CO2-derived 13C from host to virus via DNA stable-isotope probing and metagenomic analysis. Incorporation of 13C into low GC mol% AOA and virus genomes increased DNA buoyant density in CsCl gradients but resulted in co-migration with dominant non-enriched high GC mol% genomes, reducing sequencing depth and contig assembly. We therefore developed a hybrid approach where AOA and virus genomes were assembled from low buoyant density DNA with subsequent mapping of 13C isotopically enriched high buoyant density DNA reads to identify activity of AOA. Metagenome-assembled genomes were different between the two soils and represented a broad diversity of active populations. Sixty-four AOA-infecting viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) were identified with no clear relatedness to previously characterised prokaryote viruses. These vOTUs were also distinct between soils, with 42% enriched in 13C derived from hosts. The majority were predicted as capable of lysogeny and auxiliary metabolic genes included an AOA-specific multicopper oxidase suggesting infection may augment copper uptake essential for central metabolic functioning. These findings indicate virus infection of AOA may be a frequent process during nitrification with potential to influence host physiology and activity.",

Yet, there are few examples of such seasonal polyphenisms that have characterized the environmental cues, ecological consequences, or genetic mechanisms involved in generating the plastic variation of wing color. Further, there is a lack of support that such plasticity may impact the adaptive diversification of butterfly wing patterns. Here, we report a case of seasonal polyphenism in pigment and structurally-based color patterns of Zerene cesonia that are strikingly similar to the color pattern divergence seen on the wings of sulphur butterflies. We show that (i) coordinated changes in temperature and photoperiod drive the plasticity, (ii) the plastic color changes impact how fast the butterflies can warm, (iii) identify spalt as likely be involved in the genetic coupling of the pigment and structurally-based color plastic response. We further show that this plastic wing changes phenocopy wing pattern divergence between Zerene species, as well as the color pattern differences known to be commonly involved in sexual selection and speciation across sulphur butterflies. Together, our results demonstrate that shared environmental cues and genetic basis for pigment and structural color plasticity may result in conditions that may have facilitated species diversification of sulphur butterflies.",

    "abstract": "The production of the bacterial anti-competitor toxins, called bacteriocins, is widely described as spite, because the production of the toxins is costly and often requires cell death for release. Given these costs, it reasonable to think that bacteriocin production should be induced by the presence of unrelated competitor strains. Nonetheless, recent evidence in the insect-pathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus koppenhoeffri showed that bacteriocin production occurs regardless of the presence of unrelated competitors. Could the constitutive production of bacteriocins be favored by natural selection? Here we use a mathematical model to examine this question, both within and between subpopulations. The model assumes that bacteriocin production is constitutive and costly, and that toxin release only occurs during natural cell death. We found that constitutive bacteriocin producers can outcompete non-producer sensitive strains within populations, and that it can spread in a metapopulation provided there is local competition for patches. Hence, the evolution of bacteriocin production does not require the detection of competitors or \"suicidal\" release of toxins.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between transcription factors (TF) and chromatin factors (CF) regulate gene expression programmes to determine cellular fate. However, unlike for TF, the exact role of CF in this process is poorly understood. Using haematopoiesis as a model system and utilising novel functional CRISPR screens ex vivo and in vivo, coupled with Perturb-Seq, CF binding and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in primary murine cells, we assess the role of 550 chromatin factors in lineage choice in normal haematopoiesis and the maintenance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These studies demonstrate marked specificity for a large number of CFs in lineage determination, highlighting functional diversity within specific families of chromatin regulators, including MLL-H3K4-methyltransferases and different BAF-complexes, that regulate disparate lineage decisions across haematopoiesis. Conversely, we demonstrate that unrelated Repressive complexes function similarly to restrain excessive myeloid differentiation and protect lineage diversity. We identify interactions between CF and TF that, at least in part, explain the regulatory function of CF and link Brd9-loss to a premalignant state. Utilising similar experiments in a relevant murine AML model, we demonstrate opposing effects for CF in normal haematopoiesis and AML, where MLL-H3K4-methyltransferases, c-BAF-remodelers and Repressive complexes prevent differentiation and maintain leukaemic fitness. We show that this alteration relates to differential utilisation of TF by CF complexes between normal and malignant haematopoiesis, highlighting corrupted TF-CF interactions as potential novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in AML. Together, this study provides novel insights on the functional diversity of chromatin factors in governing cell-fate.",

    "abstract": "When foraging in dynamic and uncertain environments, animals can benefit from basing their decisions on smart inferences about hidden properties of the world. Typical theoretical approaches to understand the strategies that animals use in such settings combine Bayesian inference and value iteration to derive optimal behavioral policies that maximize total reward given changing beliefs about the environment. However, specifying these beliefs requires infinite numerical precision; with limited resources, this problem can no longer be separated into optimizing inference and optimizing action selections. To understand the space of behavioral policies in this constrained setting, we enumerate and evaluate all possible behavioral programs that can be constructed from just a handful of states. We show that only a small fraction of the top-performing programs can be constructed by approximating Bayesian inference; the remaining programs are structurally or even functionally distinct from Bayesian. To assess structural and functional relationships among all programs, we developed novel tree embedding algorithms; these embeddings, which are capable of extracting different relational structures within the program space, reveal that nearly all good programs are closely connected through single algorithmic \"mutations\". We demonstrate how one can use such relational structures to efficiently search for good solutions via an evolutionary algorithm. Moreover, these embeddings reveal that the diversity of non-Bayesian behaviors originates from a handful of key mutations that broaden the functional repertoire within the space of good programs. The fact that this diversity of behaviors does not significantly compromise performance suggests a novel approach for studying how these strategies generalize across tasks.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an adverse hepatic drug reaction that can potentially lead to life-threatening liver failure. Previously published work in the scientific literature on DILI has provided valuable insights for the understanding of hepatotoxicity as well as drug development. However, the manual search of scientific literature in PubMed is laborious. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been developed to decipher and understand the meaning of human language by extracting useful information from unstructured text data. In particular, NLP along with artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) techniques may allow automatic processing of the DILI literature, but useful methods are yet to be demonstrated. To address this challenge, we have developed an integrated NLP/ML classification model to identify DILI-related literature using only paper titles and abstracts. We used 14,203 publications provided by the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) challenge, employing word vectorization techniques in NLP coupled with machine learning methods. Classification modeling was performed using 2/3 of the data for training and the remainder for testing in internal validation. The best performance was achieved using a linear support vector machine (SVM) model that combined vectors derived from term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, achieving an accuracy of 95.0% and an F1-score of 95.0%. The final SVM model built using all 14,203 publications was tested on independent datasets, resulting in accuracies of 92.5%, 96.3%, and 98.3%, and F1-scores of 93.5%, 86.1%, and 75.6% for three test sets (T1-T3). The SVM model was tested on four external validation sets (V1-V4), resulting in accuracies of 92.0%, 96.2%, 98.3%, and 93.1%, and F1-scores of 92.4%, 82.9%, 75.0%, and 93.3%.",

Networks of directly interacting lymphocytes ( lymphonets) emerge as a distinctive feature of the anti-cancer immune response. Lymphonets nucleate from small T-cell clusters and incorporate B cells with increasing size. CXCR3-mediated trafficking modulates lymphonet size and number, but neoantigen expression directs intratumoral localization. Lymphonets preferentially harbor TCF1+/PD1+ progenitor CD8 T cells involved in responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Upon treatment of mice with ICB therapy or a neoantigen-targeted vaccine, lymphonets retain progenitor and gain cytotoxic CD8 T-cell populations, likely via progenitor differentiation. These data show that lymphonets create a spatial environment supportive of CD8 T-cell anti-tumor responses.",

    "abstract": "Primary resistance drastically limits the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in melanoma. Resistance to ICB may also develop when tumours relapse after targeted therapy. To identify cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms driving resistance to ICB, we generated single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients on ICB therapy, including an early time point obtained after only one cycle of treatment. Comparing these data with murine scRNA-seq datasets, we established a comprehensive view of the cellular architecture of the treatment-naive melanoma ecosystem, and defined 6 evolutionarily conserved melanoma transcriptional metaprograms (Melanocytic or MEL, Mesenchymal-like or MES, Neural Crest-like, Antigen Presentation, Stress (hypoxia response) and Stress (p53 response)). Spatial multi-omics revealed a non-random geographic distribution of cell states that is, at least partly, driven by the tumour microenvironment. The single-cell data allowed unambiguous discrimination between melanoma MES cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts both in silico and in situ, a long-standing challenge in the field. Importantly, two of the melanoma transcriptional metaprograms were associated with divergent clinical responses to ICB. While the Antigen Presentation cell population was more abundant in tumours from patients who exhibited a clinical response to ICB, MES cells were significantly enriched in early on-treatment biopsies from non-responders, and their presence significantly predicted lack of response. Critically, we identified TCF4 (E2-2) as a master regulator of the MES program and suppressor of both MEL and Antigen Presentation programs. Targeting TCF4 expression in MES cells either genetically or pharmacologically using a bromodomain inhibitor increased immunogenicity and sensitivity to targeted therapy. This study describes an increasingly complex melanoma transcriptional landscape and its rapid evolution under ICB. It also identifies a putative biomarker of early response to ICB and an epigenetic therapeutic strategy that increases both immunogenicity of ICB-refractory melanoma and their sensitivity to targeted therapy.",

As successive plesia on the gnathostome lineage, they reveal the early sequences of vertebrate evolution, including the assembly of the vertebrate skeleton. This is predicated however, on understanding of their diversity and interrelationships. The largest ostracoderm clade, the Pteraspidimorphi, is often reconstructed as sister taxon to other boney vertebrates yet they lack a phylogenetic framework, in particular the heterostracans. Problematic heterostracans with a tessellate headshield ( tessellate-basal model) are often regarded as the plesiomorphic condition for the clade but no phylogenetic analysis has included these taxa. Here we review the Heterostraci and present their first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis (131 heterostracan taxa and 12 outgroup taxa). Heterostraci and Ordovician Pteraspidimorphi are recovered as sister-group to all other boney jawless vertebrates in parsimony analyses, however, in no instances do we recover a monophyletic Pteraspidimorphi. Tree visualization reveals lack of resolution results from two conflicting solutions for the heterostracan  root. Stratigraphic congruences provides support for the macromeric Ctenaspisdidae as sister taxon to all other Heterostraci rather than the \"tesselate-basal\" model. The results presented here are the first phylogenetic hypotheses of heterostracan relationships and it is hoped a first step into an accurate interpretation of character evolution and polarity in this crucial episode of vertebrate evolution.",

    "abstract": "One major challenge in systems biology is to understand how various genes in a gene regulatory network (GRN) collectively perform their functions and control network dynamics. This task becomes extremely hard to tackle in the case of large networks with hundreds of genes and edges, many of which have redundant regulatory roles and functions. The existing methods for model reduction usually require the detailed mathematical description of dynamical systems and their corresponding kinetic parameters, which are often not available. Here, we present a data-driven method for coarse-graining large GRNs, named SacoGraci, using ensemble-based mathematical modeling, dimensionality reduction and gene circuit optimization by Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. SacoGraci requires network topology as the only input and is robust against errors in GRNs. We benchmark and demonstrate its usage with synthetic, literature-based, and bioinformatics-derived GRNs. We hope SacoGraci will enhance our ability to model the gene regulation of complex biological systems.",

    "abstract": "How transient hyperglycemia contributes to cerebro-vascular disease has been a challenge to study under controlled conditions. We present an approach to model luminal vessel thrombo-inflammation using amplified, ultrashort laser-pulses to physically disrupt brain-venule endothelium. Vessel disruption in conjunction with transient hyperglycemia from a single injection of metabolically active D-glucose results in real-time responses to venule damage that include rapid serum extravasation, platelet aggregation, and neutrophil recruitment, in normal mice. In contrast, vessel thrombo-inflammation following laser-induced vessel disruption is significantly reduced in mice injected with metabolically inert L-glucose. Thrombo-inflammation is pharmacologically ameliorated by a platelet inhibitor, by a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, or by a nitric oxide donor. For comparison, in diabetic mice injured vessel thrombo-inflammatory responses are also reduced by restoration of normo-glycemia. Our approach provides a controlled method to probe synergies of transient metabolic and physical vascular perturbations and reveals new aspects of brain pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Spatial summation of perimetric stimuli has been used to derive conclusions about the spatial extent of retinal-cortical convergence, mostly from the size of the critical area of summation (Riccos area, RA) and critical number of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs). However, spatial summation is known to change dynamically with stimulus duration. Conversely, temporal summation and critical duration also vary with stimulus size. Such an important and often neglected spatio-temporal interaction has important implications for modelling perimetric sensitivity in healthy observers and for formulating hypotheses for changes measured in disease. In this work, we performed experiments on visually heathy observers confirming the interaction of stimulus size and duration in determining summation responses in photopic conditions. We then propose a simplified computational model that captures these aspects of perimetric sensitivity by modelling the total retinal input, the combined effect of stimulus size, duration and retinal cones-to-RGC ratio. We additionally show that, in the macula, the enlargement of RA with eccentricity might not correspond to a constant critical number of RGCs, as often reported, but to a constant critical total retinal input. We finally compare our results with previous literature and show possible implications for modelling disease, especially glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Generating synthetic locomotory and electrophysiological data is a useful yet cumbersome step commonly required to study theoretical models of the brains role in spatial navigation. This process can be time consuming and, without a common framework, makes it difficult to reproduce or compare studies which each generate test data in different ways. In response we present RatInABox, an open-source Python toolkit designed to model realistic rodent locomotion and generate synthetic electrophysiological data from spatially modulated cell types. This software provides users with (i) the ability to construct one- or two-dimensional environments with configurable barriers and rewards, (ii) a realistic motion model for random foraging fitted to experimental data, (iii) rapid online calculation of neural data for many of the known self-location or velocity selective cell types in the hippocampal formation (including place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells, head direction cells) and (iv) a framework for constructing custom cell types as well as multi-layer network models. Cell activity and the motion model are spatially and temporally continuous and topographically sensitive to boundary conditions and walls. We demonstrate that out-of-the-box parameter settings replicate many aspects of rodent foraging behaviour such as velocity statistics and the tendency of rodents to over-explore walls. Numerous tutorial scripts are provided, including examples where RatInABox is used for decoding position from neural data or to solve a navigational reinforcement learning task. We hope this tool significantly streamlines the process of theory-driven research into the brains role in navigation.",

    "abstract": "Influenza viruses lead to substantial morbidity and mortality including ~3-5 million cases of severe illness and ~290,000-650,000 deaths annually. One of the major hurdles regarding influenza vaccine efficacy is generating a durable, robust cellular immune response. Appropriate stimulation of the innate immune system is key to generating cellular immunity. Crosstalk between innate dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells plays a key role in activating virus-specific T cells, yet the mechanisms used by influenza A viruses (IAV) to govern this process remain incompletely understood. Here, we used an ex vivo autologous human primary immune cell culture system to evaluate the impact of genetically distinct IAV strains on DC-NK cell crosstalk and subsequent T cell activation. We report that the addition of NK cells to cultures containing both DCs and naive T cells led to an increase in the frequency of CD69+ and CD25+ T cells and elevated levels of IFN-{gamma}, TNF, and IL-10. However, upon IAV infection of DCs, the addition of NK cells to cultures no longer increased the frequency of CD25+ T cells nor elevated IFN-{gamma}, TNF, and IL-10 cytokine levels. Investigation of the impact of IAV infection on DC-NK crosstalk revealed that exposure of DCs to influenza virus in co-culture led to an increased frequency of HLA-DR+ and a decreased frequency of CD83+ and CD86+ cells-molecules involved in stimulating T cell activation. An expansion of an HLA-DR+ NK cell subset was observed following culture with influenza-infected DCs in a contact-dependent and cytokine independent-manner. Overall, our results indicate a role for DC-NK cell crosstalk in T cell priming in the context of influenza infection, informing the immunological mechanisms that could be manipulated for the next generation influenza vaccine or immunotherapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is a major foodborne pathogen transmitted to humans primarily via contaminated poultry meat. Since poultry meat is generally processed, distributed, and stored in the cold chain, the survival of C. jejuni at refrigeration temperatures crucially affects human exposure to C. jejuni. Here, we investigated genetic factors associated with cold stress tolerance in C. jejuni. Seventy-nine C. jejuni strains isolated from retail raw chicken exhibited different survival levels at 4{degrees}C for 21 days. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) clonal complex (CC)-21 and CC-443 were dominant among cold stress-tolerant strains, whereas CC-45 was common among cold stress-sensitive strains. Genome-wide average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis identified a phylogenetic cluster associated with cold stress tolerance. Moreover, a pan-genome analysis revealed 58 genes distinctively present in the cold stress-tolerant phylogenetic cluster. Among the 58 genes, cfrA, encoding the ferric enterobactin receptor involved in ion transport and metabolism, was selected for further analysis. Remarkably, the viability of a {Delta}cfrA mutant at 4{degrees}C was significantly decreased, while the levels of total reactive oxygen species and intracellular iron exceeded those in the wild type. Additionally, a knockout mutation of cfrA also significantly decreased the viability of three cold stress-tolerant isolates at 4{degrees}C, confirming the role of cfrA in cold stress tolerance. The results of this study demonstrate that unique phylogenetic clusters of C. jejuni associated with cold stress tolerance exist and that cfrA is a genetic factor contributing to cold stress tolerance in C. jejuni.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe tolerance of foodborne pathogens to environmental stresses significantly affects food safety. Several studies have demonstrated that C. jejuni survives extended exposure to low temperatures, but the mechanisms of cold stress tolerance are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that C. jejuni strains in certain phylogenetic groups exhibit increased tolerance to cold stress. Notably, cfrA is present in the phylogenetic cluster associated with cold stress tolerance and plays a role in C. jejuni survival at low temperatures by alleviating oxidative stress. This is the first study to discover phylogenetic associations involving cold stress tolerance and identify genetic elements conferring cold stress tolerance in C. jejuni.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is a central evolutionary process that reshuffles combinations of alleles along chromosomes, and consequently is expected to influence the efficacy of direct selection via Hill-Robertson interference. Additionally, the indirect effects of selection on neutral genetic diversity are expected to show a negative relationship with recombination rate, as background selection and genetic hitchhiking are stronger when recombination rate is low. However, owing to the limited availability of recombination rate estimates across divergent species, less is known about the impact of evolutionary changes in recombination rate on genomic signatures of selection. To address this question, we estimate recombination rate in two Ficedula flycatcher species, the taiga flycatcher (F. albicilla) and collared flycatcher (F. albicollis). We show that recombination rate is strongly correlated with signatures of indirect selection, and that evolutionary changes in recombination rate between species have observable impacts on this relationship. Conversely, signatures of direct selection on coding sequences show little to no relationship with recombination rate, even when restricted to genes where recombination rate is conserved between species. Thus, using measures of indirect and direct selection that bridge micro- and macro-evolutionary timescales, we demonstrate that the role of recombination rate and its dynamics varies for different signatures of selection.",

    "abstract": "More than 58,000 proteins have up-to-date correspondence between their amino acid sequence (UniProtKB) and their 3D structures (PDB), enabled by the Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequences (SIFTS) resource. In addition to this fundamental mapping, SIFTS incorporates residue-level annotations from other biological resources such as Pfam, InterPro, SCOP, SCOP2, CATH, IntEnz, GO, PubMed, Ensembl, NCBI taxonomy database and Homologene. The SIFTS data is exported in XML format per individual PDB entry and is also accessible via the PDBe REST API. These mappings have always been maintained separately from the structure data (PDBx/mmCIF file) in the PDB archive. In this current work, taking advantage of the extensibility of the core PDBx/mmCIF framework, we extended the wwPDB PDBx/mmCIF data dictionary with additional categories to accommodate SIFTS data and added the UniProt, Pfam, SCOP2, and CATH mapping information directly into the PDBx/mmCIF files from the PDB archive. The integration of mapping data in the PDBx/mmCIF files provides consistent numbering of residues in different PDB entries allowing easy comparison of structure models. The extended PDBx/mmCIF format yields a more consistent, standardised metadata description without altering the core PDB information. This development enables up-to-date cross-reference information at residue level resulting in better data interoperability, supporting improved data analysis and visualisation.\n\nAvailability and implementationWe expanded the PDBe release pipeline with a process that adds SIFTS annotations to the PDBx/mmCIF files for individual structures in the PDB archive.

We applied our TFA-BT to NCVs from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes cohort and predicted 2,555 driver NCVs in the promoters of 813 genes across 20 cancer-types. These genes are enriched in cancer-related gene ontologies, essential genes, and genes associated with cancer prognosis. We found that 765 candidate driver NCVs alter transcriptional activity, 510 lead to differential binding of TF-cofactor regulatory complexes, and that they primarily impact the binding of ETS factors. Finally, we show that different NCVs within a promoter often affect transcriptional activity through shared mechanisms. Our integrated computational and experimental approach shows that cancer NCVs are widespread and that ETS factors are commonly disrupted.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin transporter (SERT/SLC6A4) is arguably the most extensively studied solute carrier (SLC). During its eponymous action - i.e., the retrieval of serotonin from the extracellular space - SERT undergoes a conformational cycle. Typical inhibitors (antidepressant drugs and cocaine), partial and full substrates (amphetamines and their derivatives) and atypical inhibitors (ibogaine analogues) bind preferentially to different states in this cycle. This results in competitive or non-competitive transport inhibition. Here, we explored the action of N-formyl-1,3-bis (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-prop-2-yl-amine (ECSI#6) on SERT: inhibition of serotonin uptake by ECSI#6 was enhanced with increasing serotonin concentration. Conversely, the KM for serotonin was lowered by augmenting ECSI#6. ECSI#6 bound with low affinity to the outward-facing state of SERT but with increased affinity to a potassium-bound state. Electrophysiological recordings showed that ECSI#6 preferentially interacted with the inward-facing state. Kinetic modeling recapitulated the experimental data and verified that uncompetitive inhibition arose from preferential binding of ECSI#6 to the K+-bound, inward-facing conformation of SERT. This binding mode predicted a pharmacochaperoning action of ECSI#6, which was confirmed by examining its effect on the folding-deficient mutant SERT-PG601,602AA: pre-incubation of HEK293 cells with ECSI#6 restored export of SERT-PG601,602AA from the endoplasmic reticulum and substrate transport. Similarly, in transgenic flies, administration of ECSI#6 promoted delivery of SERT-PG601,602AA to the presynaptic specialization of serotonergic neurons. To the best of our knowledge, ECSI#6 is the first example of an uncompetitive SLC inhibitor. Pharmacochaperones endowed with the binding mode of ECSI#6 are attractive, because they can rescue misfolded transporters at concentrations, which cause modest transport inhibition.",

IL-12/18/21 pre-activation promoted {gamma}{delta}T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vivo and enhanced IFN-{gamma} and TNF- production, as well as granzyme B expression by endogenous CD8+ T cells in a cell-cell contact dependent manner. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of IL-12/18/21 pre-activated {gamma}{delta}T cells could overcome the resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy, and the combination therapy had a synergistic effect on the therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the enhanced anti-tumor function of adoptively transferred IL-12/18/21 pre-activated {gamma}{delta}T cells was largely diminished in the absent of endogenous CD8+T cells when administered alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1, suggesting a CD8+T cell-dependent mechanism.
