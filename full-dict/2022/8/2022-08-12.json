    "abstract": "MMUT-type methylmalonic aciduria is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by the loss of function of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) enzyme. Patients develop symptoms resembling those of primary mitochondrial disorders, but the underlying causes of mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. Here, we examined environmental and genetic interactions in MMUT deficiency using a combination of computational modeling and cellular models to decipher pathways interacting with MMUT. Immortalized fibroblast (hTERT BJ5ta) MMUT-KO (MUTKO) clones displayed a mild mitochondrial impairment in standard glucose-based medium, but they did not to show increased reliance on respiratory metabolism nor reduced growth or viability. Consistently, our modeling predicted MUTKO specific growth phenotypes only for lower extracellular glutamine concentrations. Indeed, two of three MMUT-deficient BJ5ta cell lines showed a reduced viability in glutamine-free medium. Further, growth on 183 different carbon and nitrogen substrates identified increased NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) metabolism of BJ5ta and HEK293 MUTKO cells compared to controls on purine- and glutamine-based substrates. With this knowledge, our modeling predicted 13 reactions interacting with MMUT that potentiate an effect on growth, primarily those of secondary oxidation of propionyl-CoA, oxidative phosphorylation and oxygen diffusion. Of these, we validated 3-hydroxyisobutytyl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) in the secondary propionyl-CoA oxidation pathway. Altogether, these results suggest compensation for the loss of MMUT function by increasing anaplerosis through glutamine or by diverting flux away from MMUT through the secondary propionyl-CoA oxidation pathway, which may have therapeutic relevance.\n\n1 sentence take-home messageBy perturbing metabolic pathways through genetic and environmental interventions in cellular and computational models of MMUT-type methylmalonic aciduria, we identified glutamine and secondary oxidative propionyl-CoA oxidation pathways as being important in the disease.",

    "abstract": "Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of fetal and neonatal mortality worldwide. Many of the adverse effects associated with invasive GBS are associated with inflammation that leads to chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, sepsis, and meningitis; therefore, understanding bacterial factors that promote inflammation is of critical importance. Membrane vesicles (MVs), which are produced by many pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, may modulate host inflammatory responses. In mice, GBS MVs injected intra-amniotically can induce preterm birth and fetal death. Although it is known that GBS MVs induce large-scale leukocyte recruitment into infected tissues, the immune effectors driving these responses are unclear. Here, we hypothesized that macrophages respond to GBS-derived MVs by producing proinflammatory cytokines and are recognized through one or more pattern recognition receptors. We show that THP-1 macrophage-like cells produce high levels of neutrophil- and monocyte-specific chemokines in response to MVs derived from different clinical isolates of GBS. Interleukin (IL)-1{beta} was significantly upregulated in response to MVs, which was independent of NF-kB signaling but dependent on both caspase-1 and NLRP3. These data indicate that MVs contain one or more pathogen-associated molecular patterns that can be sensed by the immune system. Furthermore, this study identifies the NLRP3 inflammasome as a novel sensor of GBS MVs. Our data additionally indicate that MVs may serve as immune effectors that can be targeted for immunotherapeutics, particularly given that similar responses were observed across this subset of GBS isolates.",

    "abstract": "The African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae Giles (Diptera: Culicidae), and the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae) are of public health concern due to their ability to transmit disease-causing parasites and pathogens. Current mosquito control strategies to prevent vector-borne diseases rely mainly on the use of chemicals. However, insecticide resistance in mosquito populations necessitates alternative control measures, including biologicals such as entomopathogenic fungi. Here we report the impact of a Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hyprocreales: Cordycipitaeceae) isolate, MHK, isolated from field-collected Ae. albopictus larvae on mosquito survival and development. Larval infection bioassays using three B. bassiana conidial doses were performed on the second and third larval instars of An. gambiae and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Larvae were monitored daily for survival and development to pupae and adults. Our results show that B. bassiana MHK was more effective in killing An. gambiae than Ae. albopictus larvae. We further observed delays in development to pupae and adults in both mosquito species exposed the varying doses of B. bassiana as compared to the water control. In addition, larval exposure to B. bassiana reduced adult male and female survival in both mosquito species, further contributing to mosquito population control. Thus, this study identifies the locally isolated fungus, B. bassiana MHK, as a possible biological control agent of two mosquito species of public health concern, increasing the arsenal for integrated mosquito control.",

    "abstract": "A lactic acid bacterium, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P1-2 (LpP1-2), can reduce environmental fatty acid hydroperoxides. The administration of LpP1-2 to oxygen-sensitive short-lived nematode mutants and iron-overloaded rats reduced the oxidative stress-related index. Since young piglets have a weak defense system against oxidative stress and are vulnerable to environmental stress, antimicrobial agents have been administered in the rearing. Based on these results, we investigated the effect of LpP1-2 administration to prepartum sows and infant piglets until weaning without antimicrobial agents on the growth of young piglets.\n\nThe group including both sows and piglets that were administrated with lactic acid bacteria containing LpP1-2 (LABLp) until the end of lactation showed the growth-promoting effect of piglet from lactation to early regular rearing, and even in late regular rearing. Blood biochemical markers were in the normal ranges in both LABLp-administrated and non-administrated groups, but various disease-related markers tended to decrease in the administrated group.\n\nTo investigate the effects of LABLp administration on postpartum piglets, the piglets born from prenatally LABLp-administrated sows were divided into two groups and then administrated with or without LABLp. The piglets in the LABLp-administrated group tended to grow very slightly higher than those in the non-administrated group from lactation to early regular rearing. After that, the growth in both groups was almost the same. These results suggest that LABLp administration to prepartum sows is essential for the growth-promoting effect.\n\nThe postnatal LABLp-administrated piglets showed a lower serum lipid peroxidation index than the non-administrated piglets, and had higher numbers of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in feces at the end of LABLp treatment. In fattening performances, the LABLp-administrated group showed a significant improvement in meat quality.\n\nWe also discuss the growth and physiological effects by LpP1-2 administration with iron on piglets because iron administration is another important issue in piglet farming.",

    "abstract": "Aging can be defined as the progressive loss of physiological homeostasis that leads to a decline in cellular and organismal function. In recent years, it has become clear that small RNA pathways play a role in aging and aging related phenotypes. Small RNA pathways regulate many important processes including development, cellular physiology, and innate immunity. The pathways illicit a form of posttranscriptional gene regulation that relies on small RNAs bound by the protein components of the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which inhibit the expression of complementary RNAs. In Drosophila melanogaster, Argonaute 1 (Ago1) is the core RISC component in microRNA (miRNA) silencing, while Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is the core RISC component in small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing. The expression of Ago1 and Ago2 is regulated by stress response transcription factor Forkhead box O (dFOXO) increasing siRNA silencing efficiency. dFOXO plays a role in multiple stress responses and regulates pathways important for longevity. Here we use a next-generation sequencing approach to determine the effects of aging on small RNA abundance and RISC loading in male and female Drosophila. In addition, we examine the impact of the loss of dFOXO on these processes. We find that the relative abundance of the majority of small RNAs does not change with age. Additionally, under normal growth conditions, the loss of dFOXO has little effect on the small RNA landscape. However, we observed that age affects loading into RISC for a small number of miRNAs.",

This cell rearrangement proceeds in three steps: the shrinkage of a junction, exchange of junctions, and elongation of the newly generated junction. Herein, by combining live imaging and physical modeling, we showed that the formation of myosin-II (myo-II) cables around the cell vertices underlies the exchange of junctions. The local and transient detachment of myo-II from the cell cortex is coupled with the junction shrinkage and elongation via an interplay between the LIM domain-containing protein Jub and the tricellular junction protein M6. Furthermore, we developed a mechanical model based on the wetting theory and clarified the way by which the physical properties of myo-II cables are integrated with the junction geometry to induce the transition between the attached and detached states and support the unidirectionality of cell rearrangement. Collectively, the present study elucidates the orchestration of geometry, mechanics and signaling for exchanging junctions.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle stem cells (also called satellite cells, SCs) are important for maintaining muscle tissue homeostasis and damage-induced regeneration. However, it remains poorly understood how the SC quiescence is preserved. Here we report that AP-1 family member ATF3 preserves the SC quiescence by preventing their premature activation. Atf3 is rapidly and transiently induced in SCs upon activation. Short-term deletion of Atf3 in SCs accelerates acute injury-induced regeneration, and however, its long-term deletion exhausts the SC pool and thus impairs muscle regeneration. The Atf3 loss also provokes SC activation during voluntary exercise and enhances SC activation during resistance exercise. Mechanistically, ATF3 directly activates the transcription of Histone 2B genes, which reduction accelerates nucleosome displacement and gene transcription required for SC activation. Finally, the ATF3-dependent H2B expression also prevents genome instability and replicative senescence in SCs. Therefore, this study has revealed a novel mechanism for preserving the SC population by actively suppressing precocious activation, in which ATF3 is a key regulator.",

    "abstract": "To facilitate rapid changes in morphology without endangering cell integrity, each cell possesses a substantial amount of cell surface excess (CSE) that can be promptly deployed to cover cell extensions. CSE can be stored in different types of small surface projections such as filopodia, microvilli, and ridges, with rounded bleb-like projections being the most common and rapidly achieved form of storage. We demonstrate in this paper that cells migrating in 3D collagen use CSE to cover the developing protrusions. After retraction of a protrusion, the CSE this produces is stored over the cell body similar to the CSE produced by cell rounding. For the coordinated process of CSE storage and release, all cells should have specific mechanisms of regulation, and we hypothesize that microtubules (MT) play an important role in this mechanism. We show here that different effects of MT depolymerization on cell motility such as inhibiting mesenchymal motility and enhancing amoeboid, can be explained by the essential role of MT in CSE regulation and dynamics.",

To visualize actin dynamics, actin molecules can be labelled by genetically fusing fluorescent proteins to actin monomers or using fluorescently tagged actin-binding proteins or single-chain anti-actin antibodies. However, the effects of these labels on the morphology of neurons have not been quantitatively compared yet. In the present study, we analysed Actin-Chromobody-GFP, LifeAct-GFP and EGFP-actin with respect to their effects on actin-related features in mouse cultured hippocampal neurons.\n\nThe actin-binding probes LifeAct and Actin-Chromobody showed similar affinity to F-actin, and along with EGFP-actin, were enriched in dendritic protrusions. In contrast to EGFP-actin, neither of these constructs was able to detect subtle changes in actin remodelling between mature mushroom shaped spine and less developed filopodia. None of the compared probes altered filopodial motility compared to control EGFP expression, however, within 24 hours expression, minor changes in dendritic spine morphology and density were visible. Furthermore, while EGFP-actin and LifeAct-GFP expression did not alter dendritic arborization, AC-GFP expressing neurons displayed a reduced dendritic arborization. We therefore conclude that careful consideration of cellular consequences is required before performing experiments with a particular actin labelling probe in primary neurons.",

    "abstract": "Pagets disease (PDB) is a late-onset bone remodelling disorder with a broad spectrum of symptoms and complications. One of the most aggressive forms is caused by the P937R mutation in the ZNF687 gene. Although the genetic involvement of ZNF687 in PDB has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association remains unclear. Here, we describe the first Zfp687 knock-in mouse model and demonstrate that the mutation recapitulates the PDB phenotype, showing a severe bone remodelling alteration. Through micro-computed tomography analysis, we observed that 8-month-old mice showed a mainly osteolytic phase, with a significant decrease in the trabecular bone volume affecting the femurs and the vertebrae of both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice. In contrast, osteoblast activity was deregulated, beginning to produce disorganised bone. Noteworthy, this phenotype became pervasive in 16-month-old mice, where osteoblast function overtook bone resorption as the predominant event, as highlighted by the presence of woven bone in histological analyses, consistent with the PDB phenotype. Furthermore, we detected osteophytes and intervertebral disc degeneration, outlining for the first time the link between osteoarthritis and PDB in a PDB mouse model. Finally, we generated CRISPR-Cas9-based Zfp687 knock-out RAW 264.7 cells, and noted a remarkable impairment of osteoclast differentiation capacity, reinforcing the relevance of Zfp687 during this process. RNA-sequencing on wild type and KO clones identified a set of genes involved in osteoclastogenesis under the control of Zfp687, i.e., Tspan7, Cpe, Vegfc, and Ggt1. Thus, this study established an essential role of Zfp687 in the regulation of bone remodelling, and may offer the potential to therapeutically treat PDB.",

    "abstract": "The Par complex polarizes diverse animal cells through the concerted action of multiple regulators. Binding to Par-3 couples the complex to cortical flows that construct the Par membrane domain. Once localized properly, the complex is thought to transition from Par-3 to the Rho GTPase Cdc42 to activate the complex. While this transition is a critical step in Par-mediated polarity, little is known about how it occurs. Through a biochemical reconstitution approach utilizing purified, intact Par complex and qualitative binding assays, we found that Par-3 and Cdc42 exhibit strong negative cooperativity for the Par complex. We show that the interactions between the second and third PDZ protein interaction domains of Par-3 and the aPKC Kinase-PBM (PDZ binding motif) mediate the displacement of Cdc42 from the Par complex. Our results indicate that Par-3, Cdc42, Par-6, and aPKC are the minimal components that are sufficient for this transition to occur and that no external factors are required. Our findings provide the mechanistic framework for understanding a critical step in the regulation of Par complex polarization and activity.",

    "abstract": "Catalysis and fidelity of multisubunit RNA polymerases rely on a highly conserved active site domain called the trigger loop (TL), which achieves roles in transcription through conformational changes and interaction with NTP substrates. The mutations of TL residues cause distinct effects on catalysis including hypo- and hyperactivity and altered fidelity. We applied molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and machine learning (ML) techniques to characterize TL mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) system. We did so to determine relationships between individual mutations and phenotypes and to associate phenotypes with MD simulated structural alterations. Using fitness values of mutants under various stress conditions, we modeled phenotypes along a spectrum of continual values. We found that ML could predict the phenotypes with 0.68 R2 correlation from amino acid sequences alone. It was more difficult to incorporate MD data to improve predictions from machine learning, presumably because MD data is too noisy and possibly incomplete to directly infer functional phenotypes. However, a variational auto-encoder model based on the MD data allowed the clustering of mutants with different phenotypes based on structural details. Overall, we found that lethal mutations tended to increase distances of TL residues to the NTP substrate, while viable loss-of-function (LOF) substitutions tended to confer an increase in distances between TL and bridge helix (BH). In contrast, GOF mutants generally have a disrupting effect on hydrophobic contacts among TL and nearby helices.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRNA polymerase II (Pol II) synthesizes RNA with the help of an active site domain called trigger loop (TL). The mutations of TL cause changes in the activity of Pol II that could range from gain-of function (GOF) to loss-of-function (LOF) or lethal. This study provides a systematic characterization of the structural and functional outcomes of the TL mutations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML). We obtained functional phenotypes of mutants by ML using the genetic fitness scores as the input. We revealed that mutant TL sequences could predict the functional outcomes at a relatively high correlation. Then, we performed MD simulations to relate the structural information to the phenotypes. The analysis of the MD data suggested that the lethal mutants had increased distances between the TL and the substrate, while a subset of LOF mutants showed increased distances between TL and another active site domain called bridge helix (BH). On the other hand, GOF mutants had effects on the hydrophobic interactions around the active site. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the effects of TL mutations to the Pol II function.",

    "abstract": "Although BOLD signal decreases in the default mode network (DMN) are commonly observed during attention-demanding tasks, their neurobiological underpinnings are not fully understood. Previous work has shown decreases but also increases in glucose metabolism that match with or dissociate from these BOLD signal decreases, respectively. To resolve this discrepancy, we analyzed functional PET/MRI data from 50 healthy subjects during the performance of the visuo-spatial processing game Tetris(R) and combined this with previously published data sets of working memory as well as visual and motor stimulation. Our findings show that the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN is dependent on the metabolic demands of the correspondingly engaged task-positive brain networks. Specifically, the dorsal attention (involved in Tetris(R)) and frontoparietal networks (engaged during working memory) shape the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN in opposing directions. External attention-demanding tasks lead to a downregulation of the posteromedial DMN with consistent decreases in the BOLD signal and glucose metabolism, whereas working memory is subject to metabolically expensive mechanisms of BOLD signal suppression. We suggest that the former finding is mediated by decreased glutamate signaling, while the latter results from active GABAergic inhibition, regulating the competition between self-generated and task-driven internal demands. The results demonstrate that the DMN relates to cognitive processing in a flexible manner and does not always act as a cohesive task-negative network in isolation.",

    "abstract": "1Widely documented, megaevolutionary jumps in phenotypic diversity continue to perplex researchers because it remains unclear whether these dramatic changes can emerge from microevolutionary processes. Here we tackle this question using new approaches for modeling multivariate traits to evaluate the magnitude and distribution of elaboration and innovation in the evolution of bird beaks. We find that elaboration, evolution along the major axis of phenotypic change, is common at both macro- and megaevo-lutionary scales whereas innovation, evolution away from the major axis of phenotypic change, is more prominent at megaevolutionary scales. Indeed, the major axis of phenotypic change among species beak shapes at megaevolutionary scales is an emergent property of innovation across clades. Our analyses suggest that the reorientation of phenotypes via innovation is a ubiquitous route for divergence that can arise through gradual change alone, opening up new avenues for evolution to explore.",
