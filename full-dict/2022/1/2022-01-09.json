    "abstract": "Computational methods that aim to exploit publicly available mass spectrometry repositories primarily rely on unsupervised clustering of spectra. Here, we propose to train a deep neural network in a supervised fashion based on previous assignments of peptides to spectra. The network, called \"GLEAMS,\" learns to embed spectra into a low-dimensional space in which spectra generated by the same peptide are close to one another. We use GLEAMS as the basis for a large-scale spectrum clustering, detecting groups of unidentified, proximal spectra representing the same peptide, and we show how to use these clusters to explore the dark proteome of repeatedly observed yet consistently unidentified mass spectra. We provide a software implementation of our approach, along with a tool to quickly embed additional spectra using a pre-trained model, to facilitate large-scale analyses.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional data are becoming increasingly common in nearly all areas of science. Developing approaches to analyze these data and understand their meaning is a pressing issue. This is particularly true for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), a technique that simultaneously measures the expression of tens of thousands of genes in thousands to millions of single cells. The emerging consensus for analysis workflows significantly reduces the dimensionality of the dataset before performing downstream analysis, such as assignment of cell types. One problem with this approach is that dimensionality reduction can introduce substantial distortion into the data; consider the familiar example of trying to represent the three-dimensional earth as a two-dimensional map. It is currently unclear if such distortion affects analysis of scRNA-seq data. Here, we introduce a straightforward approach to quantifying this distortion by comparing the local neighborhoods of points before and after dimensionality reduction. We found that popular techniques like t-SNE and UMAP introduce substantial distortion even for relatively simple simulated data sets. For scRNA-seq data, we found the distortion in local neighborhoods was often greater than 95% in the representations typically used for downstream analyses. This level of distortion can introduce errors into cell type identification, pseudotime ordering, and other analyses. We found that principal component analysis can generate accurate embeddings, but only when using dimensionalities that are much higher than typically used in scRNA-seq analysis. Our work suggests the need for a new generation of dimensional reduction algorithms that can accurately embed high dimensional data in its true latent dimension.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are often probed by presenting a set of stimuli that vary along one dimension (e.g. color) and quantifying how this stimulus property affect neural activity. An open question, in particular where higher-level areas are involved, is how much tuning measured with one stimulus set reveals about tuning to a new set. Here we ask this question by estimating tuning to hue in macaque V4 from a set of natural scenes and a set of simple color stimuli. We found that hue tuning was strong in each dataset but was not correlated across the datasets, a finding expected if neurons have strong mixed selectivity. We also show how such mixed selectivity may be useful for transmitting information about multiple dimensions of the world. Our finding suggest that tuning in higher visual areas measured with simple stimuli may thus not generalize to naturalistic stimuli.\n\nNew & NoteworthyVisual cortex is often investigated by mapping neural tuning to variables selected by the researcher such as color. How much does this approach tell us a neurons general  role in vision? Here we show that for strongly hue-tuned neurons in V4, estimating hue tuning from artificial stimuli does not reveal the hue tuning in the context of natural scenes. We show how models of optimal information processing suggest that such mixed selectivity maximizes information transmission.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that the cause of Down Syndrome (DS) is well established, the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to the syndrome and the phenotype of accelerated aging remain largely unknown. DNA methylation profiles are largely altered in DS, but it remains unclear how different methylation regions and probes are structured into a network of interactions. We develop and generalize the Parenclitic Networks approach that enables finding correlations between distant CpG probes (which are not pronounced as stand-alone biomarkers) and quantifies hidden network changes in DNA methylation. DS and a familybased cohort (including healthy siblings and mothers of persons with DS) are used as a case study. Following this approach, we constructed parenclitic networks and obtained different signatures that indicate (i) differences between individuals with DS and healthy individuals; (ii) differences between young and old healthy individuals; (iii) differences between DS individuals and their age-matched siblings, and (iv) difference between DS and the adult population (their mothers). The Gene Ontology analysis showed that the CpG network approach is more powerful than the single CpG approach in identifying biological processes related to DS phenotype. This includes the processes occurring in the central nervous system, skeletal muscles, disorders in carbohydrate metabolism, cardiopathology, and oncogenes. Our open-source software implementation is accessible to all researchers. The software includes a complete workflow, which can be used to construct Parenclitic Networks with any machine learning algorithm as a kernel to build edges. We anticipate a broad applicability of the approach to other diseases.",

One such example, Macaca arctoides, the bear macaque, has compensatory changes in both male and female genital morphology as compared to close relatives. Macaca arctoides also has a complex evolutionary history, having extensive introgression between the fascicularis and sinica macaque species groups. Here, phylogenetic relationships were analyzed via whole genome sequences from five species, including M. arctoides, and two species each from the putative parental species groups. This analysis revealed [~]3x more genomic regions supported placement in the sinica species group as compared to the fascicularis species group. Additionally, introgression analysis of the M. arctoides genome revealed it is a mosaic of recent polymorphisms shared with both species groups. To examine the evolution of their unique genital morphology further, the prevalence of candidate genes involved in genital morphology were compared against genome-wide outliers in various population genetic metrics, while accounting for background variation in recombination rate. This analysis identified 66 outlier genes, including several genes that influence baculum morphology in mice, which were of interest since the bear macaque has the longest primate baculum. The mean of several metrics was statistically different in the candidate genes as compared to the rest of the genome, suggesting that genes involved in genital morphology have increased divergence and decreased diversity beyond expectations. These results highlight how extensive introgression may have contributed to reproductive isolation and shaped the unique genital morphology in the bear macaque.",

Determination of the causal role of these nuclei in state transitions requires simultaneous measurements from the nuclei with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. We obtained long-term experimental single- and multi-unit measurements simultaneously from multiple nuclei of the putative hypothalamic and brainstem sleep-wake regulatory network in freely behaving rats. Cortical and hippocampal activity, along with head acceleration were also acquired to assess behavioral state. Here, we confirm that the general activity profile of the recorded sleep-wake regulatory nuclei is similar to the patterns presented previously in brief recordings of individual nuclei in head-fixed animals. However, we found that these activity profiles when studied with respect to cortical and behavioral signs of state transitions differ significantly from previous reports. Our findings pose fundamental questions about the neural mechanisms that maintain specific states and the neural interactions that lead to the emergence of sleep-wake states.",

Sucrose and glucose supported the pollen germination but galactose and fructose did not support and even considerably inhibited the pollen germination of Vinca rosea. However in pollen germination of Cucumis melo var. utilissimus, all the four sugars supported the pollen germination.

This identifies topographies that reduce colonization in vitro by up to 15-fold compared with a flat surface for both motile and non-motile bacterial pathogens. Equivalent reductions are achieved on polyurethane, a polymer commonly used in medical devices. Using machine learning methods, a set of design rules based on generalisable descriptors is established for predicting bacteria-resistant micro topographies. In a murine foreign body infection model, anti-attachment topographies are shown to be refractory to P. aeruginosa and to recruit a productive host response, highlighting the potential of simple topographical patterning of non-eluting implants for preventing medical device associated infections.",

    "abstract": "HIV integration occurs in chromatin sites that favor the release of high levels of viral progeny, alternatively the virus is also able to discreetly coexist with the host. The viral infection perturbs the cellular environment inducing the remodeling of the nuclear landscape. Indeed, HIV-1 triggers the nuclear clustering of the host factor CPSF6, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Our data indicate that HIV usurps a recently discovered biological phenomenon, called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), to hijack the host cell. We observed CPSF6 clusters as part of HIV-induced membraneless organelles (HIV-1 MLOs) in macrophages, which are one of the main HIV target cells. We describe that HIV-1 MLOs follow phase separation rules and represent functional biomolecular condensates. We highlight HIV-1 MLOs as hubs of nuclear reverse transcription, while the double stranded viral DNA, once formed, rapidly migrates outside these structures. Transcription-competent proviruses localize outside, but near HIV-1 MLOs, in LEDGF-abundant regions, known to be active chromatin sites. Therefore, HIV-1 MLOs orchestrate viral events prior to the integration step and create a favorable environment for the viral replication. This study uncovers single functional host-viral complexes in their nuclear landscape, which is markedly restructured by HIV-1.",

We demonstrate that in order to obtain accurate estimates of mutation rate and timing of events, observed mutation counts should be corrected to account for clonal mutations that occurred after the founding of the tumor, as well as sequencing coverage.

Neural BOLD responses within striatal and medial prefrontal areas tracked the instantaneous difference in the prediction errors generated by these two statistical learning models. BOLD activity in the posterior cingulate, temporoparietal, and prefrontal cortices covaried with changes in estimated controllability. Exposure to inescapable stressors biased controllability estimates downward and increased reliance on the spectator model in an anxiety-dependent fashion.

    "abstract": "BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) strains have been divided into two major categories: classical K. pneumonia, which are frequently multidrug-resistant and cause hospital-acquired infections in patients with impaired defenses, and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae, which cause severe disseminated community-acquired infections in immunologically normal hosts. Both types of infections may lead to bacteremia and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The relative burden of these two types of K. pneumoniae among bloodstream isolates within the United States is not well understood.\n\nMethodsWe examined consecutive K. pneumoniae isolates cultured from the blood of hospitalized patients at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) in Chicago, Illinois April 2015 - April 2017. Bloodstream isolates underwent whole genome sequencing, and clinically relevant data (sequence type [ST], capsule loci, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes) were inferred from the genome using the bioinformatic tools Kleborate and Kaptive. Patient demographic, comorbidity, and infection information, as well as phenotypic antimicrobial resistance of the isolate were extracted from the electronic medical record. Candidate hypervirulent isolates were tested in a murine model of pneumonia. Complete genome sequences of these candidate hypervirulent isolates were obtained and plasmid content was evaluated.\n\nResultsK. pneumoniae bloodstream isolates (n=104) from NMH were highly diverse consisting of 75 distinct STs and 51 unique capsule loci. The majority of these isolates (n=58, 55.8%) were susceptible to all tested antibiotics except ampicillin, but 17 (16.3%) were multidrug-resistant. A total of 32 (30.8%) of these isolates were STs of known high-risk clones, including ST258 and ST45. In particular, 18 (17.3%) were resistant to ceftriaxone, 17 harbored extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and 9 (8.7%) were resistant to meropenem. Four (3.8%) of the 104 isolates were hypervirulent K. pneumoniae, as evidenced by hypermucoviscous phenotypes, high levels of virulence in a murine model of pneumonia, and the presence of large plasmids similar to characterized hypervirulence plasmids. Of particular concern, several of these plasmids contained tra conjugation loci suggesting the potential for transmission. Two of these hypervirulent strains belonged to the well characterized ST23 lineage and one to the emerging ST66 lineage.\n\nConclusionsWhile NMH K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections are caused by highly diverse strains, the most prevalent STs were those of multidrug-resistant high-risk clones. A small number of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae were observed in patients with no recent travel history, suggesting that these isolates are undergoing community spread in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Cataract is one of the most prevalent protein aggregation disorders and still the most common cause of vision loss worldwide. The metabolically quiescent core region of the human lens lacks cellular or protein turnover; it has therefore evolved remarkable mechanisms to resist light-scattering protein aggregation for a lifetime. We now report that one such mechanism involves an unusually abundant lens metabolite, myo-inositol, suppressing aggregation of lens crystallins. We quantified aggregation suppression using our previously well-characterized in vitro aggregation assays of oxidation-mimicking human {gamma}D-crystallin variants and investigated myo-inositols molecular mechanism of action using solution NMR, negative-stain TEM, differential scanning fluorometry, thermal scanning Raman spectroscopy, turbidimetry in redox buffers, and free thiol quantitation. Unlike many known chemical chaperones, myo-inositols primary target was neither the native nor the unfolded state of the protein, nor the final aggregated state, but rather the rate-limiting bimolecular step on the aggregation pathway. Given recent metabolomic evidence that it is severely depleted in human cataractous lenses compared to age-matched controls, we suggest that maintaining or restoring healthy levels of myo-inositol in the lens may be a simple, safe, and globally accessible strategy to prevent or delay lens opacification due to age-onset cataract.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is mutated or amplified in a majority of glioblastoma (GBM), and its mutation and focal amplification correlate with a more aggressive disease course. However, EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) tested to date have yielded minimal clinical benefit. Here, we report a novel covalent-binding EGFR-TKI, CM93, as a potential drug to target adult GBMs with aberrant EGFR. CM93 has extraordinary brain exposure, with a brain-to-plasma ratio greater than 20-fold at estimated steady state. While all approved EGFR-TKIs are subject to extensive efflux transporter activity, CM93 does not inhibit the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) efflux transporters in Caco-2 cells at expected clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Equally, CM93 demonstrates moderate absorption and permeation in Caco-2 cell monolayers with efflux ratios < 2, suggesting that it is not likely a substrate of an efflux transporter. Collectively, these in vitro data may account for the dramatic increase in brain exposure over plasma as noted above. Pre-clinical efficacy studies showed that CM93 is more effective than other EGFR-TKIs in blocking the proliferation of GBM tumor cells from both patient-derived and cultured human GBM cell lines with EGFR amplification and/or EGFRvIII mutation. In addition, CM93 administered as a single agent was able to attenuate the growth of orthotopic U251-EGFRvIII xenografts and extend the survival of tumor-bearing mice in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CM93 inhibited EGFR phosphorylation in GBM tumors derived from a novel genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model of GBM with EGFRvIII expression both in vitro and in vivo. CM93 also extended the survival of mice bearing orthotopic allografts of GBM. Notably, mice maintained stable body weight during treatments with increasing doses of CM93 up to 75 mg/kg per day. Together, these data suggest that CM93 is a potential EGFR-TKI well suited for the treatment of adult GBM with mutant EGFR.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the hippocampus fire in consistent sequence over the timescale of seconds during the delay period of some memory experiments. For longer timescales, firing of hippocampal neurons also changes slowly over minutes within experimental sessions. It was thought that these slow dynamics are caused by stochastic drift or a continuous change in the representation of the episode, rather than consistent sequences unfolding over minutes. This paper studies the consistency of contextual drift in three chronic calcium imaging recordings from the hippocampus CA1 region in mice. Computational measures of consistency show reliable sequences within experimental trials at the scale of seconds as one would expect from time cells or place cells during the trial, as well as across experimental trials on the scale of minutes within a recording session. Consistent sequences in the hippocampus are observed over a wide range of time scales, from seconds to minutes. Hippocampal activity could reflect a scale-invariant spatiotemporal context as suggested by theories of memory from cognitive psychology.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin is known to be organized into multiple domains of varying sizes and compaction. While these domains are often imagined as static structures, they are highly dynamic and show cell-to-cell variability. Since processes such as gene regulation and DNA replication occur in the context of these domains, it is important to understand their organization, fluctuation and dynamics. To simulate chromatin domains, one requires knowledge of interaction strengths among chromatin segments. Here, we derive interaction strength parameters from experimentally known contact maps and use them to predict chromatin organization and dynamics. Taking two domains on the human chromosome as examples, we investigate its 3D organization, size/shape fluctuations, and dynamics of different segments within a domain, accounting for hydrodynamic effects. Considering different cell types, we quantify changes in interaction strengths and chromatin shape fluctuations in different epigenetic states. Perturbing the interaction strengths systematically, we further investigate how epigenetic-like changes can alter the spatio-temporal nature of the domains. Our results show that heterogeneous weak interactions are crucial in determining the organization of the domains. Computing effective stiffness and relaxation times, we investigate how perturbations in interactions affect the solid-like and liquid-like nature of chromatin domains. Quantifying dynamics of chromatin segments within a domain, we show how the competition between polymer entropy and interaction energy influence the timescales of loop formation and maintenance of stable loops.",

    "abstract": "Under starvation conditions, bacteria tend to slow down their translation rate by reducing rRNA synthesis, but the way they accomplish that may vary in different bacteria. In Mycobacterium species, transcription of rRNA is activated by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) accessory transcription factor CarD, which interacts directly with RNAP to stabilize the RNAP-promoter open complex formed on rRNA genes. The functions of CarD have been extensively studied, but the mechanisms that control its expression remain obscure. Here, we report that the level of CarD was tightly regulated when mycobacterial cells switched from nutrient-rich to nutrient-deprived conditions. At the translational level, an antisense RNA of carD (AscarD) was induced in a SigF-dependent manner to bind with carD mRNA and inhibit CarD translation, while at the post-translational level, the residual intracellular CarD was quickly degraded by the Clp protease. AscarD thus worked synergistically with Clp protease to decrease the CarD level to help mycobacterial cells cope with the nutritional stress. Altogether, our work elucidates the regulation mode of CarD and delineates a new mechanism for the mycobacterial starvation response, which is important for the adaptation and persistence of mycobacterial pathogens in the host environment.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) play a pivotal role in shaping diversity in eukaryotic genomes. The covered smut pathogen on barley, Ustilago hordei, encountered a recent genome expansion. Using long reads, we assembled genomes of 6 U. hordei strains and 3 sister species, to study this genome expansion. We found that larger genome sizes can mainly be attributed to a higher genome fraction of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs). In the studied smut genomes, LTR-RTs fractions are the largest in U. hordei and are positively correlated to the mating-type locus sizes, which is up to [~]560 kb in U. hordei. Furthermore, LTR-RTs were found to be associated with higher nucleotide substitution levels, as these higher levels occur more clustered in smut species with a recent LTR-RT proliferation. Moreover, genes in genome regions with higher nucleotide substitution levels generally reside closer to LTR-RTs than other genome regions. Genome regions with many nucleotide substitutions encountered an especially high fraction of CG substitutions, which is not observed for LTR-RT sequences. The high nucleotide substitution levels particularly accelerate the evolution of secretome genes, as their more flexible nature results that substitutions often lead to amino acid alterations.\n\nImportanceGenomic alteration can be generated through various means, in which transposable elements (TEs) can play a pivotal role. Their mobility causes mutagenesis in itself and can disrupt the function of the sequences they insert into. Indirectly, they also impact genome evolution as their repetitive nature facilitates non-homologous recombination. Furthermore, TEs have been linked to specific epigenetic genome organizations. We report a recent TE proliferation in the genome of the barley covered smut fungus, Ustilago hordei. This proliferation is associated with a distinct nucleotide substitution regime that has a higher rate and a higher fraction of CG substitutions. This different regime shapes the evolution of genes in subjected genome regions. Our findings highlight that TEs may influence the error-rate of DNA polymerase in a hitherto unknown fashion.",

Protein-Protein interaction and Pathway Enrichment analysis of these screened genes was done using bioinformatic tools like STRING, Cytoscape and BiNGO, DAVID, KEGG respectively.\n\nResultsA total of 181 genes were found common in both datasets. A PPI network was formed for the screened genes and 20 HUB genes were sorted which included CTNNB1, MAPK14, BTRC, EGFR, ADAM17. Pathway enrichment of HUB genes showed that they were dysregulated in carcinogenic and apoptotic pathways that seem to play a role in the progression of both the BCC.\n\nConclusionThe result and findings of bioinformatic analysis highlighted the molecular pathways and genes enriched in both Eyelid BCC as well as Non-Ocular BCC. The identified pathways should be studied further to recognise common molecular events that would lead to the progression of BCC.

    "abstract": "We systematically investigate the response of neurons to oscillatory currents and synaptic-like inputs and we extend our investigation to non-structured synaptic-like spiking inputs with more realistic distributions of presynaptic spike times. We use two types of chirp-like inputs consisting of (i) a sequence of cycles with discretely increasing frequencies over time, and (ii) a sequence having the same cycles arranged in an arbitrary order. We develop and use a number of frequency-dependent voltage response metrics to capture the different aspects of the voltage response, including the standard impedance (Z) and the peak-to-trough amplitude envelope (VENV) profiles. We show that Z-resonant cells (cells that exhibit subthreshold resonance in response to sinusoidal inputs) also show VENV-resonance in response to sinusoidal inputs, but generally do not (or do it very mildly) in response to square-wave and synaptic-like inputs. In the latter cases the resonant response using Z is not predictive of the preferred frequencies at which the neurons spike when the input amplitude is increased above subthreshold levels. We also show that responses to conductance-based synaptic-like inputs are attenuated as compared to the response to current-based synaptic-like inputs, thus providing an explanation to previous experimental results. These response patterns were strongly dependent on the intrinsic properties of the participating neurons, in particular whether the unperturbed Z-resonant cells had a stable node or a focus. In addition, we show that variability emerges in response to chirp-like inputs with arbitrarily ordered patterns where all signals (trials) in a given protocol have the same frequency content and the only source of uncertainty is the subset of all possible permutations of cycles chosen for a given protocol. This variability is the result of the multiple different ways in which the autonomous transient dynamics is activated across cycles in each signal (different cycle orderings) and across trials. We extend our results to include high-rate Poisson distributed current- and conductance-based synaptic inputs and compare them with similar results using additive Gaussian white noise. We show that the responses to both Poisson-distributed synaptic inputs are attenuated with respect to the responses to Gaussian white noise. For cells that exhibit oscillatory responses to Gaussian white noise (band-pass filters), the response to conductance-based synaptic inputs are low-pass filters, while the response to current-based synaptic inputs may remain band-pass filters, consistent with experimental findings. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of communication of oscillatory activity among neurons in a network via subthreshold oscillations and resonance and the generation of network resonance.",

As TEs move throughout genomes they often act as a source of genetic novelty, hence understanding TE evolution within lineages may help in understanding environmental adaptation. Studies into the TE content of lineages of mammals such as bats have uncovered horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) into these lineages, with squamates often also containing the same TEs. Despite the repeated finding of HTT into squamates, little comparative research has examined the evolution of TEs within squamates. Here we examine a diverse family of Australo-Melanesian snakes (Hydrophiinae) to examine if the previously identified, order-wide pattern of variable TE content and activity holds true on a smaller scale. Hydrophiinae diverged from Asian elapids [~]30 Mya and have since rapidly diversified into six amphibious, [~]60 marine and [~]100 terrestrial species which fill a broad range of ecological niches. We find TE diversity and expansion differs between hydrophiines and their Asian relatives and identify multiple HTTs into Hydrophiinae, including three likely transferred into the ancestral hydrophiine from fish. These HTT events provide the first tangible evidence that Hydrophiinae reached Australia from Asia via a marine route.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale neuroimaging datasets present unique challenges for automated processing pipelines. Mo-tivated by a large clinical trials dataset of Multiple Sclerosis with over 235,000 MRI scans, we consider the challenge of defacing - anonymisation to remove identifying facial features. The defacing process must undergo quality control (QC) checks to ensure that the facial features have been adequately anonymised and that the brain tissue is left completely intact. Visual QC checks - particularly on a project of this scale - are time-consuming and can cause delays in preparing data. We have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can assist with the QC of the application of MRI defacing; our CNN is able to distinguish between scans that are correctly defaced, and can also classify defacing failures into three sub-types to facilitate parameter tuning during remedial re-defacing. Since integrating the CNN into our anonymisation pipeline, over 75,000 scans have been processed. Strict thresholds have been applied so that ambiguous classifications are referred for visual QC checks, however all scans still undergo a time-efficient verification check before being marked as passed. After applying the thresholds, our network is 92% accurate and is able to classify nearly half of the scans without the need for protracted manual checks. Even with the introduction of the verification checks, incorporation of the CNN has reduced the time spent undertaking QC checks by 42% during initial defacing, and by 35% overall. With the help of the CNN, we have been able to successfully deface 96% of the scans in the project whilst maintaining high QC standards. In a similarly sized new project of this scale, we would expect the model to reduce the time spent on manual QC checks by 125 hours. Our approach is applicable to other projects with the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of imaging anonymisation pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a major downstream effector molecule of mTORC1, regulates cell growth and proliferation by modulating protein translation and ribosome biogenesis. We have recently identified eIF4E as an intermediate in transducing signals from mTORC1 to S6K1 and further demonstrated that the role of mTORC1 is restricted to inducing eIF4E phosphorylation and interaction with S6K1. This interaction relieves S6K1 auto-inhibition and facilitates its hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation and activation as a consequence. These observations underscore a possible involvement of mTORC1 independent kinase in mediating HM phosphorylation. Here, we report mTORC2 as an in-vivo/physiological HM kinase of S6K1. We show that rapamycin-resistant S6K1 truncation mutant {Delta}NH{Delta}CT continues to display HM phosphorylation with selective sensitivity toward Torin-1. We also show that HM phosphorylation of wildtype S6K1and {Delta}NH{Delta}CT depends on the presence of mTORC2 regulatory subunit-rictor. Furthermore, truncation mutagenesis and molecular docking analysis reveal the involvement of a conserved 19 amino acid stretch of S6K1 in mediating interaction with rictor. We finally show that deletion of the 19 amino acid region from wild type S6K1 results in loss of interaction with rictor, with a resultant loss of HM phosphorylation regardless of the presence of functional TOS motif. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2 acts as a physiological HM kinase that can activate S6K1 after its auto-inhibition is overcome by mTORC1. We, therefore, propose a novel mechanism for S6K1 regulation where mTOR complex 1 and 2 act in tandem to activate the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Cells are filled with macromolecules and polymer networks that set scale-dependent viscous and elastic properties to the cytoplasm. Although the role of these parameters in molecular diffusion, reaction kinetics and cellular biochemistry is being increasingly recognized, their contributions to the motion and positioning of larger organelles, such as mitotic spindles for cell division remain unknown. Here, using magnetic tweezers to displace and rotate mitotic spindles in living embryos, we uncovered that the cytoplasm can impart viscoelastic reactive forces that move spindles, or passive objects with similar size, back to their original position. These forces are independent of cytoskeletal force generators, yet reach hundreds of piconewtons and scale with cytoplasm crowding. Spindle motion shears and fluidizes the cytoplasm, dissipating elastic energy and limiting spindle recoils with functional implications for asymmetric and oriented divisions. These findings suggest that bulk cytoplasm material properties may constitute important control elements for the regulation of division positioning and cellular organization.\n\nSignificance StatementThe regulation of mitotic spindle positioning is a key process for tissue architecture, embryo development and stem cells. To date, most models have assumed that spindles are positioned by forces exerted by polar cytoskeleton networks, like microtubule asters or acto-myosin bundles. Here, using in situ magnetic tweezers to apply calibrated forces and torques to mitotic spindles in live dividing sea urchin cells, we found that the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm medium in which spindles are embedded can hold spindles in place, and move them back if their original position is perturbed. These viscoelastic forces are large and may significantly participate in the force balance that position and orient mitotic spindles in many cell types.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved process that has been described in different animal systems. For insects, sleep characterization has been primarily achieved using behavioral and electrophysiological correlates in a few systems. Sleep in mosquitoes, which are important vectors of disease-causing pathogens, has not been directly examined. This is surprising as circadian rhythms, which have been well studied in mosquitoes, influence sleep in other systems. In this study, we characterized sleep in mosquitoes using body posture analysis and behavioral correlates, and quantified the effect of sleep deprivation on sleep rebound, host landing and blood-feeding propensity. Body and appendage position metrics revealed a clear distinction between the posture of mosquitoes in their putative sleep and awake states for multiple species, which correlate with a reduction in responsiveness to host cues. Sleep assessment informed by these posture analyses indicated significantly more sleep during periods of low activity. Nighttime and daytime sleep deprivation resulting from the delivery of vibration stimuli induced sleep rebound in the subsequent phase in day and night active mosquitoes, respectively. Lastly, sleep deprivation suppressed host landing in both laboratory and field settings and also impaired blood feeding of a human host when mosquitoes would normally be active. These results suggest that quantifiable sleep states occur in mosquitoes, and highlight the potential epidemiological importance of mosquito sleep.",

    "abstract": "Mendels Law of Segregation states that the offspring of a diploid, heterozygous parent will inherit either allele with equal probability. While the vast majority of loci adhere to this rule, research in model and non-model organisms has uncovered numerous exceptions whereby \"selfish\" alleles are disproportionately transmitted to the next generation. Evidence of such \"transmission distortion\" (TD) in humans remains equivocal in part because scans of human pedigrees have been under-powered to detect small effects. Recently published single-cell sequencing data from individual human sperm (n = 41,189; 969-3,377 cells from each of 25 donors) offer an opportunity to revisit this question with unprecedented statistical power, but require new methods tailored to extremely low-coverage data ([~]0.01 x per cell). To this end, we developed a method, named rhapsodi, that leverages sparse gamete genotype data to phase the diploid genomes of the donor individuals, impute missing gamete genotypes, and discover meiotic recombination breakpoints, benchmarking its performance across a wide range of study designs. After applying rhapsodi to the sperm sequencing data, we then scanned the gametes for evidence of TD. Our results exhibited close concordance with binomial expectations under balanced transmission, in contrast to tenuous signals of TD that were previously reported in pedigree-based studies. Together, our work excludes the existence of even weak TD in this sample, while offering a powerful quantitative framework for testing this and related hypotheses in other cohorts and study systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a generalisable method for the calibration of fluorescence readings on microplate readers, in order to convert arbitrary fluorescence units into absolute units. FPCountR relies on the generation of bespoke fluorescent protein (FP) calibrants, assays to determine protein concentration and activity, and a corresponding analytical workflow. We systematically characterise the assay protocols for accuracy, sensitivity and simplicity, and describe a novel  ECmax assay that outperforms the others and even enables accurate calibration without requiring the purification of FPs. To obtain cellular protein concentrations, we consider methods for the conversion of optical density to either cell counts or alternatively to cell volumes, as well as examining how cells can interfere with protein counting via fluorescence quenching, which we quantify and correct for the first time. Calibration across different instruments, disparate filter sets and mismatched gains is demonstrated to yield equivalent results. It also reveals that mCherry absorption at 600nm does not confound cell density measurements unless expressed to over 100,000 proteins per cell. FPCountR is presented as pair of open access tools (protocol and R package) to enable the community to use this method, and ultimately to facilitate the quantitative characterisation of synthetic microbial circuits.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation is a defining feature of living systems. The bacterial flagellar motor adapts to changes in the external mechanical environment by adding or removing torque-generating stator units. However, the molecular mechanism for mechanosensitive motor remodeling remains unclear. Here, we induced stator disassembly using electrorotation, followed by the time-dependent assembly of the individual stator units into the motor after electrorotation was terminated. From these experiments, we extracted detailed statistics of the dwell times that comprise the stochastic dynamics of the binding and unbinding of stator units. Dwell times reveal multiple timescales, indicating the existence of multiple binding states of the stator units. Based on these results, we propose a minimal model in which the stator unit can occupy four different states - two bound states with very different rates of unbinding, a diffusive unbound state, and a transiently detached state. Our minimal model quantitatively explains multiple features of the experimental data and allows us to determine the transition rates among all four states. Our experiments and modeling suggest a mechanism of mechano-adaptive remodeling of the bacterial flagellar motor in which torque generated by bound stator units controls their effective unbinding rate by modulating the transition between the two bound states. Furthermore, the binding rate of stator units with the motor has a non-monotonic dependence on the number of bound units, likely because of two counteracting effects of motor rotation on the binding process.",

    "abstract": "The United States Army recently implemented the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) which was designed to more accurately measure functional-combat fitness constructs. The ACFT replaced the former Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). The three advent APFT consisted of: two-minute push-ups (PU), two-minute sit-ups (SU), and a timed two-mile run (RUN). The ACFT consists of six events; 3 Rep Max Deadlift (MDL), Standing Power Throw (SPT), Hand Release Push-up (HRP), Sprint-Drag-Carry (SDC), Hanging Leg Tuck (LTK), and a timed two-mile run (2MR). This study investigated the relationship between Soldier height (1.79{+/-}0.07 m) and weight (body mass 86.8{+/-}14.2 kg, BMI 27.1{+/-}3.9) on ACFT scores (442.3{+/-}54.4) of 655 male U.S. Army National Guard Soldiers in a Field Artillery Brigade. For the purpose of the investigation body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the metric representing the Soldiers height and weight. The mean and standard deviation (sd) were calculated for the ACFT event and total scores. Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs or r) were calculated between BMI and ACFT event and total scores. Likewise, PCCs were calculated between the ACFT event and total scores. The ACFT mean{+/-}sd scores were as follows: MDL=92.2{+/-}31.8 (3 maximum repetitions), SPT=9.5{+/-}2.2 (meters), HRP=24.6{+/-}13.1 (repetitions), SDC=119.8{+/-}21.7 (seconds), LTK=6.2{+/-}5.4 (repetitions), 2MR=1095.0{+/-}233.7 (seconds), ACFT total score=442.3{+/-}54.4 (points). Significant positive correlations were found between the ACFT total score: MDL (r=0.70), SPT (r=0.50), HRP (r=0.74), and LTK (r=0.76) events. Conversely, significant negative correlations were identified between ACFT total score: SDC (r=-0.68) and 2MR (r=-0.53) events. Within the parameters of this study, Soldier BMI demonstrated \"no to weak\" association with individual ACFT event or ACFT total scores. Further, the range of PCCs between the ACFT event scores were \"no to moderately high\". Military leaders may consider the results provided as combat and fitness tests continue to evolve.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria and peroxisomes are both dynamic signaling organelles that constantly undergo fission. While mitochondrial fission is known to coordinate cellular metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis, the physiological relevance of peroxisome dynamics and the implications for cell fate are not fully understood. DRP1 (dynamin-related protein 1) is an essential GTPase that executes both mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission. Patients with de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the gene that encodes DRP1, DNM1L (Dynamin 1 Like), present with encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission (EMPF1). EMPF1 is a devastating neurodevelopmental disease with no effective treatment. To interrogate the mechanisms by which DRP1 mutations cause cellular dysfunction, we used human-derived fibroblasts from patients with mutations in DRP1 who present with EMPF1. As expected, patient cells display elongated mitochondrial morphology and lack of fission. Patient cells display a lower coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain, increased proton leak, and upregulation of glycolysis. In addition to these metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial hyperfusion results in aberrant cristae structure and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, both of which are tightly linked to the changes in metabolism. Peroxisome structure is also severely elongated in patient cells and results in a potential functional compensation of fatty acid oxidation. Understanding the mechanism by which DRP1 mutations cause these metabolic changes will give insight into the role of mitochondrial dynamics in cristae maintenance and the metabolic capacity of the cell, as well as the disease mechanism underlying EMPF1.",

Sensitivity of individual-level data, ethical and practical considerations regarding data sharing across institutions could be a potential challenge for achieving this added power. Hence we implemented a federated meta-analysis approach of survival models in DataSHIELD, where only anonymous aggregated data are shared across institutions, while simultaneously allowing for exploratory, interactive modelling.\n\nIn this case, meta-analysis techniques to combine analysis results from each site are a solution, but an analytic workflow involving local analysis undertaken at individual studies hinders exploration. Thus, the aim is to provide a framework for performing meta-analysis of Cox regression models across institutions without manual analysis steps for the data providers.\n\nResultsWe introduce a package (dsSurvival) which allows privacy preserving meta-analysis of survival models, including the calculation of hazard ratios. Our tool can be of great use in biomedical research where there is a need for building survival models and there are privacy concerns about sharing data.",

The SG receptor that transduces the Fog signal into Rho1-dependent myosin activation has not been identified. Here, we reveal that the Smog GPCR transduces Fog signal to regulate Rho kinase accumulation and myosin activation in the medioapical region of cells to control apical constriction during SG invagination. We also report on unexpected Fog-independent roles for Smog in maintaining epithelial integrity and organizing cortical actin. Our data supports a model wherein Smog regulates distinct myosin pools and actin cytoskeleton in a ligand-dependent manner during epithelial tube formation.",

However, multiple sources of bias and noise in sampling and processing combine to inject error into DNA-based datasets. We focus here on the laboratory and bioinformatic processes of generating DNA-based data, since sampling bias and noise are addressed extensively in the ecological literature. To extract abundance information, it is useful to distinguish two concepts. (1) Within-sample across-species quantification describes relative species abundances within one sample. (2) Across-sample within-species quantification describes how the abundance of each individual species varies from sample to sample, as in a time series, an environmental gradient, or experimental treatments. First, we review the literature on methods to recover (1) across-species abundance information (which is achieved by removing what we call  species pipeline biases) and (2) within-species abundance information (by removing what we call  pipeline noise). We argue that many ecological questions can be answered by extracting only within-species quantification, and we therefore demonstrate how to use a  DNA spike-in to correct for pipeline noise and recover within-species abundance information. We also introduce a model-based estimator that can be employed on datasets without a physical spike-in to approximately estimate and correct for pipeline noise.",

Despite its advantages, the weak intensity of Raman spectroscopy leads to low-quality signals, particularly with tissue samples. The requirement of high exposure times makes Raman a time-consuming process and diminishes its non-invasive property while studying living tissues. Novel denoising techniques using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved remarkable results in image processing. Here, we propose a similar approach for noise reduction for the Raman spectra acquired with 10x lower exposure times. In this work, we developed fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture (FCED) and trained them with noisy Raman signals. The results demonstrate that our model is superior (p-value < 0.0001) to the conventional denoising techniques such as the Savitzky-Golay filter and wavelet denoising. Improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio values ranges from 20% to 80%, depending on the initial signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, we proved that tissue analysis could be done in a shorter time without any need for instrumental enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Cells use signal relay to transmit information across tissue scales. However, the production of information carried by signal relay remains poorly characterised. To determine how the coding features of signal relay are generated, we used the classic system for long-range signalling: the periodic cAMP waves that drive Dictyostelium collective migration. Combining imaging and optogenetic perturbation of cell signalling states, we find that migration is triggered by an increase in wave frequency generated at the signalling centre. Wave frequency is regulated by cAMP wave circulation, which organises the long-range signal. To determine the mechanisms modulating wave circulation, we combined mathematical modelling, the general theory of excitable media and mechanical perturbations to test competing models. Models in which cell density and spatial patterning modulate the wave frequency cannot explain the temporal evolution of signalling waves. Instead, our evidence leads to a model where wave circulation increases the ability for cell to relay the signal, causing further increase in the circulation rate. This implies that information driving a morphogenetic transition gradually unfolds due to positive feedback between cell signalling state and signalling pattern. This demonstrates how the coding properties of a long-range signal arise from self-organised wave dynamics at the signalling centre.",

    "abstract": "Nitrate (NO3-) is a signaling molecule that regulates gene expression in plants. The nitrate response has been extensively characterized at the transcriptome level. However, we know little about RNA nucleocytoplasmic dynamics during nitrate response. To understand the role of mRNA localization during the nitrate response, we isolated mRNA from the nucleus, cytoplasm, and whole-cells from nitrate-treated Arabidopsis roots and performed RNA-seq. We identified 402 differentially localized transcripts (DLTs) in response to nitrate. DLTs were enriched in GO-terms related to metabolism, response to stimulus, and transport. DLTs showed five localization patterns: nuclear reduction, cytoplasmic reduction, nuclear accumulation, cytoplasmic accumulation, or delayed-cytoplasmic accumulation in response to nitrate. DLTs exhibited large changes in RNA polymerase II occupancy of cognate genes and high mRNA turnover rates, indicating these are rapidly replaced mRNAs. The NITRATE REDUCTASE 1 (NIA1) transcript exhibited the largest changes in synthesis and decay. Using single-molecule RNA FISH, we showed that NIA1 nuclear accumulation occurs mainly at transcription sites. The decay profiles for NIA1 showed a higher half-life when the transcript accumulated in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. We propose that regulating nucleocytoplasmic mRNA distribution allows tuning transcript availability of fastly replaced mRNAs, controlling plants adaptive response to nitrogen nutrient signals.",

Mutant alleles in the human gene encoding CRX result in a variety of distinct blinding retinopathies, including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and Leber congenital amaurosis. Despite the success of using in vitro biochemistry, animal models, and genomics approaches to study this clinically relevant transcription factor over the past 24 years since its initial characterization, there are no high-resolution structures in the published literature for the CRX protein. In this study, we use bioinformatic approaches and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) structural analysis to further understand the biochemical complexity of the human CRX homeodomain (CRX-HD). We find that the CRX-HD is a compact, globular monomer in solution that can specifically bind functional cis-regulatory elements encoded upstream of retina -specific genes. This study presents the first structural analysis of CRX, paving the way for a new approach to studying the biochemistry of this protein and its disease-causing mutant protein variants.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific competition at the larval stage is an important ecological factor affecting life-history, adaptation and evolutionary trajectory in holometabolous insects. However, the molecular pathways and physiological trade-offs underpinning these ecological processes are poorly characterised. We reared Drosophila melanogaster at three egg densities (5, 60 and 300 eggs/ml) and sequenced the transcriptomes of pooled third-instar larvae. We also examined emergence time, egg-to-adult viability, adult mass and adult sex-ratio at each density. Medium crowding had minor detrimental effects on adult phenotypes compared to low density and yielded 24 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including several chitinase enzymes. In contrast, high crowding had substantial detrimental effects on adult phenotypes and yielded 2107 DEGs. Among these, upregulated gene sets were enriched in sugar, steroid and amino acid metabolism as well as DNA replication pathways, whereas downregulated gene sets were enriched in ABC transporters, Taurine, Toll/Imd signalling and P450 xenobiotics metabolism pathways. Overall, our findings show that larval overcrowding has a large consistent effect on several molecular pathways (i.e., core responses) with few pathways displaying density-specific regulation (i.e., idiosyncratic responses). This provides important insights into how holometabolous insects respond to intraspecific competition during development.",

    "abstract": "The composition of ecologically important moss-associated bacterial communities seems to be mainly driven by host species, but may also be shaped by environmental conditions related with tree-canopy dominance. The moss phyllosphere has been studied in coniferous forests while broadleaf forests remain understudied. To determine if host species or environmental conditions defined by tree-canopy dominance drives the bacterial diversity in the moss phyllosphere, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to quantify changes in bacterial communities as a function of host species (Pleurozium schreberi and Ptilium crista-castrensis) and forest type (coniferous black spruce versus deciduous broadleaf trembling aspen) in eastern Canada. Forest type, not host species, was the main factor affecting moss phyllosphere bacterial community composition, though the interaction of both variables was significant. Bacterial -diversity was highest in spruce forests, while there was greater turnover ({beta}- diversity) and higher {gamma}-diversity in aspen forests. Unexpectedly, Cyanobacteria were much more relatively abundant in aspen than in spruce forests, with the bacterial family Nostocaceae (Cyanobacteria) differing the most between both forest types. Our results suggest that the increasing change in dominance from coniferous to broadleaf trees due to natural and anthropic disturbances is likely to affect the composition of moss-associated bacteria in boreal forests.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal environmental insults increase the risk of neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions in the offspring. Structural modifications of dendritic spines are central to brain development and plasticity. Using maternal immune activation (MIA) as a rodent model of prenatal environmental insult, previous results have reported dendritic structural deficits in the frontal cortex. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying MIA-induced synaptic structural alterations in the offspring. Using prenatal (E12.5) injection with poly-(I:C) as a mouse MIA model, we show that upregulation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is at least in part responsible for some of the effects of prenatal insults on frontal cortex dendritic spine structure and sensorimotor gating processes. Mechanistically, we report that this upregulation of frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression is associated with MIA-induced reduction of nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, consequently, a decrease in the enrichment of GR at the 5-HT2AR promoter. The translational significance of these preclinical findings is supported by data in postmortem human brain samples suggesting dysregulated nuclear GR translocation in frontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects. Repeated (twice a day for 4 days) corticosterone administration augmented frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression and reduced GR binding to the 5-HT2AR promoter. However, virally (AAV)-mediated augmentation of GR function reduced frontal cortex 5-HT2AR expression and improved sensorimotor gating processes via 5-HT2AR. Together, these data support a negative regulatory relationship between GR signaling and 5-HT2AR expression in mouse frontal cortex that may carry implications for the pathophysiology underlying 5-HT2AR dysregulation in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Grass inflorescences support floral structures that each bear a single grain, where variation in branch architecture directly impacts yield. The maize RAMOSA1 (ZmRA1) transcription factor acts as a key regulator of inflorescence development by imposing branch meristem determinacy. Here, we show RA1 transcripts accumulate in boundary domains adjacent to spikelet meristems in Sorghum bicolor (Sb) and Setaria viridis (Sv) inflorescences similar as in the developing maize tassel and ear. To evaluate functional conservation of syntenic RA1 orthologs and promoter cis sequences in maize, sorghum and setaria, we utilized interspecies gene transfer and assayed genetic complementation in a common inbred background by quantifying recovery of normal branching in highly ramified ra1-R mutants. A ZmRA1 transgene that includes endogenous upstream and downstream flanking sequences recovered normal tassel and ear branching in ra1-R. Interspecies expression of two transgene variants of the SbRA1 locus, modeled as the entire endogenous tandem duplication or just the non-frameshifted downstream copy, complemented ra1-R branching defects and induced novel fasciation and branch patterns. The SvRA1 locus lacks conserved, upstream noncoding cis sequences found in maize and sorghum; interspecies expression of an SvRA1 transgene did not or only partially recovered normal inflorescence forms. Driving expression of the SvRA1 coding region by the ZmRA1 upstream region, however, recovered normal inflorescence morphology in ra1-R. These data leveraging interspecies gene transfer suggest that cis-encoded temporal regulation of RA1 expression is a key factor in modulating branch meristem determinacy that ultimately impacts grass inflorescence architecture.",

    "abstract": "Penicillin and related antibiotics disrupt cell wall synthesis in bacteria and induce lysis by misactivating cell wall hydrolases called autolysins. Despite the clinical importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the factors that control autolysins and how penicillins subvert this regulation to kill cells. In the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), LytA is the major autolysin responsible for penicillin-induced bacteriolysis. We recently discovered that penicillin treatment of Sp causes a dramatic shift in surface polymer biogenesis in which cell wall-anchored teichoic acids (WTAs) increase in abundance at the expense of lipid-linked lipoteichoic acids. Because LytA binds to these polymers, this change recruits the enzyme to its substrate where it cleaves the cell wall and elicits lysis. In this report, we identify WhyD (SPD_0880) as a new factor that controls the level of WTAs in Sp cells to prevent LytA misactivation and lysis. We show that WhyD is a WTA hydrolase that restricts the WTA content of the wall to areas adjacent to active PG synthesis. Our results support a model in which the WTA tailoring activity of WhyD directs PG remodeling activity required for proper cell elongation in addition to preventing autolysis by LytA.",

    "abstract": "Free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginanus) across the United States are increasingly recognized as involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission cycles. Through a cross-sectional study of 80 deer at three captive cervid facilities in central and southern Texas, we provide evidence of 34 of 36 (94.4%) white-tailed deer at a single captive cervid facility seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization assay (PRNT90), with endpoint titers as high as 1280. In contrast, all tested white-tailed deer and axis deer (Axis axis) at two other captive cervid facilities were seronegative, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in respiratory swabs from deer at any of the three facilities. These data support transmission among captive deer that cannot be explained by human contact for each infected animal, as only a subset of the seropositive does had direct human contact. The facility seroprevalence was more than double of that reported from wild deer, suggesting that the confined environment may facilitate transmission. Further exploration of captive cervids and other managed animals for their role in the epizootiology of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding impacts on animal health and the potential for spillback transmission to humans or other animal taxa.\n\nImportanceAs SARS-CoV-2 vaccine coverge of the human population increases and variants of concern continue to emerge, identification of the epidemiologic importance of animal virus reservoirs is critical. We found that nearly all (94.4%) of the captive white-tailed deer at a cervid facility in central Texas had neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. This seroprevalence is over double than that which has been reported from free-ranging deer from other regions of the US. Horizontal transmission among deer may be facilitated in confinement. Tracking new infections among wild and confined deer is critical for understanding the importance of animal reservoirs for both veterinary and human health.",

    "abstract": "The phytopathogenic fungus Rhizopus microsporus harbours a bacterial endosymbiont (Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica) for the production of the toxin rhizoxin, the causative agent of rice seedling blight. This toxinogenic bacterial-fungal alliance is, however, not restricted to the plant disease, but has been detected in numerous environmental isolates from geographically distinct sites covering all five continents. Yet, the ecological role of rhizoxin beyond rice seedling blight has been unknown.\n\nHere we show that rhizoxin serves the fungal host in fending off protozoan and metazoan predators. Fluorescence microscopy and co-culture experiments with the fungivorous amoeba Protostelium aurantium revealed that ingestion of R. microsporus spores is toxic to P. aurantium. This amoebicidal effect is caused by the bacterial rhizoxin congener rhizoxin S2, which is also lethal towards the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. By combining stereomicroscopy, automated image analyses, and quantification of nematode movement we show that the fungivorous nematode Aphelenchus avenae actively feeds on R. microsporus that is lacking endosymbionts, while worms co-incubated with symbiotic R. microsporus are significantly less lively.\n\nThis work uncovers an unexpected ecological role of rhizoxin as shield against micropredators. This finding suggests that predators may function an evolutionary driving force to maintain toxin-producing endosymbionts in non-pathogenic fungi.",

Here we report that hypoxia in Drosophila induces acute and reversible depletion of PM PI4P and PIP2 that severely disrupts the electrostatic PM targeting of multiple polybasic polarity proteins. Genetically encoded ATP sensors confirmed that hypoxia induces acute and reversible reduction of cellular ATP levels which showed a strong real-time correlation with the levels of PM PI4P and PIP2 in cultured cells. By combining genetic manipulations with quantitative imaging assays we showed that PI4KIII, as well as Rbo/EFR3 and TTC7 that are essential for targeting PI4KIII to PM, are required for maintaining the homeostasis and dynamic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 under normoxia and hypoxia. Our results revealed that in cells challenged by energetic stresses triggered by hypoxia, ATP inhibition and possibly ischemia, dramatic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 could have profound impact on many cellular processes including electrostatic PM targeting of numerous polybasic proteins.",

Most large outbreaks are caused by cooling towers contaminated with L. pneumophila. The resident microbiota of the cooling tower is a key determinant for the colonization and growth of L. pneumophila. The genus Pseudomonas correlates negatively with the presence of L. pneumophila, but it is not clear which species is responsible. Therefore, we identified the Pseudomonas species inhabiting 14 cooling towers using a Pseudomonas-specific 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing strategy. Cooling towers free of L. pneumophila contained a high relative abundance of members from the Pseudomonas alcaliphila/oleovorans phylogenetic cluster. In vitro, P. alcaliphila JCM 10630 inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila on agar plates. Analysis of the P. alcaliphila genome revealed the presence of a genes cluster predicted to produce toxoflavin. L. pneumophila growth was inhibited by pure toxoflavin and by extract from P. alcaliphila culture found to contain toxoflavin by LC-ESI-MS. In addition, toxoflavin inhibits growth of Vermameoba vermiformis, a host cell of L. pneumophila. Our study indicates that P. alcaliphila may be important to restrict growth of L. pneumophila in water systems through the production of toxoflavin. A sufficiently high concentration is likely not achieved in the bulk water but might have a local inhibitory effect such as in biofilm.",

    "abstract": "Introgression appears increasingly ubiquitous in the evolutionary history of various taxa, including humans. However, accurately estimating introgression is difficult, particularly when 1) there are many parameters, 2) multiple models fit the data well, and 3) parameters are not simultaneously estimated. Here, we use the software Legofit to investigate the evolutionary history of bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (P. troglodytes) using whole genome sequences. This approach 1) ignores within-population variation, reducing the number of parameters requiring estimation, 2) allows for model selection, and 3) simultaneously estimates all parameters. We tabulated site patterns from the autosomes of 71 bonobos and chimpanzees representing all five extant Pan lineages. We then compared previously proposed demographic models and estimated parameters using a deterministic approach. We further considered sex bias in Pan evolutionary history by analyzing the site patterns from the X chromosome. Introgression from bonobos into the ancestor of eastern and central chimpanzees and from western into eastern chimpanzees best explained the autosomal site patterns. This second event was substantial with an estimated 0.21 admixture proportion. Estimates of effective population size and most divergence dates are consistent with previous findings; however, we observe a deeper divergence within chimpanzees at 987 ka. Finally, we identify male-biased reproduction in Pan evolutionary history and suggest that western to eastern chimpanzee introgression was driven by western males mating with eastern females.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction mutations can impair energy sensing and cause cancer. Loss of function of mitochondrial TCA cycle enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) results in various forms of cancer typified by pheochromocytoma (PC). Here we delineate a signaling cascade where the loss of SDHB induces the Warburg effect in PC tumors, triggers dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, and aberrantly activates calpain and the protein kinase Cdk5, through conversion of its cofactor from p35 to p25. Consequently, aberrant Cdk5 initiates a cascade of phospho- signaling where GSK3 inhibition inactivates energy sensing by AMP-kinase through dephosphorylation of the AMP-kinase {gamma} subunit, PRKAG2. Overexpression of p25-GFP in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells also elicits this phosphorylation signaling and causes PC tumor formation. A novel Cdk5 inhibitor, MRT3-007, reversed this phospho-cascade, invoking an anti- Warburg effect, cell cycle arrest, and senescence-like phenotype. This therapeutic approach halted tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we reveal an important novel mechanistic feature of metabolic sensing and demonstrate that its dysregulation underlies tumor progression in PC and likely other cancers.\n\nHighlightsO_LILoss of SDHB function in pheochromocytoma causes Ca2+ dysregulation, calpain activation, and aberrant activation of the protein kinase Cdk5.\nC_LIO_LIHyperactive Cdk5 deregulates a GSK3/PRKAG2/AMPK signaling cascade.\nC_LIO_LIp25 overexpression and consequent aberrant Cdk5 activity in chromaffin cells causes pheochromocytoma.\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of Cdk5 activates the PRKAG2/AMPK/p53 signaling to rescue cell senescence and block PC tumor progression.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475410v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f0a48org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c1c7aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21b100org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eb8674_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Formation of endomembrane vesicles is crucial in all eukaryotic cells and relies on vesicle coats such as clathrin. Clathrin-coated vesicles form at the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi Network. They contain adaptor proteins, which serve as binding bridges between clathrin, vesicle membranes, and cargoes. A large family of monomeric ANTH/ENTH/VHS adaptors is present in A. thaliana. Here, we characterize two homologous ANTH-type clathrin adaptors, CAP1 and ECA4, in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). CAP1 and ECA4 are recruited to sites at the PM identified as clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), where they occasionally exhibit early bursts of high recruitment. Subcellular binding preferences of N- and C-terminal fluorescent protein fusions of CAP1 identified a functional adaptin-binding motif in the unstructured tails of CAP1 and ECA4. In turn, no function can be ascribed to a double serine phosphorylation site conserved in these proteins. Double knockout mutants do not exhibit deficiencies in general development or CME, but a contribution of CAP1 and ECA4 to these processes is revealed in crosses into sensitized endocytic mutant backgrounds. Overall, our study documents a contribution of CAP1 and ECA4 to CME in A. thaliana and opens questions about functional redundancy among non-homologous vesicle coat components.",

    "abstract": "The GNOM (GN) Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor for ARF small GTPases (ARF-GEF) is among the best studied trafficking regulators in plants, playing crucial and unique developmental roles in patterning and polarity. The current models place GN at the Golgi apparatus (GA), where it mediates secretion/recycling, and at the plasma membrane (PM) presumably contributing to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The mechanistic basis of the developmental function of GN, distinct from the other ARF-GEFs including its homologue GNOM-LIKE1 (GNL1), remains elusive. Insights from this study redefine the current notions of GN function. We show that GN, but not GNL1, localizes to the PM at long-lived structures distinct from clathrin-coated pits, while CME and secretion proceed normally in gn knockouts. The functional GN mutant variant GNfewerroots, absent from the GA, suggests that PM is the major place of GN action responsible for its developmental function. Following inhibition by Brefeldin A, GN, but not GNL1, relocates to the PM likely on exocytic vesicles, suggesting selective molecular associations. A study of GN-GNL1 chimeric ARF-GEFs indicate that all GN domains contribute to the specific GN function in a partially redundant manner. Together, this study offers significant steps towards the elucidation of the mechanism underlying unique cellular and development functions of GN.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is an essential process of cellular cargo uptake operating in all eukaryotes. In animal and yeast, CME involves BAR-SH3 domain proteins, endophilins and amphiphysins, which function at the conclusion of CME to recruit factors for vesicle scission and uncoating. Arabidopsis thaliana contains BAR-SH3 domain proteins SH3P1-3, but their role is poorly understood. We identify SH3P1-3 as functional homologues of endophilin/amphiphysin. SH3P1-3 bind to discrete foci at the plasma membrane (PM), and colocalization indicates late recruitment of SH3P2 to a subset of clathrin-coated pits. PM recruitment pattern of SH3P2 is nearly identical to its interactor, a putative vesicle uncoating factor AUXILIN-LIKE1, and SH3P1-3 are required for most of AUXILIN-LIKE1 PM binding. This indicates a plant-specific modification of CME, where BAR-SH3 proteins recruit auxilin-like uncoating factors, rather than the uncoating phosphatases synaptojanins. Furthermore, we identify an unexpected redundancy between SH3P1-3 and a plant-specific endocytic adaptor, TPLATE complex, showing a contribution of SH3P1-3 to gross CME.",

    "abstract": "1Although various empirical studies have reported a positive correlation between the specific growth rate and cell size across bacteria, it is currently unclear what causes this relationship. We conjecture that such scaling occurs because smaller cells have a larger surface-to-volume ratio and thus have to allocate a greater fraction of the total resources to the production of the cell envelope, leaving fewer resources for other biosynthetic processes. To test this theory, we developed a coarse-grained model of bacterial physiology composed of the proteome that converts nutrients into biomass, with the cell envelope acting as a resource sink. Assuming resources are partitioned to maximize the growth rate, the model yields expected scalings. Namely, the growth rate and ribosomal mass fraction scale negatively, while the mass fraction of envelope-producing enzymes scales positively with surface-to-volume. These relationships are compatible with growth measurements and quantitative proteomics data reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities, through their metabolism, drive carbon cycling in marine environments. These complex communities are composed of many different microorganisms including heterotrophic bacteria, each with its own nutritional needs and metabolic capabilities. Yet, models of ecosystem processes typically treat heterotrophic bacteria as a \"black box\", which does not resolve metabolic heterogeneity nor address ecologically important processes such as the successive modification of different types of organic matter. Here we directly address the heterogeneity of metabolism by characterizing the carbon source utilization preferences of 63 heterotrophic bacteria representative of several major marine clades. By systematically growing these bacteria on 10 media containing specific subsets of carbon sources found in marine biomass, we obtained a phenotypic fingerprint that we used to explore the relationship between metabolic preferences and phylogenetic or genomic features. At the class level, these bacteria display broadly conserved patterns of preference for different carbon sources. Despite these broad taxonomic trends, growth profiles correlate poorly with phylogenetic distance or genome-wide gene content. However, metabolic preferences are strongly predicted by a handful of key enzymes that preferentially belong to a few enriched metabolic pathways, such as those involved in glyoxylate metabolism and biofilm formation. We find that enriched pathways point to enzymes directly involved in the metabolism of the corresponding carbon source and suggest potential associations between metabolic preferences and other ecologically-relevant traits. The availability of systematic phenotypes across multiple synthetic media constitutes a valuable resource for future quantitative modeling efforts and systematic studies of inter-species interactions.\n\nImportanceHalf of the Earths annual primary production is carried out by phytoplankton in the surface ocean. However, this metabolic activity is heavily impacted by heterotrophic bacteria, which dominate the transformation of organic matter released from phytoplankton. Here, we characterize the diversity of metabolic preferences across many representative heterotrophs by systematically growing them on different fractions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Our analysis suggests that different clades of bacteria have substantially distinct preferences for specific carbon sources, in a way that cannot be simply mapped onto phylogeny. These preferences are associated with the presence of specific genes and pathways, reflecting an association between metabolic capabilities and ecological lifestyles. In addition to helping understand the importance of heterotrophs under different conditions, the phenotypic fingerprint we obtained can help build higher resolution quantitative models of global microbial activity and biogeochemical cycles in the oceans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays an important regulatory role in inflammatory and hypoxic diseases. Higher HIF-1 level was found in lungs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, however, its role in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced COPD has not been fully studied. Digoxin has been showed to inhibit HIF-1 translation and block HIF-1 activity and thus is often used as the HIF-1 inhibitor. Therefore, in the present study, we chose digoxin as the inhibitor to investigate whether HIF-1 contributes to the progression of COPD and possible mechanism.\n\nMethodsCS-exposed mice were intragastrically treated with different doses of digoxin, and COPD-associated phenotypes such as pathological changes in lungs, inflammation, lung function and mucus secretion in airways were evaluated. Meanwhile, CSE-treated A549 cells were administrated with digoxin or S7959. Moreover, EMT-associated markers together with HIF-1\\TGF-{beta}1\\Smad3 signaling pathway were detected both in vivo and in vitro.\n\nResultsThe level of HIF-1 was significantly increased in lungs of COPD mice and CSE-exposed A549 cells, which was markedly suppressed by digoxin. Moreover, digoxin inhibited CS-induced inflammatory responses, lung function decline, and mucus hyper-secretion in COPD mouse model. In in vitro studies, digoxin decreased CSE-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Importantly, CS-induced or CSE-induced EMT and up-regulation of HIF-1/TGF-{beta}1/Smad pathway was inhibited by digoxin. Additionally, S7959 mitigated CSE-induced EMT in A549 cells.\n\nConclusionsDigoxin can protect CS-induced COPD and prevent CS-induced EMT possibly through HIF-1/TGF-{beta}1/Smad3 signaling pathway. This study suggests HIF1- could be a potential intervention target for COPD prevention and treatment, especially for EMT in CS-induced COPD.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-antimicrobial link hypothesis is based on antimicrobial properties found in human amyloids involved in neurodegenerative and systemic diseases, along with amyloidal structural properties found in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) across kingdoms of life. Supporting this hypothesis, we here determined the fibril structure of two AMPs from amphibians, uperin 3.5 and aurein 3.3, by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), revealing amyloid cross-{beta} fibrils of mated {beta}-sheets at atomic resolution. Uperin 3.5 displayed substantial polymorphism with a protofilament of two mated {beta}-sheets. The determined structure was a polymorph showing a 3-blade symmetrical propeller of nine peptides per fibril layer including tight {beta}-sheet interfaces. This cross-{beta} cryo-EM structure complements the cross- fibril conformation previously determined by a crystal structure, substantiating a secondary structure switch mechanism of uperin 3.5. The aurein 3.3 arrangement consisted of six peptides per fibril layer, all showing kinked {beta}-sheets allowing a rounded compactness of the fibril. The kinked {beta}-sheets are similar to LARKS (Low-complexity, Amyloid-like, Reversible, Kinked segments) found in human functional amyloids. The amyloidal properties of antimicrobial peptides shed light on a mechanism of regulation of animicrobial activity involving self-assembly and fibril morphological variations. Moreover, the known endurance of amyloid structures can provide a template for the design of sturdy antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) therapeutics have developed rapidly in recent years, despite the challenges associated with delivery of large, highly charged nucleic acids. Delivery of siRNA therapeutics to the liver has been established, with conjugation of siRNA to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) providing durable gene knockdown in hepatocytes following subcutaneous injection. GalNAc binds the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) that is highly expressed on hepatocytes and exploits this scavenger receptor to deliver siRNA across the plasma membrane by endocytosis. However, siRNA needs to access the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm to provide effective gene knockdown and the entire siRNA delivery process is very inefficient, likely due to steps required for endosomal escape, intracellular trafficking, and stability of siRNA. To reveal the cellular factors limiting delivery of siRNA therapeutics, we performed a pooled, genome wide knockout screen based on delivery of GalNAc conjugated siRNA targeting the HPRT1 gene in the human hepatocellular carcinoma line Hep3B. Our primary pooled genome wide knockout screen identified candidate genes that when knocked out significantly enhanced siRNA efficacy in Hep3B cells. Follow-up studies indicate that knockout of one gene in particular, RAB18, improved siRNA efficacy.",

This transgenic line was used to run a whole organism based chemical screen in zebrafish larvae. In this screen we identified BML-257, a potent small molecule AKT inhibitor, that protected the liver against metronidazole-induced liver injury. BML-257 also showed potent prophylactic and pro-regenerative activity in this liver damage model. BML-257 also showed remarkable protective action in two independent toxicological models of liver injury caused by acetaminophen and Isoniazid.

    "abstract": "The lipid phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] is a master regulator of plasma membrane (PM) function. It engages effector proteins that regulate diverse traffic, transport, signaling and cytoskeletal processes that define PM structure and function. How a single class of lipid molecules independently regulate so many parallel processes remains an open question. We tested the hypothesis that spatially segregated pools of PI(4,5)P2 are associated with, and thus reserved for regulation of, different functional complexes in the PM. The mobility of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane was measured using lipid biosensors by single particle tracking photoactivation localization microscopy (sptPALM). We found that PI(4,5)P2, and several other classes of inner PM lipids, diffuse rapidly at approximately 0.3 {micro}m2/s with largely Brownian motion, although they spend approximately a third of their time diffusing much more slowly. Surprisingly, areas of the PM occupied by PI(4,5)P2-dependent complexes, such endoplasmic-reticulum:PM contact sites, clathrin-coated structures, and several actin cytoskeletal elements including focal adhesions, did not cause a change in PI(4,5)P2 lateral mobility. Only the spectrin and septin cytoskeletons were observed to produce a slowing of PI(4,5)P2 diffusion. We conclude that even structures with high densities of PI(4,5)P2-engaging effector proteins, such as clathrin coated pits and focal adhesions, do not corral free PI(4,5)P2, questioning a role for spatially segregated PI(4,5)P2 pools in organizing and regulating parallel PM functions.",

    "abstract": "The influenza A virus (IAV) genome is divided into eight negative-sense, single-stranded RNA segments. Each segment exhibits a unique level and temporal pattern of expression, however the exact mechanisms underlying the patterns of individual gene segment expression are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that a single substitution in the viral nucleoprotein (NP:F346S) selectively modulates neuraminidase (NA) gene segment expression while leaving other segments largely unaffected. Given what is currently known about NP function, there is no obvious explanation for how changes in NP can selectively modulate the replication of individual gene segments. We found that the specificity of this effect for the NA segment is virus strain specific and depends on the UTR sequences of the NA segment. While the NP:F346S substitution did not significantly alter the RNA binding or oligomerization activities of NP in vitro, it specifically decreased the ability of NP to promote NA segment vRNA synthesis. In addition to NP residue F346, we identified two other adjacent aromatic residues in NP (Y385 & F479) capable of similarly regulating NA gene segment expression, suggesting a larger role for this domain in gene-segment specific regulation. Our findings reveal a new role for NP in selective regulation of viral gene segment replication and demonstrate how the expression patterns of individual viral gene segments can be modulated during adaptation to new host environments.\n\nAuthor summaryInfluenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen that remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Escape from host immunity or emergence into new host species often requires mutations that modulate the functional activities of the viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) which are responsible for virus attachment to and release from host cells, respectively. Maintaining the functional balance between the activities of HA and NA is required for fitness across multiple host systems. Thus, selective modulation of viral gene expression patterns may be a key determinant of viral immune escape and cross-species transmission potential. We identified a novel mechanism by which the viral nucleoprotein (NP) gene can selectively modulate NA segment replication and gene expression through interactions with the segment UTR. Our work highlights an unexpected role for NP in selective regulation of expression from the individual IAV gene segments.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsThe centropogonid clade (Lobelioideae: Campanulaceae) is an Andean-centered rapid radiation characterized by repeated convergent evolution of morphological traits, including fruit type and pollination syndromes. While previous studies have resolved relationships of lineages with fleshy fruits into subclades, relationships among capsular species remain unresolved, particularly along the phylogenetic backbone. This lack of resolution has impeded reclassification of non-monophyletic genera, whose current taxonomy relies heavily on traits that have evolved multiple times within the clade.\n\nMethodsTargeted sequence capture using a probeset recently developed for the centropogonid clade was used to obtain phylogenomic data from DNA extracted from both silica-dried and herbarium leaf tissue. These data were used to infer relationships among species using concatenated and partitioned species tree methods, as well as to quantify gene tree discordance.\n\nKey ResultsWhile silica-dried leaf tissue resulted in generally more and longer sequence data, the inclusion of herbarium samples improved phylogenetic reconstruction. Relationships among baccate lineages are similar to those inferred by previous studies, though they differ within and among capsular lineages. We improve resolution of Siphocampylus, which forms ten groups of closely related species to which we provide informal names that largely do not correspond to current infrageneric taxonomy. Two subclades of Siphocampylus and two individual species are rogue taxa whose placement differs widely across analyses. Gene tree discordance is high.\n\nConclusionsThe first phylogenomic study of the centropogonid clade considerably improves our understanding of relationships in this rapid radiation. Differences across analyses and the possibility of additional lineage discoveries still hamper a solid and stable reclassification. Rapid morphological innovation corresponds with a high degree of phylogenomic complexity, including cytonuclear discordance, nuclear gene tree conflict, and well-supported differences between analyses based on different nuclear loci. Taken together, these results point to a potential role of hemiplasy underlying repeated convergent evolution. This hallmark of rapid radiations is likely present in many other species-rich Andean plant radiations.",

CLiPs from Pseudomonas in particular display diverse structural variations in terms of the number of amino acid residues, macrocycle size, amino acid identity and stereochemistry (e.g. D- vs. L-amino acids). Reports detailing the discovery of novel or already characterized CLiPs from new sources appear regularly in literature. Increasingly however, the lack of detailed characterization threatens to cause considerable confusion, especially if configurational heterogeneity is present for one or more amino acids. Using Pseudomonas CLiPs from the Bananamide, Orfamide and Xantholysin groups as test cases, we demonstrate and validate that 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of CLiPs are sufficiently sensitive to differentiate between possible diastereomers of a particular sequence even when they only differ in a single D/L configuration. Rapid screening, involving simple comparison of the NMR fingerprint of a newly isolated CLiP with that of a reference CLiP of known stereochemistry, can then be applied to resolve dead-ends in configurational characterization and avoid the much more cumbersome chemical characterization protocols. Even when the stereochemistry of a particular reference CLiP remains to be established, NMR fingerprinting still allows verifying whether a CLiP from a novel source is already present in the reference collection, thus contributing to dereplication. To benefit research involving CLiPs, we have made a publicly available  knowledge base at https://www.rhizoclip.be, where we present an overview of published NMR fingerprint data of characterized CLiPs, together with literature data on the originally determined structures.\n\nSignificance StatementPseudomonas CLiPs, are ubiquitous specialized metabolites, impacting the producers lifestyle and interactions with the (a)biotic environment. Consequently, they generate interest for agricultural and clinical applications. Establishing structure-activity relationships as premise to their development is hindered because full structural characterization including stereochemistry requires labor-intensive analyses, without guarantee for success. Moreover, increasing use of superficial comparison with previously characterized CLiPs introduces or propagates erroneous attributions, clouding further scientific progress. We provide a generally applicable characterization methodology for structural comparison of newly isolated CLiPs to reference compounds with (un)known stereochemistry based on NMR fingerprints. The reference compound database available for the wide scientific community promises to facilitate structural assessment and dereplication of newly isolated CLiPs, and to support genome mining for novel CLiPs.",

    "abstract": "To import large metabolites across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, TonB dependent transporters (TBDTs) undergo significant conformational change. After substrate binding in BtuB, the E. coli vitamin B12 TBDT, TonB binds and couples BtuB to the inner membrane proton motive force that powers transport (1). But, the role of TonB in rearranging the plug domain to form a putative pore remains enigmatic. Some studies focus on force-mediated unfolding (2) while others propose force-independent pore formation (3) by TonB binding leading to breakage of a salt bridge termed the \"Ionic Lock\". Our hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry measurements in E. coli outer membranes find that the region surrounding the Ionic Lock, far from the B12 site, is fully destabilized upon substrate binding. A comparison of the exchange between the B12 bound and the B12&TonB bound complexes indicates that B12 binding is sufficient to unfold the Ionic Lock region with the subsequent binding of a TonB fragment having much weaker effects. TonB binding accelerates exchange in the third substrate binding loop, but pore formation does not obviously occur in this or any region. This study provides a detailed structural and energetic description of the early stages of B12 passage that provides support both for and against current models of the transport process.\n\nSignificance StatementTonB dependent transporters such as BtuB are found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. They import scarce nutrients essential for growth, such as B12, the substrate of BtuB. Many transport steps remain enigmatic. Recent studies have emphasized force-mediated unfolding or the breakage of the \"Ionic Lock\", a moiety far from the B12 binding site. A strong dependence on the membrane environment has been noted. Accordingly, we measured hydrogen exchange on BtuB still embedded in native outer membranes and found that B12 binding is sufficient to break the Ionic Lock. The amino terminus then extends into the periplasm to bind TonB. But we find no evidence of pore formation, which likely requires energy transduction from the inner membrane by TonB.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) can enable robust and safe gene delivery to the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). While the scientific community has developed numerous neurotropic AAV variants for systemic gene-transfer to the rodent brain, there are few AAVs that efficiently access the CNS of higher order primates. We describe here AAV.CAP-Mac, an engineered AAV variant that enables systemic, brain-wide gene delivery in infants of two Old World primate species--the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and the green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus). We identified CAP-Mac using a multi-species selection strategy, initially screening our library in the adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and narrowing our pool of test-variants for another round of selection in infant macaques. In individual characterization, CAP-Mac robustly transduces human neurons in vitro and Old World primate neurons in vivo, where it targets all lobes of cortex, the cerebellum, and multiple subcortical regions of disease relevance. We use CAP-Mac for Brainbow-like multicolor labeling of macaque neurons throughout the brain, enabling morphological reconstruction of both medium spiny neurons and cortical pyramidal cells. Because of its broad distribution throughout the brain and high neuronal efficiency in infant Old World primates compared to AAV9, CAP-Mac shows promise for researchers and clinicians alike to unlock novel, noninvasive access to the brain for efficient gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "Treating immunosuppressive tumors represents a major challenge in cancer therapies. Activation of STING signaling has shown remarkable potential to invigorate the immunologically  cold tumor microenvironment (TME). However, we and others have shown that STING is silenced in many cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), both of which are associated with an immune-dampened TME. In this study, we applied mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNP) to deliver a permanently active gain-of-function STINGR284S mutant into PDAC and MCC cells. Expression of STINGR284S induces cytokines and chemokines crucial for promoting intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells and, importantly, also leads to robust cancer cell death while avoiding T cell entry and toxicity. Our studies demonstrated that mRNA-LNP delivery of STINGR284S could be explored as a novel therapeutic tool to reactivate antitumor response in an array of STING-deficient cancers while overcoming the toxicity and limitations of conventional STING agonists.",

Here we highlight a novel role for the neurotrophin receptor splice variant TrkB.T1 in neurodevelopment, embryogenesis, transformation, and oncogenesis across multiple tumor types in both humans and mice. TrkB.T1 is the predominant NTRK2 isoform across embryonic organogenesis and forced over-expression of this embryonic pattern causes multiple solid and nonsolid tumors in mice in the context of tumor suppressor loss. TrkB.T1 also emerges the predominant NTRK isoform expressed in a wide range of adult and pediatric tumors, including those harboring TRK fusions. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) proteomic analysis reveals TrkB.T1 has distinct interactors with known developmental and oncogenic signaling pathways such as Wnt, TGF-{beta}, Hedgehog, and Ras. From alterations in splicing factors to changes in gene expression, the discovery of isoform specific oncogenes with embryonic ancestry has the potential to shape the way we think about developmental systems and oncology.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) enable recombination-independent, multi-kilobase DNA insertions at RNA-programmed genomic locations. Type V-K CASTs offer distinct technological advantages over type I CASTs given their smaller coding size, fewer components, and unidirectional insertions. However, the utility of type V-K CASTs is hindered by a replicative transposition mechanism that results in a mixture of desired simple cargo insertions and undesired plasmid co-integrate products. Here, we overcome this limitation by engineering new CASTs with dramatically improved product purity. To do so, we compensate for the absence of the TnsA subunit in multiple type V-K CASTs by engineering a Homing Endonuclease-assisted Large-sequence Integrating CAST compleX, or HELIX system. HELIX utilizes a nicking homing endonuclease (nHE) fused to TnsB to restore the 5 \" nicking capability needed for dual-nicking of the DNA donor. By leveraging distinct features of both type V-K and type I systems, HELIX enables cut-and-paste DNA insertion with up to 99.3% simple insertion product purity, while retaining robust integration efficiencies on genomic targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by generating HELIX systems for other CAST orthologs. We also establish the feasibility of creating a minimal, 3-component HELIX, simplifying the number of proteins that must be expressed. Together, HELIX streamlines and improves the application of CRISPR-based transposition technologies, eliminating barriers for efficient and specific RNA-guided DNA insertions.",

Thus, identifying host proteins implicated in MAYV replication, represents an opportunity to discover potential antiviral targets. PIM kinases are enzymes that regulate essential cell functions and also appear to be critical factors in the replication of certain viruses. In this study we explored the consequences of PIM kinase inhibition in the replication of MAYV and other arboviruses. Cytopathic effects or viral titers in samples from MAYV-, Chikungunya-, Una-or Zika-infected cells treated with PIM kinase inhibitors were evaluated using an inverted microscope or plaque-forming assays. The expression of viral proteins E1 and nsP1 in MAYV-infected cells was assessed using an immunofluorescence confocal microscope or Western blot. Our results revealed that PIM kinase inhibition partially prevented MAYV-induced cell damage and also promoted a decrease in viral titers for MAYV, UNAV and ZIKV. The inhibitory effect of PIM kinase blocking was observed for each of the MAYV strains tested and also occurred as late as 8 hpi. Finally, PIM kinase inhibition suppressed the expression of MAYV E1 and nsP1 proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that PIM kinases could represent an antiviral target for MAYV and other arboviruses.",

    "abstract": "Non-toxic, biocompatible materials that inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on implanted medical devices and so prevent infection are urgently required. Weakly amphiphilic acrylate polymers with rigid hydrocarbon pendant groups resist bacterial biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo but the biological mechanism involved is not known. By comparing biofilm formation on polymers with the same acrylate backbone but with different pendant groups, we show that poly(ethylene glycol dicyclopentenyl ether acrylate; pEGdPEA) but not neopentyl glycol propoxylate diacrylate (pNGPDA) inhibited the transition from reversible to irreversible attachment. By using single-cell tracking algorithms and controlled flow microscopy we observed that fewer Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells accumulated on pEGdPEA compared with pNGPDA. Bacteria reaching the pEGdPEA surface exhibited shorter residence times and greater asymmetric division with more cells departing from the surface post-cell division, characteristic of reversible attachment. Migrating cells on pEGdPEA deposited fewer exopolysaccharide trails and were unable top adhere strongly. Discrimination between the polymers required type IV pili and flagella. On pEGdPEA, the lack of accumulation of cyclic diguanylate or expression of sadB were consistent with the failure to transit from reversible to irreversible attachment. Constitutive expression of sadB increased surface adhesion sufficient to enable P. aeruginosa to form biofilms in a Mot flagellar stator dependent manner. These findings were extendable to other biofilm resistant acrylates highlighting their unique ability to inhibit reversible to irreversible attachment as a mechanism for preventing biofilm-associated infections.\n\nSignificanceBacteria readily attach to surfaces forming biofilms. These are commonly associated with medical device-associated infections and highly refractory to antibiotics. Biocompatible, weakly amphiphilic acrylate polymers with large hydrophobic pendant groups that inhibit biofilm formation and can prevent such infections have been described. However, the biological mechanism involved is not understood. By comparing a biofilm-inhibiting with a biofilm-supporting acrylate, we showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells responded differentially to the two polymers and were unable to accumulate and adhere strongly, activate cyclic diguanylate signalling or transit from reversible to irreversible attachment on the inhibitory polymer. Constitutive expression of sadB increased surface adhesion sufficient to enable P. aeruginosa to form biofilms in a flagellar stator dependent manner overcoming the biofilm inhibitory properties of the polymer.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (IAV) remain emerging threats to human public health. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are one of the most effective prophylactic options to prevent disease caused by influenza infections. However, licensed LAIV remain restricted for use in 2- to 49-year old healthy and non-pregnant people. Therefore, development of LAIV with increased safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy is highly desired. The United States (U.S.) licensed LAIV is based on the master donor virus (MDV) A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 backbone, which was generated by adaptation of the virus to growth at low temperatures. Introducing the genetic signature of the U.S. MDV into the backbone of other IAV strains resulted in varying levels of attenuation. While the U.S. MDV mutations conferred an attenuated phenotype to other IAV strains, the same amino acid changes did not significantly attenuate the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain. To attenuate pH1N1, we replaced the conserved leucine at position 319 with glutamine (L319Q) in PB1 and analyzed the in vitro and in vivo properties of pH1N1 viruses containing either PB1 L319Q alone or in combination with the U.S. MDV mutations using two animal models of influenza infection and transmission, ferrets and guinea pigs. Our results demonstrated that L319Q substitution in the pH1N1 PB1 alone or in combination with the mutations of the U.S. MDV resulted in reduced pathogenicity (ferrets) and transmission (guinea pigs), and an enhanced temperature sensitive phenotype. These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating an attenuated MDV based on the backbone of a contemporary pH1N1 IAV strain.\n\nIMPORTANCEVaccination represents the most effective strategy to reduce the impact of seasonal IAV infections. Although LAIV are superior in inducing protection and sterilizing immunity, they are not recommended for many individuals who are at high risk for severe disease. Thus, development of safer and more effective LAIV are needed. A concern with the current MDV used to generate the U.S. licensed LAIV is that it is based on a virus isolated in 1960. Moreover, mutations that confer the temperature sensitive, cold-adapted, and attenuated phenotype of the U.S. MDV resulted in low level of attenuation in the contemporary pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1). Here, we show that introduction of PB1 L319Q substitution, alone or in combination with the U.S. MDV mutations, resulted in pH1N1 attenuation. These findings support the development of a novel LAIV MDV based on a contemporary pH1N1 strain as a medical countermeasure against currently circulating H1N1 IAV.",

MT bundles emerge from CPC droplets with protruding minus-ends that then grow into long, tapered MT structures. During this growth, the CPC in condensates apparently reorganize to coat and bundle the resulting MT structures. CPC mutants attenuated for LLPS or MT binding prevented the generation of parallel MT bundles in vitro and reduced the number of MTs present at spindle midzones in HeLa cells.

    "abstract": "Host-targeted acaricides are a valuable tool for the reduction of ticks and tick-borne disease. Tick tubes (also known as tick control tubes) are commercially available products containing permethrin-treated nesting materials. Through superficial acaricide application to Peromyscus mice, tick tubes reduce populations of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say. Results of prior field trials have varied, suggesting that mouse behavior as well as the scale of the intervention and the composition of the local host community are important determinants of efficacy. Here we evaluated behaviors related to nest material collection by P. leucopus. Two forms of nest materials used in commercial tick tube products (cotton batting and balls) were assessed through side-by-side comparisons over a four-week period. We quantified cotton uptake by monitoring weekly changes in material weight and used video surveillance to categorize and assess mouse behaviors. The odds of cotton batting being taken from tubes was 2.14 times greater than cotton balls but the process was less efficient; mice removed 0.35 g less cotton batting for each removal event and required 2.17 times longer to complete the removal. While cotton balls were readily carried in the jaws of mice, batting required separating smaller fragments from the mass before placement in the oral cavity. Video surveillance suggested that a small number of mice were super users and responsible for 22% of the 119 visits in which material was removed. Combined, material weight loss and video-captured removal events improve our understanding of host usage of nest materials but also raise questions about dissemination of the material in nests of the local mouse community.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical population genetics has been mostly developed for sexually reproducing diploid and for monoploid (haploid) organisms, focusing on eukaryotes. The evolution of bacteria and archaea is often studied by models for the allele dynamics in monoploid populations. However, many prokaryotic organisms harbor multicopy replicons - chromosomes and plasmids - and theory for the allele dynamics in populations of polyploid prokaryotes remains lacking. Here we present a population genetics model for replicons with multiple copies in the cell. Using this model, we characterize the fixation process of a dominant beneficial mutation at two levels: the phenotype and the genotype. Our results show that, depending on the mode of replication and segregation, the fixation time of mutant phenotypes may precede the genotypic fixation time by many generations; we term this time interval the heterozygosity window. We furthermore derive concise analytical expressions for the occurrence and length of the heterozygosity window, showing that it emerges if the copy number is high and selection strong. Replicon ploidy thus allows for the maintenance of genetic variation following phenotypic adaptation and consequently for reversibility in adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Large reference datasets of protein-coding variation in human populations have allowed us to determine which genes and genic sub-regions are intolerant to germline genetic variation. There is also a growing number of genes implicated in severe Mendelian diseases that overlap with genes implicated in cancer. Here, we hypothesized that mitotically mutable genic sub-regions that are intolerant to germline variation are enriched for cancer-driving mutations. We introduce a new metric, OncMTR, which uses 125,748 exomes in the gnomAD database to identify genic sub-regions intolerant to germline variation but enriched for hematologic somatic variants. We demonstrate that OncMTR can significantly predict driver mutations implicated in hematologic malignancies. Divergent OncMTR regions were enriched for cancer-relevant protein domains, and overlaying OncMTR scores on protein structures identified functionally important protein residues. Finally, we performed a rare variant, gene-based collapsing analysis on an independent set of 394,694 exomes from the UK Biobank and find that OncMTR dramatically improves genetic signals for hematologic malignancies. Our web app enables easy visualization of OncMTR scores for each protein-coding gene (https://astrazeneca-cgr-publications.github.io/OncMTR-Viewer/).",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCataglyphis are thermophilic ants that forage during the day when temperatures are highest and sometimes close to their critical thermal limit. Several Cataglyphis species have evolved unusual reproductive systems such as facultative queen parthenogenesis or social hybridogenesis, which have not yet been investigated in detail at the molecular level. We generated high-quality genome assemblies for two hybridogenetic lineages of the Iberian ant Cataglyphis hispanica using long-read Nanopore sequencing and exploited chromosome conformation capture (3C) sequencing to assemble contigs into 26 and 27 chromosomes, respectively. Further karyotype analyses confirm this difference in chromosome numbers between lineages; however, they also suggest it may not be fixed among lineages. We obtained transcriptomic data to assist gene annotation and built custom repeat libraries for each of the two assemblies. Comparative analyses with 19 other published ant genomes were also conducted. These new genomic resources pave the way for exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying the remarkable thermal adaptation and the molecular mechanisms associated with transitions between different genetic systems characteristic of the ant genus Cataglyphis.",

    "abstract": "Methyltransferase like-3 (METTL3) and METTL14 complex transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to N6 amino group of adenosine bases in RNA (m6A) and DNA (m6dA). Emerging evidence highlights a role of METTL3-METTL14 in the chromatin context, especially in processes where DNA and RNA are held in close proximity. However, a mechanistic framework about specificity for substrate RNA/DNA and their interrelationship remain unclear. By systematically studying methylation activity and binding affinity to a number of DNA and RNA oligos with different propensities to form inter- or intra-molecular duplexes or single-stranded molecules in vitro, we uncover an inverse relationship for substrate binding and methylation and show that METTL3-METTL14 preferentially catalyzes the formation of m6dA in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), despite weaker binding affinity to DNA. In contrast, it binds structured RNAs with high affinity, but methylates the target adenosine in RNA (m6A) much less efficiently than it does in ssDNA. We also show that METTL3-METTL14-mediated methylation of DNA is largely regulated by structured RNA elements prevalent in long noncoding and other cellular RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Increased Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) activity has a protective effect in diverse disease conditions as inferred from studies in FSAP-/- mice and humans deficient in FSAP activity due to a single nucleotide polymorphism. The activation of FSAP zymogen in plasma is mediated by extracellular histones that are released during tissue injury or inflammation or by positively charged surfaces. However, it is not clear if this activation mechanism is specific and amenable to manipulation. Using a phage display approach we have identified a peptide, NNKC9/41, that activates pro-FSAP in plasma. Other commonly found zymogens in the plasma were not activated. Binding studies with FSAP domain deletion mutants indicate that the N-terminus of FSAP is the key interaction site of this peptide. Blocking the contact pathway of coagulation did not influence pro-FSAP activation by the peptide. In a monoclonal antibody screen, we identified MA-FSAP-38C7 that prevented the activation of pro-FSAP by the peptide. This antibody bound to the LESLDP sequence (amino acids 30-35) in the N-terminus of FSAP. The plasma clotting time was shortened by NNKC9/41 and this was reversed by MA-FSAP-38C7 demonstrating the utility of this peptide. Identification of this peptide, and the corresponding interaction site, provides proof of principle that it is possible to activate a single protease zymogen in blood in a specific manner. Peptide NNKC/41 will be useful as a tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of activation of pro-FSAP in more detail, elucidate its biological role.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475526v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@112eea6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1d7eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@967b03org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1662c51_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
