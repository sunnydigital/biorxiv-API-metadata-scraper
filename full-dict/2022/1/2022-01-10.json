    "abstract": "About 85% of adults in the United States report drinking alcohol in their lifetime. Mood disorders, like generalized anxiety disorder and major depression, are highly comorbid with alcohol use. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is an area of the brain that is heavily implicated in both mood disorders and alcohol use disorder. Importantly, modulation of BLA network/oscillatory states via parvalbumin-positive (PV) GABAergic interneurons has been shown to control the behavioral expression of fear and anxiety. Further, PV interneurons express a high density of {delta}-subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs), which are sensitive to low concentrations of alcohol. Our lab previously demonstrated that {delta}-subunit-containing GABAARs on PV interneurons in the BLA influence voluntary ethanol intake and anxiety-like behavior in withdrawal. Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of alcohol may modulate BLA network states that have been associated with fear and anxiety behaviors via {delta}-GABAARs on PV interneurons in the BLA. Given the impact of ovarian hormones on the expression of {delta}-GABAARs, we examined the ability of alcohol to modulate local field potentials (LFPs) in the BLA from male and female C57BL/6J and Gabrd-/- mice after acute and repeated exposure to alcohol. Here, we demonstrate that acute and repeated alcohol can differentially modulate oscillatory states in male and female C57BL/6J mice, a process which involves {delta}-GABAARs. This is the first study to demonstrate that alcohol is capable of altering network states implicated in both anxiety and alcohol use disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementAlcohol use disorder and mood disorders are highly comorbid. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in both of these disorders, but the mechanisms contributing to their shared pathophysiology remain uncertain. Here we demonstrate that acute and repeated alcohol exposure can alter network oscillations in the BLA which control the behavioral expression of fear and anxiety. These data suggest that alcohol may directly influence network states associated with mood. Further, we demonstrate sex differences in alcohols ability to modulate BLA network states, an effect involving {delta}-GABAA receptors, which may contribute to sex differences in alcohol intake and comorbid mood disorders. These data potentially point to a novel mechanism mediating the effects of alcohol on affective states.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "AimsAlcohol use disorder (AUD), has been shown to have harmful cognitive and physiological effects, including altered brain chemistry. Further, although men and women may differ in vulnerability to the neurobiological effects of AUD, results of existing studies have been conflicting. Brain metabolite levels and cognitive functions were examined in a cross section of men with AUD (AUDm) and women with AUD (AUDw) to determine degree of abnormalities after extended periods of abstinence (mean, six years), and to evaluate gender differences in cognitive and metabolite measures.\n\nMethodsParticipants were 40 abstinent individuals with AUD (22 AUDw, 18 AUDm) and 50 age-equivalent non-AUD comparison participants (26 NCw, 24 NCm). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was employed at 3 Tesla to acquire metabolite spectra from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Brain metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myo-Inositol (mI), and glutamate & glutamine (Glx) were examined relative to measures of memory and inhibitory control.\n\nResultsMetabolite levels in the AUD group showed no significant differences from the NC group. Memory and inhibitory-control impairments were observed in the AUD group. There also were significant group-specific associations between metabolite ratios and measures of inhibitory control. There were no Group-by-Gender interactions for the four metabolite ratios.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that brain metabolite levels in men and women with AUD, following long-term abstinence, do not differ from individuals without AUD. The data also provide evidence of associations between metabolite levels and measures of inhibitory control, a functional domain important for curtailing harmful drinking.",

    "abstract": "An accurate characterization of the polyelectrolyte properties of actin filaments might provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the intracellular ionic wave packet propagation in neurons. Infinitely long cylindrical models for actin filaments and approximate electrochemical theories for the electrolyte solutions were recently used to characterize these properties in in vitro and intracellular conditions. This article uses a molecular structure model for actin filaments to investigate the impact of roughness and finite size on the mean electrical potential, ionic density distributions, currents, and conductivities. We solved the electrochemical theories numerically without further approximations. Our findings bring new insights into the electrochemical interactions between a filaments irregular surface charge density and the surrounding medium. The irregular shape of the filament structure model generated pockets, or hot spots, where the current density reached higher or lower magnitudes than those in neighboring areas throughout the filament surface. It also revealed the formation of a well-defined asymmetric electrical double layer with a thickness larger than that commonly used for symmetric models.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesWe aimed to investigate the contribution of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) to the inflammatory response after experimental myocardial infarction (MI).\n\nBackgroundThere is compelling evidence implicating dysregulated inflammation in the mechanism of ventricular remodeling and heart failure (HF) after MI. The transcription factor Nrf2 (encoded by Nfe2l2) is a promising target in this context. It impedes transcriptional upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is anti-inflammatory in various murine models.\n\nMethodsWe subjected Nrf2-/- mice and wild type (WT) controls to permanent left coronary artery (LCA) ligation. The inflammatory response was investigated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of peripheral blood and heart cell suspensions, together with qRT-PCR of infarcted tissue for chemokines and their receptors. To investigate whether Nrf2-mediated transcription is a dedicated function of leukocytes, we interrogated publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from mouse hearts after permanent LCA ligation for Nrf2-regulated gene (NRG) expression.\n\nResultsFACS analysis demonstrated a profoundly inflamed phenotype in the hearts of global Nrf2-/- mice as compared to WT mice after MI. Moreover, infarcted tissue from Nrf2-/- mice displayed higher expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors, including IL6, Ccl2, and Cxcr4. RNA-seq analysis showed upregulated NRG expression in WT mice after MI compared to untreated mice, which was significantly higher in bioinformatically isolated CCR2+ cells.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, the results suggest that Nrf2 signalling in leukocytes, and possibly CCR2+ monocyte-derived cardiac resident macrophages, may be potential targets to prevent post-MI ventricular remodeling.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred an unprecedented movement to develop safe and effective vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to immunize the global population. The first set of vaccine candidates that received emergency use authorization targeted the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that enables virus entry into cells via the receptor binding domain (RBD). Recently, multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged with mutations in S protein and the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals. We have developed a dual RBD and nucleocapsid (N) subunit protein vaccine candidate named RelCoVax(R) through heterologous expression in mammalian cells (RBD) and E. coli (N). The RelCoVax(R) formulation containing a combination of aluminum hydroxide (alum) and a synthetic CpG oligonucleotide as adjuvants elicited high antibody titers against RBD and N proteins in mice after a prime and boost dose regimen administered 2 weeks apart. The vaccine also stimulated cellular immune responses with a potential Th1 bias as evidenced by increased IFN-{gamma} release by splenocytes from immunized mice upon antigen exposure particularly N protein. Finally, the serum of mice immunized with RelCoVax(R) demonstrated the ability to neutralize two different SARS-CoV-2 viral strains in vitro including the Delta strain that has become dominant in many regions of the world and can evade vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies. These results warrant further evaluation of RelCoVax(R) through advanced studies and contribute towards enhancing our understanding of multicomponent subunit vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Kobuviruses are an unusual and poorly characterised genus within the picornavirus family, and can cause gastrointestinal enteric disease in humans, livestock and pets. The human Kobuvirus, Aichi virus (AiV) can cause severe gastroenteritis and deaths in children below the age of five years, however this is a very rare occurrence. During the assembly of most picornaviruses (e.g. poliovirus, rhinovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus), the capsid precursor protein VP0 is cleaved into VP4 and VP2. However, Kobuviruses retain an uncleaved VP0. From studies with other picornaviruses, it is known that VP4 performs the essential function of pore formation in membranes, which facilitates transfer of the viral genome across the endosomal membrane and into the cytoplasm for replication. Here, we employ genome exposure and membrane interaction assays to demonstrate that pH plays a critical role in AiV uncoating and membrane interactions. We demonstrate that incubation at low pH alters the exposure of hydrophobic residues within the capsid, enhances genome exposure and enhances permeabilisation of model membranes. Furthermore, using peptides we demonstrate that the N-terminus of VP0 mediates membrane pore formation in model membranes, indicating that this plays an analogous function to VP4.\n\nImportanceTo initiate infection, viruses must enter a host cell and deliver their genome into the appropriate location. The picornavirus family of small non-enveloped RNA viruses includes significant human and animal pathogens and are also models to understand the process of cell entry. Most picornavirus capsids contain the internal protein VP4, generated from cleavage of a VP0 precursor. During entry, VP4 is released from the capsid. In enteroviruses this forms a membrane pore, which facilitates genome release into the cytoplasm. Due to high levels of sequence similarity, it is expected to play the same role for other picornaviruses. Some picornaviruses, such as Aichi virus, retain an intact VP0, and it is unknown how these viruses re-arrange their capsids and induce membrane permeability in the absence of VP4. Here we have used Aichi virus as a model VP0 virus to test for conservation of function between VP0 and VP4. This could enhance understanding of pore function and lead to development of novel therapeutic agents that block entry.",

    "abstract": "Yersinia enterocolitica employs a type three secretion system (T3SS) to translocate immunosuppressive effector proteins into host cells. To this end, the T3SS assembles a translocon/pore complex composed of the translocator proteins YopB and YopD in host cell membranes serving as an entry port for the effectors. The translocon is formed in a Yersinia-containing pre-phagosomal compartment that is connected to the extracellular space. As the phagosome matures, the translocon and the membrane damage it causes are recognized by the cell-autonomous immune system. We infected cells in the presence of fluorophore-labeled ALFA-tag-binding nanobodies with a Y. enterocolitica strain expressing YopD labeled with an ALFA-tag. Thereby we could record the integration of YopD into translocons and its intracellular fate in living host cells. YopD was integrated into translocons around 2 min after uptake of the bacteria into a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate enriched pre-phagosomal compartment and remained there for 27 min on average. Damaging of the phagosomal membrane as visualized with recruitment of GFP-tagged galectin-3 occurred in the mean around 14 min after translocon formation. Shortly after recruitment of galectin-3, guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP-1) was recruited to phagosomes, which was accompanied by a decrease in the signal intensity of translocons, suggesting their degradation. In sum, we were able for the first time to film the spatiotemporal dynamics of Yersinia T3SS translocon formation and degradation and its sensing by components of the cell-autonomous immune system.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus spores, like most Bacillus spores, can survive for years, germinate when their surroundings become suitable, and spore germination proteins play an important role in the initiation of germination. Because germinated spores lose dormant spores extreme resistance, information on the function of germination proteins could be useful in developing new strategies to control B. cereus spores. Prior work has shown that: i) the channel protein SpoVAEa exhibits high frequency movement in the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (IM) in dormant spores of B. subtilis; ii) the formation of the foci termed the germinosome between two germination proteins, the germinant receptor GerR and the scaffold protein GerD, in developing spores of B. cereus is slower than foci formation by GerR and GerD individually. However, the dynamics of movement of SpoVAEa in B. cereus spores, and the behaviour of the germinosome in B. cereus spore germination are unclear. In this study, we found that SpoVAEa fluorescent foci in dormant spores of B. cereus move on the IM, but slower than in B. subtilis spores, and likely colocalize transiently with GerD-mScarlet-I in the germinosome. Our results further indicate that: i) expression of GerR-SGFP2 and SpoVAEa-SGFP2 with GerD-mScarlet-I from a plasmid leads to more heterogeneity and lower efficiency of spore germination in B. cereus; and ii) germinosome foci observed by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between GerR-SGFP2 and GerD-mScarlet-I b can be lost soon after the spore phase transition. However this is not always the case, as some GerR-SGFP2 foci and GerD-mScarlet-I foci continued to exist, colocalize, and even show a weak FRET signal. These data highlight the heterogeneous behaviour of spore germination protein complexes and indicate that some complexes may persist well beyond the initiation of germination.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacillus cereus is commonly present in soil and does harm to humans via contaminated food. In this study, we used B. cereus spores to investigate the movement of the spore-specific channel protein SpoVAEa, the interaction between SpoVAEa and the germinosome scaffold protein GerD, as well as the dynamics of a number of germination proteins in spore germination. Our results expand upon observations of the interactions between specific B. cereus spore germination proteins, in particular the GerR germinant receptor A, B and C subunits and GerD, as well as between SpoVAEa and GerD. The approaches used in this work could also be used to examine the interactions between GerD and SpoVAEa and other germination proteins in spores of other Bacillus species.",

SteD specifically localises at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and MHCII compartments; however, the targeting, membrane integration and trafficking of SteD are not understood. Using systematic mutagenesis, we identify distinct regions of SteD that are required for these processes. We show that SteD integrates into membranes of the ER/Golgi through a two-step mechanism of membrane recruitment from the cytoplasm followed by integration. SteD then migrates to and accumulates within the TGN. From here it hijacks the host adaptor protein (AP)1-mediated trafficking pathway from the TGN to MHCII compartments. AP1 binding and post-TGN trafficking require a short sequence in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of SteD that resembles the AP1-interacting dileucine sorting signal, but in inverted orientation, suggesting convergent evolution.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial secondary metabolites are structurally diverse molecules that drive microbial interaction by altering growth, cell differentiation, and signaling. Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive soil-dwelling bacterium, produces a wealth of secondary metabolites, among them, lipopeptides have been vastly studied by their antimicrobial, antitumor, and surfactant activities. However, the natural functions of secondary metabolites in the lifestyles of the producing organism remain less explored under natural conditions, i.e. in soil. Here, we describe a hydrogel-based transparent soil system to investigate B. subtilis chemical ecology under controllable soil-like conditions. The transparent soil matrix allows the growth of B. subtilis and other isolates gnotobiotically and under nutrient-controlled conditions. Additionally, we show that transparent soil allows the detection of lipopeptides production and dynamics by HPLC-MS and MALDI-MS imaging, along with fluorescence imaging of 3-dimensional bacterial assemblages. We anticipate that this affordable and highly controllable system will promote bacterial chemical ecology research and help to elucidate microbial interactions driven by secondary metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is the most prevalent cause of vulvovaginal candidiasis ( yeast infection) and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, though the incidence of non-albicans yeast species is increasing. The azole fluconazole is the primary antifungal drug used to treat R/VVC yet isolates from some species have intrinsic resistance to fluconazole, and recurrent infection can occur even with fluconazole-susceptible populations. The second-line broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug, boric acid, is an alternative treatment that has been found to successfully treat complicated VVC infections. Far less is known about how boric acid inhibits growth of yeast isolates in different morphologies compared to fluconazole. We found significant differences in drug resistance and drug tolerance (the ability of a subpopulation to grow slowly in high levels of drug) between C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis isolates, with the specific relationships dependent on both drug and phenotype. Population-level variation for both susceptibility and tolerance was broader for fluconazole than boric acid in all species. Unlike fluconazole, which neither prevented hyphal formation nor disrupted mature biofilms, boric acid inhibited C. albicans hyphal formation and reduced mature biofilm biomass and metabolic activity in all isolates in a dose-dependent manner. Variation in planktonic response did not generally predict biofilm phenotypes. Overall, our findings illustrate that boric acid is broadly effective at inhibiting growth across many isolates and morphologies, which could explain why it is an effective treatment for R/VVC.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in late 2019, has caused a worldwide pandemic with unprecedented economic and societal impact. Currently, several vaccines are available, and multitudes of antiviral treatments have been proposed and tested. Although many of the vaccines show high clinical efficacy, they are not equally accessible worldwide. Additionally, due to the continuous emergence of new virus variants, and generally short duration of immunity, the development of safe and effective antiviral treatments remains of the utmost importance. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, substantial efforts have been undertaken to repurpose existing and approved drugs for accelerated clinical testing and potential emergency use authorizations. However, drug-repurposing using high throughput screenings in cellular assays, often identify hits that later prove ineffective in clinical studies. Our approach was to evaluate the activity of compounds that have either been tested clinically or already undergone extensive preclinical profiling, using a standardized in vitro model of human nasal epithelium. Secondly, we evaluated drug combinations using sub-maximal doses of each active single compound. Here, we report the antiviral effects of 95 single compounds and 30 combinations. The data show that selected drug combinations including 10 M of molnupiravir, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. This indicates that such combinations are worthy of further evaluation as potential treatment strategies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 lineages are continuously evolving. As of December 2021, the AY.4.2 Delta sub-lineage represented 20 % of sequenced strains in UK and has been detected in dozens of countries. It has since then been supplanted by the Omicron variant. AY.4.2 displays three additional mutations (T95I, Y145H and A222V) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike when compared to the original Delta variant (B.1.617.2) and remains poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed the fusogenicity of the AY.4.2 spike and the sensitivity of an authentic AY.4.2 isolate to neutralizing antibodies. The AY.4.2 spike exhibited similar fusogenicity and binding to ACE2 than Delta. The sensitivity of infectious AY.4.2 to a panel of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies was similar to Delta, except for the anti-RBD Imdevimab, which showed incomplete neutralization. Sensitivity of AY.4.2 to sera from individuals having received two or three doses of Pfizer or two doses of AstraZeneca vaccines was reduced by 1.7 to 2.1 fold, when compared to Delta. Our results suggest that mutations in the NTD remotely impair the efficacy of anti-RBD antibodies. The temporary spread of AY.4.2 was not associated with major changes in spike function but rather to a partially reduced neutralization sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell immunity is expected to counteract viral variants in both efficient and durable ways. We recently described a way to induce a potent SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T immune response through the generation of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerging from muscle cells. This method relies on intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing different SARS-CoV-2 antigens fused at their N-terminus with Nefmut protein, i.e., a very efficient EV-anchoring protein. However, quality, tissue distribution, and efficacy of these SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells remained uninvestigated. To fill the gaps, antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes induced by the immunization through the Nefmut-based method were characterized in terms of their polyfunctionality and localization at lung airways, i.e., the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that injection of vectors expressing Nefmut/S1 and Nefmut/N generated polyfunctional CD8+ T lymphocytes in both spleens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs). When immunized mice were infected with 4.4 lethal doses 50% of SARS-CoV-2, all S1-immunized mice succumbed, whereas those developing the highest percentages of N-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes resisted the lethal challenge. We also provide evidence that the N-specific immunization coupled with the development of antigen-specific CD8+ T-resident memory cells in lungs, supporting the idea that the Nefmut- based immunization can confer a long-lasting, lung-specific immune memory. In view of the limitations of current anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in terms of antibody waning and efficiency against variants, our CD8+ T cell-based platform could be considered for a new combination prophylactic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Nosema ceranae is an intracellular fungal parasite for honeybees, leading to chronic disease named bee nosemosis with worldwide distribution. Asian honeybee (Apis cerana) is the original host for N. ceranae, but the impact of N. ceranae infection on A. cerana physiology is largely unknown. In this current work, workers of Apis cerana cerana, a subspecies of Asian honeybee, were artificially inoculated with N. ceranae spores and reared under lab conditions, followed by detection of fungal spore load as well as host sucrose solution consumption, midgut epithelial cell structure, and lifespan. The result of spore counting suggested that the spore load in the host midgut decreased significantly during 1 dpi-2 dpi, whereas that displayed an elevated trend among 2 dpi-13 dpi. The sucrose solution consumption of workers in N. ceranae-inoculated groups among 1 dpi-20 dpi was always higher than that of workers in un-inoculated groups; additionally, the difference of sucrose solution consumption between these two groups at 4 dpi, 5 dpi, and 13 dpi was of significance. Based on microscopic observation of paraffin sections, darkly stained parasites were clearly detected in the midgut epithelial cells of N. ceranae-inoculated workers at 7 dpi-10 dpi, whereas no parasite was observed in those of un-inoculated workers. In addition, the boundaries of un-inoculated host epithelial cells were intact and the darkly stained nucleus were clear, while the boundaries of midgut epithelial cells of N. ceranae-inoculated workers were blurred, the nucleus were almost disappeared, and the nucleic acid substances were diffused. Moreover, the survival rates of workers in both N. ceranae-inoculated groups and un-inoculated groups at 1 dpi-5 dpi were pretty high and then started to decrease at 5 dpi; the survival rate of workers in N. ceranae-inoculated groups was always lower than that in un-inoculated groups, with significant difference between these two groups during 11 dpi-20 dpi. These results together indicate that the quantity of fungal spores continuously elevated with the microsporidian multiplication, causing energetic stress for workers and host cell structure damage, which further negatively affected the host lifespan. Our findings offer a solid basis not only for exploring the molecular mechanism underlying N. ceranae infection but also for investigating the interaction between N. ceranae and eastern honeybee.",

    "abstract": "The potential of energy filtering and direct electron detection for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) image processing has been well documented for single particle analysis (SPA). Here, we assess the performance of recently introduced hardware for cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA), an increasingly popular structural determination method for complex 3D specimens. We acquired cryo-ET datasets of EIAV virus-like particles (VLPs) on two contemporary cryo-EM systems equipped with different energy filters and direct electron detectors (DED), specifically a Krios G4, equipped with a cold field emission gun (CFEG), Thermo Fisher Scientific Selectris X energy filter, and a Falcon 4 DED; and a Krios G3i, with a Schottky field emission gun (XFEG), a Gatan Bioquantum energy filter, and a K3 DED. We performed constrained cross-correlation-based STA on equally sized datasets acquired on the respective systems. The resulting EIAV CA hexamer reconstructions show that both systems perform comparably in the 4-6 [A] resolution range. In addition, by employing a recently introduced multiparticle refinement approach, we obtained a reconstruction of the EIAV CA hexamer at 2.9 [A]. Our results demonstrate the potential of the new generation of energy filters and DEDs for STA, and the effects of using different processing pipelines on their STA outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Loss of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome, the leading form of inherited intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that controls neuronal mRNA localization and translation. FMRP is thought to inhibit translation elongation after being recruited to target transcripts via binding RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) within the coding sequence. Here, we directly test this model and report that FMRP inhibits translation independent of mRNA G4s.\n\nFurthermore, we found that the RGG box motif together with its natural C-terminal domain forms a non-canonical RNA-binding domain (ncRBD) that is essential for translational repression. The ncRBD elicits broad RNA binding ability and binds to multiple reporter mRNAs and all four homopolymeric RNAs. Serial deletion analysis of the ncRBD identified that the regions required for mRNA-binding and translational repression overlap but are not identical. Consistent with FMRP stalling elongating ribosomes and causing the accumulation of slowed 80S ribosomes, transcripts bound by FMRP via the ncRBD co-sediment with heavier polysomes and were present in puromycin-resistant ribosome complexes. Together, this work identifies a ncRBD and translational repression domain that shifts our understanding of how FMRP inhibits translation independent of mRNA G4s.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that nearly 50% of mammalian transcripts contain at least one upstream open reading frame (uORF), which are typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the downstream main ORF. Most uORFs are thought to be inhibitory as they sequester the scanning ribosome, but in some cases allow for translation re-initiation. However, termination in the 5' UTR at the end of uORFs resembles pre-mature termination that is normally sensed by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Translation re-initiation has been proposed as a method for mRNAs to prevent NMD. Here we test how uORF length influences translation re-initiation and mRNA stability in HeLa cells. Using custom 5' UTRs and uORF sequences, we show that re-initiation can occur on heterologous mRNA sequences, favors small uORFs, and is supported when initiation occurs with more initiation factors. After determining reporter mRNA half-lives in HeLa cells and mining available mRNA half-life datasets for cumulative predicted uORF length, we conclude that translation re-initiation after uORFs is not a robust method for mRNAs to prevent NMD. Together, these data suggests that the decision of whether NMD ensues after translating uORFs occurs before re-initiation in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Phage lysins are a source of novel antimicrobials to tackle the bacterial antibiotic resistance crisis. The engineering of phage lysins is being explored as a game-changing technological strategy for introducing a more precise approach in the way we apply antimicrobial therapy. Such engineering efforts will benefit from a better understanding of lysin structure and function. In this work, the antimicrobial activity of the endolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage JG004, termed Pae87, has been characterized. This lysin had been previously identified as an antimicrobial agent candidate, able to interact with the Gram-negative surface and disrupt it. Further evidence is hereby provided on this matter, based on a structural and biochemical study. A high-resolution crystal structure of Pae87 complexed with a peptidoglycan fragment showed a separate substrate-binding region within the catalytic domain, 18 [A] away from the catalytic site and located at the opposite side of the lysin molecule. This substrate binding region was conserved among phylogenetically related lysins lacking an additional cell wall binding domain, but not among those containing such a module. Two glutamic acids were identified as relevant for the peptidoglycan degradation activity, although Pae87 antimicrobial activity was seemingly unrelated to it. In contrast, an antimicrobial peptide-like region within Pae87 C-terminus, named P87, was found to be able to actively disturb the outer membrane and have antibacterial activity by itself. Therefore, we propose an antimicrobial mechanism for Pae87 in which the P87 peptide plays the role of binding to the outer membrane and disrupting the cell wall function, either with or without the participation of Pae87 catalytic activity.\n\nSynopsisThe structure of the monomodular Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage JG004 lysin Pae87 is presented and investigated in relationship with its function repurposed as an antimicrobial agent. The structure with its peptidoglycan ligand revealed a possible cell wall binding region. A C-terminal antimicrobial peptide-like region is shown to be important for disrupting the bacterial cell wall.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a primary sensor of aberrant DNA that governs an innate immune signaling cascade, leading to the induction of the type-I interferon response. We have previously identified polyglutamine binding protein 1, PQBP1, as an adaptor molecule required for cGAS-mediated innate immune response of lentiviruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), but dispensable for the recognition of DNA viruses. HIV-1- encoded DNA is synthesized as a single copy from its RNA genome, and is subsequently integrated into the host chromatin. HIV-1 then produces progeny through amplification and packaging of its RNA genome, thus, in contrast to DNA viruses, HIV-1 DNA is both transient and of low abundance. However, the molecular basis for the detection and verification of this low abundance HIV-1 DNA pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) is not understood. Here, we elucidate a two-factor authentication strategy that is employed by the innate immune surveillance machinery to selectively respond to the low concentration of PAMP, while discerning these species from extranuclear DNA molecules. We find that, upon HIV-1 infection, PQBP1 decorates intact viral capsid, which serves as a primary verification step for the viral nucleic acid cargo. As the reverse transcription and capsid disassembly initiate, cGAS protein is then recruited to the capsid in a PQBP1-dependent manner, enabling cGAS molecules to be co-positioned at the site of PAMP generation. Thus, these data indicate that PQBP1 recognition of the HIV-1 capsid sanctions a robust cGAS-dependent response to a limited abundance and short-lived DNA PAMP. Critically, this illuminates a molecular strategy wherein the modular recruitment of co-factors to germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) serves to enhance repertoire of pathogens that can be sensed by the innate immune surveillance machinery.",
