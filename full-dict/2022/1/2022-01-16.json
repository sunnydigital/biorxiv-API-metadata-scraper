    "abstract": "To systematically investigate the complexity of neuron-specification regulatory networks we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen against all 875 transcription factors (TFs) encoded in Caenorhabditis elegans genome and searched for defects in nine different neuron types of the monoaminergic (MA) superclass and two cholinergic motoneurons.\n\nWe identified 91 TF candidates to be required for correct generation of these neuron types of which 28 were confirmed by mutant analysis. We found that correct reporter expression in each individual neuron type requires at least nine different TFs. Individual neuron types do not usually share TFs involved in their specification but share a common pattern of TFs belonging to the five most common TF families: Homeodomain (HD), basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH), Zinc Finger (ZF), Basic Leucine Zipper Domain (bZIP) and Nuclear Hormone Receptors (NHR). HD TF members are over-represented, supporting a key role for this family in the establishment of neuronal identities. These five TF families area also prevalent when considering mutant alleles with previously reported neuronal phenotypes in C. elegans, Drosophila or mouse. In addition, we studied terminal differentiation complexity focusing on the dopaminergic terminal regulatory program. We found two HD TFs (UNC-62 and VAB-3) that work together with known dopaminergic terminal selectors (AST-1, CEH-43, CEH-20). Combined TF binding sites for these five TFs constitute a cis-regulatory signature enriched in the regulatory regions of dopaminergic effector genes. Our results provide new insights on neuron-type regulatory programs in C. elegans that could help better understand neuron specification and evolution of neuron types.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing provides a new way to explore the evolutionary history of cells. Compared to traditional bulk sequencing, where a population of heterogeneous cells is pooled to form a single observation, single-cell sequencing isolates and amplifies genetic material from individual cells, thereby preserving the information about the origin of the sequences. However, single-cell data is more error-prone than bulk sequencing data due to the limited genomic material available per cell. Here, we present error and mutation models for evolutionary inference of single-cell data within a mature and extensible Bayesian framework, BEAST2. Our framework enables integration with biologically informative models such as relaxed molecular clocks and population dynamic models. Our simulations show that modeling errors increase the accuracy of relative divergence times and substitution parameters. We reconstruct the phylogenetic history of a colorectal cancer patient and a healthy patient from single-cell DNA sequencing data. We find that the estimated times of terminal splitting events are shifted forward in time compared to models which ignore errors. We observed that not accounting for errors can overestimate the phylogenetic diversity in single-cell DNA sequencing data. We estimate that 30-50% of the apparent diversity can be attributed to error. Our work enables a full Bayesian approach capable of accounting for errors in the data within the integrative Bayesian software framework BEAST2.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal effects associated with COVID-19 are highly variable for reasons that are not understood. In this study, we used intestinal organoid-derived cultures differentiated from primary human specimens as a model to examine inter-individual variability. Infection of intestinal organoids derived from different donors with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in orders of magnitude differences in virus replication in small intestinal and colonic organoid-derived monolayers. Susceptibility to infection correlated with ACE2 expression level and was independent of donor demographic or clinical features. ACE2 transcript levels in cell culture matched the amount of ACE2 in primary tissue indicating this feature of the intestinal epithelium is retained in the organoids. Longitudinal transcriptomics of organoid-derived monolayers identified a delayed yet robust interferon signature, the magnitude of which corresponded to the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, virus with the Omicron variant spike protein infected the organoids with the highest infectivity, suggesting increased tropism of the virus for intestinal tissue. These results suggest that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 replication in intestinal tissues results from differences in ACE2 levels, which may underlie variable patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Sexually dimorphic courtship behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster develop from the activity of the sexual differentiation genes, doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru), functioning with other regulatory factors that have received little attention. The dissatisfaction gene (dsf) encodes an orphan nuclear receptor homologous to vertebrate Tlx and Drosophila tailless that is critical for the development of several aspects of female- and male-specific sexual behaviors. Here, we report the pattern of dsf expression in the central nervous system and show that the activity of sexually dimorphic abdominal interneurons that co-express dsf and dsx is necessary and sufficient for vaginal plate opening in virgin females, ovipositor extrusion in mated females, and abdominal curling in males during courtship. We find that dsf activity results in different neuroanatomical outcomes in females and males, promoting and suppressing, respectively, female development and function of these neurons depending upon the sexual state of dsx expression. We posit that dsf and dsx interact to specify sex differences in the neural circuitry for dimorphic abdominal behaviors.",

However, because of the fleeting nature of conformational changes in proteins, investigating protein conformational spaces is a challenging task to do experimentally. Nonetheless, computational methods have shown to be practical to explore these conformational pathways. In this work, we use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods to evaluate our previously introduced algorithm called RRTMC, that uses a combination of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees algorithm and Monte Carlo criteria to explore these pathways. TDA is used to identify the intermediate conformations that are generated the most by RRTMC and examine how close they are to existing known intermediate conformations. We concluded that the intermediate conformations generated by RRTMC are close to existing experimental data and that TDA can be a helpful tool to analyze protein conformation sampling methods.",

    "abstract": "Insect wings are heterogeneous structures, with flexural rigidity varying one to two orders of magnitude over the wing surface. This heterogeneity influences the deformation the flapping wing experiences during flight. However, it is not well understood how this flexural rigidity gradient affects wing performance. Here, we develop a simplified 2D model of a flapping wing as a pitching, plunging airfoil using the assumed mode method and unsteady vortex lattice method to model the structural and fluid dynamics, respectively. We conduct parameter studies to explore how variable flexural rigidity affects mean lift production, power consumption and the forces required to flap the wing. We find that there is an optimal flexural rigidity distribution that maximizes lift production; this distribution generally corresponds to a 3:1 ratio between the wings flapping and natural frequencies, though the ratio is sensitive to flapping kinematics. For hovering flight, the optimized flexible wing produces 20% more lift and requires 15% less power compared to a rigid wing but needs 20% higher forces to flap. Even when flapping kinematics deviate from those observed during hover, the flexible wing outperforms the rigid wing in terms of aerodynamic force generation and power across a wide range of flexural rigidity gradients. Peak force requirements and power consumption are inversely proportional with respect to flexural rigidity gradient, which may present a trade-off between insect muscle size and energy storage requirements. The model developed in this work can be used to efficiently investigate other spatially variant morphological or material wing features moving forward.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreasing evidence indicates that redox stress participates in MFS aortopathy, though its mechanistic contribution is little known. We reported elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and NADPH oxidase NOX4 upregulation in MFS patients and mouse aortae. Here we address the contribution of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which catabolizes purines into uric acid and ROS in MFS aortopathy.\n\nMethods and ResultsIn aortic samples from MFS patients, XOR protein expression, revealed by immunohistochemistry, increased in both the tunicae intima and media of the dilated zone. In MFS mice (Fbn1C1041G/+), aortic XOR mRNA transcripts and enzymatic activity of the oxidase form (XO) were augmented in the aorta of 3-month-old mice but not in older animals. The administration of the XOR inhibitor allopurinol (ALO) halted the progression of aortic root aneurysm in MFS mice. ALO administrated before the onset of the aneurysm prevented its subsequent development. ALO also inhibited MFS-associated endothelial dysfunction as well as elastic fiber fragmentation, fibrotic collagen remodeling, nuclear translocation of pNRF2 and increased 3-nitrotyrosine levels all occurring in the tunica media. ALO reduced the MFS-associated large aortic production of H2O2, and NOX4 and MMP2 transcriptional overexpression.\n\nConclusionsAllopurinol interferes in aortic aneurysm progression acting as a potent antioxidant.

    "abstract": "Endotoxin - bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - is a driver of the lethal infection sepsis through activation of innate immune responses. When delivered to the cytosol of macrophages, LPS (cLPS) induces the assembly of an inflammasome that contains caspases-4/5 in humans or caspase-11 in mice. Whereas activation of all other inflammasomes is triggered by sensing of pathogen products by a specific host cytosolic pattern recognition receptor protein, whether pattern recognition receptors for cLPS exist has been doubted by many investigators, as caspases-4, -5, and -11 bind and activate LPS directly in vitro. Here we show that the primate-specific protein NLRP11 is a pattern recognition receptor for cLPS required for efficient activation of the caspase-4 inflammasome in human macrophages. NLRP11 is present in humans and other primates, but absent in mice, likely explaining why it has been missed in screens looking for innate immune signaling molecules, most of which have been carried out in mice. NLRP11 is a previously missing link and a component of the human caspase-4 inflammasome activation pathway.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDiscovery that human macrophages contain a cytosolic receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide.",

    "abstract": "An estimated 10% of flowering plant species conceal their pollen within tube-like anthers that dehisce through small apical pores (poricidal anthers). Bees extract pollen from poricidal anthers through a complex motor routine called floral buzzing, whereby the bee applies vibratory forces to the flower stamen by rapidly contracting its flight muscles. The resulting deformation depend on the stamens natural frequencies and vibration mode shapes, yet for most poricidal species these properties have not been sufficiently characterized. We performed experimental modal analysis on Solanum elaeagnifolium stamens to quantify their natural frequencies and vibration modes. Based on morphometric and dynamic measurements, we developed a finite element model of the stamen to identify how variable material properties, geometry and bee weight could affect its dynamics. In general, stamen natural frequencies fell outside the reported floral buzzing range, and variations in stamen geometry and material properties were unlikely to bring natural frequencies within this range. However, inclusion of bee mass reduced natural frequencies to within the floral buzzing frequency range and gave rise to an axial-bending vibration mode. We hypothesize that floral buzzing bees exploit the large vibration amplification factor of this mode to increase anther deformation, which may facilitate pollen ejection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the factors that influence microbes environmental distributions is important for deter-mining drivers of microbial community composition. These include environmental variables like temperature and pH, and higher-dimensional variables like geographic distance and host species phylogeny. In microbial ecology, \"specificity\" is often described in the context of symbiotic or host parasitic interactions, but specificity can be more broadly used to describe the extent to which a species occupies a narrower range of an environmental variable than expected by chance. Using a standardization we describe here, Raos (1982, 2010) Quadratic Entropy can be conveniently applied to calculate specificity of a feature, such as a species, to many different environmental variables.\n\nResultsWe present our R package specificity for performing the above analyses, and apply it to four real-life microbial data sets to demonstrate its application. We found that many fungi within the leaves of native Hawaiian plants had strong specificity to rainfall and elevation, even though these variables showed minimal importance in a previous analysis of fungal beta-diversity. In Antarctic cryoconite holes, our tool revealed that many bacteria have specificity to co-occurring algal community composition. Similarly, in the human gut microbiome, many bacteria showed specificity to the composition of bile acids. Finally, our analysis of the Earth Microbiome Project data set showed that most bacteria show strong ontological specificity to sample type. Our software performed as expected on synthetic data as well.\n\nConclusionsspecificity is well-suited to analysis of microbiome data, both in synthetic test cases, and across multiple environment types and experimental designs. The analysis and software we present here can reveal patterns in microbial taxa that may not be evident from a community-level perspective. These insights can also be visualized and interactively shared among researchers using specificitys companion package, specificity.shiny.",

    "abstract": "Membrane trafficking pathways perform important roles in establishing and maintaining the endolysosomal network. Retrograde protein sorting from the endosome is promoted by conserved SNX-BAR-containing coat complexes including retromer which enrich cargo at tubular microdomains and generate transport carriers. In metazoans, retromer cooperates with VARP, a conserved VPS9-domain GEF, to direct an endosomal recycling pathway. The function of the yeast VARP homolog Vrl1 has been overlooked due an inactivating mutation in commonly studied strains. Here, we demonstrate that Vrl1 has features of a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms an obligate complex with Vin1, the paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5. Unique features in the Vin1 N-terminus allow Vrl1 to distinguish it from Vps5, thereby forming what we have named the VINE complex. VINE occupies endosomal tubules and promotes the delivery of a conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like protein to the vacuolar membrane. In addition to sorting functions, membrane recruitment by Vin1 is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity, suggesting that VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome.",

    "abstract": "A major goal for the development of vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses, such as influenza or HIV, is to elicit antibodies with broad neutralization capacity. However, B cell precursors capable of maturing into broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) can be rare in the immune repertoire. Due to the stochastic nature of B cell receptor (BCR) rearrangement, a limited number of third heavy chain complementary determining region (CDRH3) sequences are identical between different individuals. Thus, in order to successfully engage broadly neutralizing antibody precursors that rely on their CDRH3 loop for antigen recognition, immunogens must be able to tolerate sequence diversity in the B cell receptor repertoire across an entire vaccinated population. Here, we present a combined experimental and computational approach to identify BCRs in the human repertoire with CDRH3 loops predicted to be engaged by a target immunogen. For a given antibody/antigen pair, deep mutational scanning was first used to measure the effect of CDRH3 loop substitution on binding. BCR sequences, isolated experimentally or generated in silico, were subsequently evaluated to identify CDRH3 loops expected to be bound by the candidate immunogen. We applied this method to characterize two HIV-1 germline-targeting immunogens and found differences in the frequencies with which they are expected to engage target B cells, thus illustrating how this approach can be used to evaluate candidate immunogens towards B cell precursors engagement and to inform immunogen optimization strategies for more effective vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveElectroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery (MI) classification is an important aspect in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) which bridges between neural system and computer devices decoding brain signals into recognizable machine commands. However, the MI classification task is challenging due to inherent complex properties, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG signals. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, the current work proposes an efficient multi-scale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN).\n\nApproachIn the framework, discriminant user-specific features have been extracted and integrated to improve the accuracy and performance of the CNN classifier. Additionally, different data augmentation methods have been implemented to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.\n\nMain resultsThe model achieves an average classification accuracy of 93.74% and Cohens kappa-coefficient of 0.92 on the BCI competition IV2b dataset outperforming several baseline and current state-of-the-art EEG-based MI classification models.\n\nSignificanceThe proposed algorithm effectively addresses the shortcoming of existing CNN-based EEG-MI classification models and significantly improves the classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Aging manifests as progressive dysfunction culminating in death. The diversity of cell types is a challenge to the precise quantification of aging and its reversal. Here we develop a suite of  aging clocks based on single cell transcriptomic data to characterize cell type-specific aging and rejuvenation strategies. The subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic region contains many cell types and provides an excellent system to study cell-level tissue aging and regeneration. We generated 21,458 single-cell transcriptomes from the neurogenic regions of 28 mice, tiling ages from young to old. With these data, we trained a suite of single cell-based regression models (aging clocks) to predict both chronological age (passage of time) and biological age (fitness, in this case the proliferative capacity of the neurogenic region). Both types of clocks perform well on independent cohorts of mice. Genes underlying the single cell-based aging clocks are mostly cell-type specific, but also include a few shared genes in the interferon and lipid metabolism pathways. We used these single cell-based aging clocks to measure transcriptomic rejuvenation, by generating single cell RNA-seq datasets of SVZ neurogenic regions for two interventions - heterochronic parabiosis (young blood) and exercise. Interestingly, the use of aging clocks reveals that both heterochronic parabiosis and exercise reverse transcriptomic aging in the niche, but in different ways across cell types and genes. This study represents the first development of high-resolution aging clocks from single cell transcriptomic data and demonstrates their application to quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation.",

    "abstract": "Soil microorganisms drive ecosystem function, but challenges of scale between microbe and ecosystem hinder our ability to accurately quantify and predictively model the soil microbe-ecosystem function relationship. Quantifying this relationship necessitates studies that systematically characterize multi-omics of soil microorganisms and their activity across sampling scales from spatially resolved to bulk measures, and structural complexity, from liquid pure culture to in situ. To address this need, we cultured two diazotrophic bacteria in liquid and solid media, with and without nitrogen (N) to quantify differences in extracellular metabolites associated with nitrogen fixation under increasing environmental structural complexity. We also quantified extracellular metabolites across sampling scales including bulk sampling via GC-MS analysis and spatially resolved analysis via MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. We found extracellular production of inorganic and organic N during free-living nitrogen fixation activity, highlighting a key mechanism of terrestrial N contributions from this process. Additionally, our results emphasize the need to consider the structural complexity of the environment and spatial scale when quantifying microbial activity. We found differences in metabolite profiles between culture conditions, supporting previous work indicating environmental structure influences microbial function, and across scales, underscoring the need to quantify microbial scale conditions to accurately interpret microbial function.\n\nImportanceStudying soil microorganisms, both who is present and what they are doing, is a challenge because of vast differences in scale between microorganism and ecosystem and because of inherent complexities of the soil system (e.g., opacity, chemical complexity). This makes measuring and predicting important ecosystem processes driven by soil microorganisms, like free-living nitrogen fixation, difficult. Free-living nitrogen fixing bacteria play a key role in terrestrial nitrogen contributions and may represent a significant, yet overlooked, nitrogen source in agricultural systems like bioenergy crops. However, we still know very little about how free-living nitrogen fixation contributes nitrogen to terrestrial systems. Our work provides key insight by hierarchically increasing structural complexity (liquid vs. solid culture) and scale (spatially resolved vs. bulk) to address the impact of environmental structure and sampling scale on detection of free-living nitrogen fixation and to identify the forms of nitrogen contributed to terrestrial systems by free-living nitrogen bacteria.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been successfully used to generate engineered T cells capable of recognizing and eliminating cancer cells. The structure of CARs frequently includes costimulatory domains, which enhance the T cell response upon antigen encounter. However, it is not fully known how the CAR co-stimulatory domains influence T cell activation in the presence of biological variability. In this work, we used mathematical modeling to elucidate how the inclusion of one such co-stimulatory molecule, CD28, impacts the response of a population of engineered T cells under different sources of variability. Particularly, our simulations demonstrate that CD28-bearing CARs mediate a faster and more consistent population response under both target antigen variability and kinetic rate variability. We identify kinetic parameters that have the most impact on mediating cell activation. Finally, based on our findings, we propose that enhancing the catalytic activity of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) can result in drastically reduced and more consistent response times among heterogeneous CAR T cell populations.",

    "abstract": "In thylakoid membranes, Photosystem II monomers from the stromal lamellae contain the subunits PsbS and Psb27 (PSIIm-S/27), while Photosystem II monomers from granal regions (PSIIm) lack these subunits. Here, we have isolated and characterised these two types of Photosystem II complexes. The PSIIm-S/27 showed enhanced fluorescence, the near-absence of oxygen evolution, as well as limited and slow electron transfer from QA to QB compared to the near-normal activities in the granal PSIIm. However, when bicarbonate was added to the PSIIm-S/27, water splitting and QA to QB electron transfer rates were comparable to those in granal PSIIm. The findings suggest that the binding of PsbS and/or Psb27 inhibits forward electron transfer and lowers the binding affinity for the bicarbonate. This can be rationalized in terms of the recently discovered photoprotection role played by bicarbonate binding via the redox tuning of the QA/QA*- couple, which controls the charge recombination route, and this limits chlorophyll triplet mediated 1O2 formation (Brinkert K et al. (2016) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 113(43):12144-12149). These findings suggest that PSIIm-S/27 is an intermediate in the assembly of PSII in which PsbS and/or Psb27 restrict PSII activity while in transit, by using a bicarbonate-mediated switch and protective mechanism.\n\nOne sentence summaryA photosystem II monomer with PsbS and Psb27 as additional subunits, is inactive as isolated but activated by bicarbonate, and is attributed to be a late-stage intermediate in photoassembly.",

    "abstract": "The guppy Y chromosome has been considered a model system for the evolution of suppressed recombination between sex chromosomes, and it has been proposed that complete sex-linkage has evolved across about 3 Mb surrounding this fishs sex-determining locus, followed by recombination suppression across a further 7 Mb of the 23 Mb XY pair, forming younger \"evolutionary strata\". Sequences of the guppy genome show that Y is very similar to the X chromosome, making it important to understand which parts of the Y are completely non-recombining, and whether there is indeed a large completely non-recombining region. Here, we describe new evidence that supports a different interpretation of the data that suggested the presence of such a region. We analysed PoolSeq data in samples from multiple natural populations from Trinidad. This yields evidence for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between sequence variants and the sex-determining locus. Downstream populations have higher diversity than upstream ones (which display the expected signs of bottlenecks). The associations we observe conform to predictions for a genome region with infrequent recombination that carries one or more sexually antagonistic polymorphisms. They also suggest the region in which the sex-determining locus must be located. However, no consistently male-specific variants were found, supporting the suggestion that any completely sex-linked region may be very small.",

In efforts to understand how such multivalent interactions regulate Drp1 functions, in vitro reconstitution schemes rely on recruiting soluble portions of the adaptors appended with genetically encoded polyhistidine tags onto membranes containing Ni2+-bound chelator lipids. These strategies are facile and circumvent the challenge in working with membrane proteins but assume that binding is specific to proteins carrying the polyhistidine tag. Here, we find using chelator lipids and chelator beads that both native and recombinant Drp1 directly bind Ni2+ ions. Metal-binding therefore represents a potential strategy to deplete or purify Drp1 from native tissue lysates. Importantly, high concentrations of the metal in solution inhibit GTP hydrolysis and renders Drp1 inactive in membrane fission. Together, our results emphasize a metal-binding propensity, which could significantly impact Drp1 functions.",

    "abstract": "As a critical sphingolipid metabolite, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays an essential role in immune and vascular systems. There are five S1P receptors, designated as S1PR1-5, encoded in the human genome, and their activities are governed by endogenous S1P, lipid-like S1P mimics, or non-lipid-like therapeutic molecules. Among S1PRs, S1PR1 stands out due to its non-redundant functions, such as the egress of T and B cells from the thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues, making it a potential therapeutic target. However, the structural basis of S1PR1 activation and regulation by various agonists remains unclear. Here we reported four atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of Gi-coupled human S1PR1 complexes: bound to endogenous agonist d18:1 S1P, benchmark lipid-like S1P mimic phosphorylated Fingolimod ((S)-FTY720-P), or non-lipid-like therapeutic molecule CBP-307 in two binding modes. Our results revealed the similarities and differences of activation of S1PR1 through distinct ligands binding to the amphiphilic orthosteric pocket. We also proposed a two-step \"shallow to deep\" transition process of CBP-307 for S1PR1 activation. Both binding modes of CBP-307 could activate S1PR1, but from shallow to deep transition may trigger the rotation of the N-terminal helix of Gi and further stabilize the complex by increasing the Gi interaction with the cell membrane. We combine with extensive biochemical analysis and molecular dynamic simulations to suggest key steps of S1P binding and receptor activation. The above results decipher the common feature of the S1PR1 agonist recognition and activation mechanism and will firmly promote the development of therapeutics targeting S1P receptors.",

    "abstract": "Prevalence of wide spread bacterial infections bring forth a critical need in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the antibiotics as well as the bacterial response to those antibiotics. Improper usage of antibiotics, which can be in sub-lethal concentrations is one among the multiple reasons for acquiring antibiotic resistance which makes it vital to understand the bacterial response towards sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics. In this work, we have used colistin, a well-known membrane active antibiotic used to treat severe bacterial infections and explored the impact of its sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on the lipid membrane dynamics and morphological changes of E. coli. Upon investigation of live cell membrane properties such as lipid dynamics using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we observed that colistin disrupts the lipid membrane at sub-MIC by altering the lipid diffusivity. Interestingly, filamentation-like cell elongation was observed upon colistin treatment which led to further exploration of surface morphology with the help of atomic force spectroscopy. The changes in the surface roughness upon colistin treatment provides additional insight on the colistin-membrane interaction corroborating with the altered lipid diffusion. Although altered lipid dynamics could be attributed to an outcome of lipid rearrangement due to direct disruption by antibiotic molecules on the membrane or an indirect consequence of disruptions in lipid biosynthetic pathways, we were able to ascertain that altered bacterial membrane dynamics is due to direct disruptions. Our results provide a broad overview on the consequence of the cyclic polypeptide, colistin on membrane specific lipid dynamics and morphology of a live Gram-negative bacterial cell.",

    "abstract": "Regular exercise can direct muscle kynurenine (KYN) metabolism toward the neuroprotective branch of the kynurenine pathway thereby limiting the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites in the brain and contributing to mental resilience. While the effect of regular exercise has been studied, the effect of muscle disease on KYN metabolism has not yet been investigated. Previous work has highlighted anxiety-like behaviors in approximately 25% of patients with DMD, possibly due to altered KYN metabolism. Here, we characterized KYN metabolism in mdx mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Young (8-10 week old) DBA/2J (D2) mdx mice, but not age-matched C57BL/10 (C57) mdx mice, had lower levels of circulating KYNA and KYNA:KYN ratio compared with their respective wild-type (WT) controls. Moreover, only D2 mdx mice displayed signs of anxiety-like behaviour, spending more time in the corners of their cages during a novel object recognition test when compared with WT. Along with this, we found that muscles from D2 mdx mice had less peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha and kynurenine amino transferase-1 enzyme content as well as elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines compared with WT muscles. Thus, our pilot work shows that KYN metabolism is altered in D2 mdx mice, with a potential contribution from altered muscle health.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe have previously demonstrated the in vivo importance of the Akt-eNOS substrate-kinase relationship, as defective postnatal angiogenesis characteristic of global Akt1-null mice is rescued when bred to  gain-of-function eNOS S1176D mutant mice. While multiple studies support the cardioprotective role of endothelial NO generation, the causal role of Akt1-dependent eNOS S1176 phosphorylation during atherosclerotic plaque formation is not yet clear.\n\nApproach & ResultsWe herein bred congenic  loss-of-function eNOS S1176A and  gain-of-function eNOS S1176D mutant mice to the proatherogenic Akt1-/-; ApoE-/- double knockout mice to definitively test the importance of Akt-mediated eNOS S1176 phosphorylation during atherogenesis. We find that a single amino acid substitution at the eNOS S1176 phosphorylation site yields divergent effects on atherosclerotic plaque formation, as an eNOS phospho-mimic aspartate (D) substitution at S1176 leads to decreased indices of atherosclerosis, even when on a proatherogenic Akt1 global deletion background. Conversely, mice harboring an unphosphorylatable mutation to alanine (S1176A) result in increased lipid deposition and cellular apoptosis, phenocopying the physiological consequence of eNOS deletion and/or impaired enzyme function. Furthermore, gene expression analyses of whole aortas indicate a combinatorial detriment from NO deficiency and Western Diet challenge, as  loss-of-function eNOS SA mice on a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet present a unique expression pattern indicative of augmented T-cell activity when compared to eNOS S1176D mice.\n\nConclusionsBy using genetic epistasis approaches, we conclusively demonstrate that Akt-mediated eNOS S1176 phosphorylation and subsequent activation remains to be the most physiologically relevant method of NO production to promote cardioprotective effects.",

    "abstract": "Many scenarios in cellular communication requires cells to interpret multiple dynamic signals. It is unclear how exposure to immune stimuli alters transcriptional responses to subsequent stimulus under inflammatory conditions. Using high-throughput microfluidic live cell analysis, we systematically profiled the NF-{kappa}B response to different signal sequences in single cells. We found that NF-{kappa}B dynamics stores the history of signals received by cells: depending on the dose and type of prior pathogenic and cytokine signal, the NF-{kappa}B response to subsequent stimuli varied widely, from no response to full activation. Using information theory, we revealed that these stimulus-dependent changes in the NF-{kappa}B response encode and reflect information about the identity and dose of the prior stimulus. Small-molecule inhibition, computational modeling, and gene expression profiling show that this encoding is driven by stimulus-dependent engagement of negative feedback modules. These results provide a model for how signal transduction networks process sequences of inflammatory stimuli to coordinate cellular responses in complex dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has restricted the efficacy of dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapies against HIV-1. Heterogeneous immune exhaustion and metabolic states of CD8+ T cells might differentially associate with dysfunction. However, specific parameters associated to functional restoration of CD8+ T cells after DC treatment have not been investigated in detail. Here, we studied the association of ART duration with memory subsets, exhaustion and metabolic profiles of CD8+ T cells from PLWH and improvement of polyfunctional and effector HIV-1 specific responses after stimulation with Gag-adjuvant-primed DC. HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell responses from a larger proportion PLWH on ART for more than 10 years (LT-ARTp) improved polyfunctionality and capacity to eliminate autologous p24+ infected CD4+ T cells in vitro. In contrast, CD8+ T cells from PLWH on ART for less than a decade (ST-ARTp) were less responsive to DC treatment and functional improvement was limited in this group. This was associated with lower frequencies of central memory CD8+ T cells, increased co-expression of PD1 and TIGIT and reduced mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic induction upon TCR activation. In contrast, CD8+ T cells from LT-ARTp showed increased frequencies of TIM3+PD1-cells and preserved induction of glycolysis. Treatment of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells from ST-ARTp with combined anti-PD1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies plus a glycolysis promoting drug restored their ability to eliminate infected CD4+ T cells. Together, our study identifies specific immunometabolic parameters for different PLWH subgroups potentially useful for future personalized DC-based HIV-1 vaccines.",

    "abstract": "How autoreactive CD4 T cells develop to cause rheumatoid arthritis remains unknown. We used a reporter for antigen-receptor signaling in the SKG autoimmune arthritis model to profile a T cell subpopulation enriched for arthritogenic naive CD4 T cells before arthritis onset by bulk and single cell RNA and T cell antigen-receptor (TCR) sequencing. Our analyses reveal that despite their impaired proximal TCR signaling, a subset of SKG naive CD4 T cells that have recently encountered endogenous antigen upregulate gene programs associated with positive regulation of T cell activation and cytokine signaling at higher levels than wild type cells in the pre-disease state. These arthritogenic cells also induce genes associated with negative regulation of T cell activation but do so less efficiently than wild type cells. Furthermore, their TCR sequences exhibit a previously unrecognized biased peripheral TCR V{beta} repertoire likely driven by endogenous viral superantigens. These particular V{beta}s, known to recognize endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) superantigen, are further expanded in arthritic joints. Our results demonstrate that autoreactive naive CD4 T cells which recognize endogenous viral superantigens are poised to cause disease by their altered transcriptome.\n\nSummary blurbSelf-reactive SKG T cells that escaped negative selection harbor an independent defect in anergy that, together with chronic antigen stimulation, sets the stage for disease.

Sweeteners are widely used food additives, although many studies using animal models have linked sweetener consumption to gut microbial changes and health issues. Whether sweeteners directly change the human gut microbiome functionality remains largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the responses of five human gut microbiomes to 21 common sweeteners, using an approach combining high-throughput ex vivo microbiome culturing and metaproteomics to quantify functional changes in different taxa. Hierarchical clustering based on metaproteomic responses of individual microbiomes resulted in two clusters. The first cluster was composed of non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) and two sugar alcohols with shorter carbon backbones (4-5 carbon atoms), and the second cluster was composed of sugar alcohols with longer carbon backbones. The metaproteomic functional responses of the second cluster were similar to the prebiotic fructooligosaccharides and kestose, indicating that these sugar alcohol-type sweeteners have potential prebiotic functions. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the direct effects of commonly used sweeteners on the functions of the human gut microbiome using a functional metaproteomics approach, improving our understanding of the roles of sweeteners on microbiome-associated human health and disease issues.",

    "abstract": "Hadal snailfishes are the deepest-living fishes in the ocean, inhabiting trenches from depths of [~]6,000 to 8,000 m. While the microbial communities in trench environments have begun to be characterized, the microbes associated with hadal megafauna remain relatively unknown. Here, we describe the gut microbiomes of two hadal snailfishes, Pseudoliparis swirei (Mariana Trench) and Notoliparis kermadecensis (Kermadec Trench) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We contextualize these microbiomes with comparisons to the abyssal macrourid Coryphaenoides yaquinae and the continental shelf-dwelling snailfish Careproctus melanurus. The microbial communities of the hadal snailfishes were distinct from their shallower counterparts and were dominated by the same sequences related to the Mycoplasmataceae and Desulfovibrionaceae. These shared taxa indicate that symbiont lineages may have remained similar to the ancestral symbiont since their geographic separation or that they are dispersed between geographically distant trenches and subsequently colonize specific hosts. The abyssal and hadal fishes contained sequences related to known, cultured piezophiles, microbes that grow optimally under high hydrostatic pressure, including Psychromonas, Moritella, and Shewanella. These taxa are adept at colonizing nutrient-rich environments present in the deep ocean, such as on particles and in the guts of hosts, and we hypothesize they could make a dietary contribution to deep-sea fishes by degrading chitin and producing fatty acids. We characterize the gut microbiota within some of the deepest fishes to provide new insight into the diversity and distribution of host-associated microbial taxa and the potential of these animals, and the microbes they harbor, for understanding adaptation to deep-sea habitats.\n\nImportanceHadal trenches, characterized by high hydrostatic pressures and low temperatures, are one of the most extreme environments on our planet. By examining the microbiome of abyssal and hadal fishes, we provide insight into both the physiology of the deepest-living vertebrates and the microbes which colonize them. Our findings show that there are similar microbial populations in fishes geographically separated by thousands of miles, reflecting strong selection for specific microbial lineages. Only a handful of psychropiezophilic taxa, which do not reflect the diversity of microbial life at great depth, have been successfully isolated in the laboratory. Our examination of deep-sea fish microbiomes shows that typical high-pressure culturing methodologies, which have largely remained unchanged since the pioneering work of Claude ZoBell in the 1950s, may simulate the chemical environment found in animal guts and helps explain why the same deep-sea genera are consistently isolated.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial endosymbionts are found in multiple arthropod species, where they play crucial roles as nutritional symbionts, defensive symbionts or reproductive parasites. Recent work has highlighted a new clade of heritable microbes within the gammaproteobacteria that enter into both obligate and facultative symbioses, with an obligately required unculturable symbiont recently given the name Cand. Symbiopectobacterium. In this study, we describe a culturable rod shaped non-flagellated bacterial symbiont from this clade isolated from the leafhopper Empoasca decipiens. The symbiont is related to the transovarially-transmitted  BEV bacterium that was first isolated from the leafhopper Euscelidius variegatus by Alexander Purcell, and we therefore name the symbiont Symbiopectobacterium purcellii sp. nov. gen. nov. We further report the closed genome sequence for S. purcellii. The genome is atypical for a heritable microbe, being large in size, without profound AT bias and with little evidence of pseudogenization. The genome is predicted to encode Type II, III and VI secretion systems and associated effectors and a non-ribosomal peptide synthase array likely to produce bioactive small molecules. Predicted metabolism is more complete than for other symbionts in the Symbiopectobacterium clade, and the microbe is predicted to synthesize a range of B vitamins. However, Biolog plate analysis indicate metabolism is depauperate compared to the sister clade, represented by Pectobacterium carotovorum. A quorum-sensing pathway related to that of Pectobacterium spp. (containing an overlapping expI-expR1 pair in opposite directions and a \"solo\" expR2) is evidenced, and LC-MS/MS analysis reveals the presence of 3-hydroxy-C10-HSL as the sole N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) in our strain. This AHL profile is profoundly divergent from that of other Erwinia and Pectobacterium spp., which produce mostly 3-oxo-C6- and 3-oxo-C8-HSL and could aid group identification. Thus, this microbe denotes one that has lost certain pathways associated with a saprophytic lifestyle but represents an important baseline against which to compare other members of the genus Symbiopectobacterium that show more profound integration into host biology.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) can thrive in its host during an infection, and, as a result, it must be able to respond to external stimuli and available carbon sources. The preclinical use of engineered pathogens capable of constitutive light production may provide realtime information on microbial-specific metabolic processes. Here we mapped the central metabolism of a luxABCDE-modified S. pyogenes Xen20 (Strep. Xen20) to its de novo synthesis of luciferase substrates as assessed by the rate of light production in response to different environmental triggers. Previous characterization predicted that the lux operon was under the myo-inositol iolE promotor. Here we show that supplementation with myoinositol generated increased Xen20 luminescence. Surprisingly, when supplemented with infection-relevant carbon sources, such as glucose or glycine, light production was diminished. This was presumably due to the scavenging of pyruvate by L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Inhibition of LDH by its inhibitor, oxamate, partially restored luminescent signal in the presence of glucose, presumably by allowing the resulting pyruvate to proceed to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). This phenomenon appeared specific to the lactic acid bacterial metabolism as glucose or glycine did not reduce signal in an analogous luxABCDE-modified Gram-positive pathogen, Staph. Xen29. The Strep. Xen20 cells produced light in a concentration-dependent manner, inversely related to the amount of glucose present. Taken together, our measures of microbial response could provide new information regarding the responsiveness of S. pyogenes metabolism to acute changes in its local environments and cellular health.",

Like other bacterial pathogens, the development of antimicrobial resistance is a severe problem in curing non-typhoidal Salmonella infection. In this work, we have investigated the role of four prominent outer membrane porins of S. Typhimurium, namely OmpA, OmpC, OmpD, and OmpF, in resistance against broad-spectrum {beta}-lactam antibiotics-ceftazidime and meropenem. We found that deleting OmpA from Salmonella makes the bacteria susceptible to {beta}-lactam drugs. The MIC for both the antibiotics reduced significantly for STM{Delta} ompA compared to the wild-type and the ompA complemented strains. Despite the presence of antibiotics, the uninterrupted growth of STM{Delta} ompC,{Delta} ompD, and{Delta} ompF endorsed the dispensability of these three porins in antimicrobial resistance. The {beta}-lactam antibiotics caused massive depolarization in the outer membrane of the bacteria in the absence of OmpA. We have proved that none of the extracellular loops but the complete structure of perfectly folded OmpA is required by the bacteria for developing antimicrobial resistance. Our data revealed that STM{Delta} ompA consumed more antibiotics than the wild-type and the complemented strain, resulting in severe damage of the bacterial outer membrane and subsequent killing of the pathogen by antibiotic-mediated oxidative stress. Upon deleting ompA, the steady decrease in the relative proportion of antibiotic-resistant persisters and the clearance of the STM{Delta} ompA from the liver and spleen of C57BL/6 mice upon treatment with ceftazidime proved the role of OmpA in rendering protection against {beta}-lactam antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Inherited microorganisms can selfishly manipulate host reproduction to drive through populations. In Drosophila melanogaster, germline expression of the native Wolbachia prophage WO proteins CifA and CifB cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in which embryos from infected males and uninfected females suffer catastrophic mitotic defects and lethality; however, in infected females, CifA expression rescues the embryonic lethality and thus imparts a fitness advantage to the maternally-transmitted Wolbachia. Despite widespread relevance to sex determination, evolution, and vector control, the mechanisms underlying when and how CI impairs male reproduction remain unknown and a topic of debate. Here we use cytochemical, microscopic, and transgenic assays in D. melanogaster to demonstrate that CifA and CifB proteins of wMel localize to nuclear DNA throughout the process of spermatogenesis. Cif proteins cause abnormal histone retention in elongating spermatids and protamine deficiency in mature sperms that travel to the female reproductive tract with Cif proteins. Notably, protamine gene knockouts enhance wild type CI. In ovaries, CifA localizes to germ cell nuclei and cytoplasm of early-stage egg chambers, however Cifs are absent in late-stage oocytes and subsequently in fertilized embryos. Finally, CI and rescue are contingent upon a newly annotated CifA bipartite nuclear localization sequence. Together, our results strongly support the Host Modification model of CI in which Cifs initially modify the paternal and maternal gametes to bestow CI-defining embryonic lethality and rescue.",

    "abstract": "The two doublet histones of Marseillevirus are distantly related to the four eukaryotic core histones and wrap 121 basepairs of DNA to form remarkably similar nucleosomes. By permeabilizing Marseillevirus virions and performing genome-wide nuclease digestion, chemical cleavage and mass spectrometry assays, we find that the higher-order organization of Marseillevirus chromatin fundamentally differs from that of eukaryotes. Marseillevirus nucleosomes fully protect DNA within virions as closely abutted 121-bp DNA wrapped cores without linker DNA or phasing along genes. Likewise, we observed that a large fraction of the nucleosomes reconstituted onto multi-copy tandem repeats of a nucleosome positioning sequence are tightly packed. Dense promiscuous packing of fully wrapped nucleosomes rather than \"beads-on-a-string\" with genic punctuation represents a new mode of DNA packaging by histones. We suggest that doublet histones have evolved for viral genome protection and may resemble an early stage of histone differentiation leading to the eukaryotic octameric nucleosome.",

    "abstract": "Nascent pairs of ecologically differentiated species offer an opportunity to get a better glimpse at the genetic architecture of speciation. Of particular interest is our recent ability to consider a wider range of genomic variants, not only single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thanks to long-read sequencing technology. We can now identify structural variants (SVs) like insertions, deletions, and other rearrangements, allowing further insights into the genetic architecture of speciation and how different types of variants are involved in species differentiation. Here, we investigated genomic patterns of differentiation between sympatric species pairs (Dwarf and Normal) belonging to the Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) species complex. We assembled the first reference genomes for both C. clupeaformis sp. Normal and C. clupeaformis sp. Dwarf, annotated the transposable elements, and analysed the genomes in the light of related coregonid species. Next, we used a combination of long-read and short-read sequencing to characterize SVs and genotype them at population-scale using genome-graph approaches, showing that SVs cover five times more of the genome than SNPs. We then integrated both SNPs and SVs to investigate the genetic architecture of species differentiation in two different lakes and highlighted an excess of shared outliers of differentiation. In particular, a large fraction of SVs differentiating the two species correspond to insertions or deletions of transposable elements (TEs), suggesting that TE accumulation may represent a key component of genetic divergence between the Dwarf and Normal species. Altogether, our results suggest that SVs may play an important role in speciation and that, by combining second and third generation sequencing, we now have the ability to integrate SVs into speciation genomics.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is a phylogenetic method widely used to analyze the properties of ancient biomolecules and to elucidate mechanisms of molecular evolution. Despite its increasingly widespread application, the accuracy of ASR is currently unknown, as it is generally impossible to compare resurrected proteins to the true ancestors. Which evolutionary models are best for ASR? How accurate are the resulting inferences? Here we answer these questions using a cross-validation method to reconstruct each extant sequence in an alignment with ASR methodology, a method we term \"extant sequence reconstruction\" (ESR). We thus can evaluate the accuracy of ASR methodology by comparing ESR reconstructions to the corresponding known true sequences.\n\nWe find that a common measure of the quality of a reconstructed sequence, the average probability, is indeed a good estimate of the fraction of correct amino acids when the evolutionary model is accurate or overparameterized. However, the average probability is a poor measure for comparing reconstructions from different models, because, surprisingly, a more accurate phylogenetic model often results in reconstructions with lower probability. While better (more predictive) models may produce reconstructions with lower sequence identity to the true sequences, better models nevertheless produce reconstructions that are more biophysically similar to true ancestors. In addition, we find that a large fraction of sequences sampled from the reconstruction distribution may have fewer errors than the single most probable (SMP) sequence reconstruction, despite the fact that the SMP has the lowest expected error of all possible sequences. Our results emphasize the importance of model selection for ASR and the usefulness of sampling sequence reconstructions for analyzing ancestral protein properties. ESR is a powerful method for validating evolutionary models used for ASR and can be applied in practice to any phylogenetic analysis of real biological sequences.",

    "abstract": "Natural products of lichen-forming fungi are structurally diverse and have a variety of medicinal properties. Despite this, they a have limited implementation in industry, because the corresponding genes remain unknown for most of the natural products. Here we implement a long-read sequencing and bioinformatic approach to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of the bioactive natural product gyrophoric acid (GA). Using 15 high-quality genomes representing nine GA-producing species of the lichen-forming fungal genus Umbilicaria, we identify the most likely GA cluster and investigate cluster gene organization and composition across the nine species. Our results show that GA clusters are promiscuous within Umbilicaria, with only three genes that are conserved across species, including the PKS gene. In addition, our results suggest that the same cluster codes for different but structurally similar NPs, i.e., GA, umbilicaric acid and hiascic acid, bringing new evidence that lichen metabolite diversity is also generated through regulatory mechanisms at the molecular level. Ours is the first study to identify the most likely GA cluster, and thus provides essential information to open new avenues for biotechnological approaches to producing and modifying GA and similar lichen-derived compounds. We show that bioinformatics approaches are useful in linking genes and potentially associated natural products. Genome analyses help unlocking the pharmaceutical potential of organisms such as lichens, which are biosynthetically diverse but slow growing, and difficult to cultivate due to their symbiotic nature.\n\nImportanceThe implementation of natural products in the pharmaceutical industry relies on the possibility of modifying the natural product (NP) pathway to optimize yields and pharmacological effects. Characterization of genes and pathways underlying natural product biosynthesis is a major bottleneck for the use of natural products in the pharmaceutical industry. Genome mining is a promising and relatively cost- and time-effective approach to exploit unexplored NP resources for drug discovery. In this study, we identify the most likely gene cluster for the lichen-forming fungal depside gyrophoric acid in nine Umbilicaria species. This compound shows cytotoxic and antiproliferative properties against several cancer cell lines, and is also a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. We identify the putative GA cluster from nine Umbilicaria species. This information paves the way for generating GA analogs with modified properties by selective activation/deactivation of genes.",

    "abstract": "Study DesignPreclinical animal study\n\nObjectiveEvaluation of the degenerative progression resulting from either a partial- or full- width injury to the mouse lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) using contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography and histological analyses. We utilized a lateral-retroperitoneal surgical approach to access the lumbar IVD, and the injuries to the IVD were induced by either incising one side of the annulus fibrosus or puncturing both sides of the annulus fibrosus. The full-width injury caused dramatic reduction in nucleus pulposus hydration and significant degeneration. A partial-width injury produces localized deterioration around the annulus fibrosus that resulted in local tissue remodeling without gross degeneration to the IVD.\n\nMethodsFemale C57BL/6J mice of 3-4 months age were used in this study. They were divided into three groups to undergo partial-width, full-width, or sham injuries. The L5/L6 and L6/S1 lumbar IVDs were surgically exposed using a lateral-retroperitoneal approach. The L6/S1 IVDs were injured using either a surgical scalpel (partial-width) or a 33G needle (full-width), with the L5/L6 serving as an internal control. These animals were allowed to recover and then sacrificed at 2-, 4-, or 8-weeks post-surgery. The IVDs were assessed for degeneration using contrast-enhanced microCT (CE{micro}CT) and histological analysis.\n\nResultsThe high-resolution 3D evaluation of the IVD confirmed that the respective injuries localized within one side of the annulus fibrosus or spanned the full width of the IVD. The full-width injury caused deteriorations in the nucleus pulposus after 2 weeks and progressed to significant degeneration at 8 weeks, while the partial width injury caused localized disruptions that remained limited to the annulus fibrosus.\n\nConclusionThe use of CE{micro}CT revealed distinct IVD degeneration profiles resulting from partial- and full- width injuries. The partial width injury may serve as an alternative for IVD degeneration resulting from localized annulus fibrosus injuries in humans.",

    "abstract": "Venoms of predatory marine cone snails (the family Conidae, order Neogastropoda) are intensely studied because of the broad range of biomedical applications of the neuropeptides that they contain, conotoxins. Meanwhile anatomy in some other neogastropod lineages strongly suggests that they have evolved similar venoms independently of cone snails, nevertheless their venom composition remains unstudied. Here we focus on the most diversified of these lineages, the genus Vexillum (the family Costellariidae). We have generated comprehensive multi-specimen, multi-tissue RNA-Seq data sets for three Vexillum species, and supported our findings in two species by proteomic profiling. We show that venoms of Vexillum are dominated by highly diversified short cysteine-rich peptides that in many aspects are very similar to conotoxins. Vexitoxins possess the same precursor organization, display overlapping cysteine frameworks and share several common post-translational modifications with conotoxins. Some vexitoxins show detectable sequence similarity to conotoxins, and are predicted to adopt similar domain conformations, including a pharmacologically relevant inhibitory cysteine-know motif (ICK). The tubular gL of Vexillum is a notably more recent evolutionary novelty than the conoidean venom gland. Thus, we hypothesize lower divergence between the toxin genes, and their  somatic counterparts compared to that in conotoxins, and we find support for this hypothesis in the molecular evolution of the vexitoxin cluster V027. We use this example to discuss how future studies on vexitoxins can inform origin and evolution of conotoxins, and how they may help addressing standing questions in venom evolution.",

    "abstract": "A key theoretical challenge posed by single-molecule studies is the inverse problem of deducing the underlying molecular dynamics from the time evolution of low-dimensional experimental observables. Toward this goal, a variety of low-dimensional models have been proposed as descriptions of single-molecule signals, including random walks with or without conformational memory and/or with static or dynamics disorder. Differentiating among different models presents a challenge, as many distinct physical scenarios lead to similar experimentally observable behaviors such as anomalous diffusion and nonexponential relaxation. Here we show that information-theory-based analysis of single-molecule time series, inspired by Shannons work studying the information content of printed English, can differentiate between Markov (memoryless) and non-Markov single-molecule signals and between static and dynamic disorder. In particular, non-Markov time series are more predictable and thus can be compressed and transmitted within shorter messages (i.e. have a lower entropy rate) than appropriately constructed Markov approximations, and we demonstrate that in practice the LZMA compression algorithm reliably differentiates between these entropy rates across several simulated dynamical models.",

Here, we used Hi-M, a multiplexed DNA-FISH imaging technique providing developmental timing and transcriptional status, to show that the emergence of TADs at the ensemble level partially segregates the conformational space explored by single nuclei during the early development of Drosophila embryos. Surprisingly, a substantial fraction of nuclei displayed strong insulation even before TADs emerged. Moreover, active transcription within a TAD led to minor changes to the local inter- and intra-TAD chromatin conformation in single nuclei and only weakly affected insulation to the neighboring TAD. Overall, our results indicate that multiple parameters contribute to shaping the chromatin architecture of single nuclei at the TAD scale.",

Here, we demonstrate that combined LSD1 and JAK1/2 inhibition exerts synergistic anti-leukemic effects specifically in ML-DS, both in vitro and in patient derived xenografts in vivo. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib enhanced the LSD1 inhibitor-induced differentiation, proliferation arrest and apoptosis in patient-derived leukemic blasts. At the transcriptional level, the combination synergistically repressed gene expression signatures essential for cell division. We further observed an immunogenic gene expression pattern in the form of increased cytokine signaling, which - by sensitizing ML-DS blasts to the JAK-STAT signaling blockade induced by ruxolitinib - could explain the increased susceptibility of ML-DS blasts to combination therapy. Taken together, we establish combined LSD1 and JAK-STAT inhibition as an efficacious therapeutic regimen specifically designed to target important steps in ML-DS leukemogenesis, paving the way for targeted therapies in this entity.",

DNMT3A mutations resulted in myeloid over lymphoid bias, and in expansion of immature myeloid progenitors primed toward megakaryocytic-erythroid fate. We observed dysregulated expression of lineage and leukemia stem cell markers. DNMT3A R882 led to preferential hypomethylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 targets and a specific sequence motif.

Here, we compared the frequency of Tregs, the activation of the IL-33/ILC2s axis in M2 macrophages, and the DNA methylation of epithelial lung cells from post-septic infant and adult mice. In contrast to adults, infant mice were resistant to secondary infection and did not show impairment in tumour controls upon melanoma challenge. Mechanistically, increased IL-33 levels, Tregs expansion, and activation of ILC2s and M2-macrophages were observed in post-septic adults but not infant mice. Impaired IL-33 production in post-septic infant mice was associated with increased DNA-methylation on lung epithelial cells. Notably, IL-33 treatment boosted the expansion of Tregs and induced immunosuppression in infant mice. Clinically, adults but not pediatric post-septic patients exhibited higher counts of Tregs and sera IL-33 levels. Hence, we describe a crucial and age-dependent role for IL-33 in post-sepsis immunosuppression.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive introgression is ubiquitous in animals but experimental support for its role in driving speciation remains scarce. In the absence of conscious selection, admixed laboratory strains of Drosophila asymmetrically and progressively lose alleles from one parental species and reproductive isolation against the predominant parent ceases after 10 generations. Here, we selectively introgressed during one year light pigmentation genes of D. santomea into the genome of its dark sibling D. yakuba, and vice versa. We found that the pace of phenotypic change differed between the species and the sexes, and identified through genome sequencing common as well as distinct introgressed loci in each species. Mating assays showed that assortative mating between introgressed flies and both parental species persisted even after four years ([~] 60 generations) from the end of the selection. Those results indicate that selective introgression of as low as 0.5% of the genome can beget morphologically-distinct and reproductively-isolated strains, two prerequisites for the delimitation of new species. Our findings hence represent a significant step towards understanding the genome-wide dynamics of speciation-through-introgression.",
