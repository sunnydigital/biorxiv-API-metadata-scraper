    "abstract": "Lysosomes orchestrate degradation and recycling of exogenous and endogenous material, thus controlling cellular homeostasis. Little is known how this organelle changes during malignant transformation. We investigate the intracellular landscape of lysosomes in a cellular model of bladder cancer. Employing standardized cell culture on micropatterns we identify a phenotype of peripheral lysosome positioning prevailing in bladder cancer but not normal urothelium. We show that lysosome positioning is controlled by transcription factor EB (TFEB) and that lysosomal dispersion results from TFEB activation downstream of lysosomal Ca2+ release. Remarkably, we find that TFEB regulates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) levels on endomembranes which recruit FYVE-domain containing proteins, such as the motor adaptor protrudin, for anterograde movement of lysosomes. Altogether, we uncover lysosome positioning as result of PtdIns3P activation downstream of TFEB as a potential biomarker for bladder cancer. Moreover, we reveal a novel role of TFEB in regulating cellular PtdIns levels, conceptually clarifying the dual role of TFEB as regulator of endosomal maturation and autophagy, two distinct processes controlled by PtdIns3P.\n\nStatement of significanceHere we provide the first atlas for the landscape of the lysosomal compartment in bladder cancer and reveal the mechanistic role of TFEB in regulating endosomal PtdIns3P levels and subsequent lysosomal dispersion. We unveiled lysosomal positioning as a potential biomarker for malignant bladder cancer which might arise as an actionable target for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Visual perception remains stable across saccadic eye movements, despite the concurrent strongly disruptive visual flow. This stability is partially associated with a reduction in visual sensitivity, known as saccadic suppression, which already starts in the retina with reduced ganglion cell sensitivity. However, the retinal circuit mechanisms giving rise to such suppression remain unknown. Here, we describe these mechanisms using electrophysiology in mouse, pig, and macaque retina, 2-photon calcium imaging, computational modeling, and human psychophysics. We find that sequential stimuli, such as those that naturally occur during saccades, trigger three independent suppressive mechanisms in the retina. The main suppressive mechanism is triggered by contrast-reversing sequential stimuli and originates within the receptive field center of ganglion cells. It does not involve inhibition or other known suppressive mechanisms such as saturation or adaptation. Instead, it relies on temporal filtering of the inherently slow response of cone photoreceptors coupled with downstream nonlinearities. Two further mechanisms of suppression are present predominantly in ON ganglion cells and originate in the receptive field surround, highlighting a novel disparity between ON and OFF ganglion cells. The mechanisms uncovered here likely play a role in shaping the retinal output following eye movements and other natural viewing conditions where sequential stimulation is ubiquitous.",

    "abstract": "The medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, is a powerful model organism for investigating fundamental neurobehavioral processes. The well-documented arrangement and properties of H. verbanas nervous system allows changes at the level of specific neurons or synapses to be linked to physiological and behavioral phenomena. Juxtaposed to the extensive knowledge of H. verbanas nervous system is a limited, but recently expanding, portfolio of molecular and multi-omics tools. Together, the advancement of genetic databases for H. verbana will complement existing pharmacological and electrophysiological data by affording targeted manipulation and analysis of gene expression in neural pathways of interest. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly for H. verbana, which is approximately 250 Mbp in size and consists of 61,282 contigs. Whole genome sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform followed by genome assembly with CLC-Bio Genomics Workbench and subsequent functional annotation. Ultimately, the diversity of organisms for which we have genomic information should parallel the availability of next generation sequencing technologies to widen the comparative approach to understand the involvement and discovery of genes in evolutionarily conserved processes. Results of this work hope to facilitate comparative studies with H. verbana and provide the foundation for future, more complete, genome assemblies of the leech.",

Here we report on a two-dimensional molecular data storage system that records information in both the sequence and the backbone structure of DNA and performs nontrivial joint data encoding, decoding and processing. Our 2DDNA method efficiently stores high-density images in synthetic DNA and embeds pertinent metadata as nicks in the DNA backbone. To avoid costly worst-case redundancy for correcting sequencing/rewriting errors and to mitigate issues associated with mismatched decoding parameters, we develop machine learning techniques for automatic discoloration detection and image inpainting. The 2DDNA platform is experimentally tested by reconstructing a library of images with undetectable or small visual degradation after readout processing, and by erasing and rewriting copyright metadata encoded in nicks. Our results demonstrate that DNA can serve both as a write-once and rewritable memory for heterogenous data and that data can be erased in a permanent, privacy-preserving manner. Moreover, the storage system can be made robust to degrading channel qualities while avoiding global error-correction redundancy.",

    "abstract": "As an adaptive system, the brain must retain a faithful representation of the world while continuously integrating new information. Recent experiments have measured population activity in cortical and hippocampal circuits over many days, and found that patterns of neural activity associated with fixed behavioral variables and percepts change dramatically over time. Such \"representational drift\" raises the question of how malleable population codes can interact coherently with stable long-term representations that are found in other circuits, and with relatively rigid topographic mappings of peripheral sensory and motor signals. We explore how known plasticity mechanisms can allow single neurons to reliably read out an evolving population code without external error feedback. We find that interactions between Hebbian learning and single-cell homeostasis can exploit redundancy in a distributed population code to compensate for gradual changes in tuning. Recurrent feedback of partially stabilized readouts could allow a pool of readout cells to further correct inconsistencies introduced by representational drift. This shows how relatively simple, known mechanisms can stabilize neural tuning in the short term, and provides a plausible explanation for how plastic neural codes remain integrated with consolidated, long-term representations.\n\nSignificanceThe brain is capable of adapting while maintaining stable long-term memories and learned skills. Recent experiments show that neural responses are highly plastic in some circuits, while other circuits maintain consistent responses over time, raising the question of how these circuits interact coherently. We show how simple, biologically motivated Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms in single neurons can allow circuits with fixed responses to continuously track a plastic, changing representation without reference to an external learning signal.",

Inspired by clinical observations, we ask if this bilateral representation differs for the left and right hemispheres. Electrocorticography (ECoG) was recorded in human participants during an instructed-delay reaching task, with movements produced with either the contralateral or ipsilateral arm. Using a cross-validated kinematic encoding model, we found stronger bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere, an effect that was present during preparation and was amplified during execution. Consistent with this asymmetry, we also observed better across-arm generalization in the left hemisphere, indicating similar neural representations for right and left arm movements. Notably, these left hemisphere electrodes were centered over premotor and parietal regions. The more extensive bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere adds a new perspective to the pervasive neuropsychological finding that the left hemisphere plays a dominant role in praxis.",

    "abstract": "Electrotaxis, the directional migration of cells in a constant electric field, is important in regeneration, development, and wound healing. Electrotaxis has a slower response and a smaller dynamic range than guidance by other cues, suggesting that the mechanism of electrotaxis share both similarities and differences with chemical-gradient-sensing pathways. We examined a mechanism centered on the excitable system consisting of cortical waves of biochemical signals coupled to cytoskeletal reorganization, which has been implicated in random cell motility. We use electro-fused giant Dictyostelium discoideum cells to decouple waves from cell motion and employ nanotopographic surfaces to limit wave dimensions and lifetimes. We demonstrate that wave propagation in these cells is guided by electric fields. The wave area and lifetime gradually increase in the first 10 minutes after an electric field is turned on, leading to more abundant and wider protrusions in the cell region nearest the cathode. The wave directions display \"U-turn\" behavior upon field reversal, and this switch occurs more quickly on nanotopography. Our results suggest that electric fields guide cells by controlling waves of signal transduction and cytoskeletal activity, which underlie cellular protrusions. Whereas surface receptor occupancy triggers both rapid activation and slower polarization of signaling pathways, electric fields appear to act primarily on polarization, explaining why cells respond to electric fields more slowly than to other guidance cues.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is composed of functional networks that have a modular topology, where brain regions are organized into communities that form internally dense (segregated) and externally sparse (integrated) subnetworks that underlie higher-order cognitive functioning. It is hypothesized that amyloid-{beta} and tau pathology in preclinical Alzheimers disease (AD) spread through functional networks, disrupting neural communication that results in cognitive dysfunction. We used high-resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses to test whether in vivo amyloid-{beta} and tau burden was associated with the segregation and integration of brain functional connections, and episodic memory, in cognitively-unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers who are expected to develop early-onset AD dementia in approximately 13 years on average. Compared to non-carriers, mutation carriers exhibited less functional segregation and integration in posterior default-mode network (DMN) regions, particularly the precuneus, and in the retrospenial cortex, which has been shown to link medial temporal regions and cortical regions of the DMN. Mutation carriers also showed greater functional segregation and integration in regions connected to the salience network, including the striatum and thalamus. Greater tau burden was associated with lower segregated and integrated functional connectivity of DMN regions, particularly the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex. In turn, greater tau pathology was related to higher segregated and integrated functional connectivity in the retrospenial cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex, a hub of the salience network. These findings enlighten our understanding of how AD-related pathology distinctly alters the brains functional architecture in the preclinical stage, possibly contributing to pathology propagation and ultimately resulting in dementia.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAmyloid-{beta} and tau pathologies in Alzheimers disease (AD) are hypothesized to propagate through functional networks. Research is needed to elucidate how AD-related pathologies alter the brains functional connections years before symptom-onset to help predict pathology accumulation and dementia risk. Using high-resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses and PET imaging, we showed that greater tau burden was associated with largely dysconnectivity of posterior default-mode network brain regions, and increased connectivity of structures associated with the salience network and others that are critical for integrating information across neural systems in cognitively-unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers. Findings enlighten how amyloid-{beta} and tau relate to distinct patterns of functional connectivity in regions that underlie memory functioning and are critical for information processing, helping predict disease progression.",

Genetic variants that produce a higher proportion of spores are predicted to undercut multicellular organization unless cooperators assort positively. Cell adhesion is considered a primary factor driving such assortment, but evolution of adhesion has not been experimentally connected to changes in social performance. We modified by experimental evolution the efficiency of individual cells in attaching to a surface. Surprisingly, evolution appears to have produced social cooperators irrespective of whether stronger or weaker adhesion was selected. Quantification of reproductive success, cell-cell adhesion and developmental patterns, however, revealed two distinct social behaviours, as captured when the classical metric for social success is generalized by considering clonal spore production. Our work shows that cell mechanical interactions can constrain evolution of development and sociality in chimeras, and that elucidation of proximate mechanisms is necessary in order to understand the ultimate emergence of multicellular organization.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with a reduced magnitude of primary immune responses to vaccination and constriction of immune receptor repertoire diversity. Clinical trials demonstrated high efficacy of mRNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in older adults but concerns about virus variant escape have not been well addressed. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of humoral and cellular immunity against an early-pandemic viral isolate and compared that to the P.1. (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants in <50 and >55 age cohorts of mRNA vaccine recipients. We have further measured neutralizing antibody titers for B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.595; a SARS-CoV-2 isolate bearing Spike mutation E484Q. As reported, robust immunity required the second dose of vaccine. Older vaccinees manifested robust cellular immunity against early-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and more recent variants, which remained statistically comparable to the adult group. The older cohort had lower neutralizing capacity at the first time point following the second dose, but at later time points immunity was indistinguishable between them. While the duration of these immune responses remains to be determined over longer periods of time, these results provide reasons for optimism regarding vaccine protection of older adults against SARS-CoV-2 variants and inform thinking about boost vaccination with variant vaccines.\n\neTOC summaryVaccine responses are often diminished with aging, but we found strong responses to SARS-CoV-2 in older adults following mRNA vaccination. T cell responses were not diminished when confronted by SARS-CoV-2 variants.

    "abstract": "Human in vitro models of neural tissue with controllable cellular identity, tunable microenvironment, and defined spatial arrangement are needed to facilitate studies of brain development and disease. Towards this end, embedded printing in jammed microgel supports (i.e., granular gels) holds great promise as it allows precise and programmable patterning of extremely soft and compliant tissue constructs. However, in contrast to the vast material landscape available for bulk hydrogels, granular printing support formulations are restricted to a handful of materials without the ability for facile adjustment of biofunctional properties of the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, there has been a need for novel materials that take advantage of versatile biomimicry of bulk hydrogels while providing high-fidelity support for embedded printing akin to granular gels. To address this need, we present a modular platform for bioengineering of neuronal networks via direct embedded 3D printing of human stem cells inside Self-Healing Annealable Particle-Extracellular matrix (SHAPE) composites. SHAPE composites consist of soft microgels immersed in viscous extracellular-matrix solution to enable precise freeform patterning of human stem cells and consequent generation and long-term maintenance of mature subtype-specific neurons that extend projections within the volume of the annealed support. The developed approach further allows multi-ink deposition, live spatial and temporal monitoring of oxygen levels, as well as creation of vascular channels. Due to its modularity, SHAPE biomanufacturing toolbox not only offers a solution for functional modeling of mechanically sensitive neural constructs, but also has potential to be applied to a wide range of biomaterials with different crosslinking mechanisms to model tissues and diseases where recapitulation of complex architectural features and topological cues is essential.",

Here we assessed adaptive evolution across genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome by correlating clade growth with mutation accumulation as well as by comparing rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence, clustering of mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and degree of convergent evolution of individual mutations. We find that spike S1 is the focus of adaptive evolution, but also identify positively-selected mutations in other genes that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Adaptive changes in S1 accumulated rapidly, resulting in a remarkably high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence that is 2.5X greater than that observed in HA1 at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "With decreasing costs of high-throughput sequencing, more and more datasets providing omics profiles of cancer patients become available. Thus, novel survival analysis approaches integrating these differently sized and heterogeneous molecular and clinical groups of variables start being developed. Due to the difficulty of the task of multi-omics data integration, the Cox Proportional-Hazards (PH) model using clinical data has remained one of the best-performing techniques, barely outperformed by models using molecular data modalities. There is therefore a need for methods that can successfully perform multi-omics integration in survival analysis and outperform the clinical Cox PH model. Moreover, while certain deep learning methods have been shown to provide state-of-the-art accuracy of cancer survival prediction, most of them show no benefit or even decay in performance when integrating a larger number of modalities, further motivating a need to investigate how modality-specific representations should be integrated when using neural networks for multi-omics integration. We benchmarked multiple integration techniques for a neural network architecture, revealing that hierarchical autoencoder-based integration of modality-specific representations outperformed other methods such as max-pooling and was comparable with state-of-the-art statistical approaches for multi-omics integration. Further, we showed that the hierarchical autoencoder-based integration of modality-specific representations achieved increased performance through a soft modality selection mechanism, focusing on the most informative modalities for each cancer. We thus framed multiomics integration as a partial group-wise feature selection problem, highlighting that only those models performed well that could adequately weight important modalities in the presence of the high noise imposed by less important modalities.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and empirical research on the causes of species range limits suggests the contribution of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, with potentially complex interactions among them. An intrinsic factor proposed by recent theory is mutational load increasing towards range edges because of genetic drift. Furthermore, environmental quality may decline toward range edges and enhance the expression of load. Here we tested whether the expression of mutational load associated with range limits in the North American plant Arabidopsis lyrata is enhanced under stressful environmental conditions by comparing the performance of within- versus between-population crosses at common garden sites across the species distribution and beyond. Heterosis, reflecting the expression of load, increased with heightened estimates of genomic load and with environmental stress caused by warming, but the interaction was not significant. We conclude that range-edge populations suffer from a twofold genetic Allee effect caused by increased mutational load and stress-dependent load linked to general heterozygote deficiency, but no synergistic effect between them.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesHair (i.e., pelage/fur) is a salient feature of primate (including human) diversity and evolution-- serving functions tied to thermoregulation, protection, camouflage, and signaling--but wild primate pelage evolution remains relatively understudied. Specifically, assessing multiple hypotheses across distinct phylogenetic scales is essential but is rarely conducted. We examine whole body hair color and density variation across Indriidae (Avahi, Indri, Propithecus)--a lineage that, like humans, exhibits vertical posture (i.e., their whole bodies are vertical to the sun).\n\nMaterials and MethodsOur analyses consider multiple phylogenetic scales (family-level, genus-level) and hypotheses (e.g., Glogers rule, the body cooling hypotheses). We obtain hair color and density from museum and/or wild animals, opsin genotypes from wild animals, and climate data from WorldClim. To analyze our data, we use phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMM) using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.\n\nResultsOur results show that across the Indriidae family, darker hair is typical in wetter regions. However, within Propithecus, dark black hair is common in colder forest regions. Results also show pelage redness increases in populations exhibiting enhanced color vision. Lastly, we find follicle density on the crown and limbs increases in dry and open environments.\n\nDiscussionThis study highlights how different selective pressures across distinct phylogenetic scales have likely acted on primate hair evolution. Specifically, our data across Propithecus may implicate thermoregulation and is the first empirical evidence of Bogerts rule in mammals. Our study also provides rare empirical evidence supporting an early hypothesis on hominin hair evolution.",

    "abstract": "V-ATPases are rotary proton pumps that serve as signaling hubs with numerous proposed binding partners in cells. We used cryoEM combined with exhaustive focused classification to detect endogenous proteins that associate with V-ATPase from porcine kidney. A super-stoichiometric copy of subunit C was found in ~3% of complexes, while an additional ~1.6% of complexes bound mEAK-7, a protein with proposed roles in dauer formation in nematodes and mTOR signaling in mammals. High-resolution cryoEM of porcine kidney V-ATPase with recombinant mEAK-7 shows that mEAK-7s TLDc domain interacts with V-ATPases stator while its C-terminal  helix binds V-ATPases rotor. This crosslink would be expected to inhibit rotary catalysis. However, unlike inhibition of yeast V-ATPase by the TLDc protein Oxr1p, exogenous mEAK-7 does not inhibit V-ATPase and mEAK-7 overexpression in cells does not alter lysosomal or phagosomal pH. Instead, cryoEM suggests that interaction of mEAK-7 with V-ATPase is disrupted by ATP-induced rotation of the rotor. Comparison of Oxr1p and mEAK-7 binding explains this difference. Together, these results show that differences in V-ATPase binding by TLDc domain-containing proteins can lead to effects ranging from strong inhibition to formation of labile interactions that are sensitive to the enzymes activity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe efficacy of zinc phosphide (ZnP) for broadacre control of wild house mice in Australia is being reported by growers as increasingly variable. Have mice become less sensitive over time or are they taking a sub-lethal dose and developing aversion? In this laboratory study the sensitivity of groups of wild caught and an outbred laboratory strain of mice was assessed using oral gavage of a range of ZnP concentrations. The willingness of mice to consume ZnP-coated grains was then determined.\n\nRESULTSEach mouse group had very similar LD50 values (72 to 79 mg ZnP per kg body weight) which are significantly higher than previously reported. Time to death post-gavage ranged between 2.5 to 48 h. ZnP coated grains (50 g ZnP per kg grain) presented in the absence of alternative food were consumed and 94 percent of wild mice died. Mice provided with alternative food and ZnP coated wheat grains (either 25 or 50 g ZnP per kg grain) consumed toxic and non-toxic grains, and mortality was lower (33 to 55 percent). If a sublethal amount of ZnP coated grain was consumed, aversion occurred mostly in the presence of alternative food.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe sensitivity of wild house mice to ZnP in Australia is significantly lower than previously assumed. Under laboratory conditions ZnP coated grains coated with a new higher dose (50 g ZnP per kg grain) were readily consumed. Consumption of toxic grain occurred when alternative food was available but was decreased. It is important to assess the efficacy of the higher ZnP dose per grain under natural field conditions, especially when background food is low.",

In this work, we localize the cleavage site in the first loop of the extracellular domain using amino-terminal protein sequencing of purified receptor and by mutagenesis studies. We further show, that a receptor mutant not susceptible to proteolytic cleavage exhibits reduced signaling to Gs and increased activation of Gq compared to wild-type PTH1R. These findings indicate that the extracellular domain modulates PTH1R signaling specificity, and that its cleavage affects receptor signaling.",

    "abstract": "Inferring parameters of computational models that capture experimental data is a central task in cognitive neuroscience. Bayesian statistical inference methods usually require the ability to evaluate the likelihood of the model--however, for many models of interest in cognitive neuroscience, the associated likelihoods cannot be computed effciently. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a solution to this problem by only requiring access to simulations produced by the model. Here, we provide an effcient SBI method for models of decision-making. Our approach, Mixed Neural Likelihood Estimation (MNLE), trains neural density estimators on model simulations to emulate the simulator, and is designed to capture both the continuous (e.g., reaction times) and discrete (choices) data of decision-making models. The likelihoods of the emulator can then be used to perform Bayesian parameter inference on experimental data using standard approximate inference methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We demonstrate MNLE on two variants of the drift-diffusion model (DDM) and compare its performance to a recently proposed method for SBI on DDMs, called Likelihood Approximation Networks (LANs, Fengler et al. 2021). We show that MNLE is substantially more effcient than LANs: it achieves similar likelihood accuracy with six orders of magnitude fewer training simulations, and is substantially more accurate than LANs when both are trained with the same budget. This enables researchers to train MNLE on custom-tailored models of decision-making, leading to fast iteration of model design for scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "Photo-identification of individual sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) is the primary technique for mark-recapture-based population analyses for the species The visual appearance of the fluke -- with its distinct nicks and notches -- often serves as the primary visual differentiator, allowing humans to make recorded sightings of specific individuals. However, the advent of digital photography and the significant increase in volume of images from multiple projects in combination with pre-existing historical catalogs has made applying the method more challenging.with the required human labor for de-duplication (reduction of Type II errors) and reconciliation of sightings between large datasets too cost- and time-prohibitive. To address this, we trained and evaluated the accuracy of PIE v2 (a triplet loss network) along with two existing fluke trailing edge-matching algorithms, CurvRank v2 and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), as a mean to speed comparison among a high volume of photographs. Analyzed data were collected from a curated catalog of well-known sperm whales sighted across years (2005-2018) off the island of Dominica. The newly-trained PIE model outperformed the older CurvRank and DTW algorithms, and PIE provided the following top-k individual ID matching accuracy on a standard min-3/max-10 sighting training data set: Rank-1: 87.0%, Rank-5: 90.5%, and Rank-12: 92.5%. An essential aspect of PIE is that it can learn new individuals without network retraining, which can be immediately applied in the presence of (and for the resolution of) duplicate individuals in overlapping catalogs. Overall, our results recommend the use of PIE v2 and CurvRank v2 for ID reconciliation in combination due to their complementary performance.",

However, the search to emulate phenomena observed in the living matter has fallen short of producing a cytoskeletal network that would be structurally stable yet possessing adaptive plasticity. Here, we address this challenge by combining cytoskeletal polymers in a composite, where self-assembling microtubules and actin filaments collectively self-organise due to the activity of microtubules-percolating molecular motors. We demonstrate that microtubules spatially organise actin filaments that in turn guide microtubules. The two networks align in an ordered fashion using this feedback loop. In this composite, actin filaments can act as structural memory and, depending on the concentration of the components, microtubules either write this memory or get guided by it. The system is sensitive to external stimuli suggesting possible autoregulatory behaviour in changing mechanochemical environment. We thus establish artificial active actin-microtubule composite as a system demonstrating architectural stability and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing is an indispensable mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression. Splicing inhibition causes cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2/M phases, which is thought to be one of the reasons for the potent antitumor activity of splicing inhibitors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell cycle arrest have many unknown aspects. In particular, the mechanism of G2/M-phase arrest caused by splicing inhibition is completely unknown. Here, we found that lower and higher concentrations of pladienolide B caused M-phase and G2-phase arrest, respectively. We analyzed protein levels of cell cycle regulators and found that a truncated form of the p27 CDK inhibitor, named p27*, accumulates in G2-arrested cells. Overexpression of p27* caused partial G2-phase arrest. Conversely, knockdown of p27* accelerated exit from G2/M phase after washout of splicing inhibitor. These results suggest that p27* contributes to G2/M-phase arrest caused by splicing inhibition. We also found that p27* bound to and inhibited M-phase cyclins, although it is well known that p27 regulates G1/S transition. Intriguingly, p27*, but not full-length p27, was resistant to proteasomal degradation and remained in G2/M phase. These results suggest that p27*, which is a very stable truncated protein in G2/M phase, contributes to G2-phase arrest caused by splicing inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The Circadian Clock (CC) drives the normal cell cycle and reciprocally regulates telomere elongation. However, it can be deregulated in cancer, embryonic stem cells (ESC), and the early embryo. Here, its role in the resistance of cancer cells to genotoxic treatments was assessed in relation to whole-genome duplication (WGD) and telomere regulation. We first evaluated the DNA damage response of polyploid cancer cells and observed a similar impact on the cell cycle to that seen in ESC - overcoming G1/S, adapting DNA damage checkpoints, tolerating DNA damage, and coupling telomere erosion to accelerated cell senescence, favouring transition by mitotic slippage into the ploidy cycle (reversible polyploidy). Next, we revealed a positive correlation between cancer WGD and deregulation of CC assessed by bioinformatics on 11 primary cancer datasets (rho=0.83; p<0.01). As previously shown, the cancer cells undergoing mitotic slippage cast off telomere fragments with TERT, restore the telomeres by recombination and return their depolyploidised mitotic offspring to TERT-dependent telomere regulation. Through depolyploidisation and the CC \"death loop\" the telomeres and Hayflick limit count are thus again renewed. This mechanism along with similar inactivity of the CC in early embryos support a life-cycle (embryonic) concept of cancer.",

The analysis of this type of data is often trivial because it is not feasible to conduct extensive numerical methods on this type of data. Graphs or networks, on the other hand, are comprised of sets of nodes and edges that can also be considered as nominal variables. By integrating graph theory and data mining approaches, we offer the R package NIMAA to define a nominal data-mining pipeline to explore more information. Using nominal variables in a dataset, NIMAA provides functions for constructing weighted and unweighted bipartite graphs, analysing the similarity of labels in nominal variables, clustering labels or categories to super-labels, validating clustering results, predicting bipartite edges by missing weight imputation, and providing a variety of visualization tools. Here, we also indicated the application of nominal data mining in a biological dataset with well-riched nominal variables.\n\nAvailabilityNIMAAs official release and the beta update are available on CRAN and Github, respectively.

    "abstract": "Synonymous mutations, which change only the DNA sequence but not the encoded protein sequence, can affect protein structure and function, mRNA maturation, and mRNA half-lives. The possibility that synonymous mutations can act as cancer drivers has been explored in several recent studies. However, none of these studies control for all three levels (patient, histology, and gene) of mutational heterogeneity that are known to affect the accurate identification of non-synonymous cancer drivers. Here, we create an algorithm, MutSigCVsyn, an adaptation of MutSigCV, to identify synonymous cancer drivers based on a novel non-coding background model that takes into account the mutational heterogeneity across these levels. Examining 2,572 PCAWG cancer whole-genome sequences, MutSigCVsyn identifies 30 novel synonymous drivers that include mutations in promising candidates like BCL-2. By bringing the best practices in non-synonymous driver identification to the analysis of synonymous drivers, these are promising candidates for future experimental study.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe Temporal Response Function (TRF) is a linear model of neural activity time-locked to continuous stimuli, including continuous speech. TRFs based on speech envelopes typically have distinct components that have provided remarkable insights into the cortical processing of speech. However, current methods may lead to less than reliable estimates of single-subject TRF components. Here, we compare two established methods, in TRF component estimation, and also propose novel algorithms that utilize prior knowledge of these components, bypassing the full TRF estimation.\n\nMethodsWe compared two established algorithms, ridge and boosting, and two novel algorithms based on Subspace Pursuit (SP) and Expectation Maximization (EM), which directly estimate TRF components given plausible assumptions regarding component characteristics. Single-channel, multi-channel, and source-localized TRFs were fit on simulations and real magnetoencephalographic data. Performance metrics included model fit and component estimation accuracy.\n\nResultsBoosting and ridge have comparable performance in component estimation. The novel algorithms outperformed the others in simulations, but not on real data, possibly due to the plausible assumptions not actually being met. Ridge had slightly better model fits on real data compared to boosting, but also more spurious TRF activity.\n\nConclusionResults indicate that both smooth (ridge) and sparse (boosting) algorithms perform comparably at TRF component estimation. The SP and EM algorithms may be accurate, but rely on assumptions of component characteristics.\n\nSignificanceThis systematic comparison establishes the suitability of widely used and novel algorithms for estimating robust TRF components, which is essential for improved subject-specific investigations into the cortical processing of speech.",

    "abstract": "The brain integrates streams of sensory input and builds accurate predictions, while arriving at stable percepts under disparate time scales. This stochastic process bears different dynamics for different people, yet statistical learning (SL) currently averages out, as noise, individual fluctuations in data streams registered from the brain as the person learns. We here adopt the motor systems perspective to reframe SL. Specifically, we rethink this problem using the demands that the persons brain faces to predict, and control variations in biorhythmic activity akin to those present in bodily motions. This new approach harnesses gross data as the important signals, to reassess how individuals learn predictive information in stable and unstable environments. We find two types of learners: narrow-variance learners, who retain explicit knowledge of the regularity embedded in the stimuli -the goal. They seem to use an error-correction strategy steadily present in both stable and unstable cases. In contrast, broad-variance learners emerge only in the unstable environment. They undergo an initial period of memoryless learning characterized by a gamma process that starts out exponentially distributed but converges to Gaussian. We coin this mode exploratory, preceding the more general error-correction mode characterized by skewed-to-symmetric distributions and higher signal content from the start. Our work demonstrates that statistical learning is a highly dynamic and stochastic process, unfolding at different time scales, and evolving distinct learning strategies on demand.",

The PPI network map reveals convergent pathways, including mitochondrial/metabolic processes, Wnt signaling, and MAPK signaling. CRISPR knockout reveal an association between mitochondrial activity and ASD-risk genes. The PPI network shows an enrichment of 112 additional ASD-risk genes and differentially expressed genes from post-mortem ASD patients. Clustering of risk genes based on PPI networks identifies gene groups corresponding to clinical behavior score severity.

    "abstract": "The dental system of ceratopsids is among the most specialized structure in Dinosauria, and includes high angled wear surfaces, split tooth roots, and multiple teeth in each tooth family. However, the early evolution of this unique dental system is generally poorly understood due to a lack of knowledge of the dental morphology and development in early-diverging ceratopsians. Here we study the dental system of three of the earliest-diverging Chinese ceratopsians: Yinlong and Hualianceratops from the early Late Jurassic of Xinjiang, and Chaoyangsaurus from the Late Jurassic of Liaoning. By using micro-computed tomographic analyses, our study has revealed significant new information regarding the dental system of these early ceratopsians, including no more than five replacement teeth in each jaw quadrant; at most one generation of replacement teeth in each alveolus; nearly full resorption of the functional tooth root during tooth replacement; and occlusion with low-angled, concave wear facets that differs significantly from the shearing occlusal system seen in ceratopsids. Yinlong displays an increase in the number of maxillary tooth alveoli and a decrease in the number of replacement teeth during ontogeny as well as the retention of remnants of functional teeth in the largest individual. Early-diverging ceratopsians thus display a relatively slow tooth replacement rate compared to late-diverging ceratopsians. Combined with paleobotany and palaeoenvironment data, Yinlong likely uses gastroliths to triturate foodstuffs, and the difference in diet strategy might have influenced the pattern of tooth replacement in later-diverging ceratopsians.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory-based research is resource intensive in terms of financial costs and its carbon footprint. Research laboratories require immense amounts of energy to power equipment, as well as large volumes of materials, particularly of single-use item consumption. In fact, many laboratories have essentially become reliant on single-use plastics. Understanding the full carbon footprint of consumable usage is increasingly important as many research institutes commit to carbon neutrality. To date, no carbon footprint assessment has been conducted to detail the differences between single-use plastics, and reusable glass in a laboratory setting. Here, we analyse the CO2 equivalent (CO2e) footprint of utilising single-use plastics, and re-use of glass or plastic items within laboratory environments. We focused our assessment on four commonly utilised consumables for mammalian cell and bacterial culture, and found that re-use scenarios resulted in substantial reduction in CO2e footprint up to 11-fold. In addition, we estimated the long-term financial costs of re-use and single-use scenarios, and found that re-use had either similar or much lower running costs even when including technical staff wage. We concluded that research facilities must foster re-use in laboratory consumables, while reserving single-use items for select, defined cases. Our study highlights the need to account for indirect CO2e footprint in designing a carbon-neutral lab.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic rodent models for human diseases have been widely used over the past 50 years and are a mainstay of many biomedical research programs. Oftentimes the sequence of the transgenic segment of DNA is carefully designed but incorporation of this DNA into the host genome is less well understood. Structural variation and insertional mutagenesis may occur at transgenic insertion sites. Here, we present a robust workflow including identification of the transgene locus via selective Illumina sequencing followed by Cas9-mediated target DNA enrichment of the locus, which successfully identified beginning and end sites of a large transgenic insertion into a murine model for human amylin-induced type II diabetes. Enriched sequences were mapped via Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Although the insertion was too long for a single mapped genetic sequence to encompass, the method provided multiple insights relevant to the animal model: a minimum number of forward- and reverse-facing transcript copies as well as characterization of an inversion point within the insertion site. The insertion start point containing both murine and human DNA was used to identify and separate animals hemizygous for the transgenic insertion from homozygous animals. This identification could be performed early in the rodent life cycle prior to maturation (i.e. breeding age), thus allowing for management of colony phenotypes and eliminating the need to \"genotype by phenotype\" later on (onset of amylin-induced type II diabetes does not occur until ~8-10 weeks of age for this model). We further confirmed our homozygous diabetic mice function the same as colonies established in other labs and present full antibody and fluorescent-staining protocols (available in SI). Lastly, we note that, due to our genotyping, a novel animal was identified within our colony: non-diabetic homozygous mice. Indeed, only 37% of homozygous mice bred in our colony became diabetic.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARY (for broad audience)Transgenic rodent models are important to studying human diseases. When creating a new rodent model, one may insert new DNA into a well-characterized background genome. However, it is oftentimes not known where the new DNA was incorporated, how many times it was incorporated, or if any coding sequences or regulatory elements within native DNA were disrupted. Here, we have developed a method to characterize transgenic animals, and have applied it to a popular model for studying human amylin-induced type II diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Humans display great versatility when performing goal-directed tasks while walking. However, the extent to which such versatility helps with fall avoidance remains unclear. We recently demonstrated a functional connection between the motor regulation needed to achieve task goals (e.g. maintaining walking speed) and a simple walkers ability to reject large disturbances. Here, for the same model, we identify the viability kernel--the state space region in which the walker can step forever via at least one sequence of push-off inputs per state. We further find that only a few basins of attraction of the speed-regulated walkers steady-state gaits can fully cover the viability kernel. This highlights a potentially important role of task-level motor regulation in fall avoidance. Therefore, we posit an adaptive hierarchical control/regulation strategy that switches between different task-level regulators to avoid falls. Our hierarchical task switching controller only requires a target value of the regulated observable--a  task switch--at each walking step, each chosen from a small, predetermined collection. Because humans have typically already learned to perform such tasks during nominal walking conditions, this suggests that the  information cost of biologically implementing such controllers for the nervous system, including cognitive demands in humans, could be relatively low.",

Inferring CNAs from cancer genomic data could help shed light on the initiation, progression, and potential treatment of cancer. While such data have traditionally been available via \"bulk sequencing\", the more recently introduced techniques for single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) provide the type of data that makes CNA inference possible at the single-cell resolution.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a new birth-death evolutionary model of CNAs as well as a Bayesian method, NestedBD, for the inference of evolutionary trees (topologies and branch lengths with relative mutation rates) from single-cell data under this model. We assessed the accuracy of our method on both simulated and biological data and compared it to the accuracy of two standard phylogenetic tools, namely neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony (MP). We show through simulations that our method infers more accurate topologies and branch lengths. We also studied the ancestral state reconstruction accuracy with the birth-death evolutionary model and found it outperformed MP. Finally, running all three methods on a colorectal cancer data set, we observed that among all three methods, only the phylogeny inferred by NestedBD clearly separated the primary tumor cells from the metastatic ones, providing a more plausible history of the tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "Human myelin disorders are commonly studied in mouse models. Since both clades evolutionarily diverged approximately 85 million years ago, it is critical to know to what extent the myelin protein composition has remained similar. Here we use quantitative proteomics to analyze myelin purified from human white matter and find that the relative abundance of the structural myelin proteins PLP, MBP, CNP and SEPTIN8 correlates well with that in C57Bl/6N- mice. Conversely, multiple other proteins were identified exclusively or predominantly in human or mouse myelin. This is exemplified by peripheral myelin protein-2 (PMP2), which was specific to human CNS myelin, while tetraspanin-2 (TSPAN2) and connexin-29 (CX29/GJC3) were confined to mouse myelin. Assessing published scRNA-seq-datasets, human and mouse oligodendrocytes display well-correlating transcriptome profiles but divergent expression of distinct genes including Pmp2, Tspan2 and Gjc3. Species-dependent diversity of oligodendroglial mRNA-expression and myelin protein composition can be informative when translating from mouse models to humans.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUbiquitination is widely involved in protein homeostasis and cell signaling. Ubiquitin E3 ligases are critical regulators of ubiquitination that recognize and recruit specific ubiquitination targets for the final rate-limiting step of ubiquitin transfer reactions. Understanding the ubiquitin E3 ligase ac-tivities will provide knowledge in the upstream regulator of the ubiquitination pathway and reveal po-tential mechanisms in biological processes and disease progression. Recent advances in mass spec-trometry-based proteomics have enabled deep profiling of ubiquitylome in a quantitative manner. Yet, functional analysis of ubiquitylome dynamics and pathway activity remains challenging.\n\nResultsHere, we developed a UbE3-APA, a computational algorithm and stand-alone python-based software for Ub E3 ligase Activity Profiling Analysis. Combining an integrated annotation database with statistical analysis, UbE3-APA identifies significantly activated or suppressed E3 ligases based on quantitative ubiquitylome proteomics datasets. Benchmarking the software with published quantitative ubiquitylome analysis confirms the genetic manipulation of SPOP enzyme activity through overexpres-sion and mutation. Application of the algorithm in the re-analysis of a large cohort of ubiquitination proteomics study revealed the activation of PARKIN and the co-activation of other E3 ligases in mito-chondria depolarization-induced mitophagy process. We further demonstrated the application of the algorithm in the DIA-based quantitative ubiquitylome analysis.\n\nAvailabilitySource code and binaries are freely available for download at URL: https://github.com/Chenlab-UMN/Ub-E3-ligase-Activity-Profiling-Analysis, implemented in python and supported on Linux and MS Windows\n\nContactyuechen@umn.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available.",

    "abstract": "Aging affects iron homeostasis, as evidenced by tissue iron loading and toxicity and common anemia in the elderly. Iron needs in mammals are met primarily by iron-recycling from senescent red blood cells (RBCs), a task chiefly accomplished by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) via erythrophagocytosis. Given that RPMs continuously process iron, their cellular functions might be susceptible to age-dependent decline, a condition that has been largely unexplored to date. Here, we found that 10-11-months-old female mice exhibit iron loading, diminished lysosomal activity, and decreased erythrophagocytosis rate in RPMs. These impairments lead to the retention of senescent hemolytic RBCs in the spleen, and the formation of undegradable iron- and heme-rich extracellular protein aggregates, likely derived from ferroptotic RPMs. We further found that feeding mice an iron-reduced diet alleviates iron accumulation in RPMs, enhances their ability to clear erythrocytes, and limits ferroptosis. Consequently, this diet ameliorates hemolysis of splenic RBCs and the formation of iron-rich aggregates, increasing serum iron availability in aging mice. Using RPM-like cells, we show that the diminished iron-recycling capacity of RPMs is underlain by iron accumulation and reduced expression of heme-catabolizing enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Taken together, we identified RPM collapse as an early hallmark of aging and demonstrated that dietary iron reduction improves iron turnover efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, is the most common sensory deficit globally, and the biggest modifiable risk factor for a later dementia diagnosis. Despite its ubiquity, however, the primary pathology contributing to presbycusis is reportedly contentious, particularly the relative role of damage to the sensory outer hair cells compared to the stria vascularis, an important inner ear structure that maintains the ionic concentration of inner ear fluids that surround it. To determine what might be the \"dogma\" of the field regarding the primary pathology in presbycusis, we conducted an online Google survey (https://forms.gle/GPreoePmRxBBkchc7) asking relevant respondents in the field their opinions on the matter. In Question (Q1), respondents were asked to rate  in your opinion from  least likely to  most likely (on a scale 1 to 4 [being  most likely])  what is the primary pathology contributing to presbycusis? in terms of  damage to: i) the inner hair cells, ii) outer hair cells (OHCs), iii) spiral ganglion, iv) stria vascularis. The term  dogma suggests that the proportion of people in the field who believe that the main cause of presbycusis is damage to the stria vascularis is at least 50%. The results of our survey estimated this proportion to be 19/101 = 0.188 (95% CI [0.124 0.275]) and a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that this proportion is at least 0.5 was rejected (p < 10-10). When it came to opining what  other professionals in the field consider to be the primary pathology contributing to presbycusis (Q2), the tendency to rank  damage to OHCs as being the primary pathology was 45%. Stria vascularis was least likely to be ranked 4 (11%) by professionals in the field opining about the beliefs of others. Even when  noise damage was excluded as a factor (Q3), the  most likely contributing factor to presbycusis was stated to be damage to the OHCs (42%). Our data suggest the dogma of the field is that damage to outer hair cells is the primary pathology in presbycusis.",

    "abstract": "Organisms with complex life cycles demonstrate a remarkable ability to change their phenotypes across development, presumably as an evolutionary adaptation to developmentally variable environments. Developmental variation in environmentally sensitive performance, and thermal sensitivity in particular, has been well documented in holometabolous insects. For example, thermal performance in adults and juvenile stages exhibit little genetic correlation (genetic decoupling) and can evolve independently, resulting in divergent thermal responses. Yet, we understand very little about how this genetic decoupling occurs. We tested the hypothesis that genetic decoupling of thermal physiology is driven by fundamental differences in physiology between life stages, despite a potentially conserved Cellular Stress Response. We used RNAseq to compare transcript expression in response to a cold stressor in Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults and used RNAi (RNA interference) to test whether knocking down nine target genes differentially affected larval and adult cold tolerance. Transcriptomic responses of whole larvae and adults during and following exposure to -5{degrees}C were largely unique both in identity of responding transcripts and in temporal dynamics. Further, we found no relationship between stage-specificity and tissue-specificity of transcripts, suggesting that the differences are not simply driven by differences in tissue composition across development. In addition, RNAi of target genes resulted in largely stage-specific and sometimes sex-specific effects on cold tolerance. The combined evidence suggests that thermal physiology is largely stage-specific at the level of gene expression, and thus natural selection may be acting on different loci during the independent thermal adaptation of different life stages.\n\nSummary StatementRNAseq and gene knockout via transgenic RNAi lines suggest that physiological responses to low temperatures are largely distinct across life stages of the fly Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Pain is not only a perceptual phenomenon, but also a preeminent learning signal. In reinforcement learning models, prediction errors (PEs) play a crucial role, i.e. the mismatch between expectation and sensory input. In particular, advanced learning models require the representation of different types of PEs, namely signed PEs (whether more or less pain was expected) to specify the direction of learning, and unsigned PEs (the absolute deviation from an expectation) to adapt the learning rate. The insula has been shown to play an important role in pain intensity coding and in signaling surprise. However, mainly unsigned PEs could be identified in the anterior insula. It remains an open question whether these PEs are specific to pain, and whether signed PEs are also represented in the insula.\n\nTo answer these questions, 47 subjects learned associations of two conditioned stimuli (CS) with four unconditioned stimuli (US; painful heat or loud sound, of one low and one high intensity each) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and skin conductance response (SCR) measurements. CS-US associations reversed multiple times between intensities and between sensory modalities, generating frequent PEs.\n\nSCRs indicated comparable nonspecific characteristics of the two modalities. fMRI analyses focusing on the insular and opercular cortices contralateral to painful stimulation showed that activation in the anterior insula correlated with unsigned intensity PEs. Importantly, this unsigned PE signal was similar for pain and aversive sounds and also modality PEs, indicating an unspecific aversive surprise signal. Conversely, signed pain intensity PE signals were modality-specific and located in the dorsal posterior insula, an area previously implicated in pain intensity processing.\n\nPrevious studies have identified abnormal insula function and abnormal learning as potential causes of pain chronification. Our findings link these results and suggest one potential mechanism, namely a misrepresentation of learning relevant prediction errors in the insular cortex.",

Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a reversible, covalent inhibitor targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the active protease inhibitor in PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets). We evaluated the in vitro catalytic activity and in vitro potency of nirmatrelvir against the main protease (Mpro) of prevalent variants of concern (VOC) or variants of interest (VOI): Alpha (, B.1.1.7), Beta ({beta}, B.1.351), Delta ({delta}, B1.617.2), Gamma ({gamma}, P.1), Lambda ({lambda}, B.1.1.1.37/C37), Omicron (o, B.1.1.529) as well as the original Washington or wildtype strain. These VOC/VOI carry prevalent mutations at varying frequencies in the Mpro specifically for: , {beta},{gamma} (K90R), {lambda} (G15S) and o (P132H). In vitro biochemical enzymatic assay characterization of the enzyme kinetics of the mutant Mpros demonstrate that they are catalytically comparable to wildtype. Nirmatrelvir has similar potency against each mutant Mpro including P132H that is observed in the Omicron variant with a Ki of 0.635 nM as compared to a Ki of 0.933nM for wildtype. The molecular basis for these observations were provided by solution-phase structural dynamics and structural determination of nirmatrelvir bound to the o, {lambda} and {beta} Mpro at 1.63 - 2.09 [A] resolution. These in vitro data suggest that PAXLOVID has the potential to maintain plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir many-fold times higher than the amount required to stop the SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI, including Omicron, from replicating in cells (1).",

As of January 2021, the WHO has defined five  variants of concern (VOC): B.1.1.7 (Alpha, ), B.1.351 (Beta, {beta}), P.1 (Gamma, {gamma}), B.1.617.2 (Delta, {delta}), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron, o). To provide a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 and variants, Nirmatrelvir, the antiviral component of PAXLOVID, an oral outpatient treatment recently authorized for conditional or emergency use treatment of COVID-19, was developed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a specific inhibitor of coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also referred to as 3CLpro), with potent antiviral activity against several human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS (Owen et al, Science 2021. doi: 10.1126/science.abl4784).

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is emerging as key physical principle for biological organization inside living cells, forming condensates that play important roles in the regulation of multiple functions. Inside living nuclei, transcription factor (TF) condensates regulate transcriptional initiation and amplify transcriptional output of expressed genes. Yet, the biophysical parameters controlling TF condensation are still poorly understood. Here we applied a battery of single molecule imaging tools, theory and simulations to investigate the physical properties of TF condensates of the Progesterone Receptor (PR) in vivo. Analysis of individual PR trajectories at different ligand concentrations showed marked signatures of a ligand-tunable and regulated LLPS process. Using a machine learning architecture, we uncovered that diffusion within condensates follows fractional Brownian motion, reflecting viscoelastic interactions between PR and chromatin within condensates. High density single molecule localization maps further revealed that condensate growth dynamics is dominated by Brownian motion coalescence (BMC) at shorter times, but deviate at longer timescales reaching a growth plateau with nanoscale condensate sizes. To understand our observations we developed an extension of the BMC model by including stochastic unbinding of particles within condensates. The model reproduced the BMC behavior together with finite condensate sizes a steady-state, fully recapitulating our experimental data. Our results are thus consistent with droplet growth dynamics being regulated by the escaping probability of TFs molecules from condensates. The interplay between condensation assembly and molecular escaping maintains an optimum physical condensate size. Such phenomena must have implications for the biophysical regulation of other TF condensates and could also operate in multiple biological scenarios.",

    "abstract": "How SARS-CoV-2 causes the observed range of clinical manifestations and disease severity remains poorly understood. SARS-CoV-2 encodes for two proteases (3CLPro and PLPro), vital for viral production, but also promiscuous with respect to host protein targets, likely contributing to the range of disease. Pharmacological inhibition of the 3C-like3 protease has revealed remarkable reduction in hospitalization and death in phase 2/3 clinical studies. However, the mechanisms responsible for the pathology mediated by those proteases are still unclear. In this study, we develop a bioinformatic algorithm, leveraging experimental data from SARS-CoV, to predict host cleavage targets of the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease, or 3CLPro. We capture targets of the 3CL protease described previously for SARS-CoV, and we identify hundreds of new putative targets. We experimentally validate a number of these predicted targets, including the giant sarcomeric protein Obscurin, and show that expression of 3CL protease alone recapitulates the sarcomeric disorganization seen by SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Our data provide a resource to identify putative host cleavage targets of 3CL protease that contribute to mechanisms and heterogeneity of disease in COVID-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have become a major public health concern due to increased transmissibility, and escape from natural immunity, vaccine protection, and monoclonal antibody therapeutics. The highly transmissible Omicron variant has up to 32 mutations within the spike protein, many more than previous variants, heightening these concerns of immune escape. There are now multiple antiviral therapeutics that have received approval for emergency use by the FDA and target both the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the main protease (Mpro), which have accumulated fewer mutations in known SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we test nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), and other clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the novel Omicron variant, in live-virus antiviral assays. We confirm that nirmatrelvir and other clinically relevant antivirals all maintain activity against all variants tested, including Omicron.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) could cause significant human and economic damage owing to increased infectivity and transmissibility, and understanding their characteristics is crucial for infection control. Here, we analyzed differences in viral stability and disinfection efficacy between the Wuhan strain and all VOCs. On plastic and skin surfaces, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants exhibited more than two-fold longer survival than the Wuhan strain, and the Omicron variant had the longest survival time. Specifically, survival times of the Wuhan strain, Alpha variant, Beta variant, Gamma variant, Delta variant, and Omicron variant on skin surfaces were 8.6 h (95% CI, 6.5-10.9 h), 19.6 h (95% CI, 14.8-25.3 h), 19.1 h (95% CI, 13.9- 25.3 h), 11.0 h (95% CI, 8.1-14.7 h), 16.8 h (95% CI, 13.1-21.1 h), and 21.1 h (95% CI, 15.8- 27.6 h), respectively. In vitro, disinfectant effectiveness evaluations showed that Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron were slightly more resistant to ethanol than the Wuhan strain. However, ex vivo evaluation showed that on human skin, all viruses were completely inactivated by exposure to 35 w/w % ethanol for 15 s. The high environmental stability of these VOCs could increase transmission risk and contribute to spread. Additionally, the Omicron variant might have been replaced by the Delta variant due to its increased environmental stability and rapid spread. To prevent VOC spread, it is highly recommended that current infection control practices use disinfectants with appropriate ethanol concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The viral genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), particularly its cell-binding spike protein gene, has undergone rapid evolution during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Variants including Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 now seriously threaten the efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines that target the spike protein. Viral evolution over a much longer timescale has generated a wide range of genetically distinct sarbecoviruses in animal populations, including the pandemic viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. The genetic diversity and widespread zoonotic potential of this group complicates current attempts to develop drugs in preparation for the next sarbecovirus pandemic. Receptor-based decoy inhibitors can target a wide range of viral strains with a common receptor and may have intrinsic resistance to escape mutant generation and antigenic drift. We previously generated an affinity-matured decoy inhibitor based on the receptor target of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and deployed it in a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) for intranasal delivery and passive prophylaxis against COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate the exceptional binding and neutralizing potency of this ACE2 decoy against SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2. Tight decoy binding tracks with human ACE2 binding of viral spike receptor-binding domains across diverse clades of coronaviruses. Furthermore, in a coronavirus that cannot bind human ACE2, a variant that acquired human ACE2 binding was bound by the decoy with nanomolar affinity. Considering these results, we discuss a strategy of decoy-based treatment and passive protection to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future airway virus threats.\n\nAuthor SummaryViral sequences can change dramatically during pandemics lasting multiple years. Likewise, evolution over centuries has generated genetically diverse virus families posing similar threats to humans. This variation presents a challenge to drug development, in both the breadth of achievable protection against related groups of viruses and the durability of therapeutic agents or vaccines during extended outbreaks. This phenomenon has played out dramatically during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The highly divergent Omicron variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have upended previous gains won by vaccine and monoclonal antibody development. Moreover, ecological surveys have increasingly revealed a broad class of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in animals, each poised to cause a future human pandemic. Here, we evaluate an alternative to antibody-based protection and prevention--a decoy molecule based on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Our engineered decoy has proven resistant to SARS-CoV-2 evolution during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and can neutralize all variants of concern, including Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2. Furthermore, the decoy binds tightly to a broad class of sarbecoviruses related to pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, indicating that receptor decoys offer advantages over monoclonal antibodies and may be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic and future coronavirus outbreaks to prevent and treat severe illness.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been fueled by novel variants of concern (VOC) that have increased transmissibility, receptor binding affinity, and other properties that enhance disease. The goal of this study is to characterize unique pathogenesis of the Delta VOC strain in the K18-hACE2-mouse challenge model. Challenge studies suggested that the lethal dose of Delta was higher than Alpha or Beta strains. To characterize the differences in the Delta strains pathogenesis, a time-course experiment was performed to evaluate the overall host response to Alpha or Delta variant challenge. qRT-PCR analysis of Alpha- or Delta- challenged mice revealed no significant difference between viral RNA burden in the lung, nasal wash or brain. However, histopathological analysis revealed high lung tissue inflammation and cell infiltration following Delta- but not Alpha-challenge at day 6. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines were highest at day 6 in Delta-challenged mice suggesting enhanced pneumonia. Total RNA-sequencing analysis of lungs comparing infected to uninfected mice revealed that Alpha-challenged mice have more total genes differentially activated, conversely, Delta-challenged mice have a higher magnitude of differential gene expression. Delta-challenged mice have increased interferon-dependent gene expression and IFN-{gamma} production compared to Alpha. Analysis of TCR clonotypes suggested that Delta challenged mice have increased T-cell infiltration compared to Alpha challenged. Our data suggest that Delta has evolved to engage interferon responses in a manner that may enhance pathogenesis. The in vivo and in silico observations of this study underscore the need to conduct experiments with VOC strains to best model COVID-19 when evaluating therapeutics and vaccines.\n\nImportanceThe Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is known to be more transmissible and cause severe disease in human hosts due to mutations in its genome that are divergent from previous variants of concern (VOC). Our study evaluates the pathogenesis of Delta in the K18-hACE2 mouse model compared to the Alpha VOC. We observed that relative to Alpha, Delta challenge results in enhanced inflammation and tissue damage with stronger antiviral responses. These observations provide insight into Deltas unique pathogenesis.",
