    "abstract": "BackgroundThe eukaryotic genome is capable of producing multiple isoforms from a gene by alternative polyadenylation (APA) during pre-mRNA processing. APA in the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of mRNA produces transcripts with shorter or longer 3-UTR. Often, 3-UTR serves as a binding platform for microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, which affect the fate of the mRNA transcript. Thus, 3-UTR APA is known to modulate translation and provides a mean to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Current bioinformatics pipelines have limited capability in profiling 3-UTR APA events due to incomplete annotations and a low-resolution analyzing power: widely available bioinformatics pipelines do not reference actionable polyadenylation (cleavage) sites but simulate 3-UTR APA only using RNA-seq read coverage, causing false positive identifications. To overcome these limitations, we developed APA-Scan, a robust program that identifies 3-UTR APA events and visualizes the RNA-seq short-read coverage with gene annotations.\n\nMethodsAPA-Scan utilizes either predicted or experimentally validated actionable polyadenylation signals as a reference for polyadenylation sites and calculates the quantity of long and short 3-UTR transcripts in the RNA-seq data. APA-Scan works in three major steps: (i) calculate the read coverage of the 3-UTR regions of genes; (ii) identify the potential APA sites and evaluate the significance of the events among two biological conditions; (iii) graphical representation of user specific event with 3-UTR annotation and read coverage on the 3-UTR regions. APA-Scan is implemented in Python3. Source code and a comprehensive users manual are freely available at https://github.com/compbiolabucf/APA-Scan.\n\nResultAPA-Scan was applied to both simulated and real RNA-seq datasets and compared with two widely used baselines DaPars and APAtrap. In simulation APA-Scan significantly improved the accuracy of 3-UTR APA identification compared to the other baselines. The performance of APA-Scan was also validated by 3-end-seq data and qPCR on mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. The experiments confirm that APA-Scan can detect unannotated 3 -UTR APA events and improve genome annotation.\n\nConclusionAPA-Scan is a comprehensive computational pipeline to detect transcriptome-wide 3-UTR APA events. The pipeline integrates both RNA-seq and 3-end-seq data information and can efficiently identify the significant events with a high-resolution short reads coverage plots.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle plays a central role in the regulation of systemic metabolism during lifespan. With aging, muscle mediated metabolic homeostasis is perturbed, contributing to the onset of multiple chronic diseases. Our knowledge on the mechanisms responsible for this age-related perturbation is limited, as it is difficult to distinguish between correlation and causality of molecular changes in muscle aging. Glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase 1 (GPCPD1) is a highly abundant muscle enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the lipid glycerophosphocholine (GPC). The physiological function of GPCPD1 remained largely unknown. Here, we report that the GPCPD1-GPC metabolic pathway is dramatically perturbed in the aged muscle. Muscle-specific inactivation of Gpcpd1 resulted in severely affected glucose metabolism, without affecting muscle development. This pathology was muscle specific and did not occur in white fat-, brown fat- and liver-deficient Gpcpd1 deficient mice. Moreover, in the muscle specific mutant mice, glucose intolerance was markedly accelerated under high sugar and high fat diet. Mechanistically, Gpcpd1 deficiency results in accumulation of GPC, without any other significant changes in the global lipidome. This causes an \"aged-like\" transcriptomic signature in young Gpcpd1 deficient muscles and impaired insulin signaling. Finally, we report that GPC levels are markedly perturbed in muscles from both aged humans and patients with Type 2 diabetes, with a high correlation between GPC levels and increased chronological age. Our findings show the novel and critical physiological function of GPCPD1-GPC metabolic pathway to glucose metabolism, and the perturbation of this pathway with aging, which may contribute to glucose intolerance in aging.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in almost all essential cellular processes. Perturbation of PPI networks plays critical roles in tumorigenesis, cancer progression and metastasis. While numerous high-throughput experiments have produced a vast amount of data for PPIs, these datasets suffer from high false positive rates and exhibit a high degree of discrepancy. Coevolution of amino acid positions between protein pairs has proven to be useful in identifying interacting proteins and providing structural details of the interaction interfaces with the help of deep learning methods like AlphaFold (AF). In this study, we applied AF to investigate the cancer protein-protein interactome. We predicted 1,798 PPIs for cancer driver proteins involved in diverse cellular processes such as transcription regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair and cell cycle. We modeled the spatial structure for the predicted binary protein complexes, 1,087 of which lacked previous 3D structure information. Our predictions offer novel structural insight into many cancer-related processes such as the MAP kinase cascade and Fanconi anemia pathway. We further investigated the cancer mutation landscape by mapping somatic missense mutations (SMMs) in cancer to the predicted PPI interfaces and performing enrichment and depletion analyses. Interfaces enriched or depleted with SMMs exhibit different preferences for functional categories. Interfaces enriched in mutations tend to function in pathways that are deregulated in cancers and they may help explain the molecular mechanisms of cancers in patients; interfaces lacking mutations appear to be essential for the survival of cancer cells and thus may be future targets for PPI modulating drugs.",

    "abstract": "Language processing requires the integration of diverse sources of information across multiple levels of processing. A range of psycholinguistic properties have been documented in previous studies as having influence on brain activation during language processing. However, most of those studies have used factorial designs to probe the effect of one or two individual properties using highly controlled stimuli and experimental paradigms. Little is known about the neural correlates of psycholinguistic properties in more naturalistic discourse, especially during language production. The aim of our study is to explore the above issues in a rich fMRI dataset in which participants both listened to recorded passages of discourse and produced their own narrative discourse in response to prompts. Specifically, we measured 13 psycholinguistic properties of the discourse comprehended or produced by the participants, and we used principal components analysis (PCA) to address covariation in these properties and extract a smaller set of latent language characteristics. These latent components indexed vocabulary complexity, sensory-motor and emotional language content, discourse coherence and speech quantity. A parametric approach was adopted to study the effects of these psycholinguistic variables on brain activation during comprehension and production. We found that the pattern of effects across the cortex was somewhat convergent across comprehension and production. However, the degree of convergence varied across language properties, being strongest for the component indexing sensory-motor language content. We report the full, unthresholded effect maps for each psycholinguistic variable, as well as mapping how these effects change along a large-scale cortical gradient of brain function. We believe that our findings provide a valuable starting point for future, confirmatory studies of discourse processing.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of non-human animal species have been shown to be able to respond to human referential signals, such as pointing gestures. The aim of the present study was to replicate previous findings showing cats to be sensitive to human pointing cues (Miklosi et al. 2005). In our study, we presented two types of human pointing gestures - momentary ipsilateral (direct pointing) and momentary cross-body pointing. We tested nine rescue cats in a two-way object choice task. On a group level, the success rate of cats was 74.4 percent. Cats performed significantly above chance level in both the ipsilateral and cross-body pointing condition. Trial number, rewarded side and type of gesture did not significantly affect the cats performances in the experiment. On an individual level, 5 out of 7 cats who completed 20 trials, performed significantly above chance level. Two cats only completed 10 trials. One of them succeeded in 8, the other in 6 of these. The results of our study replicate previous findings of cats being responsive to human ipsilateral pointing cues and add additional knowledge about their ability to follow cross-body pointing cues. Our results highlight that a domestic species, socialised in a group setting, may possess heterospecific communication skills. Further research is needed to exclude alternative parsimonious explanations, such as local and stimulus enhancement.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome modulates host immunity and aids in maintenance of tolerance in the gut, where microbial and food-derived antigens are abundant. Modern lifestyle practices, including diet and antibiotic use, have depleted beneficial taxa, specifically butyrate-producing Clostridia. This depletion is associated with the rising incidence of food allergy, inflammatory bowel diseases, and other noncommunicable chronic diseases. Although butyrate is known to play important roles in regulating gut immunity and maintaining epithelial barrier function, its clinical translation is challenging due to its offensive odor and quick absorption in the upper gut. Here, we have developed two polymeric micelle systems, one with a neutral charge (NtL-ButM) and one with a negative charge (Neg-ButM) that release butyrate from their polymeric core in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract when administered intragastrically to mice. We show that these butyrate-containing micelles, used in combination, restore a barrier-protective response in mice treated with either dextran sodium sulfate or antibiotics. Moreover, butyrate micelle treatment protects peanut-allergic dysbiotic mice from an anaphylactic reaction to peanut challenge and rescues their antibiotic-induced dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of Clostridium Cluster XIVa. Butyrate micelle treatment also reduces the severity of colitis in a murine model. By restoring microbial and mucosal homeostasis, these butyrate-prodrug polymeric micelles may function as a new, antigen-agnostic approach for the treatment of allergic and inflammatory disease.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of shotgun proteomics data often involves generating lists of inferred peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and/or of peptides. The canonical approach for generating these discovery lists is by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), most commonly through target-decoy competition (TDC). At the PSM level, TDC is implemented by competing each spectrums best-scoring target (real) peptide match with its best match against a decoy database. This PSM-level procedure can be adapted to the peptide level by selecting the top-scoring PSM per peptide prior to FDR estimation. Here we first highlight and empirically augment a little-known previous work by He et al., which showed that TDC-based PSM-level FDR estimates can be liberally biased. We thus propose that researchers instead focus on peptide-level analysis. We then investigate three ways to carry out peptide-level TDC and show that the most common method (\"PSM-only\") offers the lowest statistical power in practice. An alternative approach that carries out a double competition, first at the PSM and then at the peptide level (\"PSM-and-peptide\"), is the most powerful method, yielding an average increase of 17% more discovered peptides at a 1% FDR threshold relative to the PSM-only method.",

The heterodimeric ABCG5/G8 carries out selective sterol excretion, preventing the abnormal accumulation of plant sterols in human bodies, while homodimeric ABCG1 contributes to the biogenesis and metabolism of high-density lipoproteins. A sterol-binding site on ABCG5/G8 was proposed at the interface of the transmembrane domain and the core of lipid bilayers. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of ABCG5/G8 in a cholesterol-bound state. The structure combined with amino acid sequence analysis shows that in the proximity of the sterol-binding site, a highly conserved phenylalanine array supports functional implications for ABCG cholesterol/sterol transporters. Lastly, in silico docking analysis of cholesterol and stigmasterol (a plant sterol) suggests sterol-binding selectivity on ABCG5/G8, but not ABCG1. Together, our results provide a structural basis for cholesterol binding on ABCG5/G8 and the sterol selectivity by ABCG transporters.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are promising drug targets for treating a wide range of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders, but their conserved active sites have complicated the design of selective therapeutics. This study examines the allosteric inhibition of PTP1B by amorphadiene (AD), a terpenoid hydrocarbon that is an unusually selective inhibitor. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations carried out in this study suggest that AD can stably sample multiple neighboring sites on the allosterically influential C-terminus of the catalytic domain. Binding to these sites requires a disordered 7 helix, which stabilizes the PTP1B-AD complex and may contribute to the selectivity of AD for PTP1B over TCPTP. Intriguingly, the binding mode of AD differs from that of the most well-studied allosteric inhibitor of PTP1B. Indeed, biophysical measurements and MD simulations indicate that the two molecules can bind simultaneously. Upon binding, both inhibitors destabilize the 7 helix and disrupt hydrogen bonds that facilitate closure of the catalytically essential WPD loop. These findings indicate that AD is a promising scaffold for building allosteric inhibitors of PTP1B and illustrate, more broadly, how unfunctionalized terpenoids can engage in specific interactions with protein surfaces.",

Models of learning typically postulate that observations that deviate from the learned predictions are surprising and used to update those predictions. Bayesian accounts further posit the existence of a confidence-weighting mechanism: learning should be modulated by the confidence level that accompanies those predictions. However, the neural bases of this confidence are much less known than the ones of surprise. Here, we used a dynamic probability learning task and high-field MRI to identify putative cortical regions involved in the representation of confidence about predictions during human learning. We devised a stringent test based on the conjunction of four criteria. We localized several regions in parietal and frontal cortices whose activity is sensitive to the confidence of an ideal observer, specifically so with respect to potential confounds (surprise and predictability), and in a way that is invariant to which item is predicted. We also tested for functionality in two ways. First, we localized regions whose activity patterns at the subject level showed an effect of both confidence and surprise in qualitative agreement with the confidence-weighting principle. Second, we found neural representations of ideal confidence that also accounted for subjective confidence. Taken together, those results identify a set of cortical regions potentially implicated in the confidence-weighting of learning.",

    "abstract": "Birds of the order Passeriformes represent the most speciose radiation of land vertebrates, yet the cause or causes of their elevated species richness have not been satisfactorily explained. One potential key adaptation is their sole lineage-specific gene, a duplicate copy of growth hormone (GH), present in all major lineages of passerines, but in no other group of birds. Growth hormone genes plausibly influence extreme life history traits that passerines exhibit, including the shortest embryo-to-fledging developmental period of any avian order. To unravel the implications of this GH duplication, we investigated the molecular evolution of the ancestral avian GH gene (GH or GH1) and the novel passerine GH paralog (GH2), using 497 gene sequences extracted from 342 genomes. Passerine GH1 and GH2 are reciprocally monophyletic, consistent with a single duplication event from a microchromosome onto a macrochromosome in a common ancestor of extant passerines. Additional chromosomal rearrangements have changed the syntenic and potential regulatory context of these genes. Both passerine GH1 and GH2 paralogs display substantially higher rates of nonsynonymous codon change than non-passerine avian GH, suggesting positive selection following duplication. A site involved in signal peptide cleavage is under selection in both paralogs. Other sites under positive selection differ between the two paralogs, but many are clustered in one region of a 3D model of the protein. Both paralogs retain key functional features and are actively but differentially expressed in two major passerine suborders. These phenomena suggest that growth hormone genes may be evolving novel adaptive roles in passerine birds.",

    "abstract": "The macronutrient phosphorus is essential for plant growth and development. Plants have evolved multiple strategies to increase the efficiency of Pi acquisition to protect themselves from Pi starvation. However, the crosstalk between Pi homeostasis and plant development remains to be explored. Here, we report that overexpressing microRNA399 in maize induced a premature aging syndrome after pollination. Knockout of ZmPHO2, one of the miR399 targets, resulted in a similar premature aging phenotype. Strikingly, we found that INDETERMINATE1 (ID1), a floral transition regulator, inhibits the transcription of ZmMIR399 genes by directly binding to their promoters, alleviating the repression of ZmPHO2 by miR399 and ultimately contributing to the maintenance of Pi homeostasis in maize. Unlike ZmMIR399 genes, whose expression is induced by Pi deficiency, ID1 expression is independent of the Pi status, indicating that ID1 is an autonomous regulator of Pi homeostasis. Furthermore, we found that ZmPHO2 was under selection during maize domestication, resulting in a more sensitive response to phosphate starvation in temperate maize than in tropical maize. Our study reveals a direct functional link between Pi-deprivation sensing by the miR399-ZmPHO2 regulatory module and plant developmental regulation by ID1.",

    "abstract": "Breadfruit is a common tree species in Taiwan. In the indigenous Austronesian Amis culture of eastern Taiwan,  breadfruit is known as Pacilo, and its fruits are consumed as food. On Lanyu (Botel Tobago) where the indigenous Yami people live,  breadfruit is called Cipoho and used for constructing houses and plank-boats. Elsewhere in Taiwan,  breadfruit is also a common ornamental tree. As an essential component of traditional Yami culture, Cipoho has long been assumed to have been transported from the Batanes Island of the Philippines to Lanyu. As such, it represents a commensal species that potentially can be used to test the hypothesis of the northward Austronesian migration  into Taiwan. However, recent phylogenomic studies using target enrichment show that Taiwanese  breadfruit might not be the same as the Pacific breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) that was domesticated in Oceania and widely cultivated throughout the tropics. To resolve persistent misidentification of this culturally and economically important tree species of Taiwan, we sampled 36 trees of Taiwanese Artocarpus and used the Moraceae probe set to enrich 529 nuclear genes. Along with 28 archived Artocarpus sequence datasets (representing a dozen taxa from all subgenera), phylogenomic analyses showed that all Taiwanese  breadfruit samples, together with a cultivated ornamental tree from Hawaii, form a fully supported clade within the A. treculianus complex, which is composed only of endemic Philippine species. Morphologically, the Taiwanese  breadfruit matches the characters of A. treculianus. Within the Taiwanese samples of A. treculianus, Amis samples form a fully supported clade derived from within the paraphyletic grade composed of Yami samples, suggesting a Lanyu origin. Results of our target enrichment phylogenomics are consistent with the scenario that Cipoho was transported northward from the Philippines to Lanyu by Yami ancestors, though the possibility that A. treculianus is native to Lanyu cannot be ruled out completely.",

    "abstract": "Root exudation has been extensively studied due to its importance in soil carbon cycling and in supporting growth of soil microbes. However, the extent and dynamics of plant uptake of exogenous metabolites is poorly understood. To gain new insights into these processes we used 13C-tracing to characterize plant uptake of exometabolites across a panel of diverse plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, Lotus japonicus, Panicum virgatum, and Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi) grown in sterile hydroponic cultures. The uptake of exometabolites accounted for 23% of the overall B. distachyon carbon budget, and we identified 33 metabolites that were taken up by plants. Counterintuitively, many metabolites had higher uptake rates during the day vs. night. Thirteen of the metabolites from root exudates were found to promote root growth in A. thaliana, including hydroxybenzoate, threonate, N-acetyl-glucosamine, and uracil. Together these results indicate that the root uptake of organics can account for a significant portion of the plant carbon budget and that exogenous small molecules used by plants alter root growth with implications for plant nutrition, organic farming, soil nutrient cycling, and rhizosphere community dynamics.",

A whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) study of Arabidopsis shoots under iron sufficient and deficient conditions was carried out to determine the genes that are iron-regulated in the shoots. We identified two previously unannotated transcripts on chromosome 1 that are significantly iron-regulated. We have called this iron-regulated lncRNA, CAN OF SPINACH (COS). cos mutants have altered iron levels in leaves and seeds. Despite the low iron levels in the leaves, cos mutants have higher chlorophyll levels than WT plants. Moreover, cos mutants have abnormal development during iron deficiency. Roots of cos mutants are longer than those of WT plants, when grown on iron deficient medium. In addition, cos mutant plants accumulate singlet oxygen during iron deficiency. The mechanism through which COS affects iron deficiency responses is unclear, but small regions of sequence similarity to several genes involved in iron deficiency responses occur in COS, and small RNAs from these regions have been detected. We hypothesize that COS is required for normal adaptation to iron deficiency conditions.",

Arabidopsis RPW8.2 is specifically induced by the powdery mildew (PM) fungus (Golovinomyces cichoracearum) in the infected epidermal cells to activate immunity. The mechanism of RPW8.2-induction is not well understood. Here, we identify a G. cichoracearum factor delivered to the nucleus of the host cell, named Gc-RPW8.2 interacting protein 1 (GcR8IP1). Ectopic expression of GcR8IP1 in Arabidopsis or Nicotiana benthamiana suppressed host immune responses and enhanced susceptibility to PM. Host-induced gene silencing of GcR8IP1 compromised PM infectivity in susceptible Arabidopsis plants. Co-expression of GcR8IP1 with RPW8.2 increased nuclear localization of RPW8.2, which in turn, promoted transcriptional amplification of RPW8.2. Thus, RPW8.2-dependent defense strengthening is due to altered partitioning of RPW8.2 by an effector of a PM fungus, which exemplifies an atypical form of effector-triggered immunity.",

    "abstract": "The highly diverse Solanaceae family contains several widely studied model and crop species. Fully exploring, appreciating, and exploiting this diversity requires additional model systems. Particularly promising are orphan fruit crops in the genus Physalis, which occupy a key evolutionary position in the Solanaceae and capture understudied variation in traits such as inflorescence complexity, fruit ripening and metabolites, disease and insect resistance, self-compatibility, and most notable, the striking Inflated Calyx Syndrome (ICS), an evolutionary novelty found across angiosperms where sepals grow exceptionally large to encapsulate fruits in a protective husk. We recently developed transformation and genome editing in Physalis grisea (groundcherry). However, to systematically explore and unlock the potential of this and related Physalis as genetic systems, high-quality genome assemblies are needed. Here, we present chromosome-scale references for P. grisea and its close relative P. pruinosa and use these resources to study natural and engineered variation in floral traits. We first rapidly identified a natural structural variant in a bHLH gene that causes petal color variation. Further, and against expectations, we found that CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis of 11 MADS-box genes, including purported essential regulators of ICS, had no effect on inflation. In a forward genetics screen, we identified huskless, which lacks ICS due to mutation of an AP2-like gene that causes sepals and petals to merge into a single whorl of mixed identity. These resources and findings elevate Physalis to a new Solanaceae model system, and establish a new paradigm for the search of factors driving ICS.",

It consists of three subspecies: M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, M. abscessus subsp. bolletii and M. abscessus subsp. massiliense. Due to their different antibiotic susceptibility pattern, a rapid and accurate identification method is necessary for their differentiation. Although matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has proven useful for NTM identification, the differentiation of M. abscessus subspecies is challenging. In this study, a collection of 244 clinical isolates of M. abscessus complex was used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis and for the development of machine learning predictive models. Overall, using a Random Forest model with several confidence criteria (samples by triplicate and similarity values >60%), a total of 95.8% of isolates were correctly identified at subspecies level. In addition, differences in culture media, colony morphology and geographic origin of the strains were evaluated, showing that the latter most affected the mass spectra of isolates. Finally, after studying all protein peaks previously reported for this complex, two novel peaks with potential for subspecies differentiation were found. Therefore, machine learning methodology has proven to be a promising approach for rapid and accurate identification of subspecies of the M. abscessus complex using MALDI-TOF MS.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of bacteriocins are widespread amongst bacterial isolates and are important genetic determinants of competitive fitness within a given habitat. Staphylococci produce a tremendous diversity of compounds and the corresponding BGCs are frequently associated with mobile genetic elements, suggesting gain and loss of biosynthetic capacity. Pharmaceutical biology has shown that compound production in heterologous hosts is often challenging and many BGC recipients produce initially low compound amounts or show reduced growth rates. To assess whether transfer of BGCs between closely related S. aureus strains can be instantly effective or requires elaborate metabolic adaptation, we investigated the intra species transfer of a BGC encoding the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) micrococcin P1 (MP1). We found that acquisition of the BGC by S. aureus RN4220 enabled immediate MP1 production but also imposed a metabolic burden, which was relieved after prolonged cultivation by adaptive mutation. We used a multiomics approach to study this phenomenon and found adaptive evolution to select for strains with increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which enhanced metabolic fitness and levels of compound production. Metabolome analysis revealed increases of central metabolites including citrate and -ketoglutarate in the adapted strain, suggesting metabolic adaptation to overcome the BGC-associated growth defects. Our results indicate that BCG acquisition requires genetic and metabolic predispositions allowing the integration of bacteriocin production into the cellular metabolism. Inappropriate metabolic characteristics of recipients can entail physiological burdens, negatively impacting the competitive fitness of recipients within natural bacterial communities.\n\nImportanceHuman microbiomes are critically associated with human health and disease. Importantly, pathogenic bacteria can hide in human associated communities and can cause disease when the composition of the community becomes dysbalanced. Bacteriocin producing commensals are able to displace pathogens from microbial communities, suggesting that their targeted introduction in human microbiomes might prevent pathogen colonisation and infection. However, in view of future probiotic approaches, strains are needed that produce high levels of bioactive compounds and retain cellular fitness within mixed bacterial communities. Our work offers insights into the metabolic burdens associated with the production of the bacteriocin micrococcin P1 and highlights evolutionary strategies that increase cellular fitness in the context of production. Most likely metabolic adaptations are broadly relevant for bacteriocin producers and need to be considered for the future development of effective microbiome editing strategies.",

    "abstract": "Temperature and water availability are independently hypothesised to be important abiotic drivers of the evolution of metabolic rates and gas exchange patterns, respectively. Specifically, the metabolic cold adaptation hypothesis (MCA) predicts that cold environments select for faster metabolic rates to counter the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions while the hygric hypothesis predicts that dry environments select for discontinuous gas exchange to reduce water loss. Although these two hypotheses consider different physiological traits and how they vary along different abiotic gradients, metabolic rate drives gas exchange patterns in insects meaning these two traits are inherently linked. Despite this link, the MCA and hygric hypotheses are rarely considered together and the extent to which metabolic rates and respiratory patterns vary and co-vary with temperature and aridity along climatic gradients remains unclear. We tested the MCA and hygric hypotheses within a species of endemic Fijian bee, Homalictus fijiensis, across an altitudinal gradient of 1100 m, and among four Fijian bee species, including H. fijiensis, that inhabit different altitudinal bands. In Fiji, environmental temperature is ~5{degrees}C lower in the central highlands than in the coastal lowlands with the highlands receiving ~100 mm of additional precipitation than the lowlands each month. We found an MCA-like pattern within H. fijiensis and among Fijian bee species, where metabolic rate decreased with increasing temperature, but precipitation also explained variation in metabolic rate. We also found support for the hygric hypothesis within H. fijiensis and across species. Lastly, we found that the relationship between metabolic rate and ventilation rate changed depending on precipitation of the driest month within H. fijiensis and among bee species. Bees that inhabited wet regions had low ventilation rates of greater volume but bees that inhabited drier locations had rapid ventilations of smaller volume potentially as a mechanism to exchange gas without desiccating. As the correlation between metabolic rate and ventilation rate changes across the precipitation gradient, it is possible that these two traits can evolve independently of each other in response to abiotic variables despite being positively correlated.",

While the pathogenic effect of TNFAIP3 truncating variations is clearly established, that of missense variations is difficult to determine.

Review of previously reported TNFAIP3 missense variations revealed that only 3/7 are pathogenic. Through structural modeling we showed that the residues involved in OTU pathogenic missense variations establish common interactions.

Here we show that the expression of a key regulator of early gland development, the snail gene, is controlled by the Dfd and Scr Hox genes and by the Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways that induce localised transcription of upd, the ligand of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, which lies at the heart of gland specification. Our results show that the same upstream regulators are required for the early gland and tracheal primordia specification, reinforcing the hypothesis that they originated from a segmentally repeated organ present in an ancient arthropod.\n\nSummary statementBy analysing snail regulation in the CA and PG we describe their specification network, which converges on JAK/STAT pathway activation and reveals shared upstream regulators with the trachea.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure is a risk factor for many chronic diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), however the mechanism by which smoke exposure can alter homeostasis and bring about chronic inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we showcase a novel role for smoke in regulating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), showing that it activates lincRNA-Cox2, which we previously characterized as functional in inflammatory regulation. Exposing lincRNA-Cox2 murine models to smoke in vivo confirmed lincRNA-Cox2 as a regulator of inflammatory gene expression in response to smoke both systemically and within the lung. We also report that lincRNA-Cox2 negatively regulates genes in smoked bone marrow derived macrophages exposed to LPS stimulation. In addition to the effects on lncRNAs, we also report dysregulated transcription and splicing of inflammatory protein-coding genes in the bone marrow niche following CS exposure in vivo. Collectively, this work provides insights into how innate immune signaling from gene expression to splicing is altered following in vivo exposure to CS and highlights an important new role for lincRNA-Cox2 in regulating immune genes following smoke exposure.",

    "abstract": "As a strategy for minimizing microbial infections in fish hatcheries, we have investigated how putatively probiotic bacterial populations influence biofilm formation on the surface of eggs. All surfaces that are exposed to the aquatic milieu develop a microbial community through the selective assembly of microbial populations into a surface-adhering biofilm. In the investigations reported herein, we describe laboratory experiments designed to determine how initial colonization of a surface by nonpathogenic isolates from sturgeon eggs influence the subsequent assembly of populations into the existing biofilm from a pelagic river community. All eight of the tested strains altered the assembly of river biofilm in a strain-specific manner. Previously formed isolate biofilm was challenged with natural river populations and after 24 hours, two strains and two isolate combinations proved highly resistant to invasion, comprising at least 80% of the biofilm community, four isolates were intermediate in resistance with at least 45% of the biofilm community and two isolates were reduced to 4% of the biofilm community. Founding biofilms of Serratia sp, and combinations of Brevundimonas sp.-Hydrogenophaga sp. and Brevundimonas sp.-Acidovorax sp. specifically blocked populations of Aeromonas and Flavobacterium, potential fish pathogens, from colonizing the biofilm. In addition, all isolate biofilms were effective at blocking invading populations of Arcobacter. Several strains, notably Deinococcus sp., recruited specific river populations into the biofilm. The experiments suggest that relatively simple measures can be used to control the assembly of biofilm on the eggs surface and perhaps offer protection from pathogens. In addition, the methodology provides a relatively rapid way to detect potentially strong ecological interactions between bacterial populations in the formation of biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Tailocins are ribosomally synthesized bacteriocins, encoded by bacterial genomes, but originally derived from bacteriophage tails. As with both bacteriocins and phage, tailocins are largely thought to be species-specific with killing activity often assumed to be directed against closely-related strains. Previous investigations into interactions between tailocin host range and sensitivity across phylogenetically diverse isolates of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae have demonstrated that many strains possess intraspecific tailocin activity and that this activity is highly precise and specific against subsets of strains. However, here we demonstrate that at least one strain of P. syringae, USA011R, defies both expectations and current overarching dogma because tailocins from this strain possess broad killing activity against other agriculturally significant phytopathogens such as Erwinia amylovora and Xanthomonas perforans as well as against the clinical human pathogen Salmonella choleraesuis. Moreover, we show that the full spectrum of this interspecific killing activity is not conserved across closely related strains with data suggesting that even if tailocins can target different species, they do so with different efficiencies. Our results reported herein highlight the potential for and phenotypic divergence of interspecific killing activity of P. syringae tailocins and establish a platform for further investigations into the evolution of tailocin host range and strain specificity.",

    "abstract": "Geobacter sulfurreducens is a ubiquitous iron reducing bacterium in soils, and in engineered systems it can respire an electrode to produce measurable electric current. Its unique metabolism, heavily dependent on an extensive network of cytochromes, requires a unique cell composition. In this work we used metallomics, cell fraction and elemental analyses, and transcriptomics to study and analyze the cell composition of G. sulfurreducens. Elemental composition studies (C,H,O,N, ash content) showed a high C:O and H:O ratios of approximately 1.7:1 and 0.25:1, indicative of more reduced cell composition that is consistent with a high lipid content. Our study shows that G. sulfurreducens cells have a large amount of iron (2 {+/-} 0.2 g/gdw) and lipids (32 {+/-} 0.5% dw/dw) and that this composition does not change whether the cells are grown with a soluble or an insoluble electron acceptor. The high iron concentration, higher than similar microorganisms, is attributed to the production of cytochromes that are abundant in transcriptomic analyses in both solid and soluble electron acceptor growth. The unique cell composition of G. sulfurreducens must be considered when growing this microorganism for lab studies and commercial applications.\n\nImportanceGeobacter sulfurreducens is an electroactive microorganism. In nature, it grows on metallic minerals by transferring electrons to them, effectively  breathing metals. In a manmade system, it respires an electrode to produce an electric current. It has become a model organism for the study of electroactive organisms. There are potential biotechnological applications of an organism that can bridge the gap between biology and electrical signal, and as a ubiquitous iron reducer in soils around the world, G. sulfurreducens and its relatives impact the global iron cycle. We measured the concentrations of metals, macromolecules, and basic elements in G. sulfurreducens to define this organisms composition. We also used gene expression data to discuss which proteins those metals could be associated with. We found that G. sulfurreducens has a large amount of lipid and iron compared to other bacteria -- these observations are important for future microbiologists and biotechnologists working with the organism.",

    "abstract": "Phthalic acid esters (phthalates) are used as additives in various plastics and industrial applications. They are produced worldwide in huge amounts causing major pollution in the environment. Biodegradation of phthalates from the environment is an important route for their removal. In our previous work, we showed that Azoarcus sp. strain PA01 catabolizes o-phthalate via the anaerobic benzoyl-CoA pathway that involved two putative enzymes: the succinyl-CoA:o-phthalate CoA-transferase activates o-phthalate to o-phthalyl-CoA which is subsequently decarboxylated to benzoyl-CoA by o-phthalyl-CoA decarboxylase. In this work, we provide the information on the enzymes involved in the promising step of anoxic decarboxylation of o-phthalate to benzoyl-CoA. We have identified that there are two proteins are involved in decarboxylation step, of which only one does the actual decarboxylation but other one is essential. o-Phthalyl-CoA decarboxylase (PhtDa and PhtDb) encoded by the two genes PA01_00217 and PA01_00218 which catalyses the decarboxylation of activated o-phthalate to benzoyl-CoA. Both genes are originally annotated as an UbiD-like/UbiX-like protein. The gene with locus tag PA01_00217 is 1584 bp long coding for protein PhtDa (60 kDa), whereas PA01_00218 is 600 bp long codes for protein PhtDb (22 kDa). Here, we demonstrate that PhtDb is a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein which does not function as a decarboxylase alone. Rather, PhtDb is assumed to generate a modified FMN-containing cofactor that is required by the PhtDa for decarboxylase activity. Alone, PhtDa does not function as a decarboxylase either. Recombinantly expressed PhtDa and PhtDb together showed activity for decarboxylation of o-phthalyl-CoA to benzoyl-CoA, only if PhtDb was previously incubated with FMN and dimethylallyl monophosphate. Phylogenetically, the proteins PhtDa and PhtDb are closely related to UbiD-like/UbiX-like enzymes that catalyses the decarboxylation of 4-hydroxy-3-octaprenylbenzoic acid to 2-octaprenylphenol, an intermediate step in ubiquinone biosynthesis. Furthermore, multiple sequence alignment and structural modelling of both proteins suggested that only PthDb possesses the binding site for FMN. These results strongly indicate that the flavin-containing cofactor is essential for decarboxylation of o-phthalyl-CoA to benzoyl-CoA during anaerobic o-phthalate degradation by Azoarcus sp. strain PA01.",

A. baumannii utilizes the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to induce contact-dependent killing off the competitor microbes. However, the role of T6SS during host-induced oxidative stress is not explored in A. baumannii. Here, we show that A. baumannii T6+ cells cannot cope with phagocytic cell-mediated oxidative stress due to inadequate uptake of Mn2+, which is crucial for bacterial physiology and reactive oxygen species (ROS) breakdown. Deleting the Mn2+-uptake system (MntH) causes a significant increase in the T6+ population, stipulating a deleterious effect on T6SS modulation in A. baumannii. Intriguingly, we identify a bonafide sRNA, AbsR28, that meditates the crosstalk between MntH and T6SS. This work elucidates a detailed mechanism of Mn2+-dependent AbsR28-mediated post-transcriptional repression of T6SS, exploited by A. baumannii to survive in the host and establish pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial second messengers c-di-GMP and (p)ppGpp have broad functional repertoires ranging from growth and cell cycle control to the regulation of biofilm formation and virulence. The recent identification of SmbA, an effector protein from Caulobacter crescentus that is jointly targeted by both signaling molecules, has opened up studies on how these global bacterial networks interact. C-di-GMP and (p)ppGpp compete for the same SmbA binding site, with a dimer of the former ligand inducing a conformational change of loop 7 leading to downstream signaling. Here, we report a crystal structure of a partial loop 7 deletion mutant, SmbA{Delta}loop in complex with c-di-GMP determined at 1.4 [A] resolution. SmbA{Delta}loop binds monomeric c-di-GMP strengthening the view that loop 7 is required for c-di-GMP dimerization. In the crystal, SmbA{Delta}loop forms a 2-fold symmetric dimer via isologous interactions with the two symmetric halves of c-di-GMP. Structural comparisons of SmbA{Delta}loop with wild-type SmbA in complex with dimeric c-di-GMP or ppGpp support the idea that loop 7 is critical for SmbA function by interacting with downstream partners. These results underscore the flexibility of c-di-GMP in binding to the symmetric interface between protein subunits. It is envisaged that such isologous interactions of c-di-GMP will be observed in hitherto unrecognized targets.",

Release of eIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit primes 60S to associate with the 40S subunit and engage in translation. The dynamics of eIF6 interaction with the uL14 (RPL23) interface of 60S and its regulation by somatic mutations acquired in Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) is yet to be clearly understood. Here, by using a modified strategy to obtain high yields of recombinant human eIF6 we have uncovered the critical interface entailing 8 key residues in the C-tail of RPL23 that is essential for physical interactions between 60S and eIF6. Disruption of the complementary binding interface by conformational changes in eIF6 disease variants provide a mechanism for weakened interactions of variants with the 60S. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analyses uncovered dynamic configurational rearrangements in eIF6 induced by binding to RPL23 and exposed an allosteric interface regulated by the C-tail of eIF6. Disrupting a key residue in the eIF6-60S binding interface markedly limits proliferation of cancer cells, which highlights the significance of therapeutically targeting this interface.

Two enzymes are capable of catalyzing this reaction in-vitro, both with low-yield; 1) norbelladine synthase (NBS) condenses tyramine and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, while 2) noroxomaritidine/norcraugsodine reductase (NR), catalyzes a reduction reaction. To clarify the mechanisms involved in this controversial step, both NBS and NR were characterized from Narcissus papyraceus and Leucojum aestivum. Assays with each enzyme suggested that NBS and NR function together for norbelladine formation. Using molecular-homology modeling and docking studies, we predicted models for the binding of substrates to NBS and NR. Moreover, NBS and NR physically interact, localize to the cell cytoplasm and nucleus and are expressed at high levels in bulbs. Our study establishes that both NBS and NR participate in the biosynthesis of norbelladine, catalyzing the first key steps involved in the biosynthesis of the Alzheimers drug galanthamine.",

    "abstract": "Waste polyester textiles trap copious amounts of useful polymers, which are not recycled due to separation challenges and partial structural degradation during use and thermo-mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) through depolymerization can provide a feedstock of recycled monomers to make \"as-new\" polymers, and reduce the accumulation of plastic waste in landfills. Enzymes are highly specific, renewable, environmentally benign catalysts, with hydrolases available that are active on common PET textile fibers and on cotton. The enzymatic PET recycling methods in development, however, have thus far been limited to clean, high-quality PET feedstocks, and most such processes require an energy-intensive melt-amorphization step ahead of enzymatic depolymerization. Here we report that high-crystallinity PET in mixed PET/cotton textiles can be directly and selectively depolymerized to terephthalic acid (TPA) by using a commercial cutinase from Humicola insolens under moist-solid reaction conditions, affording up to 30 {+/-} 2% yield of TPA. The process is readily combined with cotton depolymerisation through simultaneous application of cellulase enzymes (CTec2(R)), providing up to 83 {+/-} 4% yield of glucose without any negative influence on the TPA yield. The herein presented selective and/or simultaneous enzymatic hydrolysis of PET/cotton textiles in solid reaction mixtures can expand the biocatalytic recycling processes of PET to less-valuable waste materials, and significantly increase its profitability through operating at very high solid-loading (40%), without the need for melt-amorphization.",

    "abstract": "Class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K{gamma}) is activated in immune cells by diverse stimuli and can form two distinct complexes, with the p110{gamma} catalytic subunit binding to either p101 or p84 regulatory subunits. These two complexes are differentially activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Ras, but the molecular details of this activation are still unclear. Using a combination of X-ray crystallography, HDX-MS, EM, molecular modeling, and biochemical assays we reveal molecular differences between the two p110{gamma}-p84 and p110{gamma}-p101 complexes that explain their differential activation. The structure of p110{gamma}-p84 shows a similar assembly to p110{gamma}-p101 at the p110{gamma} interface, however the interface in p110{gamma}-p84 is dynamic and is evolutionarily conserved to be less stable compared to p110{gamma}-p101. The p110{gamma}-p84 complex is only weakly recruited to membranes by G{beta}{gamma} subunits alone and requires recruitment by Ras to allow for G{beta}{gamma} activation through an interaction with the p110{gamma} helical domain. The interfaces of the p101 GBD with G{beta}{gamma}, and the p110{gamma} helical domain with G{beta}{gamma} were determined using computational alphafold2 modeling and HDX-MS. There are distinct differences in the C-terminal domain of p84 and p101, which allows p101 to bind G{beta}{gamma} subunits, while p84 does not. The two G{beta}{gamma} interfaces in p110{gamma} and p101 are distinct, revealing how unique mutants of G{beta}{gamma} cause differential disruption of PI3K{gamma} complex activation. Overall, our work provides key insight into the molecular basis for how different PI3K{gamma} complexes are activated.",

    "abstract": "The routine generation of enzymes with completely new active sites is one of the major unsolved problems in protein engineering. Advances in this field have been so far modest, perhaps due, at least in part, to the widespread use of modern natural proteins as scaffolds for de novo engineering. Most modern proteins are highly evolved and specialized, and, consequently, difficult to repurpose for completely new functionalities. Conceivably, resurrected ancestral proteins with the biophysical properties that promote evolvability, such as high stability and conformational diversity, could provide better scaffolds for de novo enzyme generation. Kemp elimination, a non-natural reaction that provides a simple model of proton abstraction from carbon, has been extensively used as a benchmark in de novo enzyme engineering. Here, we present an engineered ancestral {beta}-lactamase with a new active site capable of efficiently catalysing the Kemp elimination. Our Kemp eliminase is the outcome of a minimalist design based on a single function-generating mutation followed by sharply-focused, low-throughput library screening. Yet, its catalytic parameters (kcat/KM=2{middle dot}105 M-1s-1, kcat=635 s-1) compare favourably with the average modern natural enzyme and with the best proton-abstraction de novo Kemp eliminases reported in the literature. General implications of our results for de novo enzyme engineering are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) develops through step-wise genetic and molecular alterations including Kras mutation and inactivation of apoptotic pathways. Here, we find that development of anoikis resistance and metastasis of KrasG12D-driven PDAC in mice is accelerated by deleting Plk3, explaining the often reduced Plk3 expression in human PDAC. Importantly, a 41 kDa Plk3 (p41Plk3) that contained the entire kinase domain at the N-terminus (1-353 aa) is activated by scission of the precursor p72Plk3 at Arg354 by metalloendopeptidase Nardilysin (NRDC), and the resulting p32Plk3 C-terminal Polo-box domain (PBD) was quickly removed by proteasome degradation preventing the p41Plk3 inhibition by PBD. We found that p41Plk3 is the activated form of Plk3 that regulates a feedforward mechanism to promote anoikis and suppress PDAC and metastasis. p41Plk3 phosphorylates c-Fos on Thr164, which in turn, induces expression of Plk3 and pro-apoptotic genes. These findings uncovered an NRDC-regulated post-translational mechanism (PTM) that activates Plk3, establishing a prototypic regulation by scission mechanism.",

    "abstract": "REST is a widely expressed, dual role transcription factor that acts either as a transcriptional repressor or transcriptional activator depending on the genomic and cellular context. REST is an important oncogenic factor, a key player in brain cell differentiation and has a role in establishing DNA methylation status in proximity of its binding sites. Mutations in IDH cause significant changes to the epigenome contributing to blocking cell differentiation and are considered an oncogenic driver in glioma. We aimed at defining the REST role in the IDH mutation-related phenotype in gliomas accounting for its role in gene activation and repression. We studied the effects of REST knockdown, REST binding sites, and REST motifs methylation in context of IDH mutation, and found that both REST binding patterns and TF motif composition proximal to REST binding sites differed in IDH wild-type and mutant glioma. Among such REST targets were genes involved in glial cell differentiation and ECM organization. REST knockdown differently impacted glioma cell invasion depending on the IDH phenotype. DNA methylation of REST activated gene promoters showed positive correlation with gene expression. The canonical REST-repressed gene targets correlated with NPC-like cellular state properties in IDH-MUT grade 2/3 gliomas. The identified REST targets, gene regulatory networks and putative REST cooperativity with other TFs point to differential control of REST target gene expression in IDH-WT and IDH-MUT gliomas. We conclude that REST could be considered as a key factor in the design of targeted glioma therapies.",

    "abstract": "Double strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most lethal DNA lesions in cells. Previous studies show that the E6 protein of beta-human papillomavirus (HPV8 E6) impairs two major DSB repair pathways homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). However, HPV8 E6 delays but does not eliminate DSB repair capability of cells. How DSBs are repaired in cells with HPV8 E6 remains to be studied. We hypothesis that HPV8 E6 promotes a backup DSB repair pathway, alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ). Using CAS9 based Alt-EJ reporters, we show that HPV8 E6 promotes Alt-EJ. Further, using small molecule inhibitors, CRISPR/CAS9 gene knockout, and HPV8 E6 mutant, we find that HPV8 E6 promotes Alt-EJ by binding p300, an acetyltransferase that facilitates DSB repair by HR and NHEJ. Finally, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data from genomes of human foreskin keratinocytes expressing HPV8 E6 and found they displayed an increased frequency of deletions bearing the microhomology signatures of Alt-EJ. This study fills the knowledge gap how DSB is repaired in cells with HPV8 E6 and the mutagenic consequences of HPV8 E6 mediated p300 destabilization. Broadly, this study supports the hypothesis that beta-HPV promotes cancer formation by increasing genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "Class switch recombination (CSR) produces secondary immunoglobulin isotypes and requires AID-dependent DNA deamination of intronic switch (S) regions within the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) gene locus. Non-canonical repair of deaminated DNA by mismatch repair (MMR) or base excision repair (BER) creates DNA breaks that permit recombination between distal S regions. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of AID at serine-38 (pS38-AID) promotes its interaction with APE1, a BER protein, suggesting that ATM regulates CSR through BER. However, pS38-AID may also function in MMR during CSR, although the mechanism remains unknown. To examine whether ATM modulates BER- and/or MMR-dependent CSR, Atm-/- mice were bred to mice deficient for the MMR gene Msh2. Surprisingly, the predicted Mendelian frequencies of Atm-/-Msh2-/- adult mice were not obtained. To generate ATM and MSH2-deficient B cells, Atm was conditionally deleted on an Msh2-/- background using a floxed ATM allele [Atmf] and B cell-specific Cre recombinase expression (CD23-cre) to produce a deleted ATM allele (AtmD). As compared to AtmD/Dand Msh2-/- mice and B cells, AtmD/DMsh2-/- mice and B cells display a reduced CSR phenotype. Interestingly, S-S{gamma}1 junctions from AtmD/DMsh2-/-B cells that were induced to switch to IgG1 in vitro showed a significant loss of blunt end joins and an increase in insertions as compared to wildtype, AtmD/D, or Msh2-/- B cells. This data indicates that the absence of both ATM and MSH2 blocks non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to inefficient CSR. We propose a model whereby ATM and MSH2 function cooperatively to regulate end-joining during CSR through pS38-AID.\n\nSummaryLoss of the DNA repair genes Atm and Msh2 produces a novel synthetic lethality in mice. B cell specific deletion of Atm on an Msh2-/- background reduces Ig CSR and inhibits NHEJ.",

At intestinal epithelial interfaces, lamina propria Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and intraepithelial CD4+CD8+TCR{beta}+ lymphocytes (CD4-IEL) control inflammation. TGF-{beta} and retinoic acid (RA)-producing dendritic cells are required for induction of Treg and for CD4-IEL differentiation from CD4+ conventional or Treg precursors, with upregulation of Runx3 and suppression of ThPOK. We investigated Treg, CD4-IEL, ZAP70 and Runx3 in SKG mice and AS patients.\n\nMethodsWe compared ileal Treg and CD4-IEL numbers and differentiation in BALB/c and SKG mice, and with ZAP70 inhibition, and related differentially-expressed genes in terminal ileum to ChIP-seq-identified Runx3-regulated genes. We compared proportions of CD4-IEL in ileum and CD4+8+ T cells in blood of AS patients and healthy controls.\n\nResultsZAP70W163C or ZAP70 inhibition prevented intestinal CD4-IEL but not Foxp3+ Treg differentiation in context of TGF-{beta} and RA in vitro and in vivo, resulting in Runx3 and ThPOK dysregulation.

    "abstract": "Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and fermented food products. Despite its overwhelmingly fermentative metabolism, this microbe can perform extracellular electron transfer (EET) when provided with an exogenous quinone, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) and riboflavin. However, the separate roles of DHNA and riboflavin in EET in L. plantarum has remained unclear. Here we seek to understand the role of quinones and flavins for EET by monitoring iron and anode reduction in the presence and absence of these small molecules. We found that either addition of DHNA or riboflavin can support robust iron reduction, indicating electron transfer to extracellular iron occurs through both flavin-dependent and DHNA-dependent routes. Using genetic mutants of L. plantarum, we found that flavin-dependent iron reduction requires Ndh2 and EetA, while DHNA-dependent iron reduction largely relies on Ndh2 and PplA. In contrast to iron reduction, DHNA-containing media supported more robust anode reduction than riboflavin-containing media, suggesting electron transfer to an anode proceeds most efficiently through the DHNA-dependent pathway. Furthermore, we found that flavin-dependent anode reduction requires EetA, Ndh2, and PplA, while DHNA-dependent anode reduction requires Ndh2 and PplA. Taken together, we identify multiple EET routes utilized by L. plantarum and show that the EET route depends on access to environmental biomolecules and on the extracellular electron acceptor. This work expands our molecular-level understanding of EET in Gram-positive microbes and provides additional opportunities to manipulate EET for biotechnology.\n\nImportanceLactic acid bacteria are named because of their nearly exclusive fermentative metabolism. Thus, the recent observation of EET activity - typically associated with anaerobic respiration - in this class of organisms has forced researchers to rethink the rules governing microbial metabolic strategies. Our identification of multiple routes for EET in L. plantarum that depend on two separate redox active small molecules expands our understanding of how microbes metabolically adapt to different environments to gain an energetic edge and how these processes can be manipulated for biotechnological uses. Understanding the role of EET in lactic acid bacteria is of great importance due to the significance of lactic acid bacteria in agriculture, bioremediation, food production, and gut health. Furthermore, the maintenance of multiple EET routes speak to the importance of this process to function in a variety of environmental conditions.",

We present the largest investigation to date of microbes in blood, based on shotgun sequencing libraries from 9,770 healthy subjects. Leveraging the availability of data from multiple cohorts, we stringently filtered for laboratory contaminants to identify 117 microbial species detected in the blood of sampled individuals, some of which had signatures of DNA replication. These primarily comprise of commensals associated with human body sites such as the gut (n=40), mouth (n=32), and genitourinary tract (n=18), which are species that are distinct from common pathogens detected in clinical blood cultures based on more than a decade of records from a tertiary hospital. Contrary to the expectations of a shared blood microbiome, no species were detected in 84% of individuals, while only a median of one microbial species per individual was detected in the remaining 16%. Futhermore, microbes of the same species were detected in <5% of individuals, no co-occurrence patterns similar to microbiomes in other body sites was observed, and no associations between host phenotypes (e.g. demographics and blood parameters) and microbial species could be established. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis of a consistent core microbiome endogenous to human blood. Rather, our findings support the transient and sporadic translocation of commensal microbes, or their DNA, from other body sites into the bloodstream.",

    "abstract": "The recent incursion of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) virus into North America and subsequent dissemination of virus across the continent, has had significant adverse impacts on domestic poultry, and has led to widespread mortality in many wild bird species. Here we report the recent spillover of H5N1 into marine mammals in the northeastern United States, with associated mortality on a regional scale. This spillover is coincident with a second wave of H5N1 in sympatric wild birds also experiencing regional mortality events. Viral sequences derived from both seal and avian hosts reveal distinct viral genetic differences between the two waves of infection. Spillover into seals was closely related to virus from the second wave, and one of eight seal-derived sequences had the mammalian adaptation PB2 E627K.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAn outbreak of H5N1 in New England seals is the first known population-scale mammalian mortality event associated with the emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4b.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells achieve immortality by employing either homology-directed repair (HDR) or the telomerase enzyme to maintain telomeres. ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) refers to the subset of cancer cells that employ HDR. ALT mechanisms are strongly conserved from yeast to human cells, with the yeast equivalent being referred to as survivors. The non-coding RNA, TERRA and its ability to form RNA-DNA hybrids have been implicated in ALT/survivor maintenance by promoting HDR. It is not understood which telomeres in ALT/survivors engage in HDR, nor is it clear which telomeres upregulate TERRA. Using yeast survivors as a model for ALT, we demonstrate that HDR only occurs at telomeres when they become critically short. Moreover, TERRA levels steadily increase as telomeres shorten and decrease again following HDR-mediated recombination. Surprisingly, we observe that survivors undergo cycles of senescence, in a similar manner to non-survivors following telomerase loss, which we refer to as survivor associated senescence (SAS). Similar to \"normal\" senescence, we observe that RNA-DNA hybrids slow the rate of SAS by decreasing the rate of telomere shortening. In summary, TERRA RNA-DNA hybrids regulate telomere dysfunction-induced senescence in both pre- and post-crisis cells.",

    "abstract": "In the 1940s, the Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) started a grapevine breeding program to develop new cultivars adapted to the tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil. More than 2,000 crosses were carried out over 50 years, using 850 varieties as parents. However, among the thousands of hybrids developed by the program, only 130 are still maintained in the IAC grapevine germplasm collection. Little is known about their genetic makeup and usefulness for current breeding programs. In this study, we genotyped 130 Brazilian grape hybrids at 21 polymorphic microsatellite markers to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of the hybrids and verified their disclosed pedigrees. The results showed that the hybrid collection is highly diverse, with an expected heterozygosity (HE) of 0.80 and an observed heterozygosity (Ho) of 0.78. Strong structure in three subgroups based mainly on the usage and combination of parental groups was revealed by STRUCTURE software and confirmed by discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). Through molecular profiling analysis, fourteen synonyms, one homonym and one duplicate were identified. Parentage analysis confirmed 24 full parentages, as well as 33 half-kinships. In addition, 18 pedigrees were invalidated, and seven mislabeling events were identified. No compatible parent was identified for 33% of the IAC hybrids, highlighting severe genetic erosion in the IAC germplasm. The molecular characterization of the breeding hybrid bank collection contributes to our understanding of the genetic basis of the varieties, guiding the efficient utilization of available genetic diversity. Together, our results could be applied to other breeding programs and assist in the selection of parents, management of the breeding collection, and conservation of grapevine genetic resources.",

    "abstract": "We have uncovered a novel role for the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene and novel PML-like DEDDh exonucleases in the maintenance of genome stability through the restriction of LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition in jawed vertebrates. Although the PML tumour suppressor protein in mammals is SUMOylated and forms nuclear bodies, we found that the spotted gar PML ortholog and related proteins in fish are not SUMOylated and function as cytoplasmic DEDDh exonucleases. In contrast, more closely related avian and turtle PML proteins are predicted to be SUMOylated and localized both to the cytoplasm and to nuclear bodies. We also identified PML-like exon 9 (Plex9) genes in teleost fishes that encode exonucleases sharing homology to gar PML. In an example of convergent evolution and akin to TREX1, gar PML and zebrafish Plex9 proteins suppressed L1 retrotransposition and could complement TREX1 knockout in mammalian cells. We also characterized the first non-mammalian TREX1 homologs in axolotl. Following export to the cytoplasm, the human PML-I isoform also restricted L1 through its conserved C-terminus and suppressed CGAS activation. Thus, PML first emerged as a cytoplasmic suppressor of retroelements, and this function is retained in amniotes despite its role in the assembly of nuclear bodies and the acquisition of SUMO-modification.",

    "abstract": "Lattice light sheet microscopy excels at the non-invasive imaging of three-dimensional (3D) dynamic processes at high spatiotemporal resolution within cells and developing embryos. Recently, several papers have called into question the performance of lattice light sheets relative to the Gaussian sheets most common in light sheet microscopy. Here we undertake a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of various forms of light sheet microscopy which both demonstrates and explains why lattice light sheets provide significant improvements in resolution and photobleaching reduction. The analysis provides a procedure to select the correct light sheet for a desired experiment and specifies the processing that maximizes the use of all fluorescence generated within the light sheet excitation envelope for optimal resolution while minimizing image artifacts and photodamage. Development of a new type of \"harmonic balanced\" lattice light sheet is shown to improve performance at all spatial frequencies within its 3D resolution limits and maintains this performance over lengthened propagation distances allowing for expanded fields of view.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite its rapidly growing use, several misconceptions remain concerning the physics of image formation and its optimization in light sheet microscopy, particularly in high resolution variants tailored for subcellular imaging. These include the role of excitation sidelobes, the significance of out-of-focus fluorescence, the importance and optimization of deconvolution, and the perceived advantages of Gaussian beams. Here we attempt to shatter these misconceptions by showing that the professed tradeoffs between axial resolution and background haze, photobleaching rate, phototoxicity, and propensity for image artifacts do not exist for well-crafted lattice light sheets whose data is acquired and processed rigorously. The framework we provide should enable others to optimize light sheets and extract the most information at the lowest cost in their experiments.",

    "abstract": "Tight regulation of Arp2/3 complex is required to allow productive nucleation of force-generating, branched actin networks. An emerging aspect of regulation is the incorporation of subunit isoforms into Arp2/3 complex. Specifically, both isoforms of the ArpC5 subunit, ArpC5 and ArpC5L, have been reported to fine-tune nucleation activity and branch junction stability. Elevated levels of ArpC5 have also been linked to increased cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we have combined genetic engineering of cells and cellular structural biology to describe how ArpC5 and ArpC5L differentially regulate cell migration. They do so by defining the structural stability of ArpC1 in branch junctions and, in turn, by determining protrusion characteristics, protein dynamics, and actin network ultrastructure. ArpC5 isoforms also have an impact on the positioning of actin assembly factors from the Ena/VASP family, which act downstream of Arp2/3 complex-mediated nucleation. This suggests that ArpC5 and Ena/VASP proteins, both predictors for poor outcome in cancer, are part of a signaling pathway enhancing cell migration and, by inference, metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) can reveal the regulatory mechanisms of trait associated variants. eQTLs are highly cell-type and context-specific, but often these contexts are unknown or not measured. Here, we introduce PICALO (Principal Interaction Component Analysis through Likelihood Optimization), an unbiased method to identify known and hidden contexts that influence eQTLs. PICALO uses expectation maximization to identify latent components, referred to as Principal Interaction Components (PIC), that interact with genotypes to maximize explained eQTL effect-sizes.\n\nWe applied PICALO to bulk RNA-seq eQTL datasets in blood (n=2,932) and brain (n=2,440). We identify 31 PICs in blood, interacting with 4,169 (32%) unique cis-eQTLs (BH-FDR[&le;]0.05). In brain, we identified 21 PICs, interacting with 4,058 (39%) unique cis-eQTLs (BH-FDR[&le;]0.05). These PICs are associated with RNA quality, cell type composition or environmental influences. Furthermore, PICs clearly disentangle distinct eQTL contexts, for example technical from non-technical factors. Combined, 3,065 unique genes showed a cis-eQTL effect that is dependent on a cell type or other non-technical context, emphasizing the value of methods like PICALO. PICALO is robust, works well with heterogeneous datasets, yields reproducible interaction components, and identifies eQTL interactions and contexts that would have been missed when using cell counts or expression based principal components.\n\nSince PICALO allows for the identification of many context-dependent eQTLs without any prior knowledge of such contexts, this method can help to reveal and quantify the influence of previously unknown environmental factors that play a role in common diseases.",
