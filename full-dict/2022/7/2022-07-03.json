    "abstract": "The determination of the three-dimensional structure of large RNA macromolecules in solution is a challenging task that often requires the use of several experimental and computational techniques. Small-angle X-ray spectroscopy can provide insight into some geometrical properties of the probed molecule, but this data must be properly interpreted in order to generate a three-dimensional model. Here, we propose a multiscale pipeline which introduces SAXS data into modelling the global shape of RNA in solution, which can be hierarchically refined until reaching atomistic precision in explicit solvent. The low-resolution helix model (ERNWIN) deals with the exploration of the huge conformational space making use of the SAXS data, while a nucleotide-level model (SPQR) removes clashes and disentangles the proposed structures, leading the structure to an all-atom representation in explicit solvent. We apply the procedure on five different structures up to 126 nucleotides with promising results.",

    "abstract": "GTPases cycle between active GTP bound and inactive GDP bound forms. Exchange of GDP for GTP is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate GTP hydrolysis, to promote the GDP bound form. Recently, we reported that the GEF called PIX is required for assembly or stability of integrin adhesion complexes (IAC) in striated muscle. A GAP for the PIX pathway had not been identified in any cell type or organism. A screen in C. elegans of mutants in 18 proteins containing Rho GAP domains and expressed in muscle revealed that loss of function of rrc-1 results in loss of IAC components at the muscle cell boundary (MCB). RRC-1 contains an SH3 domain and a Rho GAP domain, and is localized to the IACs of MCBs, like PIX-1. rrc-1 mutants show reduced accumulation of IAC components at the MCB, sarcomere disorganization, and reduced whole animal locomotion. Knockdown of git-1, which encodes a PIX scaffold protein, reduces the level of RRC-1. Localization at MCBs of RRC-1 depends on pix-1, and the localization of PIX-1 depends on rrc-1. These results suggest that RRC-1 is a RhoGAP for the PIX pathway in muscle.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthetic eukaryotes have shaped the Earths biosphere by producing O2 and converting light into organic compounds in specialized organelles called plastids. Plastids evolved from free-living cyanobacteria engulfed by heterotrophic unicellular eukaryotes in processes called cyanobacterial endosymbioses. Two independent such processes have been reported so far. The first gave rise to primary plastids and three Archaeplastida lineages: glaucophytes, red algae and green algae with land plants, whereas the second resulted in chromatophores in the rhizarian amoeba Paulinella. Importantly, archaeplastidans donated their plastids to many protist groups, thereby further spreading photosynthesis across the tree of life. To reveal the complex plastid evolution, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic and multi-clock analyses based on new fossil calibration points and the greatest number yet of plastid-encoded proteins from 108 taxa, representing a large diversity of photosynthetic organisms. Our results indicate that primary plastids evolved prior to 2.1 - 1.8 Bya, i.e. before glaucophytes diverged from the other archaeplastidans. Like the primary plastids before, Paulinella chromatophores evolved in low salinity habitats and possibly before 292 - 266 Mya. Red and green algae were engulfed by cryptophyte and chlorarachniophyte ancestors between 1.7 - 1.4 Bya, and 1.1 - 1.0 Bya, respectively; the former subsequently triggered plastid transfers to other eukaryotes. The diversification rate of the photosynthetic organisms increased with temperature and CO2 but decreased with O2 and volcanic activity. We also studied the impact of various molecular clocks and calibration sets on the age estimation and clearly indicate that the clocks are the source of greater differences.\n\nSignificance StatementCyanobacteria and eukaryote endosymbioses created a multitude of photosynthetic organelles called plastids that feed most life on our planet. For decades scientists have been trying to untangle the puzzle of plastid evolution, i.e. when and how plastids were acquired and spread throughout the eukaryotic tree of life. To answer these questions we applied phylogenetic and multi-clock methods combined with new fossil calibration points on large data sets. Our results push back in the Earths history most key events concerning plastid evolution compared to previous reports. Additionally, we discovered a significant impact of climatic and atmospheric parameters on the diversification rate of plastid lineages. The estimated divergence times enabled us to reinterpret taxonomic classification of controversial fossils.",

    "abstract": "Sexual activity (mating) negatively affects immune function in various insect species, in both sexes. In the experiments reported in this manuscript, we tested if hosts adapted to regular pathogen challenges are less susceptible to mating induced immune suppression, using experimentally evolved Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for increased post-infection survival when infected with a Gram-positive bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis. Mating increased susceptibility of females to bacterial pathogens, but in a pathogen specific manner. Mating-induced increase in susceptibility was also affected by host evolutionary history, with females from selected populations exhibiting similar post-infection survival irrespective of mating status, while females from control populations became more susceptible to bacterial infections after mating. Post-infection survival of males, irrespective of their evolutionary history, was not affected by their mating status. We therefore conclude that hosts evolved to better survive bacterial infections are also better at resisting mating-induced increase in susceptibility to infections in Drosophila melanogaster.",

Flower constancy is important for plant reproduction, but whether bees also benefit from flower constancy remains unclear. Social bees, which often use communication about food sources, show particularly strong flower constancy.\nC_LIO_LIWe hypothesised that the sharing of social information increases the benefits of flower constancy because foragers share information selectively about high-quality food sources, thereby reducing the need to sample alternatives. We also asked if foraging landscapes affect flower constancy. We developed an agent-based model that allowed us to simulate bee colonies with and without communication and flower constancy in different foraging environments.\nC_LIO_LIFlower constancy alone performed poorly in all environments, while indiscriminate flower choice was often the most successful strategy. However, communication improved the performance of flower constant colonies in nearly all tested environments. This combination was particularly successful when high-quality food sources were abundant and competition was weak.\nC_LIO_LIOur findings help explain why social bees tend to be more flower constant than solitary bees and suggest that flower constancy can be an adaptive strategy in social bees.

    "abstract": "Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized biological imaging, improving the spatial resolution of traditional microscopes by an order of magnitude. However, SMLM techniques depend on accumulation of many localizations over thousands of recorded frames to yield a single super-resolved image, which is time consuming. Hence, the capability of SMLM to observe dynamics has always been limited. Typically, a few minutes of data acquisition are needed to reconstruct a single super-resolved frame. In this work, we present DBlink, a novel deep-learning-based algorithm for super spatiotemporal resolution reconstruction from SMLM data. The input to DBlink is a recorded video of single molecule localization microscopy data and the output is a super spatiotemporal resolution video reconstruction. We use bi-directional long short term memory (LSTM) network architecture, designed for capturing long term dependencies between different input frames. We demonstrate DBlink performance on simulated data of random filaments and mitochondria-like structures, on experimental SMLM data in controlled motion conditions, and finally on live cell dynamic SMLM. Our neural network based spatiotemporal interpolation method constitutes a significant advance in super-resolution imaging of dynamic processes in live cells.",

Besides observing the cellular physiological properties, in situ monitoring of neurochemical concentrations with cellular spatial resolution in such neural tissues can provide additional valuable insights in models of disease and drug efficacy. In this work, we demonstrate the first three-dimensional (3D) tissue cultures with embedded optical dopamine (DA) sensors. We developed an alginate/Pluronic F127 based bio-ink for human dopaminergic brain tissue printing with tetrapodal-shaped-ZnO microparticles (t-ZnO) additive as the DA sensor. DA quenches the autofluorescence of t-ZnO in physiological environments, and the reduction of the fluorescence intensity serves as an indicator of the DA concentration. The neurons that were 3D printed with the t-ZnO showed good viability, and extensive 3D neural networks were formed within one week after printing. The t-ZnO can sense DA in the 3D printed neural network with a detection limit of 0.137 M. The results are a first step toward integrating tissue engineering with intensiometric biosensing for advanced artificial tissue/organ monitoring.",

    "abstract": "To train robust deep neural networks (DNNs), we systematically study several target modification approaches, which include output regularisation, self and non-self label correction (LC). Three key issues are discovered: (1) Self LC is the most appealing as it exploits its own knowledge and requires no extra models. However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as training goes is not well answered in the literature. (2) Some methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better. (3) Using the standard training setting, a trained network is of low confidence when severe noise exists, making it hard to leverage its high-entropy self knowledge.\n\nTo resolve the issue (1), taking two well-accepted propositions-deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise and minimum entropy regularisation principle-we propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time and entropy. Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the prediction is of low entropy (high confidence). For the issue (2), according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it. This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation. To address the issue (3), we decrease the entropy of self knowledge using a low temperature before exploiting it to correct labels, so that the revised labels redefine a low-entropy target state.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments in both clean and noisy settings, and on both image and protein datasets.

To investigate cancer pathophysiology and therapies, confocal imaging of fluorescent cancer cells, and their response to treatments in zebrafish larvae, yields valuable information.

To alleviate this problem, we present a software-tool to segment cells from confocal images and track characteristics such as volume, location in the larva and fluorescent intensity on a single-cell basis. Using this software-tool, we were able to characterize the responses of the cancer cell lines Molm-13 and MDS-L to established treatments. By utilizing the computer-assisted processing of confocal images as presented here, more information can be obtained while being less time-consuming and reducing the demand of manual data handling, when compared to a manual approach, thereby accelerating the pursuit of novel anti-cancer treatments.\n\nSummary statementWe present a software tool for automatic cell segmentation of fluorescent cancer cells in zebrafish larvae to determine characteristics of the cancer cell population on a single-cell basis.",

    "abstract": "Interspecies grafting is a technique that allows beneficial shoot and root combinations from separate species to be combined into a single organism. Despite its relevance to agricultural production, little is known about the determinants of graft compatibility. One hypothesis for compatibility revolves around the taxonomic degree of relatedness between the two plants. To test how phylogenetic distance affects interspecific graft compatibility within the economically important Solanaceae sub-family, Solanoideae, we characterized the anatomical and biophysical integrity of graft junctions for graft combinations made between four species: tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), eggplant (Solanum melongena), pepper (Capsicum annuum), and groundcherry (Physalis pubescens). We analyzed the survival, growth, and junction integrity via bend tests, and imaged the cellular composition of the graft junctions in order to deduce the status of vascular connectivity across the junction. Utilizing these techniques, we were able to quantitatively assess the degree to which each interspecific combination exhibits compatibility. Despite the fact that most of our graft combinations exhibited high survival rates, we show that only tomato and eggplant heterografts are truly compatible. Unlike incompatible grafts, the formation of reconnected vascular tissue within the tomato and eggplant heterografts contributed to biophysically stable grafts that were resistant to snapping. Furthermore, we identified 10 graft combinations that show delayed incompatibility, providing a useful, economically relevant system to pursue deeper work into genetic and genomic determinants of graft compatibility. This work provides new evidence indicating that graft compatibility may be limited to intrageneric combinations within the Solanoideae subfamily. Further research using more extensive graft combinations amongst Solanaceous species can be used to test whether our hypothesis broadly applies to this family.",

    "abstract": "Visual perceptual learning is traditionally thought to arise in visual cortex. However, typical perceptual learning tasks also involve systematic mapping of visual information onto motor actions. Because the motor system contains both effector-specific and effector-unspecific representations, the question arises whether visual perceptual learning is effector-specific itself, or not. Here, we study this question in an orientation discrimination task. Subjects learn to indicate their choices either with joystick movements or with manual reaches. After training, we challenge them to perform the same task with eye movements. We dissect the decision-making process using the drift diffusion model. We find that learning effects on the rate of evidence accumulation depend on effectors, albeit not fully. This suggests that during perceptual learning, visual information is mapped onto effector-specific integrators. Overlap of the populations of neurons encoding motor plans for these effectors may explain partial generalization. Taken together, visual perceptual learning is not limited to visual cortex, but also affects sensorimotor mapping at the interface of visual processing and decision making.",

    "abstract": "Helping another in distress can be motivated by either affective or cognitive empathy, with the latter commonly believed to be restricted to humans and possibly other apes. Here, we found evidence for rodent helping that occurs in the absence of affective cues. We employed a paradigm in which a free rat can open the door to a restrainer containing a trapped rat. When the trapped rat was treated with the anxiolytic midazolam, the helping behavior exhibited by the free rat was diminished but did not extinguish. Correspondingly, midazolam-treated trapped rats still released themselves when given the opportunity, albeit at longer latencies than controls, evidence that midazolam only partially reduced the distress experienced by trapped rats. To test whether helping could occur for a rat who exhibited no affect, trapped rats were immobilized by general anesthesia or heavy sedation. Surprisingly, rats opened the door to restrainers containing these immobilized rats and pulled the incapacitated rats out of the restrainer, pushing them away from the arena center. The same solicitous behavior was observed when an anesthetized rat was simply placed in the center of the arena, without being confined within a restrainer. We speculate that the cognitive dissonance of immobile rats, at odds with predictive expectations of rat behavior built up over a lifetime, motivated solicitous behavior including helping. To block affective behavioral displays without associated dissonant cues of immobility, metyrapone, a drug that selectively blocks corticosterone synthesis, was administered to trapped rats. Under such circumstances, little helping behavior occurred. In sum, rats may be motivated either by affect or by cognitive dissonance, the latter comprising a rudimentary form of cognitive empathy.",

    "abstract": "Whereas axons deprived of their nucleus degenerate within a few days in Mammals, they survive for several months in Crustacean. However, it is not known if central synapses from sensory axons may preserve their molecular machinery in the absence of spiking activity, after peripheral axotomy, which suppress their nucleus. Using electrophysiology techniques and electron microscopy imaging we report that 1) Electron microscopy analysis confirms previous observations that glial cell nucleus present in sensory nerve, proliferate an migrate to axon tubes, in which they form close contact with surviving axons; 2) after peripheral axotomy performed in vivo on Coxo-Basipodite chordotonal organ (CBCO) sensory nerve does not convey any sensory message, but antidromic volleys are observed; 3) Central synaptic transmission to motoneurons (MNs) progressively declines over #200 days (90% of monosynaptic excitatory transmission is lost after 3 weeks, whereas 60% of polysynaptic inhibitory transmission persist up to 6 months). After #200 days no transmission is observed anymore; 4) However, this total loss is only apparent, because repetitive electrical stimulation of the sensory nerve in vitro progressively restores first inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) then excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs); 5) The loss of synaptic transmission can be prevented by in vivo chronic sensory nerve stimulation; 6) Using simulations based on the geometric arrangements of synapses of the monosynaptic excitatory transmission and disynaptic inhibitory pathways, we have shown that antidromic activity in CBCO nerve could play a role in maintenance of synaptic function of inhibitory pathways to MNs, but not on monosynaptic excitatory transmission to MNs. Taken together, our study confirms the key role of glial nucleus in axon survival, that machinery for spike conduction and synaptic release even if no activity is present for several months. After long silence periods (>6 months) spike conduction and synaptic function can still be restored by electrical activity.",

    "abstract": "Listening in a noisy environment is challenging, but many previous studies have demonstrated that comprehension of speech can be substantially improved by looking at the talkers face. We recently developed a deep neural network (DNN) based system that generates movies of a talking face from speech audio and a single face image. In this study, we aimed to quantify the benefits that such a system can bring to speech comprehension, especially in noise. The target speech audio was masked with signal to noise ratios of -9, -6, -3, and 0 dB and was presented to subjects in three audio-visual (AV) stimulus conditions: 1) synthesized AV: audio with the synthesized talking face movie; 2) natural AV: audio with the original movie from the corpus; and 3) audio-only: audio with a static image of the talker. Subjects were asked to type the sentences they heard in each trial and keyword recognition was quantified for each condition. Overall, performance in the synthesized AV condition fell approximately halfway between the other two conditions, showing a marked improvement over the audio-only control but still falling short of the natural AV condition. Every subject showed some benefit from the synthetic AV stimulus. The results of this study support the idea that a DNN-based model that generates a talking face from speech audio can meaningfully enhance comprehension in noisy environments, and has the potential to be used as a \"visual hearing aid.\"",

    "abstract": "Bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled throughout life by bone resorbing osteoclasts and bone forming osteoblasts, to adapt to physiological or mechanical demands. These processes are impaired in osteoporosis, and understanding how bone remodeling is regulated could improve anti-osteoporotic treatments. Clinical investigations show that short-term treatment with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) acutely decreases serum markers of bone resorption and may increase bone formation. However, evidence for direct effects of GIP intracellular signaling and functions in mature human osteoclasts and osteoblasts have not been investigated. We report that the GIP receptor (GIPR) is robustly expressed in mature human osteoclasts. Exposure of osteoclasts to GIP inhibits osteoclastogenesis, delays bone resorption, and increases osteoclast apoptosis by acting upon multiple signaling pathways (cAMP, Src, Akt, calcium, p38) to impair nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) and nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF{kappa}B). Human osteoblasts also express GIPR, and GIP improves osteoblast survival via cAMP and Akt-mediated pathways. GIP treatment of co-cultures of osteoclasts and osteoblasts also decreased bone resorption. Antagonizing GIPR with GIP(3-30)NH2 abolished the effects of GIP on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. This study demonstrates that GIP inhibits bone resorption and improves survival of human osteoblasts, which could increase bone mass and strength, supporting clinical investigations of the effect of GIP on bone. Moreover, this study demonstrates that GIPR agonism could be beneficial in the treatment of disorders of bone remodeling, such as osteoporosis.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryGIP acts directly on bone cells to regulate bone remodeling",

    "abstract": "MotivationBiological systems are made of entities organized at different scales (e.g. macro-organisms, symbionts, genes...) which evolve in interaction. These interactions range from independence or conflict to cooperation and coevolution, which results in them having a common history. The evolution of such systems is approached by phylogenetic reconciliation, which describes the common patterns of diversification between two different levels, e.g. genes and species, or hosts and symbionts for example. The limit to two levels hides the multi-level inter-dependencies that characterize complex systems.\n\nResultsWe present a probabilistic model of evolution of three nested levels of organization which can account for the codivergence of hosts, symbionts and their genes. This model allows gene transfer as well as host switch, gene duplication as well as symbiont diversification inside a host, gene or symbiont loss. It handles the possibility of ghost lineages as well as temporary free-living symbionts.\n\nGiven three phylogenetic trees, we devise a Monte Carlo algorithm which samples evolutionary scenarios of symbionts and genes according to an approximation of their likelihood in the model. We evaluate the capacity of our method on simulated data, notably its capacity to infer horizontal gene transfers, and its ability to detect hostsymbiont co-evolution by comparing host/symbiont/gene and symbiont/gene models based on their estimated likelihoods. Then we show in a aphid enterobacter system that some reliable transfers detected by our method, are invisible to classic 2-level reconciliation. We finally evaluate different hypotheses on human population histories in the light of their coevolving Helicobacter pylori symbionts, reconciled together with their genes.\n\nAvailabilityImplementation is available on GitHub https://github.com/hmenet/TALE.

Most of the song phrases and rain calls did not differ in any of the characteristics measured between urban and rural chaffinches.

    "abstract": "Brain computer interfaces (BCIs), including penetrating microelectrode arrays, enable both recording and stimulation of neuronal cells. However, device implantation inevitably causes injury to brain tissue and induces a foreign body response, leading to reduced recording performance and stimulation efficacy. Astrocytes in the healthy brain play multiple roles including regulating energy metabolism, homeostatic balance, transmission of neural signals, and neurovascular coupling. Following an insult to the brain, they are activated and observed to gather around the site of injury. These reactive astrocytes have been regarded as one of the main contributors to the formation of a glial scar which affects the performance of microelectrode arrays. This study investigates the dynamics of astrocytes within the first 2 weeks after implantation of an intracortical microelectrode into the mouse brain using two-photon microscopy. From our observation astrocytes are highly dynamic during this period, exhibiting patterns of process extension, soma migration, morphological activation, and device encapsulation that are spatiotemporally distinct from other glial cells, such as microglia or oligodendrocyte precursor cells. This detailed characterization of astrocyte reactivity will help to better understand the tissue response to intracortical devices and lead to the development of more effective intervention strategies to improve the functional performance neural interfacing technology.",

    "abstract": "The synaptic organization of the brain is constantly modified by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. In several neurological disorders, abnormal neuronal activity and pathological synaptic connectivity may significantly impair normal brain function. Reorganization of neuronal circuits by therapeutic stimulation has the potential to restore normal brain dynamics. Increasing evidence suggests that the temporal stimulation pattern crucially determines the long-lasting therapeutic effects of stimulation. Here, we tested whether a specific pattern of brain stimulations can enable the suppression of pathologically strong inter-population synaptic connectivity through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). More specifically, we tested how introducing a time shift between stimuli delivered to two interacting populations of neurons can effectively decouple them. To that end, we first used a tractable model, i.e., two bidirectionally coupled leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, to theoretically analyze the optimal range of stimulation frequency and time shift for decoupling. We then extended our results to two reciprocally connected neuronal populations (modules) where inter-population delayed connections were modified by STDP. As predicted by the theoretical results, appropriately time-shifted stimulation causes a decoupling of the two-module system through STDP, i.e., by unlearning pathologically strong synaptic interactions between the two populations. Based on the overall topology of the connections, the decoupling of the two modules, in turn, causes a desynchronization of the populations that outlasts the cessation of stimulation. Decoupling effects of the time-shifted stimulation can be realized by time-shifted burst stimulation as well as time-shifted continuous simulation. Our results provide insight into the further optimization of a variety of multichannel stimulation protocols aiming at a therapeutic reshaping of diseased brain networks.",

We previously reported that male mice retain obesity-associated immunological changes even after weight loss, suggesting that immune cells may remember the state of obesity. Therefore, we hypothesized that cycles of weight gain and loss, otherwise known as weight cycling, can induce innate memory in adipose macrophages. We first treated bone marrow derived macrophages in a culture model of innate immune memory. Priming the cells with palmitic acid or adipose tissue conditioned media increased maximal glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and increased LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 production. While weight loss improved glucose tolerance, adipose macrophages retained elevated LPS-induced cytokine production. In a model of weight cycling, adipose macrophages had elevated metabolism and secreted higher levels of basal TNF. Together, these data suggest that obesity and subsequent weight loss can prime adipose macrophages for enhanced inflammation upon weight regain. This innate immune memory response may contribute to worsened glucose tolerance following weight cycling.",

We successfully grew three different unicellular, biotechnologically relevant cyanobacteria: Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 and Synechococcus sp. UTEX 3154. Highly-resolved 1D screening of nitrate, phosphate, carbonate, and salt content show that nitrate and/or phosphate can be limiting in standard cultivation media. Finally, we show that 2D screening results from our microfluidic setup translate well to a laboratory scale high-density cultivation setup. This study demonstrates that droplet-based microfluidics by micro segmented-flow are a powerful tool for high-throughput optimization of cyanobacterial cultivation.",

    "abstract": "The high incidence of aneuploidy in early human development, arising either from errors in meiosis or postzygotic mitosis, is the primary cause of pregnancy loss, miscarriage, and still birth following natural conception as well as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) has confirmed the prevalence of meiotic and mitotic aneuploidies among blastocyst-stage IVF embryos that are candidates for transfer. However, only about half of normally fertilized embryos develop to the blastocyst stage in vitro, while the others arrest at cleavage to late morula or early blastocyst stages. To achieve a more complete view of the impacts of aneuploidy, we applied a validated method of PGT-A to a large series (n = 909) of arrested embryos and trophectoderm biopsies. We then correlated observed aneuploidies with abnormalities of the first two cleavage divisions using time lapse imaging (n = 843). The combined incidence of meiotic and mitotic aneuploidies was strongly associated with blastocyst morphological grading, with the proportion ranging from 20% to 90% for the highest to lowest grades, respectively. In contrast, the incidence of aneuploidy among arrested embryos was exceptionally high (94%), dominated by mitotic aneuploidies affecting multiple chromosomes. In turn, these mitotic aneuploidies were strongly associated with abnormal cleavage divisions, such that 51% of abnormally dividing embryos possessed mitotic aneuploidies compared to only 23% of normally dividing embryos. We conclude that the combination of meiotic and mitotic aneuploidies drives arrest of human embryos in vitro, as development increasingly relies on embryonic gene expression at the blastocyst stage.",

We found that the bulk of genetic adaptation occurred after the start of the Bronze Age, <4,500 years ago, and was enriched in genes relating to host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, we detected directional selection acting on specific leukocytic lineages and experimentally demonstrated that the strongest negatively selected immunity gene variant -- the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein gene (LBP) D283G -- is hypomorphic. Finally, our analyses suggest that the risk of inflammatory disorders has progressively increased in post-Neolithic Europeans, partly due to antagonistic pleiotropy following genetic adaptation to pathogens.",

Plant breeders improve those traits by generating crosses of cultivated tomatoes with their wild relatives. Specific allele introgression relying on meiotic recombination, is hampered by structural divergence between parental genomes. However, previous studies of interspecific tomato hybridization focused in single cross or lacked resolution due to prohibitive sequencing costs of large segregating populations. Here, we used pooled-pollen sequencing to reveal unprecedented details of recombination patterns in five interspecific tomato hybrids. We detected hybrid-specific recombination coldspots that underscore the influence of structural divergence in shaping recombination landscape. Crossover regions and coldspots show strong association with specific TE superfamilies exhibiting differentially accessible chromatin between somatic and meiotic cells. We also found gene complexes associated with metabolic processes, stress resistance and domestication syndrome traits, revealing undesired consequences of recombination suppression to phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate that by using resequencing data of wild and domesticated tomato populations, we can screen for alternative parental genomes to overcome recombination barriers. Overall, our results will allow breeders better informed decisions on generating disease-resistant and climate-resilient tomato.",

    "abstract": "The H-matrix best linear unbiased prediction (HBLUP) method has been widely used in livestock breeding programs. It can integrate all information, including pedigree, genotypes, and phenotypes on both genotyped and non-genotyped individuals into one single evaluation that can provide reliable predictions of breeding values. The existing HBLUP method (e.g., that implemented in BLUPf90 software) requires hyper-parameters that should be adequately optimised as otherwise the genomic prediction accuracy may decrease. In this study, we assess the performance of HBLUP using various hyper-parameters such as blending, tuning and scale factor in simulated as well as real data on Hanwoo cattle. In both simulated and cattle data, we show that blending is not necessary, indicating that the prediction accuracy decreases when using a blending hyper-parameter < 1. The tuning process (adjusting genomic relationships accounting for base allele frequencies) improves prediction accuracy in the simulated data, confirming previous studies, although the improvement is not statistically significant in the Hanwoo cattle data. We also demonstrate that a scale factor, , which determines the relationship between allele frequency and per-allele effect size, can improve the HBLUP accuracy in both simulated and real data. Our findings suggest that an optimal scale factor should be considered to increase the prediction accuracy, in addition to blending and tuning processes, when using HBLUP.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite significant advancements in genotyping technologies, the capability to predict the phenotypes of complex traits is still limited. H-matrix best linear unbiased prediction (HBLUP) method has been used to tackle this limitation to demonstrate a promising prediction accuracy. However, the performance of HBLUP depends heavily on the optimisation of hyper-parameters (e.g. blending and tuning). In this study, we introduce a scale factor (), as a new hyper-parameter in HBLUP, which accounts for the relationship between allele frequency and per-allele effect size. Using simulation and real data analysis, we investigate the impact of the hyper-parameters (blending, tuning, and scale factor) on the performance of HBLUP. In general, the blending process may not improve the prediction accuracy for simulation and cattle data although a marginally improved prediction accuracy is observed with a blending hyper-parameter = 0.86 for one of carcass traits in the cattle data. In contrast, the tuning process can increase the HBLUP accuracy particularly in simulated data. Furthermore, we observe that an optimal scale factor plays a significant role in improving the prediction accuracy in both simulated and real data, and the improvement is relatively large compared with blending and tuning processes. In this context, we propose considering the scale factor as a hyper-parameter to increase the predictive performance of HBLUP.",

Cells from late stages of oncogenesis, i. e. bona fide tumor cells, interfere with these signaling pathways through expression of membrane-associated catalase. Transformed cells and tumor cells with inhibited catalase show mutual exclusivity of apoptosis-inducing NO/peroxynitrite and HOCl signaling. H2O2 is the substrate for HOCl synthesis by DUOX-coded peroxidase. However, at high concentrations of H2O2, HOCl signaling is abrogated through the reaction between excess H2O2 and HOCl. Experimental increase in the NO concentration through addition of NO donors, induction of NO synthase (NOS), addition or the NOS substrate arginine, or inhibition of NO dioxygenase(NOD) leads to the inhibition of HOCl signaling, but also to abrogation of H2O2-mediated interference with HOCl signaling. Vice versa, an increase in extracellular H2O2 through increasing the cell density, gamma irradiation or addition of glucose oxidase inhibits NO/peroxynitrite signaling. These mutual reactions between NO and H2O2/HOCl are catalyzed by an iron-mediated reaction cycle, which allows consumption of NO by H2O2/HOCl and vice versa. These reactions explain the preferences of tumor cell lines for NO/peroxynitrite or HOCl signaling after inhibition of their protective catalase, as well as the differential expression of these pathways dependent on the degree of catalase inhibition. The understanding of these reactions allows to rationally modulate quality and strength of ROS/RNS-dependent apoptosis-inducing signaling pathways of malignant cells. The knowledge about these reactions should allow to optimize strategies for tumor therapy that are based on reactivation of intercellular ROS/RNS-dependent apoptosis-inducing signaling of tumor cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/498603v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4fbdb6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130063forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea2e67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18c85cb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights* NADPH oxidase and peroxidase drive apoptosis-inducing HOCl signaling\n* NADPH oxidase and NO synthase drive apoptosis-inducing NO/peroxynitrite signaling\n* H2O2 establishes and interferes with HOCl signaling, dependent on its concentration\n* NO inhibits HOCl signaling and abrogates H2O2-dependent inhibition of HOCl signaling\n* H2O2 interferes with NO/peroxnitrite signaling\n* Mutual interactions of NO and H2O2 are catalysed by an iron-mediated reaction cycle",

Yet, this information is still difficult to access for many scientists and for most genomes. To provide easy access and graphical summary to the status of genome function annotation for model organisms and bioenergy and food crop species, we created a web application (https://genomeannotation.rheelab.org) to visualize, search, and download genome annotation data for 28 species. The summary graphics and data tables will be updated semi-annually and snapshots will be archived to provide a historical record of the progress of genome function annotation efforts. Clear and simple visualization of updated gene function annotation, including the extent of what is unknown, will help address the grand challenge of elucidating functions of all genes in organisms.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry proteomics is a powerful tool in biomedical research but its usefulness is limited by the frequent occurrence of missing values in peptides that cannot be reliably quantified for particular samples. Many analysis strategies have been proposed for missing values where the discussion often focuses on distinguishing whether values are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). We argue here that missing values should always be viewed as MNAR in label-free proteomics because physical missing value mechanisms cannot be identified for individual points and because the probability of detection is related to underlying intensity. We show that the probability of detection can be accurately modeled by a logit linear curve. The curve asymptotes close to 100%, limiting the potential role of missing values unrelated to intensity. The curve is also incompatible with simple censoring mechanisms. We propose a statistical method for estimating the detection probability curve as a function of the underlying intensity, whether observed or not. The model quantifies the bias of missing intensities as compared to those that are observed. The model demonstrates that missing values are informative and suggests possible approaches to imputation and differential expression.",

    "abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs), i.e. the covalent cut of the DNA backbone over both strands, are a detrimental outcome of cell irradiation, bearing chromosomal aberrations and leading to cell apoptosis. In the early stages of the evolution of a DSB, the disruption of the residual interactions between the DNA moieties drives the fracture of the helical layout; in spite of its biological significance, the details of this process are still largely uncertain. Here, we address the mechanical rupture of DNA by DSBs via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations: the setup involves a 3855-bp DNA filament and diverse DSB motifs, i.e. within a range of distances between strand breaks (or DSB distance). By employing a coarse-grained model of DNA, we access the molecular details and characteristic timescales of the rupturing process. A sequence-nonspecific, linear correlation is observed between the DSB distance and the internal energy contribution to the disruption of the residual (Watson-Crick and stacking) contacts between DNA moieties, which is seemingly driven by an abrupt, cooperative process. Moreover, we infer an exponential dependence of the characteristic rupture times on the DSB distances, which we associate to an Arrhenius law of thermally-activated processes. This work lays the foundations of a detailed, mechanistic assessment of DSBs in silico, as a benchmark to both numerical simulations and data from single molecule experiments.",

In liver cancer, TLSs have been reported to be pro-tumorigenic as they harbor tumor progenitor cells and nurture their growth. The processes involved in TLS development and acquisition of pro- or anti-tumorigenic phenotype in cancer are largely unknown. RORc expressing immune cells have been previously implicated in TLS formation, however we find that they are not necessary for TLS neogenesis in the liver under chronic inflammation conditions. On the contrary, RORc expressing cells rather negatively regulate TLS formation, since in their absence TLSs form in excess. Importantly, in chronically inflamed livers lacking RORc expressing cells, pro-tumorigenic TLSs become anti-tumorigenic, resulting in reduction of tumor load. Comparing liver pro- and anti-tumorigenic TLSs by transcriptional, proteomic and immunohistochemical analyses, revealed an enrichment of exhausted CD8 cells that retained effector functions and had a progenitor-like proliferative phenotype in anti-tumorigenic TLSs. Similar observations were found when comparing pro- and anti-tumorigenic TLSs in human tissues. Thus, RORc expressing cells negatively regulate CD8 cell abundance, and facilitate the pro-tumorigenic functions of hepatic TLSs.",

Among the outstanding questions in pancreatic cancer biology are the causes and consequences of genomic heterogeneity observed in the disease. However, to use pancreatic cancer organoids as a model to study genomic variations, we need to first understand the degree of genomic heterogeneity and its stability within organoids. Here, we used single-cell whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genomic heterogeneity of two independent pancreatic cancer organoids, as well as their genomic stability with extended culture. Clonal populations with similar copy number profiles were observed within the organoids, and the proportion of these clones was shifted with extended culture, suggesting the growth advantage of some clones. However, sub-clonal genomic heterogeneity was also observed within each clonal population, indicating the genomic instability of the pancreatic cancer cells themselves. Furthermore, our transcriptomic analysis also revealed a positive correlation between copy number alterations and gene expression regulation, suggesting the functionality of these copy number alterations.",

    "abstract": "Asian honey bee Apis cerana is the original host for Nosema ceranae, a unicellular fungal parasite that causes bee nosemosis throughout the world. Currently, interaction between A. cerana and N. ceranae is largely unknown. Here, based on our previously gained high-quality RNA-seq and small RNA-seq data from N. ceranae-infected A. c. cerana workers midguts and clean spores, differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmiRNAs) in N. ceranae targeted by DEmiRNAs in host midguts and A. c. cerana DEmRNAs targeted by microsporidian DEmiRNAs were predicted using bioinformatics, and then target DEmRNAs in microsporidian and host were annotated and investigated, with a focus on targets involved in N. ceranae glycolysis/glyconeogenesis and virulence factors as well as A. c. cerana energy mechanism and immune response. Its found that 97 down-regulated (60 up-regulated) mRNAs in NcCKM vs NcTM1 were potentially targeted by eight up-regulated (six down-regulated) miRNAs in AcCKMI1 vs AcTMI1, 44 down-regulated (15 up-regulated) mRNAs in NcCKM vs NcTM2 were putative targets of seven up-regulated (two down-regulated) miRNAs in AcCKMI2 vs AcTMI2. Additionally, miR-60-y and miR-676-y were found to up-regulate in AcCKMI1 vs AcTMI1 and target genes engaged in spore wall protein and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, while miR-60-y in AcCKMI1 vs AcTMI1 was up-regulated and potentially targeted a glycolysis/gluconeogenesis-associated gene. Comparatively, 343 down-regulated (138 up-regulated) mRNAs in AcCKM1 vs AcTM1 were putative targets of 121 up-regulated (112 down-regulated) miRNAs in NcCKMI vs NcTMI1, 247 down-regulated (110 up-regulated) mRNAs were putatively targeted by 110 up-regulated (104 down-regulated) miRNAs in NcCKMI vs NcTMI2. Further analysis showed that 31 up-regulated miRNAs in NcCKMI vs NcTMI1 potentially targeted 12 down-regulated mRNAs in AcCKM1 vs AcTM1, which were involved in five immune-related pathways such as phagasome and Jak-STAT signaling pathway, whereas nine up-regulated miRNAs in NcCKMI vs NcTMI2 putatively targeted five down-regulated mRNAs in AcCKM2 vs AcTM2, which were engaged in three immune-related pathways including endocytosis, lysosomes, and regulation of autophagy. In addition, miR-21-x was observed to up-regulate in NcCKMI vs NcTMI1 and target a oxidative phosphorylation-related gene. Finally, potential targeting relationship between two host DEmiRNAs-microsporidian DEmRNAs pairs and two microsporidian DEmiRNAs-host DEmRNAs pairs were verified on basis of RT-qPCR. Our findings not only lay a foundation for exploring the molecular mechanism underlying cross-kingdom regulation between A. c. cerana workers and N. ceranae, but also offer valuable insights into Asian honey bee-microsporidian interaction.",

    "abstract": "The leaf epidermis is the outermost cell layer forming the interface between plants and the atmosphere that must both provide a robust barrier against (a)biotic stressors and facilitate carbon dioxide uptake and leaf transpiration 1. To achieve these opposing requirements, the plant epidermis developed a wide range of specialized cell types such as stomata and hair cells. While factors forming these individual cell types are known 2-5, it is poorly understood how their number and size is coordinated. Here, we identified a role for BdPRX76/BdPOX, a class III peroxidase, in regulating hair cell and stomatal size in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. In bdpox mutants prickle hair cells were smaller and stomata were longer. Because stomatal density remained unchanged, the negative correlation between stomatal size and density was disrupted in bdpox and resulted in higher stomatal conductance and lower intrinsic water-use efficiency. BdPOX was exclusively expressed in hair cells suggesting that BdPOX cell-autonomously promotes hair cell size and indirectly restricts stomatal length. Cell wall autofluorescence and lignin stainings indicated a role for BdPOX in lignification or crosslinking of related phenolic compounds at the hair cell base. Ectopic expression of BdPOX in the stomatal lineage increased phenolic autofluorescence in guard cell walls and restricted stomatal elongation in bdpox. Together, we highlight a developmental interplay between hair cells and stomata that optimizes epidermal functionality. We propose that cell-type-specific changes disrupt this interplay and lead to compensatory developmental defects in other epidermal cell types.",

The CS membrane domain (CSD) proteins 1-5 (CASP1-5) define and accumulate at the CS associated membrane domains displaying matrix adhesion and protein exclusion. A full CASP knock-out (caspQ) now reveals that CASPs are not needed for localization of lignification or lignin-polymerizing enzymes, since correctly aligned spots still form in the mutant. Ultra-structurally, however, these spots appear as highly disorganized secretory foci, with neither exclusion zone nor membrane attachment and excessive cell wall growth. Biotin proximity labelling identifies RabA-GTPases as potential CASP-interactors. We confirm their localisation and function at the CSD, similar to exocyst subunits, known Rab effectors. Our work reveals that CASPs enforce displacement of initial secretory foci through exclusion of vesicle tethering factors, thereby ensuring rapid fusion of microdomains and effective sealing of the cell wall space.",

    "abstract": "Understanding societies of individuals is a challenging task. In several ant species individuals seem to have the same physical characteristics and, in principle, could assume any role the social environment requires. However, most ants societies present a caste organization in their colonies with particular roles. For the biologist understanding the complex dynamics ruling a colony is hard due to the difficulty of collecting and classifying long term ant activities in the field. The relocation phenomena which generally correspond to perturbation phases suffered by ant colonies are critical moments in the colony history and require rapid and effective response from workers in order to ensure the survival of the colony and its setup in a new safe nest. How the colonial group deals with this process? Is there a particular organization of the workers during the relocation periods? Here, we applied an experimentally induced protocol in the laboratory combined with behavioral observations and hierarchical classifications in order to identify social roles in a ponerine species, Paraponera clavata, and the repartition of labor during two resting periods and two relocation phases. The method provided significant information concerning the social dynamics of ant colonies and contribute to understand how species copes with a novel and stressing situation conducing to the occupation of a novel available nest.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSynapses and spines are central in major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology, recently highlighted by ketamines and psilocybins rapid antidepressant effects. The Bayesian brain and interoception perspectives formalize MDD as being \"stuck\" in affective states constantly predicting negative energy balance. We examined how synaptic atrophy relates to the predictive function of the neocortex and thus to symptoms, using temporal memory (TM), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm. TM represents a single neocortical layer, learns in real-time using local Hebbian-learning rules, and extracts and predicts temporal sequences.\n\nMethodsWe trained a TM model on random sequences of upper-case alphabetical letters, representing sequences of affective states. To model depression, we progressively destroyed synapses in the TM model and examined how that affected the predictive capacity of the network.\n\nResultsDestroying 50% of the synapses slightly reduced the number of predictions, followed by a marked drop with further destruction. However, reducing the synapses by 25% dropped the confidence in the predictions distinctly. So even though the network was making accurate predictions, the network was no longer confident about these predictions.\n\nConclusionsThese findings explain how interoceptive cortices could be stuck in limited affective states with high prediction error. Growth of new synapses, e.g., with ketamine and psilocybin, would allow representing more futuristic predictions with higher confidence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the TM model to connect changes happening at synaptic levels to the Bayesian formulation of psychiatric symptomatology, making it possible to understand treatment mechanisms and possibly, develop new treatments.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

We benchmark the adaptive filters performance against existing nonlinear Kalman filters and explore the sensitivity of the filter parameters to the system being modelled.

Nevertheless, it is not well understood how such synchrony is achieved and maintained in a complex network of time-delayed neural interactions. Myelin plasticity has been suggested as an efficient mechanism for controlling timing in brain communications through adaptive changes of axonal conduction velocity and consequently conduction time delays, or latencies; however, local rules and feedback mechanisms that oligodendrocytes (OL) use to achieve synchronization are not known. We propose a mathematical model of oligodendrocyte-mediated myelin plasticity (OMP) in which OL play an active role in providing such feedback. This is achieved without using arrival times at the synapse or modulatory signaling from astrocytes; instead, it relies on the presence of global and transient OL responses to local action potentials in the axons they myelinate. While inspired by OL morphology, we provide the theoretical underpinnings that motivated the model and explore its performance for a wide range of its parameters. Our results indicate that when the characteristic time of OLs spike responses is between 10 and 40 ms and the firing rates in individual axons are relatively low ([lap] 10 Hz), the OMP model efficiently synchronizes correlated and time-locked signals while latencies in axons carrying independent signals are unaffected. This suggests a novel form of selective synchronization in the CNS in which oligodendrocytes play an active role by modulating the conduction delays of correlated spike trains as they traverse to their targets.\n\nSignificance StatementSynchronization of signals arriving from different neurons or brain regions is of great importance for proper brain function. In vertebrates, myelination provides an efficient way to achieve this by adjusting the conduction velocity and consequently the conduction delays. It is increasingly evident that myelination is an adaptive process and involved in learning; however, the local rules and the feedback that guide oligodendrocytes towards achieving desired delays are not known. Here we propose a simple and biologically plausible model of myelin plasticity in which oligodendrocytes play an active role in providing the needed feedback. We use theoretical arguments, mathematical modeling and computer simulations to show its robust synchronization capabilities which enable efficient communication between the brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Much work has examined the process of canceling or inhibiting an impending action. However, the converse process of initiating a movement has, comparatively, been much less studied. Action initiation and action inhibition are generally considered to be independent and qualitatively distinct processes, while the exact relationship between these processes remains unclear. One respect in which action initiation and action inhibition are often thought to differ is in their speed; action inhibition is typically considered to be faster than action initiation, which allows for impending actions to be inhibited before they are initiated. This apparent contrast is, however, largely observed in tasks in which there is much greater urgency to inhibit an action that there is to initiate an action. This asymmetry in the urgency between action initiation and action inhibition, as well as other asymmetries in how action initiation and inhibition are cued, make it impossible to compare their relative time courses. Here, we demonstrate that, when action initiation and action inhibition are measured under conditions that are matched as closely as possible, their speed is the same. In light of this, we suggest that action initiation and action inhibition may not necessarily be qualitatively distinct processes, but may instead reflect two opposing states of a single process supporting a decision about whether to act or not. This perspective carries significant implications for computational models and presumed neural mechanisms of action control.",

In the dynamic analysis of viral genome shotgun metagenomic of samples from lower gastrointestinal tract of the Apc+/1638N and C57BL/6 mice with H. pylori infection and eradication, stable viral abundance and replacement of bursted unique viral contigs in infected and uninfected Apc+/1638N mice were observed. Temperate phages, which encoding comprehensive microbial functional genes and targeting various susceptible hosts, were expanded extremely prior to cancer exacerbation. In addition, short-term antibiotic exposure for H. pylori eradication was able to alter the gut virome and thrive the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the viral genome for at least 6 months. Collectively, these results point toward a potential role of the altered, but dynamically balanced gut virome, characterized by the expanded temperate phages, in contributing to the H. pylori-driven CRC, and indicate that viral genome may act as ARG reservoir for the antibiotic resistance of bacteria after the antibiotics therapy to H. pylori eradication.",

Using a mouse model of a clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutation, DNMT3AR882/+ (Dnmt3aR878H/+), we found that aging-induced TNF signaling promoted the selective advantage of mutant HSCs as well as stimulated mutant B lymphoid cell production. Genetic loss of TNF receptor TNFR1 impaired mutant HSC fitness without altering lineage output, while loss of TNFR2 reduced lymphoid cell production and favored myeloid cell production from mutant HSCs without altering overall fitness. These results support a model where clone size and mature blood lineage production can be independently controlled to harness potential beneficial aspects of clonal hematopoiesis.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThrough identification and dissection of TNF signaling as a key driver of murine Dnmt3a-mutant hematopoiesis, we report the discovery that clone size and production of specific mature blood cell types can be independently regulated.",

    "abstract": "Automated cell segmentation from optical microscopy images is usually the first step in the pipeline of single-cell analysis. Recently, deep-learning based algorithms have shown superior performances for the cell segmentation tasks. However, a disadvantage of deep-learning is the requirement for a large amount of fully-annotated training data, which is costly to generate. Weakly-supervised and self-supervised learning is an active research area, but often the model accuracy is inversely correlated with the amount of annotation information provided. Here we focus on a specific subtype of incomplete annotations, which can be generated programmably from experimental data, thus allowing for more annotation information content without sacrificing the annotation speed. We designed a new model architecture for end-to-end training using such incomplete annotations. We benchmarked our method on a variety of publicly available dataset, covering both fluorescence and bright-field imaging modality. We additionally tested our method on a microscopy dataset generated by us, using machine generated annotations. The results demonstrated that our model trained under weak-supervision can achieve segmentation accuracy competitive to, and in some cases surpassing, state-of-the-art models trained under full supervision. Therefore, our method can be a practical alternative to the established full-supervision methods.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection enriches genotypes that are well-adapted to their environment. Over successive generations, these changes to the frequencies of types accumulate information about the selective conditions. Thus, we can think of selection as an algorithm by which populations acquire information about their environment. Kimura (1961) pointed out that every bit of information that the population gains this way comes with a minimum cost in terms of unrealized fitness (substitution load). Due to the gradual nature of selection and ongoing mismatch of types with the environment, a population that is still gaining information about the environment has lower mean fitness than a counter-factual population that already has this information. This has been an influential insight, but here we find that experimental evolution of Escherichia coli with mutations in a RNA polymerase gene (rpoB) violates Kimuras basic theory. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of Kimuras substitution load and develop a more robust measure for the cost of selection, we turn to ideas from computational learning theory. We reframe the  learning problem faced by an evolving population as a population versus environment (PvE) game, which can be applied to settings beyond Kimuras theory - such as stochastic environments, frequency-dependent selection, and arbitrary environmental change. We show that the learning theoretic concept of  regret measures relative lineage fitness and rigorously captures the efficiency of selection as a learning process. This lets us establish general bounds on the cost of information acquisition by natural selection. We empirically validate these bounds in our experimental system, showing that computational learning theory can account for the observations that violate Kimuras theory. Finally, we note that natural selection is a highly effective learning process in that selection is an asymptotically optimal algorithm for the problem faced by evolving populations, and no other algorithm can consistently outperform selection in general. Our results highlight the centrality of information to natural selection and the value of computational learning theory as a perspective on evolutionary biology.",

Complexity of rs-fMRI time-series, measured by entropy values, have recently been reported to decrease with aging, APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype and cognitive decline in AD. Here we hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index for tau-related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD process.\n\nData were obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative phase 3 (ADNI3) and the Estudio de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer en Jalisciences (EEAJ) study, including cognitively normal elderly controls, persons with late onset AD (LOAD) and early onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) patients and their relatives. Our cohort consisted of a sample of 147 subjects from ADNI3 and 41 subjects from EEAJ with T1 structural, tau-PET (tracer: 18F-AV1451) and fMRI scans. Correlations between SUVR tau-PET and multi-scale entropy (MSE) were calculated voxelwise as well as for standard automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas regions while accounting for age, gender, and regional gray matter volume. Potential pathways relating MSE to cognitive function mediated through tau-PET were assessed by path analysis.\n\nWe found significant negative correlations between low frequency MSE and tau-PET measures in medial temporal lobe, in both ADNI3 and EEAJ cohorts. Furthermore, low frequency MSE showed significant associations with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and the Mini-Mental State Status Exam (MMSE) scores in both ADNI3 and EEAJ cohorts, which were largely mediated through the tau-PET signal.\n\nCorrelations of MSE with tau-PET in temporal lobes support our hypothesis that the complexity of rs-fMRI is associated with regional tau protein accumulation. Furthermore, the association of MSE with CDR and MMSE, mediated by tau-PET, in disease relevant areas suggests that a reduction in MSE is indicative of decreased information processing capacity and cognitive decline in AD processes.",
