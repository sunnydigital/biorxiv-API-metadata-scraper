    "abstract": "Hybridization and introgression between cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Q. ilex) have traditionally been reckoned as undesirable processes, since hybrid individuals lack the profitable bark characteristics of cork oak. Nevertheless, a systematic and quantitative description of the bark of these hybrids at the microscopic level based on a significant number of individuals was not available to date.\n\nIn this work we provide such a qualitative and quantitative description, identifying the most relevant variables for their classification. Hybrids show certain features intermediate between those of the parent species, as well as other unique features, as the general suberization of inactive phloem, reported here for the first time. These results suggest a relevant hybridization-induced modification of the genetic expression patterns. Therefore, hybrid individuals provide a valuable material to disentangle the molecular mechanisms underpinning bark development in angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "An unambiguous description of an experimental setup and analysis, and the subsequent biological observation is vital for accurate data interpretation and reproducible results. Consequently, experimental analyses should be described in a concise, unequivocal, and digestible manner. The aim of minimum information guidelines is to define the fundamental complement of data that can support an unambiguous conclusion on experimental observations. In this document, we present the Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (MIADE) guidelines to define the minimal fundamental parameters required for non-experts to understand the key findings of an experiment studying intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs). MIADE guidelines provide recommendations for data producers to describe the results of their experiments at source, for curators to annotate experimental data to community resources and for database developers maintaining community resources to disseminate the data. We give examples of the application of these guidelines in common use cases and describe the implementation of an update to the DisProt IDP database to allow MIADE-compliant annotation. The MIADE guidelines will improve the interpretability of experimental results for data consumers, facilitate direct data submission, simplify data curation, improve data exchange among repositories and standardise the dissemination of the key metadata on an IDP experiment by IDP data sources.",

    "abstract": "The inverse Ising model is used in computational neuroscience to infer probability distributions of the synchronous activity of large neuronal populations. This method allows for finding the Boltzmann distribution with single neuron biases and pairwise interactions that maximizes the entropy and reproduces the empirical statistics of the recorded neuronal activity. Here we apply this strategy to large populations of retinal output neurons (ganglion cells) of different types, stimulated by multiple visual stimuli with their own statistics. The activity of retinal output neurons is driven by both the inputs from upstream neurons, which encode the visual information and reflect stimulus statistics, and the recurrent connections, which induce network effects. We first apply the standard inverse Ising model approach, and show that it accounts well for the systems collective behavior when the input visual stimulus has short-ranged spatial correlations, but fails for long-ranged ones. This happens because stimuli with long-ranged spatial correlations synchronize the activity of neurons over long distances. This effect cannot be accounted for by pairwise interactions, and so by the pairwise Ising model. To solve this issue, we apply a previously proposed framework that includes a temporal dependence in the single neurons biases to model how neurons are driven in time by the stimulus. Thanks to this addition, the stimulus effects are taken into account by the biases, and the pairwise interactions allow for characterizing the network effect in the population activity and for reproducing the structure of the recurrent functional connections in the retinal architecture. In particular, the inferred interactions are strong and positive only for nearby neurons of the same type. Inter-type connections are instead small and slightly negative. Therefore, the retinal architecture splits into weakly interacting subpopulations composed of strongly interacting neurons. Overall, this temporal framework fixes the problems of the standard, static, inverse Ising model and accounts for the systems collective behavior, for stimuli with either short or long-range correlations.",

We could visualise ROIs around the border of human brain area V1/V2, and could demonstrate suitable imaging quality for Gleason score grading in prostate cancer samples.

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe highly polygenic and pleiotropic nature of behavioural traits, psychiatric disorders, and structural and functional brain phenotypes complicate mechanistic interpretation of related genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, such that the underlying causal biological processes remain obscure. We propose the novel method of genomic principal and independent component analysis (PCA, ICA) to decompose a large set of univariate GWAS statistics of multimodal brain traits into more interpretable latent genomic components. Here we introduce this new method and evaluate its various analytic parameters and reproducibility across independent samples.\n\nMethodsTwo releases of GWAS summary statistics from the UK biobank (UKB), with 11,086 and 22,138 participants respectively, were retrieved from the Oxford BIG-40 server. GWAS summary statistics were clumped resulting in n=165,364 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and m=2,240 imaging derived phenotypes (IDPs). Both genome-wide beta-values and their corresponding, standard-error scaled z-values were decomposed using multivariate exploratory linear optimised decomposition into independent components (MELODIC). We evaluated variance explained at multiple dimensions up to 200. We tested the reproducibility of output of dimensions 5, 10, 25, and 50 by computing Pearsons correlation between component loadings, and Fisher Exact tests on overlap of the top SNP loadings across samples. Reproducibility statistics of the original raw and z-transformed univariate GWAS served as benchmarks. We also inspected the clustering of genomic components across neuroimaging modalities using t-SNE.\n\nResultsThe first five PCs derived from z-transformed GWAS captured 31.9% of the variance across SNP effect sizes, while 200 PCs increased the variance explained to 79.6%. Reproducibility of 10-dimensional PCs and ICs showed the best balance between model complexity and robustness, and variance explained (PCs: |rz-max|=0.33, |rraw-max|=0.30; ICs: |rz-max|=0.23, |rraw-max|=0.19), with decreasing model stability and reproducibility at higher dimensions. Both genomic PC and IC reproducibilities improved substantially relative to mean univariate GWAS reproducibility up to a dimension of 10. Genomic components clustered along neuroimaging modalities.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that these novel methods of genomic ICA and PCA decompose genetic effects on IDPs from raw GWAS statistics with high reproducibility by taking advantage of the inherent pleiotropic patterns. These findings encourage further applications of genomic ICA and PCA as fully data-driven methods to effectively reduce the dimensionality, enhance the signal to noise ratio, and improve interpretability of high-dimensional multi-trait genome-wide analyses.",

    "abstract": "The mind affects the body via central nervous system (CNS) control of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In humans, one striking illustration of the mind-body connection is that illusions, subjectively perceived as bright, drive constriction of the eyes pupil by activating the sympathetic arm of the ANS. How the CNS is involved in this pupil response is unknown and requires an animal model for intracerebral investigation of potential regions, cell types, and neuronal projections. However, the physiological response to this illusion has long been thought to occur only in humans. Here, we report that the same brightness illusion that evokes pupil constriction in humans also does so in rats. Cortex-wide EEG recordings revealed that, compared to a luminance-matched control stimulus, the illusion (which appears subjectively brighter to humans) evoked a larger response only in primary visual cortex (V1). This cortical response preceded pupil constriction by ~335 msec suggesting a potential causal role for V1 on the pupil. Our results establish a new animal model of importance for studying how the CNS response involved in sensing a brightness illusion drives a physiological reaction in the body. We provide objective evidence that complex mind-body connections are not confined to humans and that V1 may be part of a shared, mammalian, neural network for bodily reactions to illusions.",

    "abstract": "People can seamlessly integrate a vast array of information from what we see and hear in the noisy and uncertain world. However, the neural underpinnings of audiovisual integration continue to be the topic of debate. Using strict inclusion criteria, we performed activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 121 neuroimaging experiments with a total of 2,092 participants. We found that audiovisual integration is linked with the coexistence of multiple integration sites including early cortical, subcortical, and higher association areas. Although activity was consistently found within the superior temporal cortex, different portions of this cortical region were identified depending on the analytical contrast used, complexity of the stimuli, and modality within which attention was directed. The context-dependent neural activity related to audiovisual integration suggests a flexible rather than fixed neural pathway for audiovisual integration. Together, our findings highlight a flexible multiple pathways model for audiovisual integration, with superior temporal cortex as the central node in these neural assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Experiments employing chronic monitoring of neurophysiological signals and video are commonly used in studies of epilepsy to characterize behavioral correlates of seizures. Our objective was to design a low-cost platform that enables chronic monitoring of several animals simultaneously, synchronizes bilateral local field potential and video streams in real-time, and parses recorded data into manageable file sizes. We present a hardware solution leveraging Intan and Open Ephys acquisition systems and a software solution implemented in Bonsai. The platform was tested in 48-hour continuous recordings simultaneously from multiple mice (male and female) with chronic epilepsy. To enable seizure detection and scoring, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that reads the data produced by our workflow and allows a user with no coding expertise to analyze events. Our Bonsai workflow was designed to maximize flexibility for a wide variety of experimental applications, and our use of the Open Ephys acquisition board would allow for scaling recordings up to 128 channels per animal.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe present a low-cost hardware and software solution intended for multi-animal chronic seizure monitoring, that prioritizes experimental freedom, and requires no coding expertise of the user. We provide details for using an Intan adapter board to enable user freedom regarding the type of electrodes used. Video and local field potential data streams are synchronized and parsed in Bonsai - an open-source visual programming language that has pre-written libraries that allow our workflow to be adapted to other data types or to integrate with open-source toolboxes. Finally, for those intending to use our platform for seizure monitoring, we provide an accessible GUI to aid in seizure detection and behavioral scoring.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal and the caudate networks, defined by their intrinsic resting state functional connectivity (FC), exhibit strong network specificity. This is reflected as strong within-network and weak between-network FC, as well as their dissociable roles in cognition. Aging typically reduces the specificity of brain networks. However, whether the hippocampal and caudate networks show age-related decreases in network specificity is unclear. Further, whether any age-related decreases in network specificity are due to reduced within-network FC, increased between-network FC, or some combination of both, is also unclear. Using a large-scale fMRI data set acquired from healthy younger (n = 101, aged 18-40 years) and older (n = 101, 55-75 years) adults, networks centered on the left anterior hippocampus and the head of the right caudate nucleus were compared. These sub-regions were chosen based on their distinct contributions to cognition, their known interactions, and their susceptibility to age-related changes. A mixed effect model was used to identify brain regions where network specificity differed between groups. For younger adults, hippocampal network specificity was strong in the medial frontal gyrus (MFG), while caudate network specificity was strong in the basal nuclei. However, network specificity in these same regions was significantly reduced in older adults. Reduced specificity in each network was due to a weakening of within-network connectivity rather than an increase in between-network connectivity. These results indicate that hippocampal and caudate network specificity decreases with advancing age, raising the possibility that these reductions may contribute to age-related changes in memory.\n\nImpact StatementOlder adults represent an increasing proportion of the population, thus increasing the urgency for us to understand the neurological changes that contribute to age-related memory loss. Aging is associated with a loss of network specificity, reflected as reduced within-network, and increased between-network, connectivity. My work shows that this phenomenon is not restricted to the hippocampal and caudate networks, which are critical for learning facts and skills, respectively: Both networks decreased in network functional connectivity. These results raise the possibility that \"blurring\" between these networks relates to age-related memory loss, possibly as a compensatory mechanism to protect memory in old age.",

    "abstract": "The \"cocktail party\" problem - how a listener perceives speech in noisy environments - is typically studied using speech (multi-talker babble) or noise maskers. However, realistic cocktail party scenarios often include background music (e.g., coffee shops, concerts). Studies investigating musics effects on concurrent speech perception have predominantly used highly controlled synthetic music or shaped noise which do not reflect naturalistic listening environments. Behaviorally, familiar background music and songs with vocals/lyrics inhibit concurrent speech recognition. Here, we investigated the neural bases of these effects. While recording multichannel EEG, participants listened to an audiobook while popular songs (or silence) played in the background at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Songs were either familiar or unfamiliar to listeners and featured either vocals or isolated instrumentals from the original audio recordings. Comprehension questions probed task engagement. We used temporal response functions (TRFs) to isolate cortical tracking to the target speech envelope and analyzed neural responses around 100 ms (i.e., auditory N1 wave). We found that speech comprehension was, expectedly, impaired during background music(s) compared to silence. Target speech tracking was further hindered by the presence of vocals. When masked by familiar music, response latencies to speech were less susceptible to informational masking, suggesting concurrent neural tracking of speech was easier during music known to the listener. These differential effects of music familiarity were further exacerbated in listeners with less musical ability. Our neuroimaging results and their dependence on listening skills are consistent with early attentional gain mechanisms where familiar music is easier to tune out (listeners already know the songs expectancies) and thus can allocate fewer attentional resources to the background music to better monitor concurrent speech material.",

While neural stem cells (NSCs) and common astrocytes have clearly distinct functions, they share highly similar transcriptome profiles. How stemness is molecularly encoded is therefore unclear. Here we use single-cell NMT-seq to simultaneously characterize the transcriptome, DNA methylome and chromatin accessibility of astrocytes and the NSC lineage in the healthy and ischemic brain. Our data reveal distinct methylation profiles associated with either astrocyte or stem cell function. Stemness is conferred by methylation of astrocyte genes and demethylation of neurogenic genes that are expressed only later. Surprisingly, ischemic injury unlocks the stemness-methylome in common astrocytes enabling generation of neuroblasts. Furthermore, we show that oligodendrocytes employ Tet-mediated demethylation to regulate expression of myelin-related genes, many of which are abnormally methylated in multiple sclerosis. Overall, we show that DNA methylation is a promising target for regenerative medicine.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499860v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149fe11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c71902org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13ae945org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a8d37e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The blind spot is both a necessity and a nuisance for seeing. It is the portion of the visual field projecting to where the optic nerve crosses the retina, a region devoid of photoreceptors and hence visual input. The precise way in which vision transitions into blindness at the blind spot border is to date unknown. A chief challenge to map this transition is the incessant movement of the eye, which unavoidably smears measurements across space. In this study, we used high-resolution eye-tracking and state-of-the-art retinal stabilization to finely map the blind spot borders. Participants reported the onset of tiny high-contrast probes that were briefly flashed at precise positions around the blind spot. This method has sufficient resolution to enable mapping of blood vessels from psychophysical measurements. Our data show that, even after accounting for eye movements, the transition zones at the edges of the blind spot are considerable. On the horizontal meridian, the regions with detection rates between 80% and 20% span approximately 25% of the overall width of the blind spot. These borders also vary considerably in size across different axes. These data show that the transition from full visibility to blindness at the blind spot border is not abrupt but occurs over a broad area.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundControllability is a measure of the brains ability to orchestrate neural activity which can be quantified in terms of properties of the brains network connectivity. Evidence from the literature suggests that aging can exert a general effect on whole-brain controllability. Mounting evidence, on the other hand, suggests that parenthood and motherhood in particular lead to long-lasting changes in brain architecture that effectively slow down brain aging. We hypothesize that parenthood might preserve brain controllability properties from aging.\n\nMethodsIn a sample of 814 healthy individuals (aged 33.9{+/-}12.7 years, 522 females), we estimate whole-brain controllability and compare the aging effects in subjects with vs. those without children. We use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to estimate the brain structural connectome. The level of brain control is then calculated from the connectomic properties of the brain structure. Specifically, we measure the network control over many low-energy state transitions (average controllability) and the network control over difficult-to-reach states (modal controllability).\n\nResults and conclusionIn nulliparous females, whole-brain average controllability increases, and modal controllability decreases with age, a trend that we do not observe in parous females. Statistical comparison of the controllability metrics shows that modal controllability is higher and average controllability is lower in parous females compared to nulliparous females. In men, we observed the same trend, but the difference between nulliparous and parous males do not reach statistical significance. Our results provide strong evidence that parenthood contradicts aging effects on brain controllability and the effect is stronger in mothers.",

    "abstract": "We have enquired into the neural activity which correlates with the experience of beauty aroused by abstract paintings consisting of arbitrary assemblies of lines and colours. During the brain imaging experiments, subjects rated abstract paintings according to aesthetic appeal. There was low agreement on the aesthetic classification of these paintings among participants. Univariate analyses revealed higher activity with higher declared aesthetic appeal in both the visual areas and the medial frontal cortex. Additionally, representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that the experience of beauty correlated with decodable patterns of activity in visual areas. These results are broadly similar to those obtained in previous studies on facial beauty. With abstract art, it was the involvement of visual areas implicated in the processing of lines and colours while with faces it was of visual areas implicated in the processing of faces. Both categories of aesthetic experience correlated with increased activity in medial frontal cortex. We conclude that the sensory areas participate in the selection of stimuli according to aesthetic appeal and that it is the co-operative activity between the sensory areas and the medial frontal cortex that is the basis for the experience of abstract visual beauty. Further, this co-operation is enabled by \"experience dependent\" functional connections, in the sense that currently the existence and high specificity of these connections can only be demonstrated during certain experiences.",

    "abstract": "The liver is a multitasking organ with essential functions for vertebrate health spanning metabolism and immunity. In contrast to mammals, our understanding of liver cellular heterogeneity and its role in regulating immunological status remains poorly defined in fishes. Addressing this knowledge gap, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of 47,432 nuclei isolated from the liver of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) contrasting control fish with those challenged with a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas salmonicida, a problematic bacterial pathogen in global aquaculture. We identified the major liver cell types and their sub-populations, revealing poor conservation of many hepatic cell marker genes utilized in mammals, while identifying novel heterogeneity within the hepatocyte, lymphoid, and myeloid lineages. This included polyploid hepatocytes, multiple T cell populations including {gamma}{delta} T cells, and candidate populations of monocytes/macrophages/dendritic cells. A dominant hepatocyte population radically remodeled its transcriptome following infection to activate the acute phase response and other defense functions, while repressing routine functions such as metabolism. These defense-specialized hepatocytes showed strong activation of genes controlling protein synthesis and secretion, presumably to support the release of acute phase proteins into circulation. The infection response further involved up-regulation of numerous genes in an immune-cell specific manner, reflecting functions in pathogen recognition and killing, antigen presentation, phagocytosis, regulation of inflammation, B cell differentiation and T cell activation. Overall, this study greatly enhances our understanding of the multifaceted role played by liver cells in immune defense and metabolic remodeling following infection and provides many novel cell-specific marker genes to empower future studies of this organ in fishes.",

    "abstract": "Microbially derived, protein-based biopesticides offer a more sustainable pest management alternative to synthetic pesticides. Vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip3), multidomain proteins secreted by Bacillus thuringiensis, represent a second-generation insecticidal toxin that have been used in transgenic crops. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Vip3s toxicity is poorly understood. Here, we determine the distinct functions and contributions of the domains of the Vip3Aa protein to its toxicity against Spodoptera frugiperda larvae. Vip3Aa domains II and III (DII-DIII) bind the midgut epithelium, while DI maintains the tetrameric state of the Vip3Aa protoxin, which is essential for its stability and toxicity. DI-DIII can be activated by midgut proteases, and exhibits ex vivo cytotoxicity similar to full-length Vip3Aa. We also determine that DV binds the peritrophic matrix via its glycan-binding activity, which is essential for Vip3Aa insecticidal activity. We further show that Vip3Aa has multiple protease activation sites and that introducing additional cleavage sites between DI and DII can increase the proteolysis efficiency and boost Vip3Aa insecticidal potency. This study provides insights into Vip3Aas mode-of-action and demonstrates a proof-of-concept strategy to enhance the insecticidal potency of Vip3Aa, which should significantly improve its application and development as a biopesticide.",

To explore the potential impact of vaccine-induced immunity targeting the HA stem, we examined the fitness effects of viral escape from stem-binding broadly neutralizing antibodies (stem-bnAbs). Recombinant viruses containing each individual antibody escape substitution showed diminished replication compared to wild-type virus, indicating that stem-bnAb escape incurred fitness costs. A second-site mutation in the HA head domain (N133D) reduced the fitness effects observed in primary cell cultures and likely enabled the selection of escape mutations. This putative permissive mutation was not, however, sufficient to ease fitness costs in a ferret transmission model. Taken together, these data suggest that viral escape from stem-bnAbs is costly but highlight the potential for epistatic interactions to enable evolution within the functionally constrained HA stem domain.",

    "abstract": "The colonic epithelium is the most rapidly renewing tissue in the body and is organized into a single cell layer of invaginations called crypts. Crypt renewal occurs through Lgr5+ gut stem cells situated at the crypt base, which divide, produce daughter cells that proliferate, migrate, differentiate into all the cells required for normal gut function (eg. Goblet cells, enterocytes), and are finally shed into the crypt lumen. In health this rapid renewal helps maintain barrier function next to the hostile gut luminal environment that contains microbes and food. In parallel, the peri-cryptal lamina propria hosts the largest monocyte-derived macrophage population in the human body. Different macrophage phenotypes have been associated with intestinal health/intact barrier function, namely M2 compared to M1 macrophages that indicate inflammation/compromised barrier function. However, the direct effect of different macrophage subtypes have on colonic crypt renewal is not well understood. In this study we have utilized a reductionist 3D in vitro co-culture model to determine the regulatory capacity of M1 and M2 macrophages on colonic crypt renewal. We show that colonic crypt proliferation is increased in the presence of M1 or M2 macrophages, while we further demonstrate that a decrease in goblet and tuft cell expression as well as an increase in Lgr5+ stem cell numbers is only achieved through M1-crypt crosstalk in a contact dependent manner.",

We performed a multi-omics analysis of human limbal stem cells from the cornea and keratinocytes from the epidermis, and characterized their molecular signatures, highlighting their similarities and differences. Through gene regulatory network analyses, we identified shared and cell type-specific transcription factors that define specific cell fates, and established their regulatory hierarchy. Single-cell RNA-seq analyses of the cornea and the epidermis confirmed these shared and cell type-specific transcription factors. Notably, the shared and limbal stem cell-specific transcription factors can cooperatively target genes associated with corneal opacity. Importantly, we discovered that FOSL2, a direct PAX6 target gene, is a novel candidate associated with corneal opacity, and it regulates genes implicated in corneal diseases. By characterizing molecular signatures, our study unveils the regulatory circuitry governing the limbal stem cell fate and its association with corneal opacity.",

    "abstract": "PREMISEWe investigated whether phylogenetic conservatism can improve the performance of seed germinability prediction models. Previous studies in tallgrass prairie and alpine meadow revealed that seed morphological traits demonstrate phylogenetic conservatism. We hypothesized that phylogenetic conservatism in seed traits could help predict the seed germinability, under the assumption that seed traits contain phylogenetic signals.\n\nMETHODSWe measured seed germination percentage and seed morphological traits (seed mass, seed height, and seed surface area) on 34 native species from shortgrass prairie in North America. We supplemented these data with similar data from the literature on 11 more species. We calculated the robustness of the phylogenetic signal of each trait to the number of species sampled. We also compressed the phylogenetic distance matrix to a two-dimensional space, and applied the Akaike information criterion to evaluate the effects of phylogeny on seed germinability prediction models.\n\nKEY RESULTSWe found weak but significant phylogenetic signals in seed mass and seed height in the full data set. These phylogenetic signals were not able to improve seed germinability prediction model performance among shortgrass prairie species. Our robustness tests of phylogenetic signals using random sub-sampling showed that the detection rate of phylogenetic signals in seed mass was increased along with the expansion of species pool, and nearly 100% at 40 species. However, the detection rate of phylogenetic signals in seed height was constantly low, around 20%.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWhen the phylogenetic signals are weak, the phylogenetic position does not improve germinability prediction model performance. Therefore, phylogenetic signals detected during a single species pool calculation may not accurately reflect the phylogenetic conservatism of the trait in a plant community. We suggest testing for robustness of phylogenetic signals using random sub-sampling tests.",

    "abstract": "Fishery-independent longline surveys provide valuable data to monitor fish populations. However, competition for bait on the finite number of hooks leads to biased estimates of relative abundance when using simple catch-per-unit-effort methods. Numerous bias-correcting instantaneous-catch-rate methods have been proposed, modelling the bait removal times as independent random variables. However, experiments have cast doubts on the many assumptions required for these to accurately infer relative abundance. We develop a new approach by treating some observations as right-censored, acknowledging that observed catch counts are lower bounds of what they would have been in the absence of hook competition. Through simulation experiments we confirm that our approach consistently outperforms previous methods. We demonstrate performance of all methods on longline survey data of eleven species. Accounting for hook competition leads to large differences in relative indices (often -50% to +100%), with effects of hook competition varying between species (unlike other methods). Our method can be applied using existing statistical packages and can include environmental influences, making it a general and reliable method for analyzing longline survey data.",

Trait-based approaches provide a unique framework to detect the potential mechanisms of how this intensification affects biodiversity and alter ecosystem services. However, the potential relationship between arthropod traits and various types of habitats is still poorly understood, especially in subtropical vegetable agroecosystems.\n\nHere, we conducted a trait-based approach to evaluate the variable roles of different habitats on functional trait diversity and the structure of the arthropod community in brassica vegetable crops. Twenty-three conventional cruciferous vegetables fields were sampled over two years in three regions in Fujian, China. We found that the increasing proportion of non-brassica vegetable plantations and water bodies negatively affected the functional diversity of arthropods, whereas forest and grassland habitats showed a positive correlation, indicating habitat filtering for certain traits or trait combinations.\n\nThis study demonstrates the importance of landscape composition as an ecological filter for vegetable arthropod community, and identifies how the proportion of different habitats selected for or against specific functional traits. Our findings support that increasing forest and grassland areas adjacent to vegetable fields can play a vital role in promoting the functional diversity of arthropod communities. Since the natural enemy assemblages supported by these habitats bear combinations of diverse traits adapted to disturbance, they have the potential to enhance pest suppression in the highly variable environment of vegetable crops.",

SPEER was used to analyze leukocyte RNA encoding 63 hereditary cancer syndrome genes in 20,317 individuals undergoing clinical genetic testing.

Integrating SPEER results into variant interpretation allowed reclassification of VUS to P/LP in 0.4% and to B/LB in 5.9% of the 20,317 patients.

However, genome-wide scans do not identify the cells impacted by genetic polymorphisms on the risk haplotypes or the genes impacted by those variants. We have shown that genetic variants driving JIA risk are likely to affect both innate and adaptive immune functions. We provide additional evidence that JIA risk variants impact innate immunity.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe queried publicly available H3K4me1/H3K27ac ChIP-seq data in CD14+ monocytes to determine whether the linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks incorporating the SNPs that tag JIA risk loci showed enrichment for these epigenetic marks. We also queried monocyte/macrophage GROseq data, a functional readout of active enhancers. We defined the topologically associated domains (TADs) encompassing enhancers on the risk haplotypes and identified genes within those TADs expressed in monocytes. We performed ontology analyses of these genes to identify cellular processes that may be impacted by these variants. We also used whole blood RNAseq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data base to determine whether SNPs lying within monocyte GROseq peaks influence plausible target genes within the TADs encompassing the JIA risk haplotypes.\n\nResultsThe LD blocks encompassing the JIA genetic risk regions were enriched for H3K4me1/H3K27ac ChIPseq peaks (p=0.00021 and p=0.022) when compared to genome background. Eleven and sixteen JIA were enriched for resting and activated macrophage GROseq peaks, respectively risk regions (p=0.04385 and p=0.00004). We identified 321 expressed genes within the TADs encompassing the JIA haplotypes in human monocytes. Ontological analysis of these genes showed enrichment for multiple immune functions. Finally, we found that SNPs lying within the GROseq peaks are strongly associated with expression levels of plausible target genes in human whole blood.\n\nConclusionsThese findings support the idea that both innate and adaptive immunity are impacted by JIA genetic risk variants.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the rate of genetic gain for seed yield remains the primary breeding objective in both public and private soybean breeding programs. Genomic selection (GS) has the potential to accelerate the rate of genetic gain for soybean seed yield. To date, limited studies have empirically validated accuracy of GS and compared to phenotypic selection (PS), and none has been done for soybean breeding. This study conducted the first empirical validation of GS for increasing seed yield using over 1,500 lines and over 7 years (2010-2016) of replicated experiments in the University of Nebraska soybean breeding program. The study was designed to capture the varying genetic relatedness of the training population to three validation sets: two large bi-parental populations (TBP-1 and TBP-2), and a large validation set comprised of 457 pre-selected advanced lines derived from 45 bi-parental populations in the variety development program (TMP). We found that prediction accuracy (0.54) from our validation experiments was competitive with what we obtained from a series of cross-validation experiments (0.64). Both GS and PS were more effective for increasing population mean performance with similar realized gain but significantly greater than random selection (RS). We found a selection advantage of GS over PS where higher genetic gain and identification of top-performing lines was maximized at higher selection stringency from 10 to 20% selected proportion. GS led to at least 2% increase in the mean genetic similarity vs. PS and RS, potentially causing a minimal loss of genetic diversity. We showed that loss of genetic variance in the GS set was presumably due to a significant shift on allelic frequencies towards the extremes. Across all loci, an average increase of 0.04 in allelic frequency in the GS set was observed after selection, which is about 5% higher than the base population when no selection was made. Overall, we demonstrate that GS performed as effectively as PS, and the implementation of GS in a public soybean breeding program should be warranted mainly for reducing breeding cycle time and lowering cost per unit gain.",

    "abstract": "The comb of honeybees has long been the subject of curiosity and admiration. Its noteworthy features include the even hexagonal layout and the sharing of walls, both side walls and bases, that provide a maximum storage volume while using a minimum of wax for its construction. The efficiency of its structure relies on a regular layout where cells are positioned correctly relative to each other. Each new cell should be placed exactly between two previously constructed cells, a task made more difficult by the incomplete nature of cells at the edge of comb where the new ones are to be built. By offering bees shaped wax stimuli we have identified sub-cell scale shapes that trigger certain patterns of behaviour by honeycomb construction workers. These behaviours, we found, cause the creation of a new cell to be aligned to small concavities and for cell walls to be built mid-way between two such stimuli. We show that by responding to the form of partially constructed comb, the bees build the next iteration of cells and walls at the locations necessary for the repeated pattern of cells to continue.",

However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible multi-gene perturbations severely limits experimental interrogation. Here, we present GEARS, a method that can predict transcriptional response to both single and multi-gene perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from perturbational screens. GEARS is uniquely able to predict outcomes of perturbing combinations consisting of novel genes that were never experimentally perturbed by leveraging geometric deep learning and a knowledge graph of gene-gene relationships. GEARS has higher precision than existing approaches in predicting five distinct genetic interaction subtypes and can identify the strongest interactions more than twice as well as prior approaches. Overall, GEARS can discover novel phenotypic outcomes to multi-gene perturbations and can thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.",

    "abstract": "Due to complexity of RNA transcripts expressed in any given cell or tissue, the assembly of de novo transcriptomes still represents a computational challenge when compared to genome assemblies. A number of modern transcriptome assembly algorithms have been developed to meet this challenge, and each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses dependent on the transcript abundance and complexity of the biological sample that is sequenced. As such, we are seeking to develop a transcriptome assembly pipeline in which multiple transcriptomes are generated, merged, and then redundancies are filtered out to produce a final transcriptome that should contain full length sequences of all transcripts. However, it is almost impossible to evaluate the efficacies of such novel assembly pipelines using short read sequencing data derived from biological samples due to not knowing a priori the transcript abundance and complexity. Thus, to test our pipelines we developed RAFTS. This tool is used to generate simulated short read sequencing datasets using annotated genomic data from model species.",

    "abstract": "Protein function is a direct consequence of its sequence, structure and the arrangement at the binding site. Bioinformatics using sequence analysis is typically used to gain a first insight into protein function. Protein structures, on the other hand, provide a higher resolution platform into understanding functions. As the protein structural information is increasingly becoming available through experimental structure determination and through advances in computational methods for structure prediction, the opportunity to utilize this data is also increasing. Structural analysis of small molecule ligand binding sites in particular provide a direct and more accurate window to infer protein function. However it remains a poorly utilized resource due to the huge computational cost of existing methods that make large scale structural comparisons of binding sites prohibitive. Here we present an algorithm called FLAPP that produces very rapid atomic level alignments. By combining clique matching in graphs and the power of modern CPU architectures, FLAPP aligns a typical pair of binding site binding sites at ~12.5 milliseconds using a single CPU core, ~ 1 millisecond using 12 cores on a standard desktop machine, and performs a PDB-wide scan in 1-2 minutes. We perform rigorous validation of the algorithm at multiple levels of complexity and show that FLAPP provides accurate alignments. We also present a case study involving vitamin B12 binding sites to showcase the usefulness of FLAPP for performing an exhaustive alignment based PDB-wide scan. We expect this tool will be invaluable to the scientific community to quickly align millions of site pairs on a normal desktop machine to gain insights into protein function and drug discovery for drug target and off-target identification, and polypharmacology.",

    "abstract": "The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is an ancient transcriptional factor originally discovered as a sensor of dioxin. In addition to its function as receptor of environmental toxins, it plays an important role in development. Although a significant amount of research has been carried out to understand AHR signal transduction pathway and its involvement in species susceptibility to environmental toxins, none of them to date has comprehensively studied its evolutionary origins. Studying evolutionary origins of molecules can inform ancestral relationships of genes. Vertebrate genome has been shaped by two rounds of whole-genome duplications at the base of vertebrate evolution approximately 600 million years ago (Mya), followed by lineage specific gene losses, which often complicate assignment of functional homology. It is crucial to understand evolutionary origins of this transcription factor and its partners, in order to distinguish orthologs from ancient non-orthologous homologs. In this study, we have investigated evolutionary origins of proteins involved in the AHR pathway. Our results provide evidence of gene loss and duplications, crucial for understanding functional connectivity of human and model species. Multiple studies have shown that 2R-ohnologs (genes and proteins that have survived from the 2R-WGD) are enriched in signaling components relevant to developmental disorders and cancer. Our findings provide a link between AHR pathways evolutionary trajectory and its possible mechanistic involvement in pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are essential DNA-binding proteins that regulate the rate of transcription of several genes and controls the expression of genes inside a cell. The prediction of TFs with high precision is important for understanding number of biological processes such as cell-differentiation, intracellular signaling, cell-cycle control. In this study, we developed a hybrid method that combine alignment-based and alignment-free methods for predicting transcription factors with higher accuracy. All models have been trained, tested and evaluated on a large dataset that contain 19406 TFs and 523560 non-TFs protein sequences. In order to avoid biasness in evaluation, dataset is divided in training and validation/independent dataset, where 80% data was used for training and remaining 20% for external validation. In case of alignment-free methods, models are developed based on machine learning techniques using compositional features of a protein. Our best alignment-free model obtained AUC 0.97 on independent dataset. In case of alignment-based method, we used BLAST at different cut-off to predict transcription factors. Though alignment-based method shows excellent performance but unable to cover all transcription factor due to no-hits. In order to combine power of both, we developed a hybrid method that combine alignment-free and alignment-based method; achieved maximum AUC of 0.99 on independent dataset.

HTR was examined in a magnetometer-based assay.\n\nResults1) Psilocybin and escitalopram significantly reduced marble-burying. The effect of psilocybin was not attenuated by the 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907. The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT reduced marble-burying as did the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was additive to that of psilocybin but that of buspirone was not. The 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635, attenuated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone but not the effect of psilocybin. 2) Psilocybin injections over 3.5 hours had no effect on marble-burying and the effect of bolus injection was not persistent. 3) Co-administration of buspirone with psilocybin blocked its effect on HTR\n\nConclusionsNeither 5-HT2A nor 5-HT1A receptors are pivotally implicated in the effect of psilocybin on marble-burying. Co-administration with buspirone may block the psychedelic effects of psilocybin without impeding its anti-obsessional effects.",

    "abstract": "Fat accumulation during liver steatosis precedes inflammation and fibrosis in fatty liver diseases, and is associated with disease progression. Despite a large body of evidence that liver mechanics play a major role in liver disease progression, the effect of fat accumulation by itself on liver mechanics remains unclear. Thus, we conducted ex vivo studies of liver mechanics in rodent models of simple steatosis to isolate and examine the mechanical effects of intrahepatic fat accumulation, and found that fat accumulation softens the liver. Using a novel adaptation of microindentation to permit association of local mechanics with microarchitectural features, we found evidence that the softening of fatty liver results from local softening of fatty regions rather than uniform softening of the liver. These results suggest that fat accumulation itself exerts a softening effect on liver tissue. This, along with the localized heterogeneity of softening within the liver, has implications in what mechanical mechanisms are involved in the progression of liver steatosis to more severe pathologies and disease. Finally, the ability to examine and associate local mechanics with microarchitectural features is potentially applicable to the study of the role of heterogeneous mechanical microenvironments in both other liver pathologies and other organ systems.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is characterised by an age-related decrease in the number of muscle fibres and additional weakening of the remaining fibres, resulting in a reduction in muscle mass and function. Many studies associate poor maternal nutrition during gestation and/or lactation with altered skeletal muscle homeostasis in the offspring and the development of sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to determine whether the musculoskeletal physiology in offspring born to mouse dams fed a low-protein diet during pregnancy was altered and whether any physiological changes could be modulated by the nutritional protein content in early postnatal stages. Thy1-YFP female mice were fed ad libitum on either a normal (20%) or a low-protein (5%) diet. Newborn pups were cross-fostered to different lactating dams (maintained on 20% or 5% diet) to generate 3 groups analysed at weaning (21 days): Normal-to-Normal (NN), Normal-to-Low (NL) and Low-to-Normal (LN). Further offspring were maintained ad libitum on the same diet as during lactation until 12 weeks of age creating another 3 groups (NNN, NLL, LNN). Mice on a low protein diet postnatally (NL, NLL) exhibited a significant reduction in body and muscle weight persisting up to 12 weeks, unlike mice on a low protein diet only prenatally (LN, LNN). Muscle fibre size was reduced in mice from the NL but not LN group, showing recovery at 12 weeks of age. Muscle force was reduced in NLL mice, concomitant with changes in the NMJ site and changes in atrophy-related and myosin genes. In addition, CT scans of mouse tibiae at 12 weeks of age revealed changes in bone mass and morphology, resulting in a higher bone mass in the NLL group than the control NNN group. Finally, changes in the expression of miR-133 in the muscle of NLL mice suggest a regulatory role for this microRNA in muscle development in response to postnatal diet changes. Overall, this data shows that a low maternal protein diet and early postnatal life low-protein intake in mice can impact skeletal muscle physiology and function in early life while postnatal low protein diet favors bone integrity in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "The health benefits of regular physical exercise are well known. Even so, there is increasing evidence that the exercise regimes of elite athletes can evoke cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and even sudden cardiac death (SCD). The mechanism of exercise-induced arrhythmia and SCD is poorly understood. While some studies after endurance training have been performed in small animals these have limited translation value.\n\nHere, we show that chronic training in a canine model (12 sedentary and 12 trained dogs) that mimics the regime of elite athletes induces electrophysiological remodeling (measured by ECG, patch-clamp and immunocytochemical techniques) resulting in increases of both the trigger and the substrate for ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, 4 months sustained training lengthened ventricular repolarization (QTc: 213.6{+/-}2.8 ms vs. 237.1{+/-}3.4 ms, n=12; APD90: 370.1{+/-}32.7 ms vs. 472.8{+/-}29.6 ms, n=25 vs. 29), decreased transient outward potassium current (8.8{+/-}0.9 pA/pF vs. 6.4{+/-}0.5 pA/pF at 50 mV, n=42 vs. 54) and increased the short term variability of repolarization (17.5{+/-}4.0 ms vs. 29.5{+/-}3.8 ms, n=18 vs. 27). Left ventricular fibrosis and HCN4 protein expression were also enhanced. These changes were associated with enhanced ectopic activity (number of extrasystoles: 4/hour vs. 366/hour) in vivo and arrhythmia susceptibility (elicited ventricular fibrillation: 3 of 10 sedentary dogs vs. 6 of 10 trained dogs).\n\nOur findings provide in vivo, cellular electrophysiological and molecular biological evidence for the enhanced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia in an experimental large animal model of endurance training.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy serves as an important recycling route for growth and survival of eukaryotic organisms in nutrient-deficient conditions. When confronted with starvation, metabolic flux is coordinated by individual metabolic enzymes. Given that the metabolic diversity of carbon in eukaryotes is related to their lifestyle, autophagy may be modulated by metabolic enzymes by monitoring carbon flux. Here, we attempted to identify carbon metabolic genes that modulate autophagy using VIGS screening of 45 glycolysis- and the Calvin-Benson cycle-related genes. We report here that three consecutive triose-phosphate-processing enzymes involved in the cytosolic glycolysis, TPI (triose-phosphate-isomerase), GAPC (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase), designated TGP, negatively regulate autophagy. Depletion of TGP enzymes result in spontaneous autophagy induction and increases ATG1 kinase activity. TGP enzymes interact with ATG101, a regulatory component of the ATG1 kinase complex. Spontaneous autophagy induction and abnormal growth under insufficient sugar in the TGP mutants is suppressed by crossing with the atg101 mutant. Considering that triose-phosphates are photosynthates transported to the cytosol from active chloroplasts, the TGP enzymes may be strategically positioned to monitor the flow of photosynthetic sugars and modulate autophagy accordingly. Collectively, these results suggest that TGP enzymes negatively control autophagy acting upstream of the ATG1 complex, which is critical for seedling development.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a biphasic malignant clonal disorder that progresses, first with a chronic phase, where the cells have enhanced proliferation only, and then to a blast phase, where the cells have the ability of self-renewal. It is well-recognized that the Philadelphia chromosome (which contains the BCR-ABL fusion gene) is the \"hallmark of CML\". However, empirical studies have shown that the mere presence of BCR-ABL may not be a sufficient condition for the development of CML, and further modifications related to tumor suppressors may be necessary. Accordingly, we develop a three-mutation stochastic model of CML progression, with the three stages corresponding to the non-malignant cells with BCR-ABL presence, the malignant cells in the chronic phase and the malignant cells in the blast phase. We demonstrate that the model predictions agree with age incidence data from the United States. Finally, we develop a framework for the retrospective estimation of the time of onset of malignancy, from the time of detection of the cancer.",

The increased [Formula] -inhomogeneity at [&ge;] 7T and significantly larger saturation pulse flip angles which are often used for postmortem studies exceed the limits where previous MTsat [Formula] correction methods are applicable. Here, we develop a calibration-based correction model and procedure, and validate and evaluate it in postmortem 7T data of whole chimpanzee brains.\n\nTheoryThe [Formula] dependence of MTsat was investigated by varying the off-resonance saturation pulse flip angle. For the range of saturation pulse flip angles applied in typical experiments on postmortem tissue, the dependence was close to linear. A linear model with a single calibration constant C is proposed to correct bias in MTsat by mapping it to the reference value of the saturation pulse flip angle.\n\nMethodsC was estimated voxel-wise in five postmortem chimpanzee brains. \"Individual-based global parameters\" were obtained by calculating the mean C within individual specimen brains and \"group-based global parameters\" by calculating the means of the individual-based global parameters across the five brains.\n\nResultsThe linear calibration model described the data well, though C was not entirely independent of the underlying tissue and [Formula]. Individual-based and group-based global correction parameters (C = 1.2) led to visible, quantifiable reductions of [Formula]-biases in high resolution MTsat maps.\n\nConclusionThe presented model and calibration approach effectively corrects for [Formula] in-homogeneities in postmortem 7T data.",

High spatial/temporal resolution angiograms and low spatial/temporal resolution perfusion images can be flexibly reconstructed from the same raw k-space data at any timepoint within the readout. A constant flip angle (CFA) and a quadratic variable flip angle (VFA) excitation schedule were optimized through simulations and tested in healthy volunteers. A conventional sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction was compared against a locally low rank (LLR) reconstruction, which leverages spatiotemporal correlations to improve reconstruction quality. Differences in image quality were assessed through split-scan repeatability.\n\nResultsThe optimized VFA schedule (2-9{degrees}) reduced initial signal attenuation whilst boosting the signal at later timepoints, resulting in a significant (p < 0.001) improvement in image quality (up to 84%), particularly for the lower SNR perfusion images. The LLR reconstruction provided effective denoising without biasing the signal timecourses, significantly improving angiographic and perfusion imaging repeatability (up to 143%, p < 0.001) and enabling the clear depiction of small distal vessels and late tissue perfusion.\n\nConclusion4D CAPRIA can be optimized using a VFA schedule and LLR reconstruction to yield whole head 4D angiograms and perfusion images from a single scan.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to understand microglia function in health and diseases have been hindered by the lack of culture models that recapitulate in situ cellular properties. In recent years, the use of serum-free media with brain-derived growth factors (CSF1R ligands and TGF-{beta}1/2) have been favored for the maintenance of rodent microglia as they promote morphological features observed in situ. Here we study the functional and transcriptomic impacts of such media on human microglia. Media formulation had little impact on microglia transcriptome assessed by RNA sequencing which was sufficient to significantly alter microglia capacity to phagocytose myelin debris and to elicit an inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide. When compared to immediately ex vivo microglia from the same donors, the addition of fetal bovine serum to culture media, but not growth factors, was found to aid in the maintenance of key signature genes including those involved in phagocytic processes. A phenotypic shift characterized by CSF1R downregulation in culture correlated with a lack of reliance on CSF1R signaling for survival. Consequently, no improvement in cell survival was observed following culture supplementation with CSF1R ligands. Our study provides better understanding of human microglia in culture, with observations that diverge from those previously made in rodent microglia.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500101v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ea011org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cef01dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f621aborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11c9f97_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The enzyme, Cal-ID, biotinylates nearby proteins within minutes in response to elevated local calcium levels. The biotinylated proteins can be identified via mass spectrometry and visualized using microscopy.

    "abstract": "While early life drug use reliably predicts addiction liability in adulthood, the molecular mechanism by which this occurs, and the degree genetic predisposition is involved is not known. We used a unique genetic rat model of temperament to determine the impact of adolescent cocaine experience on adult psychomotor sensitization and epigenetic profiles in the striatum. Relative to adult bred low-responder (bLR) rats, bred high-responders (bHR) are more sensitive to the psychomotor-activating effects of cocaine and reinstate drug-seeking behavior more readily following prolonged cocaine exposure and a period of abstinence. We found that a 7-day sensitizing cocaine regimen (15 mg/kg/day) during either adolescence or adulthood produced psychomotor sensitization in bHRs only, while a dual cocaine exposure prevents further sensitization, suggesting limits on neuroplasticity. By contrast, adolescent cocaine in bLRs shifted their resilient phenotype, rendering them more responsive to cocaine in adulthood when initially challenged with cocaine We then assessed two functionally opposite epigenetic chromatin modifications, previously implicated in addiction liability, permissive acetylation (ac) and repressive tri-methylation (me3), on histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) in four sub-regions of the striatum. In bHRs, decreased repressive histone, H3K9me3, and increased permissive histone, acH3K9, in nucleus accumbens core associated with cocaine sensitization. However, there were limits on these epigenetic changes that paralleled the behavioral limits on further sensitization. In bLRs, the combination of cocaine exposure in adolescence and adulthood, which lead to an increase in their responsiveness to a cocaine challenge, also increased acH3K9 expression in the core. Thus, adolescent cocaine experience interacts with genetic background to elicit different behavioral profiles relevant to addiction in adulthood, with concurrent modifications in the epigenetic histone profiles in the nucleus accumbens that associate with cocaine sensitization and with metaplasticity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAdolescence is a critical period when brain developmental trajectories continue to be established and when most illicit drug use is initiated in humans. Notably, however, only a minority of adolescent drug users go on to develop substance use disorders in adulthood. We hypothesize that individual differences in genetic vulnerability, temperamental phenotype and adolescent drug history intersect to modify life-long drug abuse liability, with epigenetic modification playing an important role in this interplay. We tested this hypothesis in a genetic animal model of temperament. Our results show that adolescent cocaine experience induces psychomotor sensitization in vulnerable individuals, and that a dual exposure to cocaine (both in adolescence and adulthood) limits further sensitization in these individuals, an example of metaplasticity. By contrast, individuals who are typically resilient become more responsive to cocaine when exposed to this drug during adolescence and are then re-exposed as adults. Differences in behavioral response to cocaine were associated with unique epigenetic changes in the nucleus accumbens core. These findings shed light on the interplay of genes, environment and adolescent exposure to drugs in susceptibility to substance use disorders.",

    "abstract": "The brains connectome continually rewires throughout the life of an organism. In this study, we sought to elucidate the operational principles of such rewiring by analyzing the functional connectomes in mouse primary motor cortex (M1) during a 14-session (day) lever-press task learning in response to an auditory cue. Specifically, we employed Calcium imaging recordings of L2/3 and L5 of M1 in awake mice to reconstruct and analyze functional connectomes across learning sessions. Our results show that functional connectomes in L2/3 and L5 follow a similar learning-induced rewiring trajectory. More specifically, the connectomes rewire in a biphasic manner, where functional connectivity increases over the first few learning sessions, and then, it is gradually pruned to return to a homeostatic level of network density. We demonstrated that the increase of network connectivity in L2/3 connectomes, but not in L5, generates neuronal co-firing activity that correlates with higher motor performance (shorter cue-to-reward time), while motor performance remains relatively stable throughout the pruning phase. The results show a biphasic rewiring principle that involves the maximization of reward / performance and maintenance of network density. Finally, we demonstrated that the connectome rewiring in L2/3 is clustered around a core set of movement-associated neurons that form a highly interconnected hub in the connectomes, and that the activity of these core neurons stably encodes movement throughout learning.\n\nSignificance StatementConnectomes in the motor cortex rewire during motor skill learning, but the operational principle behind this rewiring is yet to be determined. Here, we characterized the rewiring dynamics of functional connectomes in L2/3 and L5 of M1 in mice engaging in a lever-press learning, using two-photon fluorescence microscopy data. We identified a universal biphasic rewiring trajectory across animals and layers in the motor cortex that reflects two objectives: an exploratory phase that increases functional connectivity and optimizes motor performance, and a pruning phase that brings connectivity back to a homeostatic level while maintaining motor performance. We found further that connectome rewiring during motor skill learning concentrates around a core set of highly interconnected neurons in L2/3 that reliably encode movements.",

In this work we characterized RPCS disruption in a mouse model of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) using these agents.\n\nMethodsContrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and computed tomography (CE-CT) using liposomal nanoparticles bearing gadolinium (liposomal-Gd) and iodine were performed in pregnant Gab3-/- and wild type (WT) mice at day 16 of gestation. CE-MRI was performed on a 1T scanner using a 2D T1-weighted sequence (100x100x600 {micro}m3 voxels) and CE-CT was performed at a higher resolution (70x70x70 {micro}m3 voxels). Animals were euthanized post-imaging and feto-placental units (FPUs) were harvested for histological examination. RPCS conspicuity was scored through blinded assessment of images.\n\nResultsPregnant Gab3-/- mice show elevated rates of complicated pregnancy. Contrast-enhanced imaging demonstrated frank infiltration of the RPCS of Gab3-/- FPUs. RPCS in Gab3-/- FPUs was smaller in volume, demonstrated a heterogeneous signal profile, and received lower conspicuity scores than WT FPUs. Histology confirmed in vivo findings and demonstrated staining consistent with a thinner RPCS in Gab3-/- FPUs.\n\nDiscussionImaging of the Gab3-/- mouse model at late gestation with liposomal contrast agents enabled in vivo characterization of morphological differences in the RPCS that could cause the observed pregnancy complications. An MRI-based method for visualizing the RPCS would be valuable for early detection of invasive placentation.",

    "abstract": "The proprioceptive system is essential for the control of coordinated movement, posture and skeletal integrity. The sense of proprioception is produced in the brain using peripheral sensory input from receptors such as the muscle spindle, which detects changes in the length of skeletal muscles. Despite its importance, the molecular composition of the muscle spindle is largely unknown. In this study, we generated comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of the entire muscle spindle. We then associated differentially expressed genes with the various tissues composing the spindle using bioinformatic analysis. Immunostaining verified these predictions, thus establishing new markers for the different spindle tissues. Utilizing these markers, we identified the differentiation stages the spindle capsule cells undergo during development. Together, these findings provide comprehensive molecular characterization of the intact spindle as well as new tools to study its development and function in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "An investigation on population structure and ecology of the African elephants (Loxodonta africana) was carried out in Chebera Churchura National Park, Ethiopia during the wet and dry seasons of 2020 -2021. Sample counts using distance sampling of the African elephants were carried out in an area of 1, 410 km2. The total population estimated was 756 individuals, and the mean population density estimated was 0.53/km2. Among these, females constituted 52.12% and males 36.07%. The remaining 11.8% of the population was young of both sexes. It was difficult to categorize the young into male and female in the field, as their primary sexual characteristics were not easily visible.\n\nMale to female sex ratio was 1.00:-1.42. Age structure was dominated by adults, which constituted 53.83% of the total population. Sub-adults comprised 19.11%, juveniles contributed 15.18% and calves accounted for 12.11% of the population. The herd size ranged from 1 to 149 individuals and the mean herd size during wet and dry seasons were 16.5 and 50.25, respectively. The African elephants were distributed in four habitat types: grassland, woodland, montane forest and riverine habitats in the study area. They were observed more in the riverine vegetation types during the dry season. Relative abundance of food resources, green vegetation cover and water availability in the area were the major factors governing their distribution in the present study area.",

    "abstract": "The survival of a population during environmental shifts depends on whether the rate of phenotypic adaptation keeps up with the rate of changing conditions. A common way to achieve this is via change to gene regulatory network (GRN) connections - known as rewiring - that facilitate novel interactions and innovation of transcription factors. To understand the success of rapidly adapting organisms, we therefore need to determine the rules that create and constrain opportunities for GRN rewiring.\n\nHere, using an experimental microbial model system we reveal a hierarchy among transcription factors that are rewired to rescue lost function, with alternative rewiring pathways only unmasked after the preferred pathway is eliminated. We identify three key properties - high activation, high expression, and pre-existing low-level affinity for novel target genes - that facilitate transcription factor innovation via gain of functional promiscuity. Ease of acquiring these properties is constrained by pre- existing GRN architecture, which was overcome in our experimental system by both targeted and global network alterations. This work reveals the key properties that determine transcription factor evolvability, and as such, the evolution of GRNs.",

    "abstract": "Predicting gene expression divergence and its evolutionary parameters is integral to understanding the emergence of new gene functions and associated traits. Whereas several sophisticated methods have been developed for these tasks, their applications are either limited to duplicate genes or require expression data from more than two species. Thus, here we present PiXi, the first machine learning framework for predicting expression divergence and its evolutionary parameters between single-copy genes in two species. In particular, PiXi models gene expression evolution as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and overlays this model with multi-layer neural network, random forest, and support vector machine architectures for making predictions. We show that PiXi has high power and accuracy in predicting gene expression divergence and its underlying parameters across a wide range of evolutionary scenarios, with the globally best performance achieved by a multi-layer neural network. Moreover, application of our best performing PiXi predictor to empirical data from single-copy genes residing at different loci in two species of Drosophila reveals that expression divergence occurs in approximately 20% of these positionally relocated genes and is driven by a combination of neutral and selective forces. Further analysis shows that several of these genes are involved in the electron transport chain of the mitochondrial membrane, suggesting that new chromatin environments may impact energy production in Drosophila. Thus, by providing a toolkit for predicting expression divergence and its evolutionary parameters between single-copy genes in two species, PiXi can shed light on the origins of novel phenotypes across diverse biological processes and study systems.",

    "abstract": "The extreme adaptation potential of the generalist herbivore Tetranychus urticae (the two-spotted spider mite) to pesticides as well as diverse host plants has been associated with clade-specific gene expansions in known detoxifying enzyme families, and with extensive and rapid transcriptional responses. However, how this broad transcriptional potential is regulated remains largely unknown. Using a parental/F1 design in which four inbred strains were crossed to a common inbred strain, we assessed the genetic basis and inheritance of gene expression variation in T. urticae. Mirroring known phenotypic variation in the progenitor strains of the inbreds, we confirmed that the inbred strains we created were genetically distinct, varied markedly in pesticide resistance, and also captured variation in host plant fitness commonly observed in this species. By examining differences in gene expression between parents and allele-specific expression in F1s, we found that variation in RNA abundance was more often explained in trans as compared to cis, with the former associated with dominance in inheritance. Strikingly, in a gene ontology analysis, detoxification genes of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) family, as well as dioxygenases (DOGs) acquired from horizontal gene transfer from fungi, were specifically enriched at the extremes of trans-driven up- and downregulation. In particular, a clade of CYPs with documented broad substrate-specificity including multiple pesticides, as well as DOGs that have recently been shown to have broad substrate specificity against plant specialized compounds, were exceptionally highly upregulated as a result of trans effects (or in some cases synergism of cis and trans) in the most multi-pesticide resistant strains. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential importance of trans-driven expression variation in genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and host plant use for rapid adaptation in T. urticae, and also suggest modular control of these genes, a regulatory architecture that might ameliorate negative pleiotropic effects.\n\nAuthor summaryThe two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, is a generalist herbivore and pest of diverse crops globally. In response to the plethora of chemicals used for its control, the species rapidly evolves pesticide resistance. Further, experimental evolution studies with T. urticae populations have demonstrated adaptation to challenging host plants in as few as five generations. The adaptation of T. urticae to pesticides and host plants has been associated with large transcriptome changes, including for genes associated with detoxification of pesticides and toxic plant compounds. Nevertheless, the basis of the observed transcriptome variation has remained largely unknown. Here, we examined the genetic control and inheritance of expression differences among five inbred T. urticae strains, including several with histories of intense pesticide selection. With a parental/F1 experimental design, we found that trans effects were common in explaining variation in detoxification gene expression, with the trans-driven upregulation of a subset of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases of broad substrate specificity especially striking in the most pesticide resistant strains. Our findings suggest that genetic variation acting with dominant or additive inheritance to impact the regulation of modules of detoxification genes may be an important target of selection during rapid pesticide and host plant evolution in herbivores.",

We investigated associations between night shift work and established DNAm predictors of lifestyle, and compared them with those observed between night shift work and self-reported or conventionally-measured phenotypes.\n\nMethodsIn two cohort studies, Generation Scotland (GS) (n=7,028) and Understanding Society (UKHLS) (n=1,175), we evaluated associations between night shift work and four lifestyle factors (body mass index, smoking, alcohol, education) using both conventionally-measured phenotypes and DNA methylation-based scores proxying the phenotypes. DNA methylation-based measures of biological ageing were also generated using six established \"epigenetic clocks\". Meta-analysis of GS and UKHLS results was conducted using inverse-variance weighted fixed effects.\n\nResultsNight shift work was associated with higher BMI (0.79; 95%CI 0.02, 1.56; p=0.04) and lower education (-0.18; -0.30, -0.07; p=0.002). There was weak evidence of association between night shift work and DNAm scores for smoking (0.06, -0.03, 0.15; p=0.18) and education (-0.24; -0.49, 0.01; p=0.06) in fully adjusted models. Two of the epigenetic age measures demonstrated higher age acceleration among night shift workers (0.80; 0.42, 1.18; p<0.001 for GrimAge and 0.46; 0.00, 0.92; p=0.05 for PhenoAge).\n\nConclusionsNight shift work is associated with phenotypic and DNAm-based measures of lower education.

However, since these phenomena involve multiple processes occurring in parallel, for example differentiation and proliferation, it is difficult to discern their respective contributions to a measured gene expression profile at any given point in time. Here, we demonstrate the use of un-supervised machine learning techniques to identify and \"de-convolve\" processes occurring in parallel in a simple model system. We first downloaded a published dataset of RNAseq measurements from synchronized HeLa cells that were sampled at 14 consecutive time points. We then used Fourier analysis and Topic modeling to identify two concurrent processes: a periodic process, corresponding to cell division, and a transient process related to HeLa cell identity (e.g. cervical cancer), that is presumably required for recovery from cell cycle arrest. This study demonstrates the use of un-supervised machine learning techniques to identify hidden states and processes in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Although enhancers are central to the regulation of mammalian gene expression, the mechanisms underlying Enhancer-Promoter (E-P) interactions remain unclear. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods effectively capture large-scale 3D genome structure but struggle to achieve the depth necessary to resolve fine-scale E-P interactions. Here, we develop Region Capture Micro-C (RCMC) by combining MNase-based 3C with a tiling region-capture approach and generate the deepest 3D genome maps reported thus far with only modest sequencing. By applying RCMC in mouse embryonic stem cells and reaching the genome-wide equivalent of [~]200 billion unique contacts, RCMC reveals previously unresolvable patterns of highly nested and focal 3D interactions, which we term microcompartments. Microcompartments frequently connect enhancers and promoters and are largely robust to loss of loop extrusion and inhibition of transcription. We therefore propose that many E-P interactions form through a compartmentalization mechanism, which may explain why acute cohesin depletion only modestly affects global gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Migratory birds travel over impressively long distances. Consequently, they have to adopt flight regimes being both efficient - in order to spare their metabolic resources - and robust to perturbations.\n\nThis paper investigates the relationship between both aspects, i.e. mechanical performance and stability in flapping flight of migratory birds. Relying on a poly-articulated wing morphing model and a tail-like surface, several families of steady flight regime have been identified and analyzed. These families differ by their wing kinematics and tail opening. A systematic parametric search analysis has been carried out, in order to evaluate power consumption and cost of transport. A framework tailored for assessing limit cycles, namely Floquet theory, is used to numerically study flight stability.\n\nOur results show that under certain conditions, an inherent passive stability of steady and level flight can be achieved. In particular, we find that progressively opening the tail leads to passively stable flight regimes. Within these passively stable regimes, the tail can produce either upward or downward lift. However, these configurations entail an increase of cost of transport at high velocities penalizing fast forward flight regimes.\n\nOur model-based predictions suggest that long range flights require a furled tail configuration, as confirmed by field observations, and consequently need to rely on alternative mechanisms to stabilize the flight.",

This potential is derived from the broad array of constituent and/or cargo molecules associated with EVs. Among these, microRNAs (miRNAs) are commonly implicated as important and have been associated with a wide variety of EV-induced biological phenomena. While controlled loading of single miRNAs is a well-documented approach for enhancing EV bioactivity, loading of multiple miRNAs has not been fully leveraged to maximize the potential of EV-based therapies. Here, an established approach to extrinsic nucleic acid loading of EVs, sonication, was utilized to enable controlled loading of multiple miRNAs in HEK293T EVs. Combinations of carefully chosen miRNAs were compared to single miRNAs with respect to anti-inflammatory outcomes in assays of increasing stringency, with the combination of miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 found to have the most potential amongst tested groups.",

    "abstract": "Maximum Likelihood (ML) is a widely used phylogenetic inference model. ML implementations heavily rely on numerical optimization routines that use internal numerical thresholds to determine convergence. We systematically analyze the impact of these threshold settings on the log-likelihood and runtimes for ML tree inferences with RAxML-NG, IQ-TREE, and FastTree on empirical datasets. We provide empirical evidence that we can substantially accelerate tree inferences with RAxML-NG and IQ-TREE by changing the default values of two such numerical thresholds. At the same time, altering these settings does not significantly impact the quality of the inferred trees. We further show that increasing both thresholds accelerates the RAxML-NG bootstrap without influencing the resulting support values. For RAxML-NG, increasing the likelihood thresholds{epsilon} LnL and{epsilon} brlen to 10 and 103 respectively results in an average tree inference speedup of 1.9 {+/-} 0.6 on Data collection 1, 1.8 {+/-} 1.1 on Data collection 2, and 1.9 {+/-} 0.8 on Data collection 2 for the RAxML-NG bootstrap.

    "abstract": "MotivationBasecalling long DNA sequences is a crucial step in nanopore-based DNA sequencing protocols. In recent years, the CTC-RNN model has become the leading basecalling model and has replaced prior hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on pre-segmentation of the ion current measurements. However, CTC-RNN relies on the neural network to make basecalling decisions while prior knowledge of the biological and physical processes is not involved. We believe that there are undiscovered potentials in using this prior knowledge that can benefit the basecalling performances and that HMMs can indeed be used to leverage this information if combined with an RNN in an end-to-end algorithm.\n\nResultsWe present the basecaller named Lokatt: explicit duration Markov model and residual-LSTM network. It is a novel basecaller structure based on an Explicit Duration HMM (EDHMM), designed to model the nanopore sequencing processes. Trained on a new library created with free-methylation Ecoli genome with MinION R9.4.1 chemistry, the Lokatt basecaller achieves basecalling performances with a median single read identity score of 92%, a genome coverage ratio of 99.750%, on par with existing state-of-the-art.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/chunxxc/lokatt; Data is held on Zenodo, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7970716.\n\nContactchunx@kth.se;chunxxc@gmail.com\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical nanoparticles (NPs) carrying molecular payloads are used for medical purposes such as diagnosis and medical treatment. They are designed to modify the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PKPD) of their associated payloads, to obtain better clinical results. Currently, the research process of discovering the PKPD properties of new candidates for efficient clinical treatment is complicated and time-consuming. In silico experiments are known to be powerful tools for studying biological and clinical processes and therefore can significantly improve the process of developing new and optimizing current NPs-based drugs. However, the current PKPD models are limited by the number of parameters they can take into consideration and the ability to solve large-scale in vivo settings, thus providing relatively large errors in predicting treatment outcomes. In this study, we present a novel mathematical graph-based model for PKPD of NPs-based drugs. The proposed model is based on a population of NPs performing a directed walk on a graph describing the blood vessels and organs, taking into consideration the interactions between the NPs and their environment. In addition, we define a mechanism to perform different prediction queries on the proposed model to analyze two in vivo experiments with eight different NPs, done on mice, obtaining a fitting of 0.84 {+/-} 0.01 and 0.66 {+/-} 0.01 (mean {+/-} standard deviation), respectively, comparing the in vivo values and the in silico results.",

    "abstract": "Based on the data gathered by echo-sounder buoys attached to drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (dFADs) across tropical oceans, the current study applies a Machine Learning protocol to examine the temporal trends of tuna schools association to drifting objects. Using a binary output, metrics typically used in the literature were adapted to account for the fact that the entire tuna aggregation under the dFAD was considered. The median time it took tuna to colonize the dFADs for the first time varied between 25 and 43 days, depending on the ocean, and the longest soak and colonization times were registered in the Pacific Ocean. The tuna schools Continuous Residence Times were generally shorter than Continuous Absence Times (median values between 5 and 7 days, and 9 and 11 days, respectively), in line with the results found by previous studies. Using a regression output, two novel metrics, namely aggregation time and disaggregation time, were estimated to obtain further insight into the symmetry of the aggregation process. Across all oceans, the time it took for the tuna aggregation to depart from the dFADs was not significantly longer than the time it took for the aggregation to form. The value of these results in the context of the \"ecological trap\" hypothesis is discussed, and further analyses to enrich and make use of this data source are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are interpreted by multiple reader domains and proteins to regulate gene expression. The ENL YEATS domain is a prototypical PTM reader that recognizes multiple lysine acetylation marks on the histone H3 tails as a way of recruiting chromatin remodellers. Two ENL YEATS mutations have been identified which have been linked with leukemia, Wilms tumor, and other forms of cancer and result in either an insertion or deletion of residues in the loop connecting beta sheets distant from the protein active site. In vitro experiments have shown that these mutations modulate the selectivity of YEATS domains for various lysine acetylation marks, although different experiments have provided contrasting views on the ability of the insertion and deletion mutants to discern specific PTMs. Here, we have performed multiple molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type, insertion, and deletion mutant YEATS domains free from and in complex with two PTM peptides: one that is acetylated at K9 of H3 and the other that is acetylated at residue K27 of H3. Results show that these two peptides have distinct flexibilities and binding energetics when bound to YEATS domains, and that these properties are affected by interactions with residues within and outside of the peptide consensus motif. Furthermore, these properties are modulated by the YEATS insertion and deletion mutants, which results in disparate binding effects in these systems. Together, these results suggest that only the partial exposure of histone tails is sufficient in the context of nucleosomes for YEATS-mediated recognition of acetylation marks on histone tails. They also caution against the over-interpretation of results obtained from experiments on reader domainhistone peptide binding in isolation and not in the full-length nucleosome context.",

    "abstract": "Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) is a clinically important event, where an isolated in-breast recurrence is a potentially curable event but also associated with an increased risk of distant metastases and breast cancer death. It currently remains unclear if IBTRs are associated with molecular changes that can be explored as a resource for precision medicine strategies targeting locally recurring breast cancer. Here, we employed a recently developed proteogenomics workflow to analyze a cohort of 27 primary breast cancers and their matched IBTRs by whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics to define proteogenomic features of tumor evolution. Analysis of mutational signatures, copy number changes, and cancer specific mutations revealed a relationship with estrogen and progesterone receptor statuses and increased levels of genetic change. This in turn altered the re-programming of the transcriptome and proteome towards a recurring molecular disease phenotype with high replicating capacity and a higher degree of genomic instability possibly enhanced by high expression of APOBEC3B. In conclusion, this study defines how primary breast tumors differentially evolve into different ipsilateral recurrent malignancies depending on their key biomarker status, suggesting that further enhancing the genomic instability in some tumors could serve as an alternative treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-initiating cells are the major drivers of chemoresistance and relapse, making them attractive targets for cancer therapy. However, the identity of tumor- initiating cells in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the key molecules underlying their traits remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like subpopulation marked by high expression of receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is the origin of heterogeneous tumor cells in PDAC. We demonstrate that ROR1 depletion suppresses tumor growth, recurrence after chemotherapy, and metastasis. Mechanistically, ROR1 induces the expression of AURKB by activating E2F to enhance PDAC proliferation. Furthermore, epigenomic analyses reveal that ROR1 is transcriptionally dependent on YAP/BRD4 binding at the enhancer region, and targeting this pathway reduces ROR1 expression and prevents PDAC growth. Collectively, our findings reveal a critical role of ROR1high cells as tumor-initiating cells and the functional importance of ROR1 in PDAC progression, thereby highlighting its therapeutic targetability.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499868v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167bf72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@49df52org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e480a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b987bf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Natural vision is dynamic: as an animal moves, its visual input changes dramatically. How can the visual system reliably extract local features from an input dominated by self-generated signals? In Drosophila, diverse local visual features are represented by a group of projection neurons with distinct tuning properties. Here we describe a connectome-based volumetric imaging strategy to measure visually evoked neural activity across this population. We show that local visual features are jointly represented across the population, and that a shared gain factor improves trial-to-trial coding fidelity. A subset of these neurons, tuned to small objects, is modulated by two independent signals associated with self-movement, a motor-related signal and a visual motion signal. These two inputs adjust the sensitivity of these feature detectors across the locomotor cycle, selectively reducing their gain during saccades and restoring it during intersaccadic intervals. This work reveals a strategy for reliable feature detection during locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing the regional progression of neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD) informs disease mechanisms and facilitates identification and staging of individuals at greatest risk of imminent cognitive decline, which may aid the development of early therapeutic interventions. Previous attempts to sequence neurodegeneration have analysed measures of regional volume and identified the initial sites of atrophy. However, focal microstructural alterations in white matter have also been reported in early AD. Yet, the temporal ordering of abnormality in measures of white matter microstructure relative to grey matter volume has not been established. In this study we used event-based modelling of disease progression (EBM) to provide a data-driven evaluation of the temporal sequence of abnormality in markers of white matter microstructure relative to grey matter volume. Regional microstructural metrics derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and regional volumes from Freesurfer cortical parcellation were obtained from the Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for 441 amyloid-positive participants (81 AD-dementia, 159 mild cognitive impairment, 201 cognitively normal). The estimated sequence shows a series of abnormalities in markers of white matter microstructure, followed by sequential grey matter volumetric decline, with no overlap between the two. Analysis of positional variance and cross-validation supports the robustness of our findings. These results provide the first data-driven evidence that markers of white matter microstructural degeneration precede those of cortical volumetric decline in the AD cascade. This prompts a re-evaluation of the view that regional volumetric decline can be used to characterise the very earliest stages of AD neurodegeneration. Instead, we suggest that white matter microstructural markers provide an earlier window into AD neurodegeneration. An early staging system of AD neurodegeneration based on measures of brain microstructure may find application in selecting AD subjects with early but minimal brain damage for clinical trials that aim to prevent cognitive decline.",

We found that PANX3 is absent in newborn skin but becomes upregulated with age. We characterized the skin of global Panx3 knockout mice (KO) and found that KO dorsal skin showed sex-differences at different ages, but generally had reduced dermal and hypodermal areas compared to aged-matched controls. Transcriptomic analysis of KO epidermis revealed reduced E-cadherin stabilization and Wnt signaling compared to WT, consistent with the inability of primary KO keratinocytes to adhere in culture, and diminished epidermal barrier function in KO mice. We also observed increased inflammatory signaling in KO epidermis and higher incidence of dermatitis in aged KO mice compared to wildtype controls. These findings suggest that during skin aging, PANX3 is critical in the maintenance of dorsal skin architecture, keratinocyte cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion and inflammatory skin responses.",
