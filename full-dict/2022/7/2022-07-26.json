    "abstract": "BackgroundFactors that influence vaginal microbiota composition, including its source, are not well understood. To determine if vaginal microbiota transmission from mother to daughter at birth influences the human vaginal microbiota composition in adolescence, we investigated the relationship between the vaginal microbiota of 13 mother/daughter pairs and the daughters birth mode.\n\nResultsBased on analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences, the vaginal microbiotas of mother/daughter pairs were more similar to each other if the daughter was born by vaginal delivery rather than by C-section. Additionally, genome sequences from an important member of the vaginal microbiota, Lactobacillus crispatus, isolated from one mother/daughter pair in which the daughter was born by vaginal delivery, were highly similar.\n\nConclusionsBoth community-level analysis and isolate genome sequence analysis are consistent with birth-mode dependent transmission and persistence of at least some members of the vaginal microbiota.\n\nImportanceThe composition of the human vaginal microbiota is related to many aspects of health from infection susceptibility to preterm birth. Our study provides evidence that transmission of vaginal bacteria from mother to daughter at birth may be an important factor influencing vaginal microbiota composition into adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Elaborate behaviours are produced by tightly controlled flexor-extensor motor neuron activation patterns. Motor neurons are regulated by a network of interneurons within the spinal cord, but the computational processes involved in motor control are not fully understood. The neuroanatomical arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal circuits. Rabies retrograde monosynaptic tracing has been used to label premotor interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools, with previous studies reporting topographic mediolateral positional biases in flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. To more precisely define how premotor interneurons contacting specific motor pools are organized we used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches to minimize systematic biases associated with each method. Contrary to expectations, we found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons. Thus, premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components.\n\nThe paper can be downloaded in executable format as a MATLAB live script from https://github.com/marcobeato/Spinal_premotor_interneurons_controlling_antagonistic_muscles_are_spatially_intermingled, where all the data are available An R version of the executable paper is available at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rronzano/Spinal_premotor_interneurons_controlling_antagonistic_muscles_are_spatially_intermingled.git/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the retrohippocampal cortices play crucial roles in spatial memory. Many retrohippocampal neurons have firing fields that are selectively active at specific locations, with memory for rewarded locations associated with reorganisation of these firing fields. Whether this is the sole strategy for representing spatial memories is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that during a spatial memory task retrohippocampal neurons encode location through ramping activity that extends within segments of a linear track approaching and following a reward, with the rewarded location represented by offsets or switches in the slope of the ramping activity. These ramping representations could be maintained independently of trial outcome and cues that mark the reward location, indicating that they result from recall of the track structure. During recordings in an open arena, neurons that generated ramping activity during the spatial memory task were more numerous than grid or border cells, with a majority showing spatial firing that did not meet criteria for classification as grid or border representations. Encoding of rewarded locations through offsets and switches in the slope of ramping activity also emerged in recurrent neural networks trained to solve a similar location memory task. Impaired performance of these networks following disruption of outputs from ramping neurons is consistent with this coding strategy supporting navigation to recalled locations of behavioural significance. We hypothesise that retrohippocampal ramping activity mediates readout of learned models for goal-directed navigation.",

    "abstract": "After years of experience, humans become experts at perceiving letters. Is this visual capacity attained by learning specialized letter features, or by reusing general visual features previously learned in service of object categorization? To explore this question, we first measured the perceptual similarity of letters in two behavioral tasks, visual search and letter categorization. Then, we trained deep convolutional neural networks on either 26-way letter categorization or 1000-way object categorization, as a way to operationalize possible specialized letter features and general object-based features, respectively. We found that the general object-based features more robustly correlated with the perceptual similarity of letters. We then operationalized additional forms of experience-dependent letter specialization by altering object-trained networks with varied forms of letter training; however, none of these forms of letter specialization improved the match to human behavior. Thus, our findings reveal that it is not necessary to appeal to specialized letter representations to account for perceptual similarity of letters. Instead, we argue that it is more likely that the perception of letters depends on domain-general visual features.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYFor over a century, scientists have conducted behavioral experiments to investigate how the visual system recognizes letters, but it has proven difficult to propose a model of the feature space underlying this capacity. Here we leveraged recent advances in machine learning to model a wide variety of features ranging from specialized letter features to general object-based features. Across two large-scale behavioral experiments we find that general object-based features account well for letter perception, and that adding letter specialization did not improve the correspondence to human behavior. It is plausible that the ability to recognize letters largely relies on general visual features unaltered by letter learning.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer is crucial for deciding the best treatment strategy. Deep learning can predict the subtypes from genetic information more accurately than conventional statistical methods, but to date, deep learning has not been directly utilized to examine which genes are associated with which subtypes. To clarify the mechanisms embedded in the intrinsic subtypes, we developed an explainable deep learning model called a point-wise linear (PWL) model that generates a custom-made logistic regression for each patient. Logistic regression, which is familiar to both physicians and medical informatics researchers, allows us to analyze the importance of the feature variables, and the PWL model harnesses these practical abilities of logistic regression. In this study, we show that analyzing breast cancer subtypes is clinically beneficial for patients and one of the best ways to validate the capability of the PWL model. First, we trained the PWL model with RNA-seq data to predict PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and applied it to the 41/50 genes of PAM50 through the subtype prediction task. Second, we developed a deep enrichment analysis method to reveal the relationships between the PAM50 subtypes and the copy numbers of breast cancer. Our findings showed that the PWL model utilized genes relevant to the cell cycle-related pathways. These preliminary successes in breast cancer subtype analysis demonstrate the potential of our analysis strategy to clarify the mechanisms underlying breast cancer and improve overall clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need for long-term monitoring of ecosystems and their services to inform on-ground management and policy direction. The supply of many ecosystem services relies on connections that span multiple ecosystems. Monitoring the underlying condition of interconnected ecosystems, using established indicators, is therefore required to track effectiveness of past interventions and, ideally, identify impending change. Here we conduct performance testing of ecological indicators for a catchment-to-coast system with the aim of identifying the time-scales over which they respond to change. We chose a case-study of a coastal fishery in Northern Australia that exhibits strong catchment-to-coast connectivity, has long-term available data and is under threat from water resource development. We developed a novel approach to performance testing. Our model drew on state-space modelling to capture ecological dynamics, and structural equation modelling to capture covariation in indictors timeseries. We first quantified covariation among three established ecological indicators: pasture biomass, vegetation greenness and barramundi catch per unit effort. Covariation in the indicators was driven by river flow, with higher values of all indicators occurring in years with greater river flow. We then defined reference bounds for each indicator that accounted for natural variation in river flow. We predicted the emergence times for each indicator, as the time taken for each indicator to emerge from the background of natural variation. Emergence times quantified at 80% and higher confidence levels were >10 years in all cases. Past trends and current status of ecosystem service flows are often used by decision makers to directly inform near-term actions, particularly provisioning services (such as barramundi catch) due to their important contribution to regional economies. We found that the ecological indicators should be used to assess historical performance over decadal timespans, but not as short-term indicators of recent change. More generally, we offer an approach to performance testing of indicators. This approach could be useful for quantifying time-scales of ecosystem response in other systems where cross-ecosystem connections are important.",

    "abstract": "Cities pose a major ecological challenge for wildlife worldwide. Phenotypic variation, which can result from underlying genetic variation or plasticity, is an important metric to understand eco-evolutionary responses to environmental change. Recent work suggests that urban populations might have higher levels of phenotypic variation than non-urban counterparts. This prediction, however, has never been tested across species nor over a broad geographical range. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of the avian literature to compare urban versus non-urban means and variation in phenology (i.e., lay date) and reproductive effort (i.e., clutch size, number of fledglings). First, we show that urban populations reproduce earlier and have smaller broods than non-urban conspecifics. Second, we show that urban populations have higher phenotypic variation in laying date than non-urban populations. This result arises from differences between populations within breeding seasons, conceivably due to higher landscape heterogeneity in urban habitats. These findings reveal a novel effect of urbanisation on animal life-histories with potential implications for species adaptation to urban environments (which will require further investigation). Higher variation in phenology in birds subjected to urban disturbance could result from plastic responses to a heterogeneous environment, or from higher genetic variation in phenology, possibly linked to higher evolutionary potential.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system distinguishes self from non-self by surveying peptides generated from degradation of intracellular proteins that are loaded onto MHC Class I molecules for display on the cell surface. While early studies reported that the bulk of cell surface MHC Class I complexes require the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for their generation, this conclusion has been challenged. To better understand MHC Class I peptide origins, we sought to carry out a comprehensive, quantitative census of the MHC Class I peptide repertoire in the presence and absence of UPS activity. We introduce optimized methodology to enrich for authentic Class I-bound peptides in silico and then quantify by mass spectrometry their relative amounts upon perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Whereas most peptides are dependent on the proteasome and ubiquitination for their generation, a surprising 30% of the MHC Class I repertoire, enriched in peptides of mitochondrial origin, appears independent of these pathways. A further [~]10% of Class I-bound peptides were found to be dependent on the proteasome but independent of ubiquitination for their generation. Notably, clinically achievable partial inhibition of the proteasome resulted in display of novel peptides antigens, at least one of which promotes immune system activation. Our results suggest that generation of MHC Class I*peptide complexes is more complex than previously recognized and also provide evidence for compensatory peptide-generating pathways when canonical pathways are impaired.",

Intestinal epithelial cell-specific ablation of the core clock gene Bmal1 disrupts rhythmicity of microbiota. Targeted metabolomics functionally link intestinal clock-controlled bacteria to microbial-derived products, in particular branched-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids. Microbiota transfer from intestinal clock-deficient mice into germ-free mice altered intestinal gene expression, enhanced lymphoid organ weights and suppressed immune cell recruitment.

These species may host different acquired antimicrobial resistance and virulence mechanisms and their identification are challenging. This study aims to develop predictive models based on MALDI-TOF MS spectral profiles and machine learning for species-level identification.\n\nA total of 198 ECC and 116 K. aerogenes clinical isolates from the University Hospital Ramon y Cajal (Spain) and the University Hospital Basel (Switzerland) were included. The capability of the proposed method to differentiate the most common ECC species (E. asburiae, E. kobei, E. hormaechei, E. roggenkampii, E. ludwigii, E. bugandensis) and K. aerogenes was demonstrated by applying unsupervised hierarchical clustering with PCA pre-processing. We observed a distinctive clustering of E. hormaechei and K. aerogenes and a clear trend for the rest of the ECC species to be differentiated over the development dataset. Thus, we developed supervised, non-linear predictive models (Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function and Random Forest). The external validation of these models with protein spectra from the two participating hospitals yielded 100% correct species-level assignment for E. asburiae, E. kobei, and E. roggenkampii and between 91.2% and 98.0% for the remaining ECC species. Similar results were obtained with the MSI database developed recently (https://msi.happy-dev.fr/) except in the case of E. hormaechei, which was more accurately identified by Random Forest.\n\nIn short, MALDI-TOF MS combined with machine learning demonstrated to be a rapid and accurate method for the differentiation of ECC species.",

    "abstract": "The phenotypic efficacy of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) stems from their incidence per base pair of the genome, which is orders of magnitudes greater than that of point mutations. One mitotic event stands out in its potential to significantly change a cells SCNA burden-a chromosome missegregation. We present a general deterministic framework for modeling chromosome missegregations and use it to evaluate the possibility of missegregation-induced population extinction (MIE). The model predicts critical curves that separate viable from non-viable populations as a function of their turnover- and missegregation rates. Missegregation- and turnover rates estimated from a PAN-cancer scRNA-seq dataset of 15,464 cells are then compared to predictions. The majority of tumors across all cancer types had missegregation- and turnover rates that were within viable regions of the parameter space. When a dependency of missegregation rate on karyotype was introduced, karyotypes associated with low missegregation rates acted as a stabilizing refuge, rendering MIE impossible unless turnover rates are exceedingly high. Intra-tumor heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in missegregation rates, increases as tumors progress, rendering MIE unlikely.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhen a cell missegregates a chromosome while dividing, the chance is high that its two daughter cells will behave drastically different from each other and from their parental cell. Chromosome missegregations are therefore one of the most powerful forces of phenotypic diversity. We developed a mathematical model of chromosome missegregations that allows for this cell-to-cell diversity to be accounted for. The model serves to help understand how selection acts upon cells with versatile chromosome contents, as a tool for genotype-to-phenotype mapping in various microenvironments. As a first application example we used the model to address whether there exists an upper limit on missegregation rate, beyond which cancer populations collapse. Chromosome missegregations are common. They occur in 1.2-2.3% per mitosis in normal cells [1] and in cancer cells their rate is between one and two orders of magnitudes higher [2]. The model revealed that the upper limit of missegregation rate is a function of the tumors turnover rate (i.e. how fast the tumor renews itself). In heterogenous populations however, cells with low missegregation rates protect the population from collapse. Intra-tumor heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in missegregation rates, increases as tumors progress, rendering missegregation-induced extinction unlikely.",

    "abstract": "A key question in auditory neuroscience is to what extent are brain regions functionally specialized for processing specific sound features such as sound location and identity. In auditory cortex, correlations between neural activity and sounds support both the specialization of distinct cortical subfields, and encoding of multiple sound features within individual cortical areas. However, few studies have tested the contribution of auditory cortex to hearing in multiple contexts. Here we determined the role of ferret primary auditory cortex in both spatial and non-spatial hearing by reversibly inactivating the middle ectosylvian gyrus during behavior using cooling (n=2) or optogenetics (n=1). In optogenetic experiments, we utilized the mDLx promoter to express Channelrhodopsin 2 in GABAergic interneurons and confirmed both viral expression (n=2) and light-driven suppression of spiking activity in auditory cortex, recorded using Neuropixels under anesthesia (n=465 units from 2 additional untrained ferrets). Cortical inactivation impaired vowel discrimination in co-located noise, but not in clean conditions, or when the temporally coincident vowel and noise were spatially separated by 180{degrees}. Testing the ferrets implanted with cooling loops in a sound localization task confirmed that deficits in spatial hearing arose from inactivation of the same region of auditory cortex that was implicated in vowel discrimination in noise. Our results are consistent with single unit recordings in primary auditory cortex showing mixed selectivity for spatial and non-spatial features of sound and suggest a contribution of this region to multiple forms of hearing necessary for auditory scene analysis.\n\nSignificance StatementNeurons in primary auditory cortex are often sensitive to the location and identity of sounds. Here we inactivated auditory cortex during spatial and non- spatial listening tasks using cooling, or optogenetics. Auditory cortical inactivation impaired multiple behaviors, demonstrating a role in both the analysis of sound location and identity and confirming a functional contribution of mixed selectivity observed in neural activity. Parallel optogenetic experiments in two additional untrained ferrets linked behavior to physiology by demonstrating that expression of Channelrhodopsin 2 permitted rapid light-driven suppression of auditory cortical activity recorded under anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "The position of some taxa on the Tree of Life remains controversial despite the increase in genomic data used to infer phylogenies. While analyzing large datasets alleviates stochastic errors, it does not prevent systematic errors in inference, caused by both biological (e.g., incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization) and methodological (e.g., incorrect modeling, erroneous orthology assessments) factors. In this study, we systematically investigated factors that could result in these controversies, using the treeshrew (Scandentia, Mammalia) as a study case. Recent studies have narrowed the phylogenetic position of treeshrews to three competing hypotheses: sister to primates and flying lemurs (Primatomorpha), sister to rodents and lagomorphs (Glires), or sister to a clade comprising all of these. We sampled 50 mammal species including three treeshrews, a selection of taxa from the potential sister groups, and outgroups. Using a large diverse set of loci, we assessed support for the alternative phylogenetic position of treeshrews. The results suggest that the data has statistical support for two hypotheses for the placements of treeshrews, sister to Primatomorpha and to Primatomorpha+Glires. While we observe differences in properties of loci of different types (e.g., CDS, intron, etc.) with respect to the strength of the signal, the support for any particular topology is not dependent on the properties of the data. Rather, we show that the method of phylogenetic signal assessment, as well as whether the signal is measured using the full dataset or only loci with the strongest signal, impact the results much more.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant immune responses to resident microbes promote inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic inflammatory conditions. However, how microbiota-specific immunity is controlled in mucosal tissues remains poorly understood. Here, we find that mice lacking epithelial expression of microbiota-sensitive histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) exhibit increased accumulation of commensal-specific CD4+ T cells in the intestine, provoking the hypothesis that epithelial HDAC3 may instruct local microbiota-specific immunity. Consistent with this, microbiota-specific CD4+ T cells and epithelial HDAC3 expression were concurrently induced following early-life microbiota colonization. Further, epithelial-intrinsic ablation of HDAC3 promoted T cell driven-colitis and primed development of pathogenic commensal-specific Th17 cells. Mechanistically, HDAC3 was essential for MHC class II (MHCII) expression by the intestinal epithelium, and epithelial-intrinsic MHCII actively limited commensal-specific Th17 cells and prevented microbiota-triggered inflammation. Remarkably, HDAC3 enabled the microbiota to induce MHCII on epithelial cells and limit the number of commensal-specific T cells in the intestine. Collectively, these data reveal a central role for an epithelial histone deacetylase in controlling development of tissue-intrinsic T cells that recognize commensal microbes and drive pathologic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrate vision, the feature-extracting circuits of the inner retina are driven by photoreceptors whose outputs are already pre-processed. In zebrafish, for example, outer retinal circuits split \"colour\" from \"greyscale\" information across all four cone-photoreceptor types. How does the inner retina process this incoming spectral information while also combining cone-signals to shape new greyscale functions?\n\nWe address this question by imaging the light driven responses of amacrine cells (ACs) and bipolar cells (BCs) in larval zebrafish, in the presence and pharmacological absence of inner retinal inhibition. We find that amacrine cells exert distinct effects on greyscale processing depending on retinal region, as well as contributing to the generation of colour opponency in the central retina. However, in the peripheral retina amacrine cells enhanced opponency in some bipolar cells while at the same time suppressing pre-existing opponency in others, such that the net change in the number of colour-opponent units was essentially zero. To achieve this  dynamic balance ACs counteracted intrinsic colour opponency of BCs via the On-channel. Consistent with these observations, Off-stratifying ACs were exclusively achromatic, while all colour opponent ACs stratified in the On-sublamina.\n\nThis study reveals that the central and peripheral retina of larval zebrafish employ fundamentally distinct inhibitory circuits to control the interaction between greyscale- and colour-processing. Differential actions on the On- and Off-channels control the transmission of colour-opponent signals in the periphery.",

Recently, T. harzianum IOC-3844 (Th3844) and T. harzianum CBMAI-0179 (Th0179) demonstrated great potential in the enzymatic conversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars. Herein, we performed whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the Th3844 and Th0179 strains. To assess the genetic diversity within the genus Trichoderma, the results of both strains were compared with strains of T. atroviride CBMAI-00020 (Ta0020) and T. reesei CBMAI-0711 (Tr0711). The sequencing coverage value of all genomes evaluated in this study was higher than that of previously reported genomes for the same species of Trichoderma. The resulting assembly revealed total lengths of 40 Mb (Th3844), 39 Mb (Th0179), 36 Mb (Ta0020), and 32 Mb (Tr0711). A genome-wide phylogenetic analysis provided details on the relationships of the newly sequenced species with other Trichoderma species. Structural variants revealed genomic rearrangements among Th3844, Th0179, Ta0020, and Tr0711 relative to the T. reesei QM6a reference genome and showed the functional effects of such variants. In conclusion, the findings presented herein allow the visualization of genetic diversity in the evaluated strains and offer opportunities to explore such fungal genomes in future biotechnological and industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "There is a strong consensus that selection for fungicide resistant pathogen strains can be most effectively limited by using applications of mixtures of fungicides designed to balance disease control against selection. However, how to do this in practice is not entirely characterised. Previous work indicates optimal mixtures of pairs of fungicides which are both at a high risk of resistance can be constructed using pairs of doses which select equally for both single resistant strains in the first year of application. What has not been addressed thus far is the important real-world case in which the initial levels of resistance to each fungicide differ, for example because the chemicals have been available for different lengths of time. We show how recommendations based on equal selection in the first year can be sub-optimal in this case. We introduce a simple alternative approach, based on equalising the frequencies of single resistant strains in the year that achieving acceptable levels of control is predicted to become impossible. We show that this strategy is robust to changes in parameters controlling pathogen epidemiology and fungicide efficacy. We develop our recommendation using a pre-existing, parameterised model of Zymoseptoria tritici (the pathogen causing Septoria leaf blotch on wheat), which exemplifies the range of plant pathogens which predominantly spread clonally, but for which sexual reproduction forms an important component of the life cycle. We show that pathogen sexual reproduction can influence the rate at which fungicide resistance develops, but does not qualitatively affect our optimal resistance management recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Establishing and maintaining tolerance to self- or innocuous foreign antigens is vital for preservation of organismal health. Within the thymus, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) expressing AutoImmune Regulator, Aire, play a critical role in self-tolerance through deletion of autoreactive T cells and promotion of thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell development. Within weeks of birth, a separate wave of Treg cell differentiation occurs in the periphery, upon exposure to dietary and commensal microbiota derived antigens, yet the cell types responsible for the generation of peripheral Treg (pTreg) cells are not known. Here we identified a new class of ROR{gamma}t+ antigen-presenting cells (APC), dubbed Thetis cells (TCs), with transcriptional features of both mTECs and dendritic cells (DCs), comprising 4 major sub-groups (TC I-IV). We uncovered a developmental wave of TCs within intestinal lymph nodes during a critical early life window, coincident with the wave of pTreg cell differentiation. While TC I and III expressed the signature mTEC nuclear factor Aire, TC IV lacked Aire expression and were enriched for molecules required for pTreg generation, including the TGF-{beta} activating integrin v{beta}8. Loss of either MHCII or Itgb8 expression by TCs led to a profound impairment in intestinal pTreg differentiation, with onset of intestinal inflammation. In contrast, MHCII expression by ROR{gamma}t+ group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and classical DCs was neither sufficient nor required for pTreg generation, further implicating TCs as the tolerogenic ROR{gamma}t+ APC with an essential early life function. Our studies reveal parallel pathways for establishment of tolerance to self and foreign antigen within the thymus and periphery, marked by involvement of shared cellular and transcriptional programs.",

    "abstract": "Muscle degeneration is the most prevalent cause for frailty and dependency in inherited diseases and ageing, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Elucidation of pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as effective treatments for muscle diseases represents an important goal in improving human health. Here, we show that phosphatidylethanolamine cytidyltransferase (PCYT2/ECT), the critical enzyme of the Kennedy branch of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis pathway, has an essential role in muscle health. Human genetic deficiency in PCYT2 causes a severe disease with failure to thrive and progressive muscle weakness. Pcyt2 mutant zebrafish recapitulate the patient phenotypes, indicating that the role of PCYT2/PE in muscle is evolutionary conserved. Muscle specific Pcyt2 knockout mice exhibited failure to thrive, impaired muscle development, progressive muscle weakness, muscle loss, accelerated ageing, and reduced lifespan. Mechanistically, Pcyt2 deficiency affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and physicochemical properties of the myofiber membrane lipid bilayer, in particular under exercise strain. We also show that PCYT2 activity declines in the aging muscles of humans and mice. AAV-based delivery of PCYT2 rescued muscle weakness in Pcyt2 knock-out mice and, importantly, improved muscle strength in old mice, offering a novel therapeutic avenue for rare disease patients and muscle aging. Thus, PCYT2 plays a fundamental, specific, and conserved role in vertebrate muscle health, linking PCYT2 and PCYT2 synthesized PE lipids to severe muscle dystrophy, exercise intolerance and aging.",

    "abstract": "North Carolina macular dystrophy (NCMD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease affecting macular development. The disease is caused by non-coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in two hotspot regions near PRDM13 and by duplications in two distinct chromosomal loci, overlapping DNase I hypersensitive sites near either PRDM13 or IRX1.\n\nTo unravel the mechanisms by which these variants cause disease, we first established a genome-wide multi-omics retinal database, RegRet. Integration of UMI-4C profiles we generated on adult human retina then allowed fine-mapping of the interactions of the PRDM13 and IRX1 gene promoters, and the identification of eighteen candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs), the activity of which was investigated by luciferase and Xenopus enhancer assays.\n\nNext, luciferase assays showed that the non-coding SNVs located in the two hotspot regions of PRDM13 affect cCRE activity, including two novel NCMD-associated non-coding SNVs that we identified. Interestingly, the cCRE containing one of these SNVs was shown to interact with the PRDM13 promoter, demonstrated in vivo activity in Xenopus, and is active at the developmental stage when progenitor cells of the central retina exit mitosis, putting forward this region as a PRDM13 enhancer.\n\nFinally, mining of single-cell transcriptional data of embryonic and adult retina revealed the highest expression of PRDM13 and IRX1 when amacrine cells start to synapse with retinal ganglion cells, supporting the hypothesis that altered PRDM13 or IRX1 expression impairs interactions between these cells during retinogenesis.\n\nOverall, this study gained insight into the cis-regulatory mechanisms of NCMD and supports that this condition is a retinal enhanceropathy.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=149 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481329v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a85e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9bfe55org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156a9d8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a8cb92_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Some tumour cells possess innate resistance, while others reprogramme during drug exposure and survive to form persister cells, a source of potential cancer cells for recurrent disease. Tracing individual melanoma cell populations through tumour regression and into recurrent disease remains largely unexplored, in part, because complex animal models are required for live imaging of cell populations over time. Here, we apply tamoxifen-inducible creERt2/loxP lineage tracing to a zebrafish model of MITF-dependent melanoma regression and recurrence to image and trace cell populations in vivo through disease stages. Using this strategy, we show that melanoma persister cells at the minimal residual disease site originate from the primary tumour. Next, we fate mapped rare MITF-independent persister cells and demonstrate that these cells directly contribute to progressive disease. Multiplex immunohistochemistry confirmed MITF-independent persister cells give rise to Mitfa+ cells in recurrent disease. Taken together, our work reveals a direct contribution of persister cell populations to recurrent disease, and provides a resource for lineage tracing methodology in adult zebrafish cancer models.\n\nSummary statementWe fate map melanoma cells from the primary tumour into a persister cell state and show that persister cells directly contribute to recurrent disease.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Typhimurium definitive type 104 (DT104) can infect both humans and animals and is often multidrug-resistant (MDR). Previous studies have indicated that, unlike most S. Typhimurium, the overwhelming majority of DT104 strains produce pertussis-like toxin ArtAB via prophage-encoded genes artAB. However, DT104 that lack artAB have been described on occasion. Here, we identify a MDR DT104 complex lineage circulating among humans and cattle in the United States, which lacks artAB (i.e., the \"U.S. artAB-negative major clade\"; n = 42 genomes). Unlike most other bovine- and human-associated DT104 complex strains from the U.S. (n = 230 total genomes), which harbor artAB on prophage Gifsy-1 (n = 177), members of the U.S. artAB-negative major clade lack Gifsy-1, as well as anti-inflammatory effector gogB. The U.S. artAB-negative major clade encompasses human- and cattle-associated strains isolated from [&ge;]11 U.S. states over a twenty-year period. The clade was predicted to have lost artAB, Gifsy-1, and gogB circa 1985-1987 (95% highest posterior density interval 1979.0-1992.1). When compared to DT104 genomes from other world regions (n = 752 total genomes), several additional, sporadic artAB, Gifsy-1, and/or gogB loss events among clades encompassing [&le;]5 genomes were observed. Using phenotypic assays that simulate conditions encountered during human and/or bovine digestion, members of the U.S. artAB-negative major clade did not differ from closely related Gifsy-1/artAB/gogB-harboring U.S. DT104 complex strains (ANOVA raw P-value > 0.05); thus, future research is needed to elucidate the roles that artAB, gogB, and Gifsy-1 play in DT104 virulence in humans and animals.\n\nImpact StatementMulti-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium definitive type 104 (DT104) was responsible for a global epidemic among humans and animals throughout the 1990s and continues to circulate worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that the vast majority of DT104 produce pertussis-like toxin ArtAB via prophage-encoded artAB. Here, we identify a DT104 complex lineage that has been circulating among cattle and humans across [&ge;]11 U.S. states for over twenty years, which lacks the ability to produce ArtAB (i.e., the \"U.S. artAB-negative major clade\"). The common ancestor of all U.S. artAB-negative major clade members lost the ability to produce ArtAB in the 1980s; however, the reason for this loss-of-function event within this well-established pathogen remains unclear. The role that ArtAB plays in DT104 virulence remains elusive, and phenotypic assays conducted here indicate that members of the U.S. artAB-negative major clade do not have a significant advantage or disadvantage relative to closely related, Gifsy-1/artAB/gogB-harboring U.S. DT104 complex strains when exposed to stressors encountered during human and/or bovine digestion in vitro. However, ArtAB heterogeneity within the DT104 complex suggests clade-specific selection for or against maintenance of ArtAB. Thus, future studies querying the virulence characteristics of the U.S. artAB-negative major clade are needed.\n\nData SummarySupplementary Data is available under DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7688792, with URL https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7688792.",

    "abstract": "The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to be primed for viral entry by the host cell protease furin has become one of the most investigated of the numerous transmission and pathogenicity features of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 The variant B.1.1.529 (Omicron) emerged in late 2020 and has continued to evolve and is now present in several distinct sub-variants. Here, we analyzed the \"furin cleavage site\" of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron variant) in vitro, to assess the role of two key mutations (spike, N679K and P681H) that are common across all subvariants compared to the ancestral B.1 virus and other notable lineages. We observed significantly increased intrinsic cleavability with furin compared to an original B lineage virus (Wuhan-Hu1), as well as to two variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617 (Delta) that subsequently had wide circulation. Increased furin-mediated cleavage was attributed to the N679K mutation, which lies outside the conventional furin binding pocket. Our findings suggest that B.1.1.529 (Omicron variant) has gained genetic features linked to intrinsic furin cleavability, in line with its evolution within the population as the COVID-19 pandemic has proceeded.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of the intracellular cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) pool is central to the formation of structured bacterial communities. Genome annotations predict the presence of dozens of conserved c-di-GMP catalytic enzymes in many bacterial species, but the functionality and regulatory control of the vast majority remain underexplored. Here, we begin to fill this gap by utilizing an experimental evolution system in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, which repeatedly produces a unique social trait through bidirectional transitions between two distinct phenotypes converging on c-di-GMP modulation. Parallel evolution of 33 lineages captured 147 unique mutations among 191 evolved isolates in genes that are empirically demonstrated, bioinformatically predicted, or previously unknown to impact the intracellular pool of c-di-GMP. Quantitative chemistry confirmed that each mutation causing the phenotypic shift predictably amplifies or reduces c-di-GMP production. We integrate our mutation, phenotype, and quantification data with current models of known regulatory and catalytic systems, describe a previously unknown relationship between a regulatory component of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and c-di-GMP production, and predict functions of unexpected proteins that clearly impact c-di-GMP production. Sequential mutations that continuously disrupt or recover c-di-GMP production across discrete functional elements suggest a complex and underappreciated interconnectivity within the c-di-GMP regulome of P. fluorescens.\n\nImportanceMicrobial communities comprise densely packed cells where competition for space and resources is fierce. In our model system, mutant cells with a dry (D) phenotype are selected from a population with a mucoid (M) phenotype, and vice versa, because M and D cells physically work together to spread away from the overcrowded colony. D cells produce high levels of c-di-GMP and M cells produce low levels, so each mutation impacts c-di-GMP production. C-di-GMP is a second messenger which regulates diverse bacterial phenotypes that cause tremendous clinical and environmental problems. Many bacteria possess dozens of enzymes that are predicted to produce c-di-GMP, but most are considered to be non-functional. Here, we take advantage of the bi-directional selection of M and D phenotypes to identify key residues that could force these enzymes to turn on or off. Several unexpected proteins also participate in this process, but very little is known about them.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constant by-products of aerobic life. In excess, ROS lead to cytotoxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ageing in animals and linked to age-related pathologies in humans. Acylamino acid-releasing enzymes (AARE) are bifunctional serine proteases, acting on oxidized proteins. AARE are found in all domains of life, albeit under different names, such as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH/ACPH), acylaminoacyl peptidase (AAP), or oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH). In humans, AARE malfunction is associated with age-related pathologies, while their function in plants is less clear. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of AARE genes in the plant lineage and an in-depth analysis of AARE localization and function in the moss Physcomitrella and the angiosperm Arabidopsis. AARE loss-of-function mutants have not been described for any organism so far. We generated and analysed such mutants and describe a connection between AARE function, aggregation of oxidized proteins and plant ageing, including accelerated developmental progression and reduced life span. Our findings complement similar findings in animals and humans, and suggest a unified concept of ageing may exist in different life forms.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the process of visual search, reaction time is measured relative to stimulus onset, when the whole search field is presented in view simultaneously. Salient objects are found faster, suggesting that they are detected using peripheral vision (rather than each object being fixated in turn). This work investigated how objects are detected in the periphery when onset in the visual field is due to head movement. Is the process of target detection similarly affected by salience? We test this in 360 degree view with free head and eye movement, using a virtual reality headset with eye tracking. We presented letters and Gabor patches as stimuli in separate experiments. Four clusters were arranged horizontally such that two clusters were visible at onset either side of a fixation cross (near location) while the other two entered the field of view (FoV) when the participant made an appropriate head movement (far location). In both experiments we varied whether the target was less or more salient. We found an interesting discrepancy in that across both tasks and locations the first eye movement to land near a cluster was closer to the salient target, even though salience did not lead to a faster head movement towards a cluster at the far locations. We also found that the planning of head movement changed the landing of gaze position to be targeted more towards the centres of the clusters at the far locations, leading to more accurate initial gaze positions relative to target, regardless of salience. This suggests that the spatial information available for targeting of eye movements within a given FoV is not always available for the planning of head movements and how a target appears in view affects gaze targeting accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and precise delineation of gross tumour volumes remains a barrier to radiotherapy dose escalation and boost dosing in the treatment of solid tumours, such as prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging of tumour molecular targets has the power to enable focal dose boosting, particularly when combined with technological advances such as MRI-LINAC. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a transmembrane protein overexpressed in stromal components of >90% of epithelial carcinomas. Herein we compare targeted MRI of gold standard PSMA with FAP in the delineation of orthotopic tumours in a mouse model of prostate cancer. Control (no ligand), FAP and PSMA-targeting iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared with modification of an MRI agent (FerroTrace). Mice with orthotopic LNCaP tumours underwent T2-weighted 3D MRI 24 hours after intravenous injection of contrast agents. FAP and PSMA nanoparticles produced contrast enhancement on MRI when compared to control nanoparticles, which was most pronounced on the tumour periphery. FAP-targeted MRI increased the proportion of tumour contrast enhancing black pixels by 13.37% when compared to PSMA. Furthermore, analysis of changes in R2 values between healthy prostates and LNCaP tumours indicated an increase in contrast enhancing pixels in the tumour border of 15%, when targeting FAP, in contrast to PSMA This study demonstrates preclinical feasibility of PSMA and FAP-targeted MRI which can enable targeted image-guided focal therapy of localized prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "The deadly human malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium falciparum relies on its capacity to completely remodel its host red blood cell (RBC) through the export of hundreds of parasite proteins across several membranes to the RBC. Among these exported proteins are numerous membrane proteins that are inserted into the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) during their transport via the secretory pathway. It is not known how these exported membrane proteins are extracted from the PPM for export. To answer this question, we fused the exported membrane protein skeleton binding protein 1 (SBP1) with the rapid, efficient, and promiscuous biotin ligase known as TurboID (SBP1TbID). Our data show that the SBP1TbID fusion protein was exported efficiently to the host RBC and was able to rapidly biotinylate proteins at the host-parasite interface during its export as well as at its final destination in the host RBC. Using time-resolved proximity biotinylation and label-free quantitative proteomics, we identified early (pre-export) interactors and late (post-export) interactors of SBP1TbID. This led to the identification of 24 proteins that were 10-fold or more enriched in the pre-export time point compared to the post-export time point. Among these early interactors were two promising membrane-associated proteins, one of which has a predicted porin domain, that could potentially act as a translocon at the PPM for exported membrane proteins (Plasmodium translocon of exported membrane proteins or PTEM). Both proteins localize to the host-parasite interface during early stages of the intraerythrocytic cycle and conditional knockdown of these candidates show that they play essential roles in the asexual lifecycle of the parasite. Taken together, our data suggest that these two proteins may play a role in extracting membrane proteins from the PPM for export to the host RBC.",

Breads made using high-amylose flour may elicit a lower glycaemic response, with benefits for health, however the impact of storage on novel high-amylose wheat foods structure are not known.\n\nWe investigated the staling behaviour of high-amylose bread made from a starch branching enzyme II (sbeII) wheat mutant compared to a wild-type (WT) control, by measuring starch digestibility (susceptibility to amylolysis) and bread texture over time in different storage conditions. Breads prepared from sbeII and WT control wheat flours were subjected to fresh, refrigerated and frozen storage, and starch digestibility and crumb texture were measured up to three days. Starch from sbeII flour was characterised by a larger proportion of long chains resulting in increased amylose content, typical of sbeII mutant wheat. Starch in sbeII bread was less susceptible to amylolysis when freshly baked (~17% difference of starch digested at 90 min, C90) and after storage (26%-28% C90 difference, depending on the storage condition), compared to the WT control. Texture of freshly baked sbeII bread was similar to the WT control; storage conditions affected the progression of crumb firming and resilience to touch for both breads, but changes in crumb texture were less pronounced in sbeII bread. Overall, sbeII bread was less prone to staling than conventional WT bread during the first three days of storage, particularly when stored in the fridge or at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "Collective behavior spans several orders of magnitudes of biological organization, ranging from cell colonies, to flocks of birds, to herds of wildebeests. In this work, we investigate collective motion of glioblastoma cells in an ex-vivo experimental model of malignant brain tumors. Using time-resolved tracking of individual glioma cells, we observed collective motion characterized by weak polarization in the (directional) velocities of single cells, with fluctuations correlated over many cell lengths. The correlation length of these fluctuations scales approximately linearly with the total population size, and these scale-free correlations suggest that the system is poised near a critical point. To further investigate the source of this scale-free behavior, we used a data-driven maximum entropy model to estimate the effective length scale (nc) and strength (J) of local interactions between tumor cells. The model captures statistical features of the experimental data, including the shape of the velocity distributions and the existence of long range correlations, and suggests that nc and J vary substantially across different populations. However, the scale and strength of the interactions do not vary randomly, but instead occur on the boundary separating ordered and disordered motion, where the model exhibits classical signs of criticality, including divergences in generalized susceptibility and heat capacity. Our results suggest that brain tumor assemblies are poised near a critical point characterized by scale-free correlations in the absence of strong polarization.",

    "abstract": "1.1.1. IntroductionSpinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a major cause of disability, with complications post-injury often leading to life-long health issues with need of extensive treatment. Neurological outcome post-SCI can be variable and difficult to predict, particularly in incomplete injured patients. The identification of specific SCI biomarkers in blood, may be able to improve prognostics in the field. This study has utilised proteomic and bioinformatics methodologies to investigate differentially expressed proteins in plasma samples across human SCI cohorts with the aim of identifying prognostic biomarkers and biological pathway alterations that relate to neurological outcome.\n\n1.2. Methods and MaterialsBlood samples were taken, following informed consent, from ASIA impairment scale (AIS) grade C \"Improvers\" (those who experienced an AIS grade improvement) and \"Non-Improvers\" (No AIS change), and AIS grade A and D at <2 weeks (\"Acute\") and approx. 3 months (\"Sub-acute\") post-injury. The total protein concentration from each sample was extracted, with pooled samples being labelled and non-pooled samples treated with ProteoMiner beads. Samples were then analysed using two 4-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analyses and a label-free experiment for comparison, before quantifying with mass spectrometry. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD035025 and PXD035072 for the iTRAQ and label-free experiments respectively.\n\nProteomic datasets were analysed using OpenMS (version 2.6.0). R (version 4.1.4) and in particular, the R packages MSstats (version 4.0.1) and pathview (version 1.32.0) were used for downstream analysis. Proteins of interest identified from this analysis were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n1.3. ResultsThe data demonstrated proteomic differences between the cohorts, with the results from the iTRAQ approach supporting those of the label-free analysis. A total of 79 and 87 differentially abundant proteins across AIS and longitudinal groups were identified from the iTRAQ and label-free analyses, respectively. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), Peroxiredoxin 2, Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and several immunoglobulins were identified as bio-logically relevant and differentially abundant, with potential as individual prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the majority of differentially abundant proteins were components of the complement cascade and most interacted directly with the liver.\n\n1.4. ConclusionsMany of the proteins of interest identified using proteomics were detected only in a single group and therefore have potential as a binary (present or absent) biomarkers, RBP4 and PRX-2 in particular. Additional investigations into the chronology of these proteins, and their levels in other tissues (cerebrospinal fluid in particular) are needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology, including any potentially modifiable targets. Pathway analysis highlighted the complement cascade as being significant across groups of differential functional recovery.",

By engineering the point-spread function (PSF), different fluors can be imaged simultaneously and distinguished by their unique patterns, without discarding photons. Here, we insert a silicon-dioxide phase plate at the Fourier plane of the detection path of a wide-field fluorescence microscope to produce distinguishable PSFs (X-PSFs) at different wavelengths. We demonstrate that the resulting PSFs can be localized spatially and spectrally using a statistics-based computational algorithm and can be utilized for hyper-spectral super-resolution microscopy of biological samples. Single PSFs in fixed U2OS cells were acquired using dSTORM with simultaneous illumination of fluors without emission filters. The modified PSF achieves [~]21 nm lateral localization precision (FWHM), [~]17 nm axial precision (FWHM) with an average of 1,800 - 3,500 photons per PSF and a background as high as 130 - 400 photons per pixel.

We investigated differences at the receptor level for flagellin perception (FLS2 receptor) and chitin perception (LYK5 receptor) in citrus genotypes. We were able to characterize two genetically linked FLS2 homologs from  Frost Lisbon lemon (responsive) and  Washington navel orange (non-responsive). Surprisingly, FLS2 homologs from responding and non-responding genotypes were expressed in citrus and functional when transferred to a heterologous system.  Washington navel orange weakly responds to chitin, but  Tango mandarin exhibits a robust response. LYK5 alleles were identical or nearly-identical between the two genotypes and able to complement the Arabidopsis lyk4/lyk5-2 mutant with respect to chitin perception. Collectively, our data indicates that differences in chitin and flg22 perception in these citrus genotypes are not the result of sequence polymorphisms at the receptor level. These findings shed light onto the diversity of perception of microbial features and highlight genotypes capable of recognizing polymorphic pathogen features.",

    "abstract": "After six decades practice, the semi-dwarf alleles Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b (also called Rht-1 and Rht-2) had been applied into around 70% current wheat cultivars, laid the foundation for the worldwide wheat production supply, then the agronomic traits controlled by the two alleles still keep unclear except dwarfing wheat. Here 13 agronomic traits were investigated in 400 wheat accessions with seven environments, uncovered the genetic effects of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b on wheat structure and yield traits in different genetic backgrounds and environments, and the distinct genetic effects between Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, suggesting that the introduction of green revolution alleles profoundly shaped the agronomy traits of modern wheat cultivars. The late-sowing assays and regression analysis based on the phenotypic and their meteorological data showed the accessions containing Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b are more sensitive to the temperature increase, and the Rht-D1b may lost additional 8% yield compared the cultivars without the green revolution alleles if the average temperature increases 1 {degrees}C. These results suggest the application of green revolution are facing more challenges to maintain the futural wheat production supply in global warming scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Adherence to surfaces and secretion of extracellular matrix, or biofilm formation, is common in the microbial world, but we often do not know how interaction at the cellular spatial scale translates to higher-order biofilm community ecology. Here we explore an especially understudied element of biofilm ecology, namely predation by the bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. This predator can kill and consume many different Gram-negative bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli. V. cholerae can protect itself from predation within highly packed biofilm structures that it creates, whereas E. coli biofilms are highly susceptible to B. bacteriovorus. Here we explore how predator-prey dynamics change when V. cholerae and E. coli are growing in biofilms together. We find that in dual species prey biofilms, E. coli survival under B. bacteriovorus predation increases, whereas V. cholerae survival decreases. E. coli benefits from predator protection when it becomes embedded within expanding groups of highly packed V. cholerae. But we also find that the ordered, highly packed, and clonal biofilm structure of V. cholerae can be disrupted if V. cholerae cells are directly adjacent to E. coli cells at the start of biofilm growth. When this occurs, the two species become entangled, and the resulting disordered cell groups do not block predator entry. Because biofilm cell group structure depends on initial cell distributions at the start of prey biofilm growth, the colonization dynamics have a dramatic impact on the eventual multispecies biofilm architecture, which in turn determines to what extent both species survive exposure to B. bacteriovorus.\n\nSignificance StatementBacteria live in multispecies, spatially structured communities ubiquitously in the natural world. These communities, or biofilms, have a strong impact on microbial ecology, but we often do not know how cellular scale interactions determine overall biofilm structure and community dynamics. Here we explore this problem in the context of predator-prey interaction, with two prey species - Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli - being attacked by the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. We find that when V. cholerae and E. coli grow together in biofilms, the architectures that they both produce change in ways that cannot be predicted from looking at each prey species alone, and that these changes in cell group structure impact the community dynamics of predator-prey interaction in biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimObesity is a major public health issue worldwide. Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation that contribute to long-term complications, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We hypothesized that obesity may also influence the sensitivity to food contaminants, such as fumonisin B1 (FB1), a mycotoxin produced mainly by the Fusarium verticillioides. FB1, a common contaminant of corn, is the most abundant and best characterized member of the fumonisins family. This toxin provokes severe mycotoxicosis in animals, which leads to hepatotoxicity and alterations in the immune response and intestinal barrier permeability. We investigated here whether diet-induced obesity could modulate the sensitivity to oral FB1 exposure, with emphasis on gut health and hepatotoxicity.\n\nMethodsThe metabolic effects of FB1 were assessed in obese and non-obese male C57BL/6J mice. For 15 weeks, mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal chow diet (CHOW). During the last three weeks, mice were exposed or not to FB1 (10 mg/kg body weight/day) through drinking water.\n\nResultsAs expected, HFD feeding induced significant body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. FB1-exposed mice displayed a higher sphinganine/sphingosine ratio, a well-known FB1 biomarker of exposure, due to inhibition of ceramide synthases activity by FB1. Combined exposure to HFD and FB1 resulted in body weight loss and a decrease in fasting blood glucose level. This co-exposition also induces gut dysbiosis, an increase in plasma FB1 level, a decrease in liver weight and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, plasma transaminase levels were significantly increased and associated with liver inflammation in HFD/FB1-treated mice. Liver gene expression analysis revealed that the combined exposure to HFD and FB1 was associated with reduced expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and increased expression of immune response and cell cycle-associated genes.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that, in the context of obesity, FB1 exposure promotes gut dysbiosis and severe liver inflammation. To our knowledge, this study provides the first example of obesity-induced hepatitis in response to a food contaminant.",

Body size can also influence how predators receive aposematic signals, and potentially constrain the evolution of gregarious behavior. To our knowledge, the causative links between the evolution of gregariousness, aposematism and larger body sizes have not been fully resolved. Here, using the most recently resolved butterfly phylogeny and an extensive new dataset of larval traits, we reveal the evolutionary interactions between important traits linked to larval gregariousness. We show that larval gregariousness has arisen many times across the butterflies, and aposematism is a likely prerequisite for gregariousness to evolve. We also find that body size may be an important factor for determining the coloration of solitary, but not gregarious larvae. Additionally, by exposing artificial  larvae to wild avian predation, we show that undefended, cryptic  larvae are heavily predated when aggregated but benefit from solitariness, whereas the reverse is true for aposematic prey. Our data reinforce the importance of aposematism for gregarious larval survival, whilst identifying new questions about the roles of body size and toxicity in the evolution of grouping behavior.",

We find that both central measures and measures of variation on individual-based data contain biologically relevant information that is useful for distinguishing between groups, and that batch-based inference readily produces both false positive and false negative results in these comparisons.

    "abstract": "RationaleRapid reperfusion is the most effective treatment for attenuating cardiac injury caused by myocardial ischemia. Yet, reperfusion itself elicits damage to the myocardium through incompletely understood mechanisms, known as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The myocardium adapts to I/R by changes in gene expression, which determines the cellular response to reperfusion. Protein translation is a key component of gene expression. However, it is unknown how regulation of translation contributes to cardiac gene expression in response to reperfusion and whether it can be targeted to mitigate I/R injury.\n\nMethodsTo examine translation and its impact on gene expression in response to I/R we assessed protein synthesis at different timepoints after ischemia and reperfusion in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacological inhibitors were used to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms of translational control. Transient inhibition of protein synthesis was undertaken to decipher the effects of the translational response to reperfusion on cardiac function and inflammation. Cell-type-specific ribosome profiling was performed in mice subjected to I/R to determine the impact of translation on the regulation of gene expression in cardiomyocytes.\n\nResultsReperfusion increased translation rates from a previously suppressed state during ischemia in cardiomyocytes, which was associated with the induction of cell death. In vivo, I/R resulted in strong activation of translation in the myocardial border zone. Detailed analysis revealed that the upregulation of translation is mediated by eIF4F complex formation, which was specifically mediated by the mTORC1-4EBP1-eIF4F axis. Short-term pharmacological inhibition of eIF4F complex formation by 4EGI-1 or rapamycin, respectively, attenuated translation, reduced infarct size and improved long-term cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Cardiomyocyte-specific ribosome profiling identified that reperfusion damage increased translation of mRNA networks in cardiomyocytes associated with cardiac inflammation and cell infiltration. Transient inhibition of the mTORC1-4EBP1-eIF4F axis decreased the expression of proinflammatory transcripts such as Ccl2, thereby reducing Ly6Chi monocyte infiltration and myocardial inflammation.\n\nConclusionsMyocardial reperfusion induces protein synthesis in the border zone which contributes to I/R injury by rapidly translating a specific maladaptive mRNA network that mediates immune cell infiltration and inflammation. Transient inhibition of the mTORC1-4EBP1-eIF4F signaling axis during reperfusion attenuates this proinflammatory translational response, protects against I/R injury and improves long-term cardiac function after myocardial infarction.\n\nClinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat Is New?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis is the first study to investigate the impact of translational regulation on cardiomyocyte gene expression in response to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that translation regulates approximately two-thirds of differentially expressed genes in cardiomyocytes after ischemia/reperfusion, including many involved in inflammation and immune cell infiltration.\nC_LIO_LIThe translational response to ischemia/reperfusion is regulated by the mTORC1-4EBP1-eIF4F axis, which determines pro-inflammatory monocyte infiltration via control of the expression of the chemokine Ccl2.\nC_LI\n\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?O_LICurrently, there are no specific therapies to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury, which is mediated, at least in part, by a maladaptive inflammatory response.\nC_LIO_LIA translationally controlled network regulated by the mTORC1-4EBP1-eIF4F axis can be targeted by a short-term pharmacological intervention to attenuate the inflammatory response and improve cardiac function after ischemia/reperfusion in mice.\nC_LIO_LIThis study supports the emerging concept of selectively inhibiting maladaptive elements of the inflammatory response to improve outcome in patients after myocardial infarction; in addition, it provides a mechanistic basis for the currently ongoing CLEVER-ACS trial.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable joint profiling of multiple omics. These profiles can reveal the complex interplay of different regulatory layers in single cells; still, new challenges arise when integrating datasets with some features shared across experiments and others exclusive to a single source; combining information across these sources is called mosaic integration. The difficulties lie in imputing missing molecular layers to build a self-consistent atlas, finding a common latent space, and transferring learning to new data sources robustly. Existing mosaic integration approaches based on matrix factorization cannot efficiently adapt to nonlinear embeddings for the latent cell space and are not designed for accurate imputation of missing molecular layers. By contrast, we propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model, scVAEIT, to integrate and impute multimodal datasets with mosaic measurements. A key advance is the use of a missing mask for learning the conditional distribution of unobserved modalities and features, which makes scVAEIT flexible to combine different panels of measurements from multimodal datasets accurately and in an end-to-end manner. Imputing the masked features serves as a supervised learning procedure while preventing overfitting by regularization. Focusing on gene expression, protein abundance, and chromatin accessibility, we validate that scVAEIT robustly imputes the missing modalities and features of cells biologically different from the training data. scVAEIT also adjusts for batch effects while maintaining the biological variation, which provides better latent representations for the integrated datasets. We demonstrate that scVAEIT significantly improves integration and imputation across unseen cell types, different technologies, and different tissues.\n\nSignificance StatementSingle-cell multimodal assays provide an unprecedented opportunity for investigating heterogeneity of cell types and novel associations with disease and development. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights that cannot be inferred with a single modality, access typically requires the integration of multiple data sources. We propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model for mosaic integration, which involves merging data sources that include features shared across datasets and features exclusive to a single data source. Our model is designed to provide a lower dimensional representation of the cells for visualization, clustering, and other downstream tasks; accurate imputation of missing features and observations; and transfer learning for robustly imputing new datasets when only partial measurements are available.",

    "abstract": "During listening, brain activity tracks the rhythmic structures of speech signals. Here, we directly dissociated the contribution of neural tracking in the processing of speech acoustic cues from that related to linguistic processing. We examined the neural changes associated with the comprehension of Noise-Vocoded (NV) speech using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened to NV sentences in a 3-phase training paradigm: (1) pre-training, where NV stimuli were barely comprehended, (2) training with exposure of the original clear version of speech stimulus, and (3) post-training, where the same stimuli gained intelligibility from the training phase. Using this paradigm, we tested if the neural responses of a speech signal was modulated by its intelligibility without any change in its acoustic structure. To test the influence of spectral degradation on neural tracking independently of training, participants listened to two types of NV sentences (4-band and 2-band NV speech), but were only trained to understand 4-band NV speech. Significant changes in neural tracking were observed in the delta range in relation to the acoustic degradation of speech. However, we failed to find a direct effect of intelligibility on the neural tracking of speech in both theta and delta ranges. This suggests that acoustics greatly influence the neural tracking response to speech signals, and that caution needs to be taken when choosing the control signals for speech-brain tracking analyses, considering that a slight change in acoustic parameters can have strong effects on the neural tracking response.",

We took advantage of zebrafish model system to address what is the role of early serotonin before first neurons form. Unexpectedly, we experimentally revealed the existence of delayed developmental neurogenic and behavioral effects resulting from the manipulations of pre-neural (zygote, blastula and gastrula) serotonergic system. In particular, the delayed effects included differences in the synthesis of serotonin in early serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system as well as in behavioral alterations after habituation in zebrafish larvae. These effects appeared as highly specific and did not coincide with any major abnormalities. The same manipulations of the serotonergic system at neural developmental stages did not show such effects, which confirms that early effects of serotonergic system manipulation are not based on retained serotonin in embryonic cells. Accordingly, gene expression analysis demonstrated specific changes only in response to the elevation of early pre-neural serotonin, which included the delayed and pre-mature onsets of different gene expression programs. Taken together, our results introduce a novel function of early pre-neural serotonergic system in a vertebrate embryo - tuning and fine control of specific mechanisms at later neural developmental stages that result in a mild variation of a behavioral adaptive spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Although the genetic code of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was sequenced 25 years ago, the characterization of the roles of genes within it is far from complete. The lack of a complete mapping of functions to genes hampers systematic understanding of the biology of the cell. The advent of high-throughput metabolomics offers a unique approach to uncovering gene function with an attractive combination of cost, robustness, and breadth of applicability. Here we used flow-injection time-of-flight mass spectrometry (FIA-MS) to dynamically profile the metabolome of 164 loss-of-function mutants in TOR and receptor or receptor-like genes under a time-course of rapamycin treatment, generating a dataset with over 7,000 metabolomics measurements. In order to provide a resource to the broader community, those data are made available for browsing through an interactive data visualization app hosted at https://rapamycin-yeast-metabolome.herokuapp.com/. We demonstrate that dynamic metabolite responses to rapamycin are more informative than steady state responses when recovering known regulators of TOR signaling, as well as identifying new ones. Deletion of a subset of the novel genes causes phenotypes and proteome responses to rapamycin that further implicate them in TOR signaling. We found that one of these genes, CFF1, was connected to the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis through URA10. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for flagging novel potential TOR signaling-related genes and highlights the utility of dynamic perturbations when using functional metabolomics to deliver biological insight.",

    "abstract": "Recessive alleles have been shown to directly affect both human Mendelian disease phenotypes and complex traits like height. Pedigree studies also suggest that consanguinity results in increased childhood mortality and adverse health phenotypes, presumably through penetrance of recessive mutations. Here, we test whether the accumulation of homozygous, recessive alleles decreases reproductive success in a human population. We address this question among the Namibian Himba, an endogamous agro-pastoralist population, who until very recently practiced natural fertility. Using a sample of 681 individuals, we show that Himba exhibit elevated levels of \"inbreeding\", calculated as the fraction of the genome in runs of homozygosity (FROH). Many individuals contain multiple long segments of ROH in their genomes, indicating that their parents had high kinship coefficients. However, we did not find evidence that this is explained by first-cousin consanguinity, despite a reported social preference for cross-cousin marriages. Rather, we show that elevated haplotype sharing in the Himba is due to a bottleneck, likely in the past 60 generations. We test whether increased recessive mutation load results in observed fitness consequences by assessing the effects of FROH on completed fertility in a cohort of post-reproductive women (n=69). We find that higher FROH is significantly associated with lower fertility among women who have had at least one child (p<0.006). Our data suggest a multi-locus genetic effect on fitness driven by the expression of deleterious recessive alleles, especially those in long ROH. However, these effects are not the result of consanguinity but rather elevated background identity by descent.",

Single-cell technologies such as single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), can examine cell-type specific gene regulation at unprecedented detail. However, current approaches to infer cell type-specific GRNs are limited in their ability to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements and to model network dynamics on a cell lineage. To address this challenge, we have developed single-cell Multi-Task Network Inference (scMTNI), a multi-task learning framework to infer the GRN for each cell type on a lineage from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Using simulated and real datasets, we show that scMTNI is a broadly applicable framework for linear and branching lineages that accurately infers GRN dynamics and identifies key regulators of fate transitions for diverse processes such as cellular reprogramming and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Rod bipolar cells (RBCs) faithfully transmit light-driven signals from rod photoreceptors in the outer retina to third order neurons in the inner retina. Recently, significant work has focused on the role of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins in synaptic development and signal transduction at RBC synapses. We previously identified trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG) as a novel transmembrane LRR protein localized to the dendrites and axon terminals of RBCs. We now examine the effects on RBC physiology and retinal processing of TPBG genetic knockout in mice using immunofluorescence and electrophysiological techniques. The scotopic electroretinogram showed a modest increase in the b-wave and a marked attenuation in oscillatory potentials in the TPBG knockout. No effect of TPBG knockout was observed on the RBC dendritic morphology, TRPM1 currents, or RBC excitability. Because scotopic oscillatory potentials primarily reflect RBC-driven rhythmic activity of the inner retina, we investigated the contribution of TPBG to downstream transmission from RBCs to third-order neurons. Using electron microscopy, we found shorter synaptic ribbons in TPBG knockout axon terminals in RBCs. Time-resolved capacitance measurements indicated that TPBG knockout reduces synaptic vesicle exocytosis and subsequent GABAergic reciprocal feedback without altering voltage-gated Ca2+ currents. Thus, TPBG is required for normal synaptic ribbon development and efficient neurotransmitter release from RBCs to downstream cells. Our results highlight a novel synaptic role for TPBG at RBC ribbon synapses and support further examination into the mechanisms by which TPBG regulates RBC physiology.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/501380v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d5916org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3c259org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c74e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad43a8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a class of critical regulators of mammalian physiology, can initiate unique functional responses depending on the subcellular compartment of their activation. Yet, how endosomal receptors transduce location-biased outcomes remains poorly understood. Efforts to uncover the mechanistic basis of compartmentalized GPCR signaling have largely focused on the biochemical aspect of this regulation through dissection of the relevant factors. Here, we assess the biophysical positioning of receptor-containing endosomes as an alternative salient mechanism coordinating the transduction of spatially biased responses. We focus on the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR), which preferentially mediates transcriptional reprogramming via cyclic AMP (cAMP) production from early endosomes. We overcome a technical challenge that has hindered the direct assessment of the role of endosome positioning in this paradigm by devising a strategy to selectively and rapidly redistribute endosomes  on command in intact cells without perturbing their biochemical composition. Next, we present two complementary optical readouts that enable robust measurements of bulk- and gene-specific GPCR/cAMP-dependent transcription with single-cell resolution. We then combine these readouts with rapid endosome relocalization to establish that increasing endosome distance from the nucleus inhibits the initiation of the endosome-dependent response. Lastly, we demonstrate a prominent mechanistic role of phosphodiesterase (PDE)-mediated cAMP hydrolysis in this process. Our study, therefore, illuminates a novel mechanism regulating GPCR function by identifying endosome positioning as a principal mediator of spatially selective receptor signaling.\n\nSummaryG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) orchestrate essential aspects of mammalian physiology. GPCR function is tightly controlled by endocytic trafficking, where the ligand-activated receptor engages arrestins and clathrin machinery and is subsequently internalized into endosomal compartments1. While the endosome-associated receptor pool was classically presumed to be functionally inactive, it is now clear that receptors can also signal from endosomes2-4. Moreover, endosomal receptors can initiate cellular responses that are distinct from those activated at the plasma membrane. Transcriptional reprogramming was one of the first location-biased GPCR responses to be identified and shown to be stimulated from intracellular receptors5, 6. Since then, compartmentalized signaling has been implicated in the transduction of distinct phosphosignaling7, 8 and in the coordination of unique physiologies and drug actions8-17. Yet, how the endosome selectively facilitates these responses compared to other subcellular compartments remains unclear.",

Using nanobodies as crystallization chaperones is one strategy to address the problem, but its reliability is uncharacterized and in this study, we observed it to have a poor success rate. We therefore set out to engineer robust crystallization behaviour into the nanobody scaffold by exploring the nanobody-nanobody interface predominant in the PDB using >200 combinations of surface mutations. This yielded multiple polymorphs, all mediated by this interface, with one providing far superior resolution and reliability of diffraction. We therefore refer to the modified nanobody scaffolds as \"Gluebodies\" and propose at least 2 variants that should be routinely generated for chaperone experiments. We furthermore show that Gluedodies cannot rescue intrinsically non-crystallizing proteins, but are a powerful approach to improve the packing and resolution limit of poorly diffracting crystals.",

Here, we determined the cryo-EM structures of Atg18 organized in helical tubes as well as soluble oligomers. The helical assembly is composed of Atg18 tetramers forming a lozenge cylindrical lattice with remarkable structural similarity to the COPII outer coat. When reconstituted with lipid membranes, using subtomogram averaging we determined tilted Atg18 dimer structures bridging two juxtaposed lipid membranes spaced apart by 80 [A]. Together with an AlphaFold Atg18-Atg2 model, we propose that Atg18 oligomers form a structural scaffold coordinating the Atg2 membrane bridge.

    "abstract": "Concentration of neurotransmitter inside synaptic vesicles (SVs) underlies the quantal nature of synaptic transmission. In contrast to many transporters, SV uptake of the principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is driven by membrane potential. To prevent nonquantal efflux of glutamate after SV exocytosis, the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are allosterically inhibited by the neutral pH of the synaptic cleft. We have now determined high-resolution structures of VGLUT2 with a cyclic analog of glutamate bound that defines the mechanism of substrate recognition, a positively charged cytoplasmic vestibule that electrostatically attracts the negatively charged substrate, and modification by palmitoylation that promotes retrieval of the transporter after exocytosis. The structure also incorporates an extensive, cytoplasmic network of electrostatic interactions that acts as a gate. Functional analysis shows how this cytoplasmic gate confers the allosteric requirement for lumenal H+ required to restrict VGLUT activity to SVs.",

Here, we investigated a C-terminal truncating mutation (D955AfsX112) in WDR62 using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from a patient with MCPH2. We generated neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells and cerebro-cortical progenitors and neurons from patient-derived and isogenic retro-mutated iPSC lines. We found that WDR62 dysfunction resulted in impaired cell cycle progression and alterations of the neurogenic trajectories of iPSC neuroderivatives. Moreover, we report WDR62 localization at the Golgi apparatus during interphase, both in human neural progenitors in vitro and in human fetal brain tissue. WDR62 shuttling from the Golgi apparatus to spindle poles is dynamic and microtubule-dependent. Impairment of WDR62 function and localization results in severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities, thus delineating new mechanisms in MCPH etiology.",

    "abstract": "Leptospira interrogans are bacteria that can infect all vertebrates and are responsible for leptospirosis, a neglected zoonosis. Some hosts are susceptible to leptospirosis whereas mice are resistant and get chronically colonized. Although leptospires escape recognition by some immune receptors, they activate NLRP3-inflammasome and trigger IL1{beta} secretion. Classically, IL1{beta} secretion is associated with lytic inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis, resulting from cytosolic LPS binding to inflammatory caspases. Interestingly, we showed that L. interrogans do not trigger cell death in either murine, human, hamster, or bovine macrophages, escaping both pyroptosis and apoptosis. Strikingly, we also revealed in murine cells, a potent antagonistic effect of leptospires and their atypical LPS on spontaneous and E. coli LPS-induced cell death. The leptospiral LPS efficiently prevents caspase 11 dimerization and subsequent gasdermin D cleavage. Finally, we showed that pyroptosis escape by leptospires prevents massive IL1 {beta} release, and we consistently found no major role of IL1-Receptor in controlling experimental leptospirosis in vivo. Overall, our findings described a novel mechanism by which leptospires dampen inflammation, thus potentially contributing to their stealthiness.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Subsequent Omicron reinfection or COVID-19 vaccination elicited increased antibody titres with broad neutralisation of Omicron subvariants. Prior pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus infection or vaccination primed for robust antibody responses following Omicron infection but these remained primarily focussed against ancestral variants. Primary Omicron infection thus elicits a weak antibody response in children which is boosted after reinfection or vaccination.

Here, we have developed an IN siRNA encapsulated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) in vivo delivery system that is highly efficient at targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infected mouse lungs. Importantly, IN siRNA delivery without the aid of LNPs abolishes anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vivo. Our approach using LNPs as the delivery vehicle overcomes the significant barriers seen with IN delivery of siRNA therapeutics and is a significant advancement in our ability to delivery siRNAs. The studies presented here demonstrates an attractive alternate therapeutic delivery strategy for the treatment of both future and emerging respiratory viral diseases.",

    "abstract": "The replication stress response is an essential pathway that deals with the lesions that halt the progression of DNA replication forks even during an unperturbed S phase. Basal activation of the ATR and CHK1 kinases prevents the premature firing of origins of replication during S phase, avoiding the activation of an excessive number of replication forks and the appearance of genomic instability. However, the mechanisms that regulate ATR activation in the unperturbed S phase have not been fully determined. Here we present evidence showing that the AAA ATPase VCP/p97 regulates the presence of the DNA polymerase /Primase complex (POLA/PRIM) on chromatin after origin firing, thus limiting the generation of primed DNA structures that mediate the activation of ATR by TOPBP1. As a consequence, inhibiting VCP/p97 activates ATR and CHK1 leading to cell cycle arrest in G2/M. We propose that the loading of POLA/PRIM after origin firing drives the basal activation of ATR during an unperturbed S phase and VCP/p97 regulates this activation through the extraction of POLA/PRIM from chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome studies that provide temporal information are valuable for identifying groups of similarly-behaving transcripts, giving insight into overarching gene regulatory networks. Nevertheless, inferring transcriptional networks from time series data is challenging, in part because it is difficult to holistically consider both local relationships and global structure of these complex and overlapping transcriptional responses. To address this need, we employed the Partitioned Local Depth (PaLD) method to examine four time series transcriptomic datasets generated using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we provide a self-contained description of the method and demonstrate how it can be used to make predictions about gene regulatory networks based on time series data. The analysis provides a global network representation of the data from which graph partitioning methods and neighborhood analysis can reveal smaller, more well-defined groups of like-responding transcripts. These groups of transcripts that change in response to hormone treatment (e.g., auxin or ethylene) or high salinity were demonstrated to be enriched in common biological function and/or binding of transcription factors that were not identified with prior analyses of this data using other clustering and inference methodologies. These results reveal the ability of PaLD to generate predictions about gene regulatory networks using time series transcriptomic data, which can be of value to the systems biology community.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the vector of a number of medically-important viruses, including dengue virus, yellow virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus, and as such vector control is a key approach to managing the diseases they cause. Understanding the impact of vector control on these diseases is aided by first understanding its impact on Ae. aegypti population dynamics. A number of detail-rich models have been developed to couple the dynamics of the immature and adult stages of Ae. aegypti. The numerous assumptions of these models enable them to realistically characterize impacts of mosquito control, but they also constrain the ability of such models to reproduce empirical patterns that do not conform to the models behavior. In contrast, statistical models afford sufficient flexibility to extract nuanced signals from noisy data, yet they have limited ability to make predictions about impacts of mosquito control on disease caused by pathogens that the mosquitoes transmit without extensive data on mosquitoes and disease.\n\nHere, we demonstrate how the differing strengths of mechanistic realism and statistical flexibility can be fused into a single model. Our analysis utilizes data from 176,352 household-level Ae. aegypti aspirator collections conducted during 1999-2011 in Iquitos, Peru. The key step in our approach is to calibrate a single parameter of the model to spatio-temporal abundance patterns predicted by a generalized additive model (GAM). In effect, this calibrated parameter absorbs residual variation in the abundance time-series not captured by other features of the mechanistic model. We then used this calibrated parameter and the literature-derived parameters in the agent-based model to explore Ae. aegypti population dynamics and the impact of insecticide spraying to kill adult mosquitoes.\n\nThe baseline abundance predicted by the agent-based model closely matched that predicted by the GAM. Following spraying, the agent-based model predicted that mosquito abundance rebounds within about two months, commensurate with recent experimental data from Iquitos. Our approach was able to accurately reproduce abundance patterns in Iquitos and produce a realistic response to adulticide spraying, while retaining sufficient flexibility to be applied across a range of settings.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe mosquito Aedes aegypti is the vector for a number of the most medically important viruses, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Understanding the population dynamics of this mosquito, and how those dynamics might respond to vector control interventions, is critical to inform the deployment of such interventions. One of the best ways to gain this understanding is through modeling of population dynamics. Such models are often categorizes as either statistical or dynamical, and each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages - for instance, statistical models may more closely match patterns observed in empirical data, while dynamical models are better able to predict the impact of counterfactual situations such as vector control strategies. In this paper, we present an approach which fuses these two approaches in order to gain the advantages of both: it fits empirical data on Aedes aegypti population dynamics well, while producing realistic responses to vector control interventions. Our approach has the potential to inform and improve the deployment of vector control interventions, and, when used in concert with and epidemiological model, to help reduce the burden of the diseases spread by such vectors.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unsegmented positivesense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the {beta}-coronavirus. This virus was the cause of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2019 (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan, China at the early stage of the pandemic and rapidly spread around the world. Rapid transmission and reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 threaten worldwide health with a high mortality rate from the virus. According to the significant role of non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) in inhibiting host mRNA translation, this study focuses on the link between amino acid sequences of NSP1 and alterations of them spreading around the world. The SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein sequences were analyzed and FASTA files were processed by Python language programming libraries. Reference sequences compared with each NSP1 sample to identify every mutation and categorize them were based on continents and frequencies. NSP1 mutations rate divided into continents were different. Based on continental studies, E87D in global vision and also in Europe notably increased. The E87D mutation has significantly risen especially in the last months of the study as the first frequent mutation observed. The remarkable mutations, H110Y and R24C, have the second and third frequencies, respectively. Based on this mutational information, despite NSP1 being a conserved sequence occurrence, these mutations change the rate of flexibility and stability of the NSP1 protein, which can eventually affect inhibiting the host translation.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, we analyzed 6,510,947 sequences of non-structural protein 1 as a conserved region of SARS-CoV-2. According to the obtained results, 93.4819% of samples had no mutant regions on their amino acid sequences. Heat map data of mutational samples demonstrated high percentages of mutations that occurred in the region of 72 to 126 amino acids indicating a hot spot region of the protein. Increased rates of E87D, H110Y, and R24C mutations in the timeline of our study were reported as significant compared to available mutant samples. Analyzing the details of replacing amino acids in the most frequent E87D mutation reveals the role of this alteration in increasing molecule flexibility and destabilizing the structure of the protein.",

    "abstract": "The neonatal brain is characterised by intermittent bursts of oscillatory activity interspersed by relative silence. While these bursts of activity are well characterised for many cortical areas much less is known whether and how these propagate and interact with subcortical regions. Here, early network activity was recorded using silicon probes from the developing basal ganglia, including the motor/somatosensory cortex, dorsal striatum and intralaminar thalamus, during the first two postnatal weeks in mice. Using an unsupervised detection and classification method, two main classes of bursting activity were found, consisting of spindle bursts (SB) and nested gamma spindle bursts (NGB), which were characterised by oscillatory activity at respectively [~]10 Hz and [~]30 Hz. These bursts were reliably identified across all three brain structures but differed in their structural, spectral, and developmental characteristics. Coherence and cross-correlation analyses revealed that burst events often occur synchronously across different brain regions and were mostly of a similar type, especially between cortex and striatum, which also exhibited the strongest interactions as compared to other brain regions. Interestingly, the preferred frequency for these interactions suggested a developmental shift from initial lower frequencies to higher frequencies across development. Together, these results provide the first detailed description of early network activity within the developing basal ganglia and suggests that distinct brain regions drive and coordinate burst activity at different developmental stages.",

    "abstract": "Contezolid (MRX-I), a safer antibiotic of the linezolid oxazolidinone class, is a promising new antibiotic with potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) both in vitro and in vivo. To identify resistance mechanisms of contezolid in MTB, we isolated several in vitro spontaneous contezolid-resistant MTB mutants, which exhibited 16-fold increase in MICs of contezolid compared with the parent strain but was still unexpectedly susceptible to linezolid. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that most of the contezolid-resistant mutants bore mutations in the mce3R gene which encode a transcriptional repressor. The mutations in mce3R led to markedly increased expression of a monooxygenase encoding gene Rv1936. We then characterized Rv1936 as a putative flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the degradation of contezolid into its inactive DHPO ring-opened metabolites, thereby conferring drug resistance. While contezolid is an attractive drug candidate with potent antimycobacterial activity and low toxicity, the occurrence of mutations in Mce3R should be considered when designing combination therapy using contezolid for treating tuberculosis.\n\nIMPORTANCETuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of global death and the second deadliest infectious killer after COVID-19. Compared to drug-sensitive TB, the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB is more difficult and less effective due to longer regimens and higher potential for clinical adverse events. Despite the undisputed medical success of linezolid on MDR/XDR-TB therapy, this drug suffers from severe safety limitation. The new NMPA-approved drug contezolid, as an analogue of linezolid, exhibits a superior safety profile and potent antitubercular activity. Since the less-toxic contezolid is a promising drug candidate to optimize the current longer-duration MDR/XDR-TB therapy, it would be of significance to determine the resistance profiles of contezolid in MTB. Here, we present the first exploration of the frequency, mutational targets and molecular mechanisms of contezolid resistance in MTB, which could provide theoretical guidance for its future clinical application.",

    "abstract": "In a healthy gut, microbes are often aggregated with host mucus, yet the molecular basis for this organization and its impact on intestinal health are unclear. Mucus is a viscous physical barrier separating resident microbes from epithelia, but also provides glycan cues that regulate microbial behaviors. Using experimental evolution, we discovered a mucin-sensing pathway in an Aeromonas symbiont of zebrafish, Aer01. In response to the mucin-associated glycan N-acetylglucosamine, a sensor kinase regulates expression of a mucin-binding adhesin we named MbpA. When MbpA is disrupted, Aer01 colonizes to normal levels, but is largely planktonic and elicits increased intestinal inflammation, traits which are reversed by increasing cell surface MpbA. MbpA-like adhesins are common in human-associated bacteria and expression of an Akkermansia muciniphila MbpA-like adhesin in MbpA-deficient Aer01 restored lumenal aggregation and reversed its pro-inflammatory character. Our work demonstrates how resident bacteria use mucin glycans to modulate behaviors congruent with host health.",

    "abstract": "Less invasive rumen sampling methods such as oro-esophageal probes became widely popular to explore the rumen microbiome and metabolome. However, it remains unclear if such methods represent well the rumen contents from fluid and particulate fractions. Herein, we characterized the microbiome and metabolome in rumen content collected by an oro-esophageal probe and fluid, particulate, and the combined fluid-particulate fractions collected by rumen fistula in ten multiparous Holstein dairy cows. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Untargeted metabolome was characterized using gas chromatography of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Although the pH of oro-esophageal samples was greater than those of fluid, fluid-particulate, and particulate ones, we found no difference in alpha and beta-diversity of their microbiomes. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were consistently the top three most abundant phyla representing ~90% of all detected phyla across all samples. The overall metabolome PLS-DA of oro-esophageal samples was similar to the fluid-particulate samples but differed from fluid and particulate. Enrichment analysis pathways revealed few differences between oro-esophageal and fluid-particulate samples, such as the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. The results of the current study suggest that oro-esophageal sampling can be a proxy to screen the rumen microbiome with the 16S platform and overall fluid-particulate metabolome for a single-time and diet context. Nonetheless, studies focusing specifically on fluid and particulate metabolomes and specific metabolic pathways should carefully consider the sampling method used.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe techniques used to collect the rumen contents (oro-esophageal probe and rumen fistula) suggested potential differences in the populations of rumen microbes, and the implications of these techniques for high throughput studies characterizing the rumen microbiome and metabolome need further elucidation. Ten rumen-fistulated Holstein dairy cows were used to characterize the microbiome and metabolome of samples collected using an oro-esophageal probe and the rumen-fistula fluid, particulate, and fluid-particulate fractions. The results of the current study suggest that oro-esophageal sampling represents well the rumen microbiome and overall fluid-particulate metabolome. However, fluid and particulate metabolomes and specific metabolic pathways across all types of rumen samples differed, indicating that studies focused on the characterization of rumen metabolome variable fractions should carefully consider the sampling method used.",

Using bioinformatics and chemoproteomics, we identify serine hydrolases in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that are specific to the Bacteroidetes phylum. Two are predicted homologs of the human protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a key enzyme that regulates insulin signaling. Functional studies reveal that BT4193 is a true homolog of hDPP4 while the other is misannotated and is a proline-specific triaminopeptidase. We demonstrate that BT4193 is important for envelope integrity and is inhibited by FDA-approved type 2 diabetes drugs that target hDPP4. Loss of BT4193 reduces B. thetaiotaomicron fitness during in vitro growth within a diverse community.

    "abstract": "Phage satellites are mobile genetic elements that propagate by parasitizing bacteriophage replication. We report here the discovery of abundant and diverse phage satellites that were packaged as concatemeric repeats within naturally occurring bacteriophage particles in seawater. These same phage-parasitizing mobile elements were found integrated in the genomes of dominant co-occurring bacterioplankton species. Like known phage satellites, many of the marine phage satellites encoded genes for integration, DNA replication, phage interference, and capsid assembly. Many also contained distinctive gene suites indicative of unique virus hijacking, phage interference and mobilization mechanisms. Marine phage satellite sequences were widespread in local and global oceanic virioplankton populations, reflecting their ubiquity, abundance, and temporal persistence in marine planktonic communities worldwide. Their gene content and putative life cycles suggest they may impact host-cell phage immunity and defense, lateral gene transfer, and bacteriophage-induced cell mortality and host and virus productivity. These previously unrecognized marine phage satellites therefore have potential to impact the ecology and evolution of bacteria and their bacteriophages in the ocean, and similar phage parasites likely thrive in many other microbial habitats as well.\n\nSignificance statementPhage satellites are mobile genetic elements that parasitize bacteriophage, thereby exerting profound biological and ecological impacts. To date however, phage satellites have been found primarily in Gram-positive cocci and a few Gram-negative bacteria, many of which are human pathogens. Direct inspection of \"wild\" marine virus particles however, revealed that phage satellites are widely distributed in the sea, and that their genetic diversity, gene repertoires, and host ranges are much greater than previously supposed. Our analyses provide insight into their parasitic life cycles, potential satellite-helper-phage interactions, and reproductive strategies of these newly recognized phage-parasitizing mobile elements. Their properties, diversity and environmental distributions suggest they exert pervasive influence on marine plankton ecology and bacterial and virus evolution in the sea.",

    "abstract": "Human epidemiological and animal model studies have shown that the presence of colon cancer is associated with certain microbiota. Previous human colon cancer case-control reports and our preclinical model studies identify several bacterial taxa correlating with the suppression of tumor growth. This includes a sulfate-reducing bacteria from the genus Desulfovibrio, which correlates with fewer tumors and decreased phenotype penetrance as early as 1 month of age in rats. However, other studies have shown that Desulfovibrio spp. are decreased in relative abundance in healthy patient controls. To address this disparity we treated PIRC rats, a model of human familial colon cancer that harbored a complex gut microbiota, with biofilm-forming and biofilm-deficient strains of the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH). We found that the biofilm-forming DvH strain could stably colonize the rat colon, with the bacteria detected even at 3.5 months post treatment. The biofilm-deficient DvH mutant only transiently colonized the rat colon and was no longer detected in fecal samples one-week post treatment. The colonic adenoma burden at four months of age was significantly reduced in rats colonized with the biofilm- forming DvH compared to those treated with the biofilm-deficient DvH. We found a differential shift in the endogenous gut microbiota (GM) structure over time, with a notable increase in known mucin degraders in the buffer-treated control and biofilm-deficient DvH treated groups. These latter groups of rats also showed a higher level of expression of MUC2 in the colon, which encodes for the sulfonated mucin 2 expressed primarily in the gut and trachea. We also detected more dissolved sulfide in the feces from rats treated with either buffer or biofilm-deficient DvH compared to rats colonized with the biofilm-competent DvH. We found that the in vitro biofilm- forming capacity of DvH enabled in vivo engraftment of this bacterium within a complex GM population, altering the bacterial composition, and significantly reducing tumor burden in PIRC rats.",

Although a recognized microaerophile, C. jejuni is incapable of growing in an aerobic environment. The persistence and transmission of this pathogen outside its warm-blooded avian and mammalian hosts is poorly understood. Acanthamoebae species, are predatory protists and form an important ecological niche with several bacterial species. Here, we investigate the interaction of C. jejuni and Acanthamoebae castellanii at the single-cell level. We observe that a subpopulation of C. jejuni cells can resist killing by A. castellanii and non-digested bacteria are released into the environment where they can persist. In addition, we observe that A. castellanii can harbor C. jejuni even upon encystment. Transcriptome analyses of C. jejuni interactions revealed similar survival mechanisms when infecting both A. castellanii and warm-blooded hosts. In particular, nitrosative stress defense mechanisms and flagellum function are important as confirmed by mutational analyses. This study describes a new host-pathogen interaction for C. jejuni and confirms that amoebae are transient hosts for the persistence, adaptability and potential transmission of C. jejuni.",

    "abstract": "Viral infections of marine bacteria modulate the rates of primary production and the cycling of organic and inorganic matter in the worlds oceans. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that viral infections influence the ecology of purple and green sulfur bacteria (PSB and GSB) in anoxic and sulfidic (euxinic) lakes, modern analogs of early Earth oceans. Over 200 high and medium quality viral contigs were identified in long-read metagenomes from the sediments and water column of Lime Blue and Poison Lake, respectively. We compared these sequences with 94 predicted prophages identified in the complete genomes of PSB (n = 213) and GSB (n = 33). Viral genomes carrying psbA, encoding the small subunit of photosystem II protein, were present in all three datasets (sediment, water column, and complete genomes). The ubiquity of these genes suggests that PSB and GSB viruses interfere with the light reactions of sulfur-oxidizing autotrophs in a process similar to viral modulation of photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria. Viruses predicted to infect PSB and GSB also encoded auxiliary metabolic genes involved in reductive sulfur assimilation as cysteine, a pathway not yet described in these sulfur bacteria, as well as genes involved in pigment production (crtF) and carbon fixation (CP12, zwf, PGD). These observations highlight the potential for viral modulation of metabolic markers used as proxies to interpret biogeochemical processes in early Earth oceans.",

    "abstract": "UV radiation, desiccation, and starvation induce some cyanobacteria to produce a UVA-absorbing pigment, scytonemin, at extracellular sheaths. Although the accumulation of scytonemin is recognizable as dark sheaths through optical microscopes, it has been nontrivial to identify its redox status and obtain its subcellular distribution in response to physiological conditions. Here, we show that a spontaneous Raman scattering spectral microscopy based on an excitation-laser-line-scanning method unveil 3D subcellular distributions of non-UV-induced scytonemins with distinct redox statuses in a filamentous cyanobacterium with a single nitrogen-fixing cell at the basal end. Cellular differentiations and scytonemin redox conditions were simultaneously visualized with an excitation wavelength at 1064 nm that is virtually free from the optical screening by the dark sheaths. The molecular imaging results give insights into not only secretion mechanisms of the sunscreen pigment but also interdependence between photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and redox homeostasis in one of the simplest forms of multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "A new bacterial strain highly tolerant to desiccation and to UV radiation has been isolated from the microbiome of solar panels. This strain showed a high xerotolerance in the exponential and the stationary phase of growth and it has been classified as Arthrobacter sp. Helios according to its 16S rDNA, positioning this new strain in the  Arthrobacter citreus group. The complete genome of Arthrobacter sp. Helios consists in a single circular chromosome of 3,895,998 bp, with a 66% GC content and no plasmids. A total of 3,586 genes were predicted, of which 2,275 protein-encoding genes were functionally assigned. The genome analysis suggests that it is motile, ecologically versatile, capable of growing in a variety of carbon sources and well poised to respond to environmental stresses. Using PEG6000 to mimic arid stress conditions, we have studied the transcriptional response of this strain to matric stress when cells are cultured on media containing 10% (PEG10) and 35% PEG (PEG35). The transcriptomic analysis revealed that cells can be easily adapted to moderate matric stress (PEG10) by modifying the expression of a small number of genes to maintain a high growth rate, while a higher matric stress (PEG35) altered the expression of many more genes. Remarkably, these metabolic changes do not confer the cells a higher tolerance to desiccation, suggesting that mechanisms to support matric stress and desiccation tolerance are different. The peculiar observation that Arthrobacter sp. Helios seems to be permanently prepared to handle the desiccation stress makes it an exciting chassis for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research on marine N2 fixation focused on Trichodesmium, which are generally free-living cyanobacteria, but in recent years the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A) has received increasing attention. However, few studies have shed light on the influence of the host versus the habitat on UCYN-A N2 fixation and overall metabolism. Here we compared transcriptomes from natural populations of UCYN-A from oligotrophic open-ocean versus nutrient-rich coastal waters, using a microarray that targets the full genomes of UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 and known genes for UCYN-A3. We found that UCYN-A2, usually regarded as adapted to coastal environments, was transcriptionally very active in the open ocean and appeared to be less impacted by habitat change than UCYN-A1. Across habitats and sublineages, genes for N2 fixation and energy production had high transcript levels, and, intriguingly, were among the minority of genes that kept the same schedule of diel expression. This might indicate different regulatory mechanisms for genes that are critical to the symbiosis for the exchange of nitrogen for carbon from the host. Our results underscore the importance of N2 fixation in UCYN-A symbioses across habitats, with consequences for community interactions and global biogeochemical cycles.",

    "abstract": "In response to the host environment, Cryptococcus neoformans must rapidly reprogram its translatome from one which promotes growth to one which is responsive to host temperature and oxidative stress. This reprogramming is primarily driven through the Gcn2-mediated repression of translation initiation and Ccr4-mediated removal of abundant pro-growth mRNAs from the translating pool. Here we investigate the contributions of these two pathways to the translational response to stress, and show that the response to oxidative stress is primarily driven by Gcn2 whereas temperature and oxidative stress both require Ccr4. Temperature stress, but not oxidative stress, result in an increase in RNase I resistant disome. Further, eIF2 phosphorylation varies in response to the type and magnitude of stress, yet all tested conditions induce translation of integrated stress response (ISR) transcription factor Gcn4, but not necessarily the Gcn4-dependent transcription. Finally, we define the ISR regulon in response to oxidative stress in C. neoformans. Together this study identifies the differential response to host-relevant stressors in an environmental fungus which can adapt to the environment inside the human host.",

Current bioinformatic methods for their discovery have various limitations. To circumvent this, we developed an experimental technique to discover new riboswitches called SR-PAGE (Shifted Reverse Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis). A ligand-based regulatory molecule is recognized by exploiting the conformational change of the sequence following binding with the ligand within a native polyacrylamide gel. Known riboswitches were tested with their corresponding ligands to validate our method. SR-PAGE was imbricated within an SELEX to enrich switching RNAs from a TPP riboswitch-based degenerate library to change its binding preference from TPP to thiamine. The SR-PAGE technique allows performing a large screening for riboswitches, search in several organisms and test more than one ligand simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a critical adhesion complex of the muscle cell membrane, providing a mechanical link between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cortical cytoskeleton that stabilizes the sarcolemma during repeated muscle contractions. One integral component of the DGC is the transmembrane protein, sarcospan (SSPN). Overexpression of SSPN in the skeletal muscle of mdx mice (murine model of DMD) restores muscle fiber attachment to the ECM in part through an associated increase in utrophin and integrin adhesion complexes at the cell membrane, protecting the muscle from contraction-induced injury. In this study, we utilized transcriptomic and ECM protein-optimized proteomics data sets from wild-type, mdx, and mdx transgenic (mdx TG) skeletal muscle tissues to identify pathways and proteins driving the compensatory action of SSPN overexpression.\n\nMethodsThe tibialis anterior and quadriceps muscles were isolated from wild-type, mdx, and mdx TG mice and subjected to bulk RNA-Seq and global proteomics analysis using methods to enhance capture of ECM proteins. Data sets were further analyzed through the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN) and integrative gene set enrichment to identify candidate networks, signaling pathways, and upstream regulators.\n\nResultsThrough our multi-omics approach, we identified 3 classes of differentially expressed genes and proteins in mdx TG muscle, included those that were: 1) unrestored (significantly different from wild-type, but not from mdx), 2) restored (significantly different from mdx, but not from wild-type), and 3) compensatory (significantly different from both wild-type and mdx). We identified signaling pathways that may contribute to the rescue phenotype, most notably cytoskeleton and ECM organization pathways. ECM optimized-proteomics revealed an increased abundance of collagens II, V, and XI, along with {beta}-spectrin in mdx TG samples. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified upstream regulators that are computationally predicted to drive compensatory changes, revealing a possible mechanism of SSPN rescue through a rewiring of cell-ECM bidirectional communication. We found that SSPN overexpression results in upregulation of key signaling molecules associated with regulation of cytoskeleton organization and mechanotransduction, including Rho, RAC, and Wnt.\n\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that SSPN overexpression rescues dystrophin deficiency partially through mechanotransduction signaling cascades mediated through components of the ECM and the cortical cytoskeleton.",

A DNA processing protein A (DprA) is part of a multiprotein complex and facilitate natural transformation (NT) phenotype in most bacteria. The Deinococcus radiodurans, an extremely radioresistant bacterium, is efficient in N T, and its genome encodes nearly all the components of the natural competence complex. Here, we have characterized the DprA of this bacterium (DrDprA) for the known characteristics of DprA proteins in other bacteria and the mechanisms underlying its roles in the transformation of eDNA into the bacterial genome. DrDprA is found to be a unique domain organization implicating some unique functions compared with DprA of other bacteria. In vitro studies showed that the purified recombinant DrDprA binds to both ssDNA and dsDNA with nearly equal affinity and protects ssDNA from nucleolytic degradation. DrDprA showed a strong interaction with DrRecA indicating its role in RecA catalyzed functions in vivo. Mutational studies identified amino acid residues responsible for its oligomerization, interaction with DrRecA, and DNA binding characteristics of DrDprA. Further, we demonstrated that both oligomerization and DNA binding properties of DrDprA are integral to its support in DrRecA catalyzed strand exchange reaction (SER) in vitro. These results suggested that DrDprA is largely structurally conserved with DprA homologs but showed some unique structure-function features like additional domain, the same affinity to ss/ds DNA and both oligomerization and DNA binding domains collectively contribute to its support in DrRecA functions.",

The aim of the study is to identify M. leprae and host-associated gene-expression signatures that are associated with reactional states in leprosy.\n\nMethodsThe differentially expressed genes from the whole transcriptome of M. leprae were determined using genome-wide hybridization arrays with RNA extracted from skin biopsies of 20 T1R, 20 T2R and 20 non reactional controls (NR). Additionally, human immune gene-expressions were profiled using RT2-PCR profiler arrays and real-time qPCRs.\n\nResultsThe RNA quality was optimal in 16 NR, 18 T1R and 19 T2R samples. Whole transcriptome expression array of these samples revealed significant overexpression of the genes that encode integral and intrinsic membrane proteins, hydrolases and oxidoreductases. In T1R lesional skin biopsy specimens, the top 10 over significantly upregulated genes are ML2064, ML1271, ML1960, ML122, ML2498, ML1996, ML2388, ML0429, ML2030 and ML0224 in comparison to NR.

We noted ML2664 was significantly upregulated in T1R and repressed in T2R. Conversely, we havent noted any genes upregulated in T2R and repressed in T1R. In both T1R and T2R, ML2388 was significantly overexpressed. This gene encodes a probable membrane protein and epitope prediction using Bepipred -2.0 revealed a distinct B-cell epitope. Overexpression of ML2388 was noted consistently across the reaction samples.\n\nFrom the host immune gene expression profiles, genes for CXCL9, CXCL2, CD40LG, IL17A and CXCL11 were upregulated in T1R when compared to the NR. In T2R, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL9, CXCL2 and CD40LG were upregulated.\n\nConclusionA gene set signature involving bacterial genes ML2388, ML2664, and host immune genes CXCL10 and IL-17A can be transcriptomic markers for reactional states in leprosy.",

    "abstract": "The organised generation of functionally distinct cell types in developing tissues depends on establishing spatial patterns of gene expression. In many cases, this is directed by spatially graded chemical signals - known as morphogens. In the influential \"French Flag Model\", morphogen concentration is proposed to instruct cells to acquire their specific fate. However, this mechanism has been questioned. It is unclear how it produces timely and organised cell-fate decisions, despite the presence of changing morphogen levels, molecular noise and individual variability. Moreover, feedback is present at various levels in developing tissues introducing dynamics to the process that break the link between morphogen concentration, signaling activity and position. Here we develop an alternative approach using optimal control theory to tackle the problem of morphogen-driven patterning. In this framework, intracellular signalling is derived as the control strategy that guides cells to the correct fate while minimizing a combination of signalling levels and the time taken. Applying this approach demonstrates its utility and recovers key properties of the patterning strategies that are found in experimental data. Together, the analysis offers insight into the design principles that produce timely, precise and reproducible morphogen patterning and it provides an alternative framework to the French Flag paradigm for investigating and explaining the control of tissue patterning.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation early in life is a clinically established risk factor for autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, yet the impact of inflammation on human brain development is poorly understood. The cerebellum undergoes protracted postnatal maturation, making it especially susceptible to perturbations contributing to risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, using single-cell genomics, we characterize the postnatal development of cerebellar neurons and glia in 1-5-year-old children, comparing those who died while experiencing inflammation vs. non-inflamed controls. Our analyses reveal that inflammation and postnatal maturation are associated with extensive, overlapping transcriptional changes primarily in two subtypes of inhibitory neurons: Purkinje neurons and Golgi neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis of a subset of these brains revealed no change to Purkinje neuron soma size but evidence for increased activation of microglia in those subjects experiencing inflammation. Maturation- and inflammation-associated genes were strongly enriched for those implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. A gene regulatory network model integrating cell type-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility identified seven temporally specific gene networks in Purkinje neurons and suggested that the effects of inflammation correspond to blunted cellular maturation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPost-mortem cerebelli from children who perished under conditions that included inflammation exhibit transcriptomic changes consistent with blunted maturation of Purkinje neurons compared to those who succumbed to sudden accidental death.",

Animals make immune responses against parasites, and these are important in affecting the dynamics of parasite populations. Individual animals vary in their anti-parasite immune responses. Genetic polymorphism of immune-related loci contributes to inter-individual differences in immune responses, but most of what we know in this regard comes from studies of humans or laboratory animals; there are very few such studies of wild animals naturally infected with parasites. Here we have investigated the effect of polymorphism in immune-related loci (the MHC, and genes coding for cytokines and Toll-like receptors) on a wide range of immune and infection phenotypes in UK wild house mice, Mus musculus domesticus. We found strong effects of polymorphisms in various MHC and cytokine coding loci on both immune measures (antibody concentration and cytokine production) and on infection phenotypes (infection with mites, worms and viruses). Our study provides a comprehensive view of how polymorphism of immune-related loci affects immune and infection phenotypes in naturally infected wild rodent populations.",

    "abstract": "Outbred laboratory mice (Mus musculus) are readily available and have high fecundity, making them a popular choice for biomedical research, especially toxicological and pharmacological applications. Direct high throughput genome sequencing (HTS) of these widely used research animals is an important genetic quality control measure that ensures research reproducibility. HTS data have been used to confirm the common origin of outbred stocks and to molecularly define distinct outbred populations. But these data have also revealed unexpected population structure and homozygosity in some populations; genetic features that emerge when outbred stocks are not properly maintained. We used exome sequencing to discover and interrogate protein coding variation in a newly established population of Swiss-derived outbred stock (J:ARC) that is closely related to other, commonly used CD-1 outbred populations. We used these data to describe the genetic architecture of the J:ARC population including heterozygosity, minor allele frequency, LD decay, and we defined the novel, protein-coding sequence variation. These data reveal the expected genetic architecture for a properly maintained outbred stock and provide a basis for on-going genetic quality control. We also compared these data to protein coding variation found in a multiparent outbred stock, the Diversity Outbred (J:DO). We found that the more recently derived, multiparent outbred stock has significantly higher interindividual variability, greater overall genetic variation, higher heterozygosity, and fewer novel variants than the Swiss derived J:ARC stock. However, among the novel variants found in the J:DO stock, significantly more are predicted to be protein-damaging. That individuals from this population can tolerate a higher load of potentially damaging variants highlights the buffering effects of allelic diversity and the differing selective pressures in these stocks. While both outbred stocks offer significant individual heterozygosity, our data provide a molecular basis for their intended applications, where the J:DO are best suited for studies requiring maximum, population-level genetic diversity and power for mapping, while the J:ARC are best suited as a general-purpose outbred stock with robust fecundity, relatively low allelic diversity, and less potential for extreme phenotypic variability.",

    "abstract": "Allostery is fundamental to many biological processes. Due to the distant regulation nature, how allosteric mutations, modifications and effector binding impact protein function is difficult to forecast. In protein engineering, remote mutations cannot be rationally designed without large scale experimental screen. Allosteric drugs have raised much attention due to their high specificity and possibility of overcoming existing drug-resistant mutations. However, optimization of allosteric compounds remains challenging. Here, we developed a novel computational method KeyAlloSite to predict allosteric site and to identify key allosteric residues (allo-residues) based on the evolutionary coupling model. We found that protein allosteric sites are strongly coupled to orthosteric site compared to non-functional sites. We further inferred key allo-residues by pairwise comparing the difference of evolutionary coupling scores of each residue in the allosteric pocket with the functional site. Our predicted key allo-residues are in accordance with previous experimental studies for typical allosteric proteins like BCR-ABL1, Tar and PDZ3, as well as key cancer mutations. We also showed that KeyAlloSite can be used to predict key allosteric residues distant from the catalytic site that are important for enzyme catalysis. Our study demonstrates that weak coevolutionary couplings contain important information of protein allosteric regulation function. KeyAlloSite can be applied in studying the evolution of protein allosteric regulation, designing and optimizing allosteric drugs, performing functional protein design and enzyme engineering.",

    "abstract": "Crystallization of membrane proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), is challenging and frequently requires the use of lipidic cubic phase (LCP) crystallization methods. These typically yield crystals that are too small for synchrotron X-ray crystallography, but ideally suited for the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) method microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). However, the viscous nature of LCP makes sample preparation challenging. The LCP layer is often too thick for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and crystals buried in LCP cannot be identified topologically using a focused ion-beam and scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM). Therefore, the LCP needs to either be converted to the sponge phase or entirely removed from the path of the ion-beam to allow identification and milling of these crystals. Unfortunately, conversion of the LCP to sponge phase can also deteriorate the sample. Methods that avoid LCP conversion are needed. Here, we employ a novel approach using an integrated fluorescence light microscope (iFLM) inside of a FIB/SEM to identify fluorescently labelled crystals embedded deep in a thick LCP layer. The crystals are then targeted using fluorescence microscopy and unconverted LCP is removed directly using a plasma focused ion beam (pFIB). To assess the optimal ion source to prepare biological lamellae, we first characterized the four available gas sources on standard crystals of the serine protease, proteinase K. However, lamellae prepared using either argon and xenon produced the highest quality data and structures. Fluorescently labelled crystals of the human adenosine receptor embedded in thick LCP were placed directly onto EM grids without conversion to the sponge phase. Buried microcrystals were identified using iFLM, and deep lamellae were created using the xenon beam. Continuous rotation MicroED data were collected from the exposed crystalline lamella and the structure was determined using a single crystal. This study outlines a robust approach to identifying and milling LCP grown membrane protein crystals for MicroED using single microcrystals, and demonstrates plasma ion-beam milling as a powerful tool for preparing biological lamellae.",

    "abstract": "Transfer of animal and plant detritus of both terrestrial and marine origins to the deep sea occurs on the global scale. Microorganisms play an important role in mineralizing them therein, yet to identify in situ. Here we report the family Marinifilaceae that occurred as one of the most predominant bacteria thriving on the new inputs of plant and animal biomasses in both marginal and oceanic areas observed via in situ incubation about their differentiation, environmental adaption, and metabolic mechanisms underlying their prevalence in organic matter mineralizing communities. We described the metabolic features and in situ metabolizing activities of different subgroups (tentative genus level), based on the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. One representative subgroup MF-2 dominated plant detritus-enriched cultures and specialized in polysaccharide degradation by encoding many hydrolases involved in the hydrolysis of hemicellulose, pectin, starch, cellulose, and polysaccharides containing N-acetyl groups; this subgroup also encodes a manganese superoxide dismutase with the potential of lignin oxidation and possesses complete nitrogen fixation pathway to compensate for the shortage of nitrogen sources inside the plant detritus. In contrast, those dominating the animal tissue-supported microbiomes were more diverse and formed three subgroups, which distinguished themselves from MF-2 in carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. Regardless of differentiation in carbon and nitrogen metabolisms, they share in common in energy conservation through organic fermentation, and anaerobic respiration of diverse electron receptors. These results highlight the role of Marinifilaceae bacteria neglected before in organic matter mineralizing in marine environments coupling carbon and nitrogen cycling with metals and other elements.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial mineralization of organic matters has a significant impact on the global biogeochemical cycle. This report confirmed the role of Marinifilaceae in organic degradation in the oceans, with underestimated contribution in the ocean carbon cycling. It is the dominant taxon thriving on plant and animal biomasses in our in situ incubator, as well as in whale- and wood-falls. At least nine subgroups were revealed, and widely distributed in global oceans but merely predominant in organic-rich environments with an average relative abundance of 8.3 %. Different subgroups display a preference for the degradation of different macromolecules (polysaccharides, lignin, and protein) and adapt themselves to the environments via special metabolic metabolisms.",
