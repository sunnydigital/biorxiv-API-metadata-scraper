    "abstract": "Membrane transporters of the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) family mediate various physiological processes by facilitating the translocation of amino acids, neurotransmitters, and other metabolites. In the human body, these transporters are tightly controlled through various post-translational modifications with implications on protein expression, stability, membrane trafficking, and dynamics. While N-linked glycosylation is a universal regulatory mechanism among eukaryotes, the exact molecular mechanism of how glycosylation affects the SLC6 transporter family. It is generally believed that glycans influence transporter stability and membrane trafficking, however, the role of glycosylation on transporter dynamics remains inconsistent, with differing conclusions among individual transporters across the SLC6 family. In this study, we collected over 1 millisecond of aggregated all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data to identify the impact of N-glycans of four human SLC6 transporters: the serotonin transporter, dopamine transporter, glycine transporter, and neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1. We designed our computational study by first simulating all possible combination of a glycan attached to each glycosylation sites followed by investigating the effect of larger, oligo-N-linked glycans to each transporter. Our simulations reveal that glycosylation does not significantly affect transporter structure, but alters the dynamics of the glycosylated extracellular loop. The structural consequences of glycosylation on the loop dynamics are further emphasized in the presence of larger glycan molecules. However, no apparent trend in ligand stability or movement of gating helices was observed. In all, the simulations suggest that glycosylation does not consistently affect transporter structure and dynamics among the collective SLC6 family and should be characterized at a per-transporter level to further elucidate the underlining mechanisms of in vivo regulation.",

    "abstract": "Lewy body dementias are pathologically defined by the deposition of -synuclein fibrils into inclusions throughout the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) in disease harbors circulating -synuclein-fibril seeds, and parental -synuclein fibrils can template core structure into amplified fibrils. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we identify six novel -synuclein fibril assemblies amplified from ten CSF samples (3.8[A] to 2.9[A] nominal resolutions). Fibrils are classified based on two types of filament interaction, two types of {beta}-sheet stacking, and two types of hydrophobic pocket. CSF-amplified fibril products have one, two, or three distinct assemblies each. Six of ten samples share a common fibril assembly. Within this classification, the fibrils have distinct profiles in amyloid dye binding, and dramatically different potencies in both seeding new inclusions in neurons and evoked microglial pro-inflammatory responses. However, no single structural feature predicts functional phenotypes. Our results highlight CSF as a valuable resource to identify novel -synuclein assemblies potentially important in disease.",

    "abstract": "Behaviour is the ultimate output of neural circuit computations, and therefore its analysis is a cornerstone of neuroscience research. However, every animal and experimental paradigm requires different illumination conditions to capture and, in some cases, manipulate specific behavioural features. This means that researchers often develop, from scratch, their own solutions and experimental set-ups. Here, we present OptoPi, an open source, affordable ([~] {pound}600), behavioural arena with accompanying multi-animal tracking software. The system features highly customisable and reproducible visible and infrared illumination and allows for temporally precise optogenetic stimulation. OptoPi acquires images using a Raspberry Pi camera, features motorised LED-based illumination, Arduino control, as well as spectrum and irradiance monitoring to fine-tune illumination conditions with real time feedback. Our open-source software (BIO) can be used to simultaneously track multiple animals while accurately keeping individual animals identity both in on-line and off-line modes. We demonstrate the functionality of OptoPi by recording and tracking under different illumination conditions the spontaneous behaviour of larval zebrafish as well as adult Drosophila flies and their first instar larvae, an experimental animal that due to its small size and transparency has classically been hard to track. Further, we showcase OptoPis optogenetic capabilities through a series of experiments using transgenic Drosophila larvae.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila courtship studies have elucidated several principles of the neurogenetic organization of complex behavior. Through an integration across sensory modalities, males perform stereotypic patterns of chasing, courtship song production, and copulation attempts. Here we report a serendipitous finding that intense light not only enhances courtship toward female targets but also triggers unexpected courtship behaviors among male flies. Strikingly, in wild-type male-only chambers, we observed extreme behavioral manifestations, such as \"chaining\" and \"wheeling\", resembling previously reported male-male courtship behaviors in fruitless mutants and in transformants with ectopic mini-white+ overexpression. This male-male courtship was greatly diminished in a variety of visual system mutants, including disrupted phototransduction (norpA), eliminated eye-color screening pigments (white), or deletion of the R7 photoreceptor cells (sevenless). However, light-induced courtship was unhampered in wing-cut flies, despite their inability to produce courtship song, a major acoustic signal during courtship. Unexpectedly the olfactory mutants orco and sbl displayed unrestrained male-male courtship. Particularly, orco males attained maximum courtship scores under either dim or intense light conditions. Together, our observations support the notion that the innate male courtship behavior is restrained by olfactory cues under normal conditions but can be unleashed by strong visual stimulation in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Generalization in motor learning refers to the transfer of a learned compensation to other relevant contexts. The generalization function is typically assumed to be of Gaussian shape, centered on the planned motion, although more recent studies associate generalization with the actual motion. Because motor learning is thought to involve multiple adaptive processes with different time constants, we hypothesized that these processes have different time-dependent contributions to the generalization. Guided by a model-based approach, the objective of the present study was to experimentally examine these contributions. We first reformulated a validated two-state adaptation model as a combination of weighted motor primitives, each specified as a Gaussian-shaped tuning function. Adaptation in this model is achieved by updating individual weights of the primitives of the fast and slow adaptive process separately. Depending on whether updating occurred in a plan-referenced or a motion-referenced manner, the model predicted distinct contributions to the overall generalization by the slow and fast process. We tested 23 participants in a reach adaptation task, using a spontaneous recovery paradigm consisting of five successive blocks of a long adaptation phase to a viscous force field, a short adaptation phase with the opposite force, and an error-clamp phase. Generalization was assessed in eleven movement directions relative to the trained target direction. Results of our participant population fell within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced to evidence for motion-referenced updating. This mixture may reflect the differential weighting of explicit and implicit compensation strategies among participants.",

    "abstract": "Psychological loss is a common experience that erodes well-being and negatively impacts quality of life. The molecular underpinnings of loss are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of loss using an enrichment removal (ER) paradigm in rats. A comprehensive multi-omics investigation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) revealed alterations in microglia and extracellular matrix (ECM). Follow-up studies indicated that ER decreased microglia size, complexity, and phagocytosis, suggesting reduced immune surveillance. Loss also substantially increased ECM coverage, specifically targeting perineuronal nets surrounding parvalbumin interneurons, suggesting decreased plasticity and increased inhibition in the BLA following loss. Behavioral analyses suggest that these molecular effects are linked to impaired BLA salience evaluation, reflecting emotional blunting observed in human loss. These loss-like behaviors could be rescued by depleting BLA ECM during removal, helping us understand the mechanisms underlying loss and revealing novel molecular targets to ameliorate its impact.",

Curiously, the nematode lineage lost canonical mechanisms of bacterial pattern recognition. Whether other immune receptors evolved in their place is not known. Here, we characterize the first bacterial pattern recognition receptor and its natural ligand in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that the C. elegans nuclear hormone receptor NHR-86/HNF4 senses phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN), a metabolite produced by pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PCN binds to the ligand-binding domain of NHR-86/HNF4, a ligand-gated transcription factor, and activates an anti-pathogen transcriptional program in intestinal epithelial cells that provides protection against P. aeruginosa. These data de-orphan a nuclear hormone receptor and demonstrate that surveillance of metabolite signals from bacteria allows nematodes to identify virulent pathogens in their environment that are poised to cause disease.",

    "abstract": "Wolf populations are recovering and expanding across Europe, causing conflicts with livestock owners. To mitigate these conflicts and reduce livestock damages, authorities spend considerable resources to compensate damages, support damage prevention measures, and manage wolf populations. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains largely unknown, especially at larger geographic scales. Here we compiled incident-based livestock damage data across 21 countries for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020, during which 39,262 wolf-caused incidents were reported from 470 administrative regions. We found substantial regional variation in all aspects of the data, including the primary target species, the density of damages, their seasonal distribution, and their temporal trend. More than half of the variation in damage densities across regions is explained by the area of extensively cultivated habitats occupied by wolves and namely natural grasslands and broad-leaved forests. Regional variation in husbandry practices and damage prevention, while difficult to quantify at a continental scale, appear important factors to further modulate these incidents. As illustrated with detailed data from Germany, for instance, the relationship between the number of wolf units and damages is diminishing over time, suggesting some adaptation of livestock owners and local authorities to their presence, for example by increasing prevention efforts. As we argue, temporal trends of damage incidents, which are robust to variation in data collection across regions, are thus informative about the local intensity of the wolf-human conflict. We estimated increasing trends for the majority of regions, reflecting the current expansion of wolves across the continent. Nonetheless, many of these increases were moderate and for more than one third of all regions, trends were negative despite growing wolf populations, thus indicating that wolf-livestock conflicts can be successfully mitigated with proper management.",

    "abstract": "Peptide binding proteins play key roles in biology, and predicting their binding specificity is a long-standing challenge. While considerable protein structural information is available, the most successful current methods use sequence information alone, in part because it has been a challenge to model the subtle structural changes accompanying sequence substitutions. Protein structure prediction networks such as AlphaFold model sequence-structure relationships very accurately, and we reasoned that if it were possible to specifically train such networks on binding data, more generalizable models could be created. We show that placing a classifier on top of the AlphaFold network and fine-tuning the combined network parameters for both classification and structure prediction accuracy leads to a model with strong generalizable performance on a wide range of Class I and Class II peptide-MHC interactions that approaches the overall performance of the state-of-the-art NetMHCpan sequence-based method. The peptide-MHC optimized model shows excellent performance in distinguishing binding and non-binding peptides to SH3 and PDZ domains. This ability to generalize well beyond the training set far exceeds that of sequence only models, and should be particularly powerful for systems where less experimental data is available.\n\nSignificance statementPeptide binding proteins carry out a variety of biological functions in cells and predicting their binding specificity could significantly improve our understanding of molecular pathways. Deep neural networks have achieved high structure prediction accuracy, but are not trained to predict binding specificity. Here we describe an approach to extending such networks to jointly predict protein structure and binding specificity. We incorporate AlphaFold into this approach, and fine-tune its parameters on peptide-MHC Class I and II structural and binding data. The fine-tuned model approaches state-of-the-art classification accuracy on peptide-MHC specificity prediction and generalizes to other peptide-binding systems such as the PDZ and SH3 domains.",

    "abstract": "Although current mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics identifies and quantifies thousands of proteins and (modified) peptides, only a minority of them are subjected to in-depth downstream analysis. With the advent of automated processing workflows, biologically or clinically important results within a study are rarely validated by visualization of the underlying raw information. Current tools are often not integrated into the overall analysis nor readily extendable with new approaches. To remedy this, we developed AlphaViz, an open-source Python package to superimpose output from common analysis workflows on the raw data for easy visualization and validation of protein and peptide identifications. AlphaViz takes advantage of recent breakthroughs in the deep learning-assisted prediction of experimental peptide properties to allow manual assessment of the expected versus measured peptide result. We focused on the visualization of the 4-dimensional data cuboid provided by Bruker TimsTOF instruments, where the ion mobility dimension, besides intensity and retention time, can be predicted and used for verification. We illustrate how AlphaViz can quickly validate or invalidate peptide identifications regardless of the score given to them by automated workflows. Furthermore, we provide a  predict mode that can locate peptides present in the raw data but not reported by the search engine. This is illustrated the recovery of missing values from experimental replicates. Applied to phosphoproteomics, we show how key signaling nodes can be validated to enhance confidence for downstream interpretation or follow-up experiments. AlphaViz follows standards for open-source software development and features an easy-to-install graphical user interface for end-users and a modular Python package for bioinformaticians. Validation of critical proteomics results should now become a standard feature in MS-based proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses which include numerous human pathogens of escalating global health concern that are predominantly transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks. Some, such as dengue virus, exhibit the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, making traditional vaccine-based routes of fighting viral infections problematic. The pH-dependent conformational change of the envelope (E) protein required for fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes is an attractive point of inhibition by antivirals as it also has the potential to diminish the effects of ADE. Here, we systematically examined six flaviviruses by employing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a [~]400,000 atom raft system that represents a substantial portion of the curved flaviviral envelope. We utilised a benzene-mapping approach over a total of 14 s of sampling time, leading to discovery of shared hotspots and elucidation of the dynamic behaviour of conserved cryptic sites. A cryptic pocket previously shown to bind a detergent molecule exhibited significant strain-specific characteristics. An alternative conserved cryptic site located at the E protein domain interfaces showed a more consistent dynamic behaviour across flaviviruses and contains a buried, conserved cluster of ionisable residues that includes His144, previously implicated in the pH-dependent conformational switch required for fusion. The dynamics of the cluster were further explored in extensive constant-pH simulations and revealed cluster and domain-interface disruption under low pH conditions. Based on this, we propose a cluster-dependent mechanism that addresses inconsistencies in the histidine-switch hypothesis and highlights the role of cluster protonation in orchestrating the domain dissociation pivotal for the formation of the fusogenic trimer.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499710v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a90feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9535a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f41ae0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1106e41_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, relative importance of these characteristics is unclear and it is unknown if they are sufficient to unambiguously determine recombination landscape8. Here, we analyzed over 40 DNA sequence, chromatin, and chromosome location features of maize and Arabidopsis recombination sites using machine learning9,10. We discovered that a combination of just three features, CG methylation, CHG methylation, and nucleosome occupancy, enabled identification of exact crossover site with 90% accuracy. These results imply redundancy of most recombination site characteristics. Recombination takes place in a small fraction of the genome with chromatin features distinct from those of genome at large. Surprisingly, crossover sites show elevated heterochromatin histone marks despite low DNA methylation. Crossover site features show broad evolutionary conservation, which will enable creating genetic maps in species where conventional mapping is unfeasible.",

Spinal evoked motor responses (SEMR) are commonly utilized experimental outcomes in longitudinal pre-clinical and human studies to reflect the in-vivo physiological changes in neural networks secondary to a neurological insult or neuro-rehabilitative treatments utilizing ES. However, it remains unknown if the repeated exposure to ES during SEMRs testing itself modulates the spinal cord physiology and hence the SEMRs characteristics. To address this issue, cervical ES was delivered to the healthy adult rats cervical cord using standard stimulation paradigms during multiple sessions ([~]17 hours that spanned across 100 days). Cervical SEMR and electromyography (EMG) activity from forelimb muscles during a reaching & grasping task were collected before and after 100 days. We noted persistent increase in the cervical SEMR and forelimb muscle activity during reaching & grasping task relative to baseline at the end of the stimulation period indicating increased spinal and cortical excitability. Findings from the present work suggests that cervical SEMRs are amenable to modulation by routine ES testing protocols, with prominent changes in the mono and poly synaptic component of evoked responses. Additionally, since multiple testing sessions of cervical ES alone increases the excitability of the intact spinal cord, we suggest that SEMR data be used with caution to infer the physiological status of the spinal circuitry in longitudinal studies involving multiple SEMR testing sessions. Our findings also recommend involving appropriate control groups, motor behavior correlates, and practicing caution while utilizing normalization methods to allow meaningful functional interpretation of SEMR profiles following a SCI.",

    "abstract": "When learning a novel visuomotor mapping (e.g., mirror writing), accuracy can improve quickly through explicit learning (e.g., move left to go right) but after considerable practice, implicit learning takes over, producing fast, natural movements. This implicit learning occurs automatically, but it has been unknown whether explicit learning is similarly obligatory. Using a reaching task with a 90-degree rotation between screen position and movement direction, we found that explicit learning could be \"turned off\" by introducing the rotation gradually (increments of 10-degrees) and instructing participants to move quickly. These specific conditions were crucial, because both explicit and implicit learning occurred if the rotation occurred suddenly, if participants were told to emphasize accuracy, or if visual feedback during movement was removed. We reached these conclusions by examining the time course of learning (e.g., whether there was fast improvement followed by a long tail of additional improvement), by examining the aftereffects of learning when the rotation was abruptly removed, and by using formal model comparison between a dual-state (explicit and implicit) versus a single-state learning model as applied to the data.\n\nAuthor summaryIn some situations, the relationship between motion direction and what we see is different than normal. For instance, try using a computer mouse that is held sideways (a 90-degree rotation). When first encountering this situation, people move carefully, using explicit strategies (e.g., move right to go up). However, after many learning trials, motion becomes automatic (implicit) and natural. Prior results found that implicit visuomotor learning always occurs with enough experience. In our study, we found that this is not true of explicit visuomotor learning; in some situations, explicit learning can be turned off. More specifically, we found that this occurs when the novel visuomotor situation is: 1) introduced gradually (e.g., a gradual introduction of 90-degree rotation in steps of 10 degrees); 2) when there is pressure to move quickly; and 3) with real-time onscreen views of the motion path. If any of these three components are missing, then people use explicit learning. These conclusions were reached by examining the time course of learning (e.g., whether there was both fast and slow learning as assessed with mathematical models) and by examining the tendency to automatically move in the opposite direction from the rotation when the rotation is abruptly removed after learning.",

    "abstract": "Dexterous object manipulation depends critically on information about forces normal and tangential to the fingerpads, and also on torque associated with object orientation at grip surfaces. In this study we investigated how torque information is encoded by human tactile afferents, including slowly adapting type-II (SA-II) afferents, in the fingerpads. SA-II afferent properties seemed perfectly suited for torque encoding but could not be previously investigated as they are absent in the glabrous skin of monkeys. Torques of different magnitudes (3.5-7.5 mNm) were applied in clockwise and anticlockwise directions to a standard central site on the fingerpads of 34 participants. Torques were superimposed on a 2 N, 3 N, or 4 N background normal force. Unitary microneurography recordings were made from fast adapting type-I (FA-I, n=39), slowly adapting type-I (SA-I, n=31), and type-II (SA-II, n=13) afferents supplying the fingerpads. All three afferent types encoded torque magnitude and direction, with SA-II afferents showing excitatory and inhibitory modulation depending on torque direction. Most afferents of all three types had higher torque sensitivity with smaller normal force. FA-I afferents showed the best torque magnitude and worst directional discrimination abilities in both species. Human SA-I afferent response to static torque was inferior to dynamic stimuli, while in monkeys the opposite was true. In humans this might be compensated by the addition of a sustained SA-II afferent input. In comparison to monkeys the performance of each afferent type was inferior in humans, likely due to differences in fingertip tissue compliance and skin friction. [currently 246 words; 250 words max]\n\nSignificance StatementWe investigate how individual human tactile nerve fibres encode rotational forces (torques) and compare them to their monkey counterparts. Human hands, but not monkey hands, are innervated by a tactile neuron type (SA-II afferents) specialised to encode directional skin strain, yet so far, torque encoding has only been studied in monkeys. We find that human SA- I afferents were generally less sensitive and less able to discriminate torque magnitude and direction than their monkey counterparts, especially during the static phase of torque loading. However, this shortfall in humans could be compensated by the addition of SA-II afferent input. This indicates that variation in afferent types might compliment their specialisation for stimulus features, by slight differences between encoding in the two species.",

Here, we bridge microscale molecular chemoarchitecture and pharmacologically-induced macroscale functional reorganisation, by relating the regional distribution of 19 neurotransmitter receptors and transporters obtained from Positron Emission Tomography, and the regional changes in functional MRI connectivity induced by 10 different mind-altering drugs: propofol, sevoflurane, ketamine, LSD, psilocybin, DMT, ayahuasca, MDMA, modafinil, and methylphenidate. Our results reveal that psychoactive drugs exert their effects on brain function by engaging multiple neurotransmitter systems. The effects of both anaesthetics and psychedelics on brain function are organised along hierarchical gradients of brain structure and function. Finally, we show that regional co-susceptibility to pharmacological interventions recapitulates co-susceptibility to disorder-induced structural alterations. Collectively, these results highlight rich statistical patterns relating molecular chemoarchitecture and drug-induced reorganisation of the brains functional architecture.",

    "abstract": "Systematic understanding of immune dynamics across the entire human lifespan at single-cell resolution is currently lacking. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell T cell receptor (TCR)/B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing (scTCR/BCR-seq) on over 380,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from 45 healthy participants aged 0 to over 90 years. We revealed that the functions of T cell subsets were most susceptible to senescence among all PBMCs, featured by increased NF-{kappa}B signaling and IFN-{gamma} responses pathways, while reduced telomere maintenance and energy metabolism. We subsequently explored the rewiring of cell-cell interactions among different immune cells across the lifespan and revealed the major alteration of immune checkpoints in T cells within the cellular interaction networks. By combined analysis of scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq, we revealed that 1) GNLY+ CD8 Effector T cells exhibited a high clonal expansion with distinct functional signatures in children and the elderly; 2) Naive CD4+ T and naive CD8+ T cells displayed different aging patterns in both transcriptomes and immune repertoires; and 3) CD8+ MAIT cells showed a higher cell abundance and clonal diversity in adolescents. Furthermore, we identified a unique cytotoxic B cell subset enriched in children by scRNA-seq and scBCR-seq analysis and experimental validations. In summary, our work provided valuable insights and rich resources for understanding the development and aging of the human immune system across the lifespan.",

During translocations, any associated infectious agents are moved with their wildlife hosts. Accordingly, translocations can present a risk of infectious disease emergence, although they also provide an opportunity to restore natural infectious communities ( infectome) and mitigate the long-term risks of reduced natural resistance.\n\nMethodsWe used metatranscriptomic sequencing to characterise the infectome of 41 toutouwai (North Island robin, Petroica longipes) that were translocated to establish a new population within the North Island of New Zealand. We also screened for pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites.\n\nResultsAlthough we did not detect any known avian diseases, which is a positive outcome for the translocated toutouwai population, we identified a number of novel viruses of interest, including a novel avian hepatovirus, as well as a divergent calici-like virus and four hepe-like viruses of which the host species is unknown. We also revealed a novel spirochete bacterium and a coccidian eukaryotic parasite.\n\nConclusionsThe presumably non-pathogenic viruses and microbial species identified here support the idea that the majority of microorganisms likely do not cause disease in their hosts, and that translocations could serve to help restore and maintain native infectious communities. We advise greater surveillance of infectious communities of both native and non-native wildlife before and after translocations to better understand the impact, positive or negative, that such movements may have on both host and infectome ecology.",

    "abstract": "As anthropogenic climate change alters species phenology, phenological shifts may cascade to disrupt species interactions to impact ecosystem functioning. We present a 108-year phenology dataset of 8,840 event dates for 251 phenophases for seven amphibian species, 58 birds, 14 insects, and 163 plant species, including 52 species introduced to New York. The dataset was collected at a single location in the Northeastern United States, providing continuity in monitoring since the early 1900s. We show that linear phenology analyses can underestimate the magnitude of phenological shift relative to circular methods, particularly for species experiencing extreme advancements. However, species phenologies are generally advancing, with faster advancements of insects and amphibians compared to birds and plants. Additionally, in our dataset, species with event dates later in the year are advancing more rapidly than species earlier in the year, and this relationship is stronger for animals than for plants. We present a novel, network-based approach for visualizing community and ecosystem-scale phenological synchrony. Using this approach, we find a high degree of synchrony between the monitored species, and this approach reveals that plants are more central in the phenological network, as well as species with phenological events earlier in the year. While many synchronous species are shifting at relatively similar rates and display similar temperature sensitivities, we highlight two species interactions potentially vulnerable to changing climate: Eastern Tent Caterpillars and Monarchs. Our results illustrate the utility of long-term ecological monitoring for investigating ecosystem responses to climate change and identifying potentially vulnerable phenological networks.\n\nSignificance StatementThe purpose of this study is to understand how climate change has affected the phenology of an ecological community for over 100+ years. We present a novel approach to analyzing and visualizing community-level phenological data. We find that plants are central to phenological networks, as are species that flower, fruit, or undergo other phenological events earlier in the year. This is important because understanding which species are most central to an ecosystem, as well as which species are vulnerable to climate-driven mismatches (e.g., a butterfly emerges before the flowers that it feeds on bloom) that could cascade through an ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Multiple ecological forces act together to shape the composition of microbial communities. Phyloecology approaches --which combine phylogenetic relationships with community ecology-- have the potential to disentangle such forces, but are often hard to connect with quantitative predictions from theoretical models. On the other hand, macroecology, which focuses on statistical patterns of abundance and diversity, provides natural connections with theoretical models but often neglects inter-speficic correlations and interactions. Here, we propose a unified framework combining both such approaches to analyze microbial communities. In particular, by using both cross-sectional and longitudinal metagenomic data for species abundances, we reveal the existence of a novel empirical macroecological law establishing that correlations in species-abundance fluctuations across communities decay from positive to null values as a function of phylogenetic similarity in a consistent manner across ecologically distinct microbiomes. We formulate three mechanistic models --relying on alternative ecological forces-- that lead to radically different predictions. We conclude that the empirically observed macroecological pattern can be quantitatively explained as a result of shared fluctuating resources, i.e. environmental filtering and not e.g. as a consequence of species competition. Finally, we also show that the macroecological law is also valid for temporal data of a single community, and that the properties of delayed temporal correlations are reproduced by the model with environmental filtering.",

This has limited the scope of application of IBD-based mutation rate estimation. Here, we develop an IBD-based method for mutation rate estimation from population data, and we apply it to whole genome sequence data on 4,166 European American individuals from the TOPMed Framingham Heart Study, 2,966 European American individuals from the TOPMed My Life Our Future study, and 1,586 African American individuals from the TOPMed Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network study. Although mutation rates may differ between populations due to genetic factors, demographic factors such as average parental age, and environmental exposures, our results are consistent with equal genome-wide average mutation rates across these three populations. Our overall estimate of the average genome-wide mutation rate per 108 base pairs per generation for single nucleotide variants is 1.24 (95% CI 1.18-1.33).",

    "abstract": "Triterpenoids, one of the most diverse classes of natural products, have been used for centuries as active ingredients in essential oils and Chinese medicines and are of interest for many industrial applications ranging from low-calorie sweeteners to cosmetic ingredients and vaccine adjuvants. However, not only can the extraction from plant material be cumbersome due to low concentrations of the specific triterpenoid, but concerns are also increasing regarding the sustainability of wild plant harvest while meeting market demands. The alternative is to produce triterpenoids with engineered microbes. Here, we present a generally applicable strategy for triterpenoid production in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on a modified oxidosqualene cyclase Erg7. The modification reduces the flux into the sterol pathway while increasing the precursor supply for triterpenoid production. The minimally engineered strain was exploited for the exemplary production of the lupane triterpenoids betulin, betulin aldehyde, and betulinic acid at a total titer above 6 g/L, the highest reported so far. To further highlight the chassis concept, squalene, oleanane- and dammarane-type triterpenoids were synthesized to titers at a similar gram scale. We propose the developed bakers yeast as a host for the thousands of triterpenoid synthesis pathways from plants, reducing the pressure on the natural resources.",

    "abstract": "Tissue decellularization has demonstrated widespread applications across numerous organ systems for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Decellularized tissues are expected to retain structural and/or compositional features of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM), enabling investigation of biochemical factors and cell-ECM interactions that drive tissue homeostasis, healing, and disease. However, the dense collagenous tendon matrix has limited the efficacy of traditional decellularization strategies without the aid of harsh chemical detergents and/or physical agitation that disrupt tissue integrity and denature proteins involved in regulating cell behavior. Here, we adapted and established the advantages of a detergent-free decellularization method that relies on Latrunculin B actin destabilization, alternating hypertonic-hypotonic salt and water incubations, nuclease-assisted elimination of cellular material, and protease inhibitor supplementation under aseptic conditions. Compared with previous tendon decellularization studies, our method minimized collagen denaturation while adequately removing cells and preserving bulk tissue alignment and mechanical properties. Furthermore, we demonstrated that decellularized tendon ECM-derived coatings isolated from different mouse strains, injury states (i.e., naive and acutely injured/provisional), and anatomical sites harness distinct biochemical cues and robustly maintain tendon cell viability in vitro. Together, our work provides a simple and scalable decellularization method to facilitate mechanistic studies that will expand our fundamental understanding of tendon ECM and cell biology.\n\nImpact StatementIn this study, we present a decellularization method for tendon that does not rely on any detergents or physical processing techniques. We assessed the impact of detergent-free decellularization using tissue, cellular, and molecular level analyses and validated the preservation of tendon structural organization, collagen molecular integrity, and ECM-associated biological cues that are essential for studying physiological cell-ECM interactions. Lastly, we demonstrated the success of this method on healthy and injured tendon environments, across mouse strains, and for different types of tendons, illustrating the utility of this approach for isolating the contributions of biochemical cues within unique tendon ECM microenvironments.",

However, few tools exist to analyze the spatial density of regulatory chromatin interactions. Here, we present the MultI-modal NEtwork (MINE) toolkit, including MINE-Loop, MINE-Density, and MINE-Viewer. MINE-Loop network modeling integrates Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and histone ChIP-seq data to enhance the detection of regulatory chromatin interactions (RCIs, i.e., chromatin interactions that are anchoring regulatory elements to chromatin); MINE-Density quantifies the spatial density of regulatory chromatin interactions identified by MINE-Loop within different chromatin conformations; and MINE-Viewer facilitates 3D visualization of the density of chromatin interactions and participating regulatory factors, such as transcription factors. We applied MINE to investigate the relationship between the spatial density of regulatory chromatin interactions (SD-RCI) and chromatin volume change in HeLa cells before and after liquid-liquid phase separation. Changes in SD-RCI before and after treating the HeLa cells with 1,6-hexanediol showed that the change in chromatin volume was related to the degree of activation or repression of genes in chromatin interactions.

    "abstract": "In the context of fMRI, carbon dioxide (CO2) is a well-known vasodilator that has been widely used to monitor and interrogate vascular physiology. Moreover, spontaneous fluctuations in end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) reflects changes in arterial CO2 and has been demonstrated as the largest physiological noise source in the low-frequency range of the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signal. Increasing appreciation for the role of CO2 in fMRI has given rise to methods that use it for physiological denoising or estimating cerebrovascular reactivity. However, the majority of rs-fMRI studies do not involve CO2 recordings, and most often only heart rate and respiration are recorded. While the intrinsic link between these latter metrics and CO2 led to suggested possible analytical models, they have not been widely applied. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a deep learning approach to reconstruct CO2 and PETCO2 data from respiration waveforms in the resting state. We demonstrate that the one-to-one mapping between respiration and CO2 recordings can be well predicted using fully convolutional networks (FCNs), achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.946 {+/-} 0.056 with the ground truth CO2. Moreover, dynamic PETCO2 can be successfully derived from the predicted CO2, achieving r of 0.512 {+/-} 0.269 with the ground truth. Importantly, the FCN-based methods outperform previously proposed analytical methods. In addition, we provide guidelines for quality assurance of respiration recordings for the purposes of CO2 prediction. Our results demonstrate that dynamic CO2 can be obtained from respiration-volume using neural networks, complementing the still few reports in deep-learning of physiological fMRI signals, and paving the way for further research in deep-learning based bio-signal processing.",

Here we use image-based representations of protein structure to develop ProteinSGM, a score-based diffusion model that produces realistic de novo proteins and can inpaint plausible backbones and domains into structures of predefined length. With unconditional generation, we show that ProteinSGM can generate native-like protein structures, surpassing the performance of previously reported generative models. We experimentally validate some de novo designs and observe strong structural consistency with generated backbones.

    "abstract": "While population level analyses reveal significant roles for CTCF and cohesin in mammalian genome organization, their contribution to chromatin structure and gene regulation at the single-cell level remain incompletely understood 1-4. Here, we use a super-resolution microscopy approach, Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA) 5 to measure the effects of removal of CTCF or cohesin on genome folding across genomic scales. In untreated embryonic stem cells, we observe intricate, frequently stacked loops of chromatin which are largely dissolved upon cohesin removal. The loops compact chromatin at the < 3 Mb scale, increasing proximity between sequences not only within but also between TADs. We find multi-way contacts among loop anchors, preferentially at TAD borders, and these hubs largely dissolve upon CTCF degradation. CTCF-hubs bridge intervening TAD boundaries while keeping border distal regions from neighboring TADs apart outside the hub. Cohesin dependent loops at the < 3 Mb scale impede mixing at larger chromosomal scales through steric effects of loop stacking, dramatically reducing genomic cross-talk. Disruption of this ordered chromosomal structure led to increased cell-cell variability in gene expression, exceeding changes to average expression. Together our data revise the TAD-centric understanding of CTCF and cohesin, and provide a multi-scale, structural picture of how they organize the genome on the single-cell level through distinct contributions to loop stacking.",

The exact mechanisms underlying the degree of immune cell infiltration is largely unknown. Here, we quantify the temporal dynamics of the density profile of activated immune cells around a solid tumor spheroid. We propose a computational model incorporating immune cells with active, persistent movement and a proliferation rate that depends on the presence of cancer cells, and show that the model able to reproduce quantitatively the experimentally measured infiltration profile. Studying the density distribution of immune cells inside a solid tumor can help us better understand immune trafficking in the tumor micro-environment, hopefully leading towards novel immunotherapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Imipridones are a novel class of anticancer drugs with promising antiproliferative effects in several cancer cell types, including breast cancer. Recent studies identified the mitochondrial ATP-dependent caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP) as the target for imipridones and related analogs. Despite these findings, the specific processes by which ClpP activators inhibit cancer cell growth remain poorly understood. Here we report that two structurally distinct ClpP activators, ONC201 and TR-57, promote senescence in SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Induction of senescence was measured through {beta}-galactosidase assays and confirmed by the increase of H2A.X phosphorylation, hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), upregulation of multiple interleukin mRNAs and other markers. The level of senescence induced by these compounds was equivalent to that observed with the CDK4/6 inhibitor and positive control abemaciclib. To confirm the crucial role of ClpP activation in senescence induction, we generated ClpP null TNBC cell lines using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). Neither ONC201 nor TR-57 induced senescence in the ClpP null models. Incubation of WT cells with ClpP activators led to a reduction in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins like XIAP, SMAC/DIABLO, Survivin, DR4 and DR5, which correlated with the lack of apoptosis observed in these cells. Interestingly, treatment with TR-57 strongly reduced apoptosis induced by staurosporine but increased sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). To investigate the enhanced effects of TRAIL, we examined the expression of Wee1 in senescent cells and found that both TR-57 and abemaciclib down-regulated Wee1. Addition of a Wee1 inhibitor partially sensitized cells to TRAIL suggesting the importance of Wee1 in this process. In summary, we show that ClpP activators induce senescence in a ClpP-dependent manner and that combined treatment of ClpP activators with TRAIL provides an effective approach to eliminate malignant senescent cells in vitro.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LITreatment of TNBC cells with ClpP activators induces senescence in vitro\nC_LIO_LIInduction of senescence is ClpP dependent\nC_LIO_LIActivation of ClpP leads to changes in mRNA levels of senescence associated cytokines\nC_LIO_LISenescent TNBC cells are sensitized to TRAIL mediated apoptosis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultiparametric Flow Cytometry (MFC) is an essential tool to study the involved cell lineages, the aberrant differentiation/maturation patterns and the expression of aberrant antigens in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The characterization of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) at the moment of diagnosis is critical to establish reproducible strategies for the study of measurable residual disease using MFC (MFC-MRD).\n\nMethodsIn this study, we identified and characterized LAIPs by comparing the leukemic populations of 145 AML patients, using the EuroFlow AML/ MDS MFC panel, with 6 databases of normal myeloid progenitors (MPCs). Principal component analysis was used to identify and characterize the LAIPs, which were then used to generate individual profiles for MFC-MRD monitoring. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the expression patterns of LAIPs and the different subtypes of AML.\n\nThe MFC-MRD study was performed by identifying residual AML populations that matched with the LAIPs at diagnosis. To further validate this approach, the presence of MRD was also assessed by qPCR (qPCR-MRD). Finally, we studied the association between MFC-MRD and progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nResultsThe strategy used in this study allowed us to describe more than 300 different LAIPs and facilitated the association of specific phenotypes with certain subtypes of AML. The MFC-MRD monitoring based on LAIPs with good/strong specificity was applicable to virtually all patients and showed a good correlation with qPCR-MRD and PFS.\n\nConclusionsThe described methodology provides an objective method to identify and characterize LAIPs. Furthermore, it provides a theoretical basis to develop highly sensitive MFC-MRD strategies.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous, aggressive malignancy with dismal prognosis and with limited availability of targeted therapies. AML exhibits epigenetic deregulation and transcriptional plasticity that contributes to pathogenesis. KDM6 proteins are histone-3 lysine-27 demethylases that play major context dependent roles in AML evolution and therapy resistance. Here, we demonstrate that KDM6 demethylase function critically regulates DNA damage repair (DDR) gene expression programs in AML. Mechanistically, KDM6 family protein expression is regulated by genotoxic stress, with deficiency of KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) impairing DDR transcriptional activation and compromising repair potential. Acquired KDM6A loss-of-function mutations have been implicated in chemoresistance, although a significant percentage of relapsed AML have upregulated KDM6A. Based on these mechanistic findings, olaparib treatment significantly reduced engraftment of patient-derived xenografts. Thus KDM6A-mutant human primary AML samples have increased susceptibility to Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibition in vivo. Crucially, a higher KDM6A expression is correlated with venetoclax tolerance. Loss of KDM6A increased mitochondrial activity, BCL2 expression, and sensitized AML cells to venetoclax. Additionally, KDM6A loss was accompanied with a downregulated BCL2A1, which is commonly associated with venetoclax resistance. Corroborating these results, dual targeting of PARP and BCL2 was superior to PARP or BCL2 inhibitor monotherapy in inducing AML apoptosis, and primary AML cells carrying acquired KDM6A-domain mutations were even more sensitive to the combination. Together, our study illustrates a mechanistic rationale in support for a novel combination targeted therapy for human AML based on subtype heterogeneity, and establishes KDM6A as an important molecular regulator for determining therapeutic efficacy.",

Here, we report growth-promoting phytohormone brassinosteroids promote fruit ripening in tomato through regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. Exogenous BR treatment and the increase of endogenous BR content in SlCYP90B3-OE promoted ethylene production and fruit ripening. SlBZR1, a central component and positive regulator of BR signaling pathway, promotes ethylene production and carotenoid accumulation through direct transcriptional regulation of SlACO1, SlACO3 and SlPSY1. Furthermore, SlBIN2, a negative regulator of BR signaling upstream of SlBZR1, decreases ethylene production and carotenoid accumulation.

    "abstract": "Despite the obligatory nature of ethylene to climacteric fruit ripening and the identification of 77 Ethylene Response Factors (ERFs) in the tomato genome, the role of only limited ERFs has been validated in the ripening process. Here, using a comprehensive morpho-physiological, molecular and biochemical approach, we demonstrate the regulatory role of SlERF.D7 in tomato fruit ripening. The expression of SlERF.D7 positively responds to exogenous ethylene and auxin treatments, most likely in a RIN-independent manner. Overexpression of SlERF.D7 promotes ripening and its silencing has the opposite effects. Alterations in its expression modulated ethylene production, pigment accumulation, and fruit firmness. Consistently, genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, lycopene biosynthesis, and cell wall loosening were upregulated in the overexpression lines and downregulated in RNAi lines. These transgenic lines also accumulated altered levels of IAA at late-breaker stages. A positive correlation between ARF2 orthologs transcripts and SlERF.D7 mRNA levels and the fact that ARF2A and ARF2B are direct targets of SlERF.D7 underpinned the perturbed auxin-ethylene crosstalk for the altered ripening program observed in the transgenic fruits. Overall, this study uncovers that SlERF.D7 positively regulates SlARF2A/B abundance to amalgamate auxin and ethylene signalling pathways for controlling tomato fruit ripening.\n\nHighlightThe present study identifies a new ripening regulator, SlERF.D7, that controls tomato fruit ripening by activating other known-ripening regulators, SlARF2A and SlARF2B.",

To test this, we used a computational modelling approach in a broad general-population sample (N = 753) who performed the CANTAB CGT and completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of mental illness, including depression. We fit five different computational models to the data, including two novel ones, and found that a novel model that uses an inverse power function in the loss domain (contrary to standard Prospect Theory accounts), and is influenced by the probabilities but not the magnitudes of different outcomes, captures the characteristics of our dataset very well. Surprisingly, model parameters were not significantly associated with any mental health questionnaire scores, including depression scales; but they were related to demographic variables, particularly age, with stronger associations than typical model-agnostic task measures. This study showcases a new methodology to analyse data from CANTAB CGT, describes a noteworthy null finding with respect to mental health symptoms, and demonstrates the added precision that a computational approach can offer.",

    "abstract": "Numerous T1- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have separately assessed the contribution of hippocampal gray matter macrostructure (volume) and macrostructure (diffusion) to age-related declines in episodic memory, respectively. Here, we simultaneously examined the unique and joint contribution of these distinct imaging modalities in the same sample of 84 young and 66 older adults who underwent a structural MRI protocol and completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. As expected, older age was significantly related to smaller volume and higher diffusion (intracellular, dispersion, and free) in bilateral hippocampus and to worse episodic memory performance (immediate and delayed free recall, recognition). Structural equation modelling further revealed that the age-memory relationship was significantly mediated by hippocampal diffusion, but not volume. A non-significant influential indirect effect further revealed that volume and diffusion did not jointly mediate the age-memory relationship. These findings indicate that hippocampal microstructure uniquely contributes to age-related declines in episodic memory and suggest that microstructure and macrostructure capture distinct neurobiological properties of hippocampal gray matter.",

Here we examined the geometry of DNN models of visual cortex by quantifying the latent dimensionality of their natural image representations. A popular view holds that optimal DNNs compress their representations onto low-dimensional subspaces to achieve invariance and robustness, which suggests that better models of visual cortex should have low-dimensional geometries. Surprisingly, we found a strong trend in the opposite direction--neural networks with high-dimensional image subspaces tend to have better generalization performance when predicting cortical responses to held-out stimuli in both monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data. These findings held across a diversity of design parameters for DNNs, and they suggest a general principle whereby high-dimensional geometry confers a striking benefit to DNN models of visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviridae is recognized as one of the most rapidly evolving virus family as a consequence of the high genomic nucleotide substitution rates and recombination. The family comprises a large number of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, causing an array of diseases of varying severity in animals and humans. To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been identified, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, which are globally circulating in the human population (seasonal HCoV, sHCoV), and the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Seasonal HCoV are estimated to contribute to 15-30% of common cold cases in humans; although diseases are generally self-limiting, sHCoV can sometimes cause severe lower respiratory infections, as well as enteric and neurological diseases. No specific treatment is presently available for sHCoV infections. Herein we show that the anti-infective drug nitazoxanide has a potent antiviral activity against three human endemic coronaviruses, the Alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and the Beta-coronavirus HCoV-OC43 in cell culture with IC50 ranging between 0.05 and 0.15 g/ml and high selectivity indexes. We found that nitazoxanide does not affect HCoV adsorption, entry or uncoating, but acts at postentry level and interferes with the spike glycoprotein maturation, hampering its terminal glycosylation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage. Altogether the results indicate that nitazoxanide, due to its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, may represent a readily available useful tool in the treatment of seasonal coronavirus infections.",

    "abstract": "Arctic vegetation changes, such as increasing shrub-cover, are expected to accelerate climate warming through increased absorption of incoming radiation and corresponding decrease in summer shortwave albedo. Here we analyze mid-summer shortwave land-surface albedo and its change across the pan-Arctic region based on MODIS satellite observations over the past two decades (2000-2021). In contrast to expectations, we show that terrestrial mid-summer shortwave albedo has not significantly changed in 82% of the pan-Arctic region, while 14% show an increase and 4% a decrease. By analyzing the visible and near-/shortwave-infrared range separately, we demonstrate that the slight increase arises from an albedo increase in the near-/shortwave-infrared range domain while being partly compensated by a decrease in visible albedo. A similar response was found across different tundra vegetation types. We argue that this increase in reflectance is typical with increasing biomass as a result of increased multiple reflection in the canopy. However, CMIP6 global climate model albedo predictions showed the opposite sign and different spatial patterns of snow-free summer albedo change compared to satellite-derived results. We suggest that a more sophisticated vegetation parametrization can reduce this discrepancy, and provide albedo estimates per vegetation type.",

We tested the hypothesis that spatial tradeoffs between food and safety can change the drivers of population distribution, caused by opposing patterns of density-dependent habitat selection (DDHS) that are predicted by the multidimensional ideal free distribution. We addressed this using winter aerial survey data of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus canadensis) spanning four decades. Supporting our hypothesis, we found positive DDHS for food (herbaceous biomass) and negative DDHS for safety (openness and roughness), such that the primary driver of habitat selection switched from food to safety as elk density decreased from 9.3 to 2.0 elk/km2. Our results demonstrate how population density can drive landscape-level shifts in population distribution, confounding habitat selection inference and prediction, and potentially affecting community-level interactions.",

Rats fed HFD for 4 weeks developed fatty liver, and those fed HFD for 8 weeks further progressed to steatohepatitis. We observed an increase in the proportion of inflammatory macrophages, consistent with the pathological progression. Utilizing machine learning, we divided global gene regulation into modules, wherein transcription factors within a module could regulate genes within the same module, reaffirming known regulatory relationships between transcription factors and biological processes. We identified core genes--central to co-expression and protein-protein interaction--for the biological processes discovered. Notably, a large part of the core genes overlapped with genes previously implicated in NAFLD. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq, combined with data-driven statistical analysis, offers insight into in vivo global gene regulation as a combination of modules and assists in identifying core genes of relevant biological processes.\n\nSummary blurbThis study uncovers cell type-specific global gene regulation in NAFLD progression, identifying core genes and shedding light on the diseases molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "As synthetic biology becomes increasingly capable and accessible, it is likewise increasingly critical to be able to make accurate biosecurity determinations regarding the pathogenicity or toxicity of particular nucleic acid or amino acid sequences. At present, this is typically done using the BLAST algorithm to determine the best match with sequences in the NCBI databases. Neither BLAST nor the NCBI databases, however, are actually designed for biosafety determination. Critically, taxonomic errors or ambiguities in the NCBI databases can also cause errors in BLAST-based taxonomic categorization. With heavily studied taxa and frequently used biotechnology tools, even low frequency taxonomic categorization issues can lead to high rates of errors in biosecurity decision-making. Here we focus on the implications for false positives, finding that NCBI BLAST will now incorrectly categorize a number of commonly used biotechnology tool sequences as the pathogens or toxins with which they have been used. Paradoxically, this implies that problems are expected to be most acute for the pathogens and toxins of highest interest and the most widely used biotechnology tools. We thus conclude that biosecurity tools should shift away from BLAST against NCBI and towards new methods that are specifically tailored for biosafety purposes.",

An overwhelming majority of this work has focused on the upstream metabolism of tryptophan; however, this has not resulted in clinical application. Using global metabolomic profiling of patient-derived brain tumors, we identify the downstream metabolism of tryptophan and accumulation of quinolinate (QA) as a metabolic node in glioblastoma and went on to demonstrate its critical role in promoting immune tolerance. QA acts as a \"metabolic checkpoint\" in glioblastoma by inducing NMDA receptor activation and Foxo1/PPAR{gamma} signaling, resulting in amplification of immune suppressive macrophages. Using a genetically-engineered mouse model designed to inhibit production of QA, we identify kynureninase as a promising therapeutic target to revert the potent immune suppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma. These findings offer the scientific community an opportunity to revisit the biologic consequence of this pathway as it relates to oncogenesis and neurodegenerative disease and a framework for developing new immune modulatory agents to further clinical gains in these otherwise incurable diseases.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in the reconstruction of activity patterns from skeletal remains and growing scholarly interest in ancient warfare, few biomechanical studies have investigated weaponry use. We adopt a biomechanical approach to investigate who participated in ancient Maya warfare and the types of weaponry used at the Late Postclassic (ca. 1200-1450 A.D.) regional political capital of Mayapan located in northwestern Yucatan, Mexico. This has implications for the nature and scale of Maya warfare and the size of territories that could be controlled by Maya polities. Comparative Finite Element Analysis is a powerful, non-destructive method that can be applied to skeletal remains to model strain, stress and deformation of structures in response to a defined loading regime. Here, biomechanical data extracted using cross-sectional geometry were combined with Finite Element Analysis models of three ancient Maya humeri from Mayapan: one elite male, one elite female, and one commoner female. Models were created with loading conditions of archery and spear use to assess evidence for skeletal adaptation to habitual weapon use. Following suggestions by some Mayanists that elite status males were the principal participants in warfare, we hypothesized that the elite male humerus would exhibit lower strains than the two female humeri in all the loading conditions. This was supported by the Finite Element model results, with the exception of spear throwing. The elite female humerus showed similar trends to the elite male humerus, suggesting the possibility of elite female participation in warfare.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the present study was to investigate the functional implications of sex and species differences in the pattern of transporters along nephrons in the rat and mouse kidney, as reported by Veiras et al. (J Am Soc Nephrol 28: 3504-3517, 2017). To do so, we developed the first sex-specific computational models of epithelial water and solute transport along the nephrons from male and female mouse kidneys, and conducted simulations along with our published rat models. These models account for the sex differences in the abundance of apical and basolateral transporters, glomerular filtration rate, and tubular dimensions. Model simulations predict that 73% and 57% of filtered Na+ is reabsorbed by the proximal tubules of male and female rat kidneys, respectively. Due to their smaller transport area and lower NHE3 activity, the proximal tubules in the mouse kidney reabsorb a significantly smaller fraction of the filtered Na+, at 53% in male and only 34% in female. The lower proximal fractional Na+ reabsorption in female kidneys of both rat and mouse is due primarily to their smaller transport area, lower Na+/H+ exchanger activity, and lower claudin-2 abundance, culminating in significantly larger fractional delivery of water and Na+ to the downstream nephron segments in female kidneys. Conversely, the female distal nephron exhibits a higher abundance of key Na+ transporters, including Na+-Cl- cotransporters in both species, epithelial Na+ channels for the female rat, and Na+-K+-Cl-cotransporters for the female mouse. The higher abundance of transporters accounts for the enhanced water and Na+ transport along the female rat and mouse distal nephrons, relative to the respective male, resulting in similar urine excretion between the sexes. Model simulations indicate that the sex and species differences in renal transporter patterns may partially explain the experimental observation that, in response to a saline load, the diuretic and natriuretic responses were more rapid in female rats than males, but no significant sex difference was found in mice. These computational models can serve as a valuable tool for analyzing findings from experimental studies conducted in rats and mice, especially those involving genetic modifications.",

The Arabidopsis ERECTA receptor kinase regulates diverse developmental processes via perceiving multiple EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF)/EPF-LIKE peptide ligands. How the activated ERECTA protein is turned over is unknown. Here we identify two closely-related Plant U-box ubiquitin E3 ligases, PUB30 and PUB31, as key attenuators of ERECTA signaling for two distinct developmental processes: inflorescence/pedicel growth and stomatal development. Loss-of-function pub30 pub31 mutant plants exhibit extreme inflorescence/pedicel elongation and reduced stomatal numbers owing to excessive ERECTA protein accumulation. Ligand-activation of ERECTA leads to phosphorylation of PUB30/31 by the co-receptor BRI1 ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1), which then promotes PUB30/31 to associate with and ubiquitinate ERECTA for eventual degradation. We further show that the PUB30 and PUB31 phosphorylation by BAK1 and their ubiquitination activities are critical for the proper in vivo developmental outputs. Our work highlights PUB30 and PUB31 as integral components of the ERECTA regulatory circuit that ensures optimal signaling strengths upon ligand activation, thereby enabling proper growth and development.",

However, limited literature is available on the floral development and biology of C. verum. We assessed the seasonal flowering, floral development and pollination of type A and type B varieties of C. verum. Both macroscopic and microscopic data were collected on floral biology, pollination, male and female floral organs before and after pollination. Cinnamomum verum is morpho-anatomically, structurally, and physiologically adapted for cross-pollination, possible between the two cultivars; type A (Sri Gemunu) and type B (Sri Wijaya) flowers; naturally evolved with Protogynous Dichogamy. It possesses a dry stigma, which changes its surface characteristics after pollination. During close-pollination, a higher percentage of pollen shrink and shrivel on stigma while it develops callose plugs to obstruct the growth of the pollen tube. However, during changes in environmental conditions, female and male stages in the same tree overlap for about 45-60 min suggesting possible close-pollination within the same plant. Moreover, 4-8% of the flowers formed fruits after natural close and hand pollination. pollen was found fully hydrated even after close-pollination. Although C. verum is adapted for cross-pollination, natural close-pollination is also possible. The data suggest the complex nature of the sexual reproduction of C. verum. Well-managed breeding attempts will develop superior C. verum varieties.",

    "abstract": "An emerging idea is to couple wastewater treatment and biofuel production using microalgae to achieve higher productivities and lower costs. This paper proposes a metabolic modelling of Chlorella sp. growing on wastes in mixotrophic conditions, accounting also for the possible inhibitory substrates. A metabolic model considering several possible carbon substrates was developed and run. The addition of several organic carbon substrates such as acetate, butyrate or glucose were tested, along with glycerol, a more realistic substrate from an economical point of view. The metabolic model was built using DRUM framework and consists of 188 reactions and 176 metabolites. After a calibration phase, the model was successfully challenged with data from 122 experiments collected from scientific literature in autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. The optimal feeding strategy estimated with the model reduces the time to consume the volatile fatty acids from 16 days to 2 days. The high prediction capability of this model opens new routes for enhancing design and operation in waste valorisation using microalgae.\n\nAuthor SummaryWaste valorisation is one of the current envisaged strategies to make renewable processes more economically advantageous. For example, wastewater treatment can be used to produce biohydrogen from bacteria, through a process called dark fermentation, and to cultivate microalgae for biofuel production. Dark fermentation has, as by-products, organic acids that have inhibitory effects on the growth of microalgae, increasing the time to completely treat the waste. Advances in metabolic knowledge and techniques allow for the deployment of new strategies to improve the efficiency of bioprocesses. In this work, we validate a mathematical model of the metabolism of the microalgae genus Chlorella using the DRUM framework for 122 experiments from the scientific literature. This model enables us to apply control and optimisation techniques to provide a strategy to treat wastes coming from dark fermentation processes, overcoming the inhibition of some organic acids. The strategy is able to reduce the time to treat the waste from 16 days to only 2 days.

    "abstract": "How neurogenesis and gliogenesis are coordinated during development and why mature glial cells often share properties with neuroectodermal progenitors remains unclear. Here, we have used single cell RNA sequencing to map the regulatory landscape of neuronal and glial differentiation in the mammalian enteric nervous system (ENS). Our analysis indicates that neurogenic trajectories branch directly from a linear gliogenic axis defined by autonomic neural crest cells adopting sequential states as they progressively lose their strong neurogenic bias and acquire properties of adult enteric glia. We identify gene modules associated with transcriptional programs driving enteric neurogenesis and cell state transitions along the gliogenic axis. By comparing the chromatin accessibility profile of autonomic neural crest and adult enteric glia we provide evidence that the latter maintain an epigenetic memory of their neurogenic past. Finally, we demonstrate that adult enteric glia maintain neurogenic potential and are capable of generating enteric neurons in certain contexts by activating transcriptional programs employed by early ENS progenitors. Our studies uncover a novel configuration of enteric neurogenesis and gliogenesis that enables the coordinate development of ENS lineages and provides a mechanistic explanation for the ability of enteric glia to be functionally integrated into the adult intestine and simultaneously maintain attributes of early ENS progenitors.",

Here, we used two-photon glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging to directly measure the input kinetics across individual starburst dendrites. We found that signals measured from proximal dendrites were relatively sustained compared to those measured from distal dendrites. These differences were observed across a range of stimulus sizes and appeared to be shaped mainly by excitatory rather than inhibitory network interactions. Temporal deconvolution analysis suggests that the steady-state vesicle release rate was [~] 3 times larger at proximal sites compared to distal sites. Using a connectomics-inspired computational model, we demonstrate that input kinetics play an important role in shaping direction selectivity at low stimulus velocities. Together, these results provide direct support for the  space-time wiring model for direction selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the most common approach for acquiring diffusion and functional MRI data due to its high temporal resolution. However, this comes at the cost of higher sensitivity to susceptibility-induced B0 field inhomogeneities around air/tissue inter-faces. This leads to severe geometric distortions along the phase encoding direction (PED). To correct this distortion, the standard approach involves an analogous acquisition using an opposite PED leading to images with inverted distortions and then non-linear image registration, with a transformation model constrained along the PED, to estimate the voxelwise shift that undistorts the image pair and generates a distortion-free image. With conventional image registration approaches, this type of processing is computationally intensive. Recent advances in unsupervised deep learning-based approaches to image registration have been proposed to drastically reduce the computational cost of this task. However, they rely on maximizing an intensity-based similarity measure, known to be suboptimal surrogate measures of image alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm that directly leverages ground truth spatial transformations during training. Simulated and real data experiments demonstrate improvement to distortion field recovery compared to the unsupervised approach, improvement image similarity compared to supervised approach and precision similar to TOPUP but with much faster processing.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoiesis is a complex process that is regulated at multiple levels and through both intrinsic and extrinsic regulators. Trim28 is a multidomain protein that functions as a transcription factor and E3 ubiquitin ligase. Recent studies have established the pivotal roles of Trim28 in a variety of pathophysiologic processes including inflammation, autoimmune disorders, viral pathogenesis, cancer, tumor microenvironment and epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition. However, importance of Trim28 in early hematopoiesis, particularly in the maintenance and functions of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified Trim28 as a critical regulator of self-renewal, quiescence, and functions of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Conditional ablation of Trim28 in HSCs leads to perinatal lethality, due to pancytopenia within the hematopoietic lineage. Loss of Trim28 in HSCs affects their differentiation into myeloid-, erythroid-, and lymphoid- lineages. Trim28 deletion leads to altered frequencies and absolute numbers of HSCs, Multipotent Progenitors (MPPs) and lineage committed progenitors in the bone marrow (BM). Primary- and secondary- BM transplantation studies identified an indispensable and a cell-intrinsic role for Trim28 in HSCs. Mechanistic studies identified hyperproliferation of HSPCs and deregulated expression of cell cycle regulators in HSPCs. Strikingly, gene expression studies demonstrated that Trim28 deficiency impairs the transcriptional landscape and transcription factors signatures of HSPCs. In essence, these studies highlight a previously unknown role for Trim28 in the maintenance, functions, and multi-lineage differentiation of HSPCs.",

Here we show, in Escherichia coli, that porin permeability is controlled by changes in periplasmic ions, inhibited by periplasmic acidification, thereby limiting proton loss during electron transport chain activity, and enhanced during starvation, promoting nutrient uptake. Growth in glucose increases periplasmic potassium through activating the voltage-gated channel Kch, triggering enhanced porin permeation and membrane action potentials. This metabolic control of porin permeability explains the recognized decrease in antibiotic susceptibility when bacteria are grown in lipid media and the impact of mutations in central metabolism genes on drug resistance, identifying Kch as a therapeutic target to improve bacterial killing by antibiotics.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe permeability of bacterial porin is dynamically regulated by periplasmic pH and potassium levels, altering antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus G9241 was isolated from a welder who survived a pulmonary anthrax-like disease. Strain G9241 carries two virulence plasmids, pBCX01 and pBC210, as well as an extrachromosomal prophage, pBFH_1. pBCX01 has 99.6% sequence identity to pXO1 carried by Bacillus anthracis and encodes the tripartite anthrax toxin genes and atxA, a mammalian virulence transcriptional regulator. This work looks at how the presence of pBCX01 and temperature may affect the lifestyle of B. cereus G9241 using a transcriptomic analysis and by studying spore formation, an important part of the B. anthracis lifecycle. Here we report that pBCX01 has a stronger effect on gene transcription at the mammalian infection relevant temperature of 37{degrees}C in comparison to 25{degrees}C. At 37{degrees}C, the presence of pBCX01 appears to have a negative effect on genes involved in cell metabolism, including biosynthesis of amino acids, whilst positively affecting the transcription of many transmembrane proteins. The study of spore formation showed B. cereus G9241 sporulated rapidly in comparison to the B. cereus sensu stricto type strain ATCC 14579, particularly at 37{degrees}C. The carriage of pBCX01 did not affect this phenotype suggesting that other genetic elements were driving rapid sporulation. An unexpected finding of this study was that pBFH_1 is highly expressed at 37{degrees}C in comparison to 25{degrees}C and pBFH_1 expression leads to the production of Siphoviridae-like phage particles in the supernatant of B. cereus G9241. This study provides an insight on how the extrachromosomal genetic elements in B. cereus G9241 has an influence in bacterial phenotypes.",

Culture-independent approaches highlighted the presence in abundance of marine non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs (NCD) but their ecophysiology remains elusive, mostly because of the low number of isolated NCD and because of the lack of available genetic tools for these isolates. Here, a dual genetic and functional approach allowed unveiling the ecophysiology of a marine NCD affiliated to the species Vibrio diazotrophicus. Physiological characterization of the first marine NCD mutant obtained so far was performed using a soft-gellan assay, demonstrating that a {Delta}nifH mutant in not able to grow in nitrogen-deprived media. Furthermore, we demonstrated that V. diazotrophicus produces a thick biofilm under diazotrophic conditions, suggesting biofilm production as an adaptive response of this NCD to cope with the inhibition of nitrogen-fixation by molecular oxygen. Finally, the genomic signature of V. diazotrophicus is essentially absent from metagenomic data of Tara Ocean expeditions, despite having been isolated from various marine environments. We think that the genetically tractable V. diazotrophicus strain used in this study may serve as an ideal model to study the ecophysiology of these overlooked procaryotic group.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial biofilms are ubiquitous and play important roles in diverse environments, yet, understanding of the processes underlying development of these aggregates is just emerging. Here we report cell specialization in formation of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 biofilms - a hitherto unknown characteristic of cyanobacterial multicellularity. We show that only a quarter of the cell population expresses at high levels the four-gene ebfG-operon that is required for biofilm formation. Almost all cells, however, are assembled in the biofilm. Detailed characterization of EbfG4 encoded by this operon revealed cell-surface localization as well as its presence in the biofilm matrix. Moreover, EbfG1-3 were shown to form amyloid structures such as fibrils and are thus likely to contribute to the matrix structure. These data suggest a beneficial  division of labour during biofilm formation where only some of the cells allocate resources to produce matrix proteins -  public goods that support robust biofilm development by the majority of the cells. Additionally, previous studies revealed the operation of a self-suppression mechanism that depends on an extracellular inhibitor, which supresses transcription of the ebfG-operon. Here we revealed inhibitor activity at an early growth stage and its gradual accumulation along the exponential growth phase in correlation with cell density. Data, however, do not support a threshold-like phenomenon known for quorum-sensing in heterotrophs. Together, data presented here demonstrate cell specialization and imply density-dependent regulation thereby providing novel insights into cyanobacterial communal behaviour.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=98 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/498973v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7758f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172396aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176612org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e320c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes develop in a wide range of aquatic habitats containing highly diverse and variable bacterial communities that shape both larval and adult traits, including the capacity of adult females of some mosquito species to vector disease-causing organisms to humans. However, while most mosquito studies control for host genotype and environmental conditions, the impact of microbiota variation on phenotypic outcomes of mosquitoes is often unaccounted for. The inability to conduct reproducible intra- and inter-laboratory studies of mosquito-microbiota interactions has also greatly limited our ability to identify microbial targets for mosquito-borne disease control. Here, we developed an approach to isolate and cryopreserve microbial communities derived from mosquito larval rearing environments in the lab and field. We then validated the use of our approach to generate experimental microcosms colonized by standardized lab- and field-derived microbial communities. Our results overall reveal minimal effects of cryopreservation on the recovery of bacteria when directly compared with isolation from non-cryopreserved fresh material. Our results also reveal improved reproducibility of microbial communities in replicate microcosms generated using cryopreserved stocks over fresh material. Altogether, these results provide a critical next step toward the standardization of mosquito studies to include larval rearing environments colonized by defined microbial communities. They also lay the foundation for long-term studies of mosquito-microbe interactions and the identification and manipulation of taxa with potential to reduce mosquito vectorial capacity.",

Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes are a major class of chromosome-organizing proteins present throughout all domains of life. Here, we study the role of the Escherichia coli SMC complex MukBEF in chromosome architecture and segregation. Using quantitative live-cell imaging of shape-manipulated cells, we show that MukBEF is crucial to preserve the toroidal topology of the E. coli chromosome and that it is non-uniformly distributed along the chromosome: it prefers locations towards the origin and away from the terminus of replication, and it is unevenly distributed over the origin of replication along the two chromosome arms. Using an ATP hydrolysis-deficient MukB mutant, we find that MukBEF translocation along the chromosome is ATP-dependent, in contrast to its loading onto DNA. MukBEF and MatP are furthermore found to be essential for sister chromosome decatenation. We propose a model that explains how MukBEF, MatP, and their interacting partners organize the chromosome and contribute to sister segregation and recombination. The combination of bacterial cell-shape modification and quantitative fluorescence microscopy paves way to investigating chromosome-organization factors in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Plants of different genotypes and physiological states recruit different populations of root microbiota. The selection is driven by the immune response of the plant and the composition of root exudates. Some bacteria, including Pseudomonas spp., are promiscuous root colonizers. It is yet unclear what particular changes in lifestyle enable them to thrive in the company of different plant hosts. In this study, we used RNAseq to identify genes of the differential (host-specific) and shared (host-independent) transcriptomic responses of a biocontrol strain Pseudomonas donghuensis P482 to the root exudates of two phylogenetically distinct plant species, tomato (Dicot) and maize (Monocot), both of which can be colonized by the bacterium. The host-independent response of P482 to exudates involved upregulated expression of arsenic resistance genes and bacterioferritin synthesis. Contrary, we observed downregulation of pathways related to sulfur assimilation, sensing of ferric citrate and/or other iron carriers, the acquisition of heme, the assembly of the type VI secretion system, and amino acid transport. Pathways upregulated in P482 specifically by tomato exudates included nitric oxide detoxification, repair of iron-sulfur clusters, respiration through the cyanide-insensitive cytochrome bd, and catabolism of amino acids and/or fatty acids. The maize-specific response included upregulation of genes associated with motility, the activity of MexE and two other RND efflux pumps, and copper tolerance. To provide more context to the study, we determined the chemical composition of exudates by GC-MS, NMR, and LC-SRM. Our results bring new insight into the host-driven metabolic adaptations of promiscuous root colonizing bacteria.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding factors determining the composition and the activity of plant-associated microbiota is crucial to harnessing their potential to benefit plant health. Traits that enable microorganisms to colonize plants have long been the subject of study, with many important factors identified for particular host-microbe systems. However, studies involving more than a single plant host are rare. This results in many unanswered questions on the host-specific and universal aspects of metabolism that enable more promiscuous root colonizers to interact with different plant hosts. The presented study begins to fill this knowledge gap by providing data on the metabolic pathways involved in the differential and shared response of Pseudomonas donghuensis strain P482 to the exudates of phylogenetically distant plant species: tomato and maize.",

Here, we focus on the comparison of the two main TGS providers, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), for the purpose of DNA barcoding. For ONT, we also tested selected combinations of different types of flow cells and ligation sequencing kits. Out of five tested combinations (PacBio, ONT Flongle flow cell & SQK-LSK110 kit, R9 flow cell & SQK-LSK109 kit, R9 & SQK-LSK100 kit, and R10 flow cell & Q20+ chemistry kit), ONTs Flongle turned out to be most variable in returning the results, but at the same time the most cost efficient. The highest numbers of successfully sequenced samples were achieved with the ONTs R10 & Q20+ chemistry combination. In terms of library preparation time, ONT protocols are the quickest, whereas regarding cost effectiveness - using Sanger pricing per sample as a cut-off - various technologies become affordable depending on the number of samples used. Although both tested platforms are suitable for DNA barcoding, we further discuss their limitations and applicability to different studies, with a special focus on the price and the number of samples. The pipeline we developed, from whole specimens to final DNA barcode consensuses, can aid planning and budgeting biodiversity studies, maximising the number of specimens sequenced in one run and speeding up the sample processing time.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory liver diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that deleting the focal adhesion protein Kindlin-2 in hepatocytes using the Alb-Cre transgenic mice causes a severe inflammation, resulting in premature death. Kindlin-2 loss accelerates hepatocyte apoptosis with subsequent compensatory cell proliferation and accumulation of the collagenous extracellular matrix, leading to massive liver fibrosis and dysfunction. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 loss abnormally activates the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway. Blocking activation of the TNF signaling pathway by deleting TNF receptor or deletion of caspase 8 expression in hepatocytes essentially restores liver function and prevents premature death caused by Kindlin-2 loss.Finally, of translational significance, adeno-associated virus mediated overexpression of Kindlin-2 in hepatocytes attenuates the D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury and death in mice. Collectively, we establish that Kindlin-2 acts as a novel intrinsic inhibitor of the TNF pathway to maintain liver homeostasis and may define a useful therapeutic target for liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cells interpret a variety of signals through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and stimulate the generation of second messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). A long-standing puzzle is deciphering how GPCRs elicit different physiological responses despite generating similar levels of cAMP. We previously showed that some GPCRs generate cAMP from both the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus. Here, we demonstrate that cardiomyocytes distinguish between subcellular cAMP inputs to elicit different physiological outputs. We show that generating cAMP from the Golgi leads to regulation of a specific PKA target that increases the rate of cardiomyocyte relaxation. In contrast, cAMP generation from the plasma membrane activates a different PKA target that increases contractile force. We further validated the physiological consequences of these observations in intact zebrafish and mice. Thus, we demonstrate that the same GPCR acting through the same second messenger regulates cardiac contraction and relaxation dependent on its subcellular location.",

    "abstract": "COQ7 is a mitochondrial hydroxylase that catalyzes the penultimate step of the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ; ubiquinone). CoQ is an obligate component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and an antioxidant. CoQ deficiencies due to mutations in CoQ biosynthetic enzymes are severe genetic disorders often manifesting as mitochondrial disease syndrome. COQ7 is part of the relatively rare class of di-iron carboxylate enzymes, which carry out a wide range of reactions. In a previous study we described how COQ7 activity is inhibited in mammalian cells after treatment with iron chelating agents. Here, we report that manganese exposure of mouse cells leads to decreased COQ7 activity and resulting CoQ deficiency, which might participate in manganese toxicity. We find that the presence of cobalt can interfere with the inhibition of COQ7 by manganese. We present evidence that both manganese inhibition and cobalt interference are the result of metal exchange at the di-iron active site of COQ7. We present findings that suggest that 1) cobalt has greater affinity for the active site of COQ7 than both iron and manganese and, 2) that iron replacement by cobalt at the active site preserves catalytic activity.",

    "abstract": "Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) plays important roles in processes for the survival of the cell and whole organisms. In contrast to canonical secretory routes, UPS does not generally require secretory signal sequences and often bypasses secretory compartments such as the ER and the Golgi apparatus.\n\nGiardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite of global medical importance and reduced subcellular complexity known to release several proteins, some of them virulence factors, without canonical secretory signals, thus implicating UPS at the parasite-host interface. No dedicated machinery nor mechanism(s) for UPS in Giardia are currently known, although speculations on unique endocytic Giardia compartments called PV/PECs have been put forth.\n\nTo begin to address the question of whether PV/PECs are implicated in virulence-associated UPS and to define the composition of molecular machinery involved in release of confirmed and putative virulence factors, in this study we employed affinity purification and mass spectrometry coupled to microscopy-based subcellular localization and signal correlation quantification techniques to investigate protein complexes of eleven reported unconventionally-secreted putative and confirmed virulence factors, all predicted to be cytosolic. A subset of selected putative and confirmed virulence factors, along with their interaction partners, unequivocally associate to the surface of PV/PECs. Extended and validated interactomes point to a core PV/PECs-associated UPS machinery, which includes uncharacterized and Giardia-specific coiled-coil proteins and NEK kinases. Finally, a specific subset of the alpha-giardin protein family was invariably found enriched in all PV/PECs-associated protein interactomes, highlighting a previously unappreciated role for these proteins at PV/PECs and in UPS.\n\nTaken together, our results provide the first characterization of a virulence-associated UPS protein complex in Giardia lamblia at PVs/PECs, suggesting a novel link between these primarily endocytic and feeding organelles and UPS at the parasite-host interface.",

    "abstract": "Motile cilia are organelles lining the surfaces of major organs of the human body and generate directional fluid flow. Ciliary dysfunction has been linked to an emerging class of multisystem disorders, collectively known as motile ciliopathies. Drug screening for ciliopathies is challenging due to the unavailability of high-throughput assays that can evaluate ciliary flow generation. Here, we describe the development of a unique assay that enables the direct and rapid evaluation of mucociliary flow, which simultaneously facilitates high-throughput screening of potential therapeutic agents for motile ciliopathies. The assay relies on the ability of Xenopus tadpoles to promote mixing of a two-phase differential density aqueous mixture, through the robust flow generated by the mucociliary epithelium on their epidermis. We show that the rate of phase mixing is proportional to the rate of cilia-driven flow, therefore it directly represents the effectiveness of flow generation. We also demonstrate that the assay can detect changes in ciliary flow elicited by defects in cilia, CBF modulation and rotational polarity, providing an ideal assay for the identification of CBF-modulating compounds, as potential drugs for motile ciliopathies. Importantly we use the assay to show that CBF modulating drugs can improve flow generation and could thus be used as a potential therapeutic approach in PCD patients. The assay we have developed thus represents a powerful new tool for research, as well as drug development.",

    "abstract": "The cell cycle controls division and proliferation of all eukaryotic cells and is tightly regulated at multiple checkpoints by complexes of core cell cycle proteins. Due to the difficulty in accessing female gametes and zygotes of flowering plants, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying initiation embryogenesis despite the crucial importance of this process for seed crops. In this study, we reveal four levels of factors involved in rice zygotic cell cycle control and characterize their functions and regulation. Protein-protein interaction studies, including within zygote cells, and in vitro biochemical analyses delineate a model of the zygotic cell cycle core complex for rice. In this model, CDKB1, a major regulator of plant mitosis, is a cyclin (CYCD5)-dependent kinase; its activity is coordinately inhibited by two cell cycle inhibitors, KRP4 and KRP5; and both KRPs are regulated via F-box protein 3 (FB3)-mediated proteolysis. Supporting their critical role in controlling the rice zygotic cell cycle, mutations in KRP4, KRP5, and FB3 result in the compromised function of sperm cells and abnormal organization of female germ units, embryo and endosperm, thus significantly reducing seed-set rates. This work helps reveals regulatory mechanisms controlling the zygotic cell cycle toward seed formation in angiosperms.",

During cell division, members of the kinesin-6 family play critical roles in anaphase and cytokinesis, however little is known about their motility properties. We find that truncated versions of MKLP1 (HsKIF23), MKLP2 (HsKIF20A), and HsKIF20B predominately display non-processive behavior as single molecules although slow, processive motility was occasionally observed, most prominently for MKLP2. Despite their non-processive nature, all kinesin-6 proteins were able to work in teams to drive microtubule gliding. MKLP1 and KIF20B were also able to work in teams to drive robust transport of both peroxisomes, a low-load cargo, and Golgi, a high-load cargo, in cells. In contrast, MKLP2 showed minimal transport of peroxisomes and was unable to drive Golgi dispersion. These results indicate that while all three mammalian kinesin-6 motor proteins are generally non-processive as single motors, they differ in their ability to work in teams and generate forces needed to drive cargo transport in cells.",

The physical mechanisms that generate pulmonary epithelia of such different shapes are just beginning to be uncovered. Pulmonary smooth muscle plays stage-dependent roles in shaping the epithelium during lung development in the mouse, anole, and chicken. We hypothesized that differences in the timing and spatial patterns of smooth muscle differentiation correspond to distinct patterns of gene expression in the pulmonary mesenchyme. To test this hypothesis and investigate differences in pulmonary smooth muscle patterning across terrestrial vertebrates, we generated scRNA-seq datasets from lungs of mouse, anole, and chicken embryos. These data revealed that smooth muscle regulators are expressed in similar patterns in mouse and anole lungs, in which epithelial branches are sculpted by smooth muscle, but diverge in chicken lungs, in which the epithelium branches in the absence of smooth muscle. Pulmonary smooth muscle differentiates from the lung mesenchyme in mouse and anole. Surprisingly, however, bioinformatic and experimental evidence suggest that pulmonary smooth muscle is derived from vascular smooth muscle in chicken. Furthermore, our data revealed differences in the timing and extent of smooth muscle innervation across species. These findings highlight how terrestrial vertebrates have evolutionarily repurposed similar morphogenetic motifs to build lungs that suit their energetic needs.",

    "abstract": "Tissue flow during morphogenesis is commonly driven by local constriction of cell cortices, which is caused by activation of actomyosin contractility. This can lead to long-range flows due to tissue viscosity. However, in the absence of cell-intrinsic polarized forces or polarity in forces external to the tissue, these flows must be symmetric and centered around the region of contraction. Polarized tissue flows have been previously demonstrated to arise from the coupling of such contractile flows to points of increased friction or adhesion to external structures. However, we show with experiments and modeling that the onset of polarized tissue flow in early Drosophila morphogenesis occurs independent of adhesion and is instead driven by a geometric coupling of apical actomyosin contractility to tissue curvature. Particularly, the onset of polarized flow is driven by a mismatch between the position of apical myosin activation and the position of peak curvature at the posterior pole of the embryo. Our work demonstrates how genetic and geometric information inherited from the mother interact to create polarized flow during embryo morphogenesis.",

The mold Aspergillus flavus is a causative agent of both aspergillosis and fungal keratitis infections, but species closely related to A. flavus are not considered clinically relevant. To study the evolution of A. flavus pathogenicity, we examined genomic and phenotypic traits of two strains of A. flavus and three closely related non- pathogenic species: Aspergillus arachidicola (two strains), Aspergillus parasiticus (two strains), and Aspergillus nomiae (one strain). We identified over 3,000 orthologous proteins unique to A. flavus, including seven biosynthetic gene clusters present in A. flavus strains and absent in the three non-pathogenic species. We chose to characterize secondary metabolite production for all seven strains under two clinically relevant conditions, temperature and salt concentration. Temperature impacted metabolite production in all species. Conversely, we found a lack of impact of salinity on secondary metabolite production. Strains of the same species produced different metabolites. Growth under stress conditions revealed additional heterogeneity within species. Using the invertebrate model of fungal disease Galleria mellonella, we found virulence of strains of the same species varied widely, and A. flavus strains were not more virulent than strains of the non-pathogenic species. In a murine model of fungal keratitis, we observed significantly lower disease severity and corneal thickness for A. arachidicola compared to other species at 48 hrs, but not at 72 hrs.

    "abstract": "The activity of transposable elements (TEs) contributes significantly to genome evolution. TEs often destabilize genome integrity but may also confer adaptive variation in phenotypic traits. De-repression of epigenetically silenced TEs often initiates bursts of transposition activity that may be counteracted by purifying selection and genome defenses. However, how these forces interact to determine the expansion routes of TEs within a species remains largely unknown. Here, we analyzed a set of 19 telomere-to-telomere genomes of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Phylogenetic reconstruction and ancestral state estimates of individual TE families revealed that TEs have undergone distinct activation and repression periods resulting in highly uneven copy numbers between genomes of the same species. Most TEs are clustered in gene poor niches, indicating strong purifying selection against insertions near coding sequences. TE families with high copy numbers have low sequence divergence and strong signatures of defense mechanisms (i.e., RIP). In contrast, small non-autonomous TEs (i.e., MITEs) are less impacted by defense mechanisms and are often located in close proximity to genes. Individual TE families have experienced multiple distinct burst events that generated many nearly identical copies. We found that a Copia element burst was initiated from recent copies inserted substantially closer to genes compared to older insertions. Overall, TE bursts tended to initiate from copies in GC-rich niches that escaped inactivation by genomic defenses. Our work shows how specific genomic environments features provide triggers for TE proliferation.",

    "abstract": "PPAR{gamma} is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that regulates adipogenic and insulin sensitizing gene programs via two activation function (AF) regulatory domains: a ligand-dependent AF-2 coregulator interaction surface within the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) and an N-terminal disordered AF-1 domain (NTD or A/B region). Here, we show the AF-1 contains an evolutionary conserved Trp-Pro motif that populates two long-lived AF-1 conformations via proline cis/trans isomerization. The Trp-Pro motif participates in transient intradomain AF-1 contacts and interdomain contacts with two surfaces of the LBD ({beta}-sheet and AF-2). Mutagenesis indicates the Pro residue negatively regulates PPAR{gamma} transcriptional output, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism for AF-1 isomerization. Our findings provide a structural rationale to explain previous in vitro and cellular studies that reported interdomain functional communication between the PPAR{gamma} AF-1 and LBD. Our study also illuminates a structural biology platform to study how disordered domains in nuclear receptors influence their structure and function.",

    "abstract": "In image-based profiling, software extracts thousands of morphological features of cells from multi-channel fluorescence microscopy images, yielding single-cell profiles that can be used for basic research and drug discovery. Powerful applications have been proven, including clustering chemical and genetic perturbations based on their similar morphological impact, identifying disease phenotypes by observing differences in profiles between healthy and diseased cells, and predicting assay outcomes using machine learning, among many others. Here we provide an updated protocol for the most popular assay for image-based profiling, Cell Painting. Introduced in 2013, it uses six stains imaged in five channels and labels eight diverse components of the cell: DNA, cytoplasmic RNA, nucleoli, actin, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. The original protocol was updated in 2016 based on several years experience running it at two sites, after optimizing it by visual stain quality. Here we describe the work of the Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling (JUMP) Cell Painting Consortium, aiming to improve upon the assay via quantitative optimization, based on the measured ability of the assay to detect morphological phenotypes and group similar perturbations together. We find that the assay gives very robust outputs despite a variety of changes to the protocol and that two vendors dyes work equivalently well. We present Cell Painting version 3, in which some steps are simplified and several stain concentrations can be reduced, saving costs. Cell culture and image acquisition take 1-2 weeks for a typically sized batch of 20 or fewer plates; feature extraction and data analysis take an additional 1-2 weeks.\n\nKey references using this protocolVirtual screening for small-molecule pathway regulators by image-profile matching (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2022.08.003) - recent work examining the ability to use collected Cell Painting profiles to screen for regulators of a number of diverse biological pathways.\n\nJUMP Cell Painting dataset: images and profiles from two billion cells perturbed by 140,000 chemical and genetic perturbations (DOI) - the description of the main JUMP master public data set, using this protocol in the production of >200 TB of image data and >200 TB of measured profiles.\n\nKey data used in this protocolCell Painting, a high-content image-based assay for morphological profiling using multiplexed fluorescent dyes (https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2016.105) - this paper provides the first step-by-step Cell Painting protocol ever released.",

    "abstract": "1.1.1. IntroductionSpinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a major cause of disability, with complications post-injury often leading to life-long health issues with need of extensive treatment. Neurological outcome post-SCI can be variable and difficult to predict, particularly in incomplete injured patients. The identification of specific SCI biomarkers in blood, may be able to improve prognostics in the field. This study has utilised proteomic and bioinformatics methodologies to investigate differentially expressed proteins in plasma samples across human SCI cohorts with the aim of identifying prognostic biomarkers and biological pathway alterations that relate to neurological outcome.\n\n1.2. Methods and MaterialsBlood samples were taken, following informed consent, from ASIA impairment scale (AIS) grade C \"Improvers\" (those who experienced an AIS grade improvement) and \"Non-Improvers\" (No AIS change), and AIS grade A and D at <2 weeks (\"Acute\") and approx. 3 months (\"Sub-acute\") post-injury. The total protein concentration from each sample was extracted, with pooled samples being labelled and non-pooled samples treated with ProteoMiner beads. Samples were then analysed using two 4-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analyses and a label-free experiment for comparison, before quantifying with mass spectrometry. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD035025 and PXD035072 for the iTRAQ and label-free experiments respectively.\n\nProteomic datasets were analysed using OpenMS (version 2.6.0). R (version 4.1.4) and in particular, the R packages MSstats (version 4.0.1) and pathview (version 1.32.0) were used for downstream analysis. Proteins of interest identified from this analysis were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n1.3. ResultsThe data demonstrated proteomic differences between the cohorts, with the results from the iTRAQ approach supporting those of the label-free analysis. A total of 79 and 87 differentially abundant proteins across AIS and longitudinal groups were identified from the iTRAQ and label-free analyses, respectively. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), Peroxiredoxin 2, Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and several immunoglobulins were identified as bio-logically relevant and differentially abundant, with potential as individual prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the majority of differentially abundant proteins were components of the complement cascade and most interacted directly with the liver.\n\n1.4. ConclusionsMany of the proteins of interest identified using proteomics were detected only in a single group and therefore have potential as a binary (present or absent) biomarkers, RBP4 and PRX-2 in particular. Additional investigations into the chronology of these proteins, and their levels in other tissues (cerebrospinal fluid in particular) are needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology, including any potentially modifiable targets. Pathway analysis highlighted the complement cascade as being significant across groups of differential functional recovery.",

    "abstract": "Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeric Molecules (PROTAC) is a rapidly emerging technology for drug target protein degradation and drugging undruggable drug targets. There is a growing literature on in-silico approaches to the complex problem of PROTAC design, specifically the advantages of AI/ in-silico methods in the PROTAC Design Make Test Analyze (DMTA) cycle. Our work presented here aims to contribute to the growing literature of in-silico approaches to PROTAC design by incorporating and demonstrating incremental advancement over previously published methods. We use AI based generative methods for PRTOAC design and Molecular Dynamics to evaluate the stability of the ternary complex formed and ability of the PROTAC to hold the target protein and E3 ligase together stably. To quantify the performance of the PROTAC candidate, we also estimate computationally the PROTAC performance metrics routinely measured by the experimentalists in PROTAC assays. We use highly accurate absolute binding free energy calculations used traditionally in protein-ligand space for the PROTAC system. We calculate (Gibbs free energy change) {Delta}G for binary complex formation and ternary complex formation mediated by the PROTAC using Free Energy Perturbation - Thermodynamics Integration (FEP-TI) method which is benchmarked in literature with a root mean square error of 0.8 kcal/mol. We calculate {Delta}G for ternary and binary complexes and estimate whether {Delta}G for ternary is lower than the {Delta}G estimated for binary complexes. When the {Delta}G for ternary is lower than the binary it is inferred that ternary complexation is favoured over binary. Therefore, through these methods we can theoretical estimate {Delta}G measured by experimentalists in PROTAC assays such as Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) which capture the {Delta}G for ternary and binary complex formation mediated by the PROTAC. This method will help reduce time as well as costs of the PROTAC DMTA cycle and will accelerate early stage PROTAC drug discovery. As an illustrative application of our in-silico PROTAC design approach, we chose the target Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR-1) which is a target approved drug for colorectal cancer. We report the findings and conclude with future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Different high temperatures adversely affect crop and algal yields with various responses in photosynthetic cells. The list of genes required for thermotolerance remains elusive. Additionally, it is unclear how carbon source availability affects heat responses in plants and algae. We utilized the insertional, indexed, genome-saturating mutant library of the unicellular, eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to perform genome-wide, quantitative, pooled screens under moderate (35{degrees}C) or acute (40{degrees}C) high temperatures with or without organic carbon sources. We identified heat-sensitive mutants based on quantitative growth rates and identified putative heat tolerance genes (HTGs). By triangulating HTGs with heat-induced transcripts or proteins in wildtype cultures and MapMan functional annotations, we present a high/medium-confidence list of 933 Chlamydomonas genes with putative roles in heat tolerance. Triangulated HTGs include those with known thermotolerance roles and novel genes with little or no functional annotation. About 50% of these high-confidence HTGs in Chlamydomonas have orthologs in green lineage organisms, including crop species. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants deficient in the ortholog of a high-confidence Chlamydomonas HTG were also heat sensitive. This work expands our knowledge of heat responses in photosynthetic cells and provides engineering targets to improve thermotolerance in algae and crops.",

    "abstract": "The ability to perform sophisticated, high-throughput optogenetic experiments has been greatly enhanced by recent open-source illumination devices that allow independent programming of light patterns in single wells of microwell plates. However, there is currently a lack of instrumentation to monitor such experiments in real time, necessitating repeated transfers of the samples to stand-alone instruments and limiting the types of experiments that could be performed. Here we address this gap with the development of the optoPlateReader (oPR), an open-source, solid-state, compact device that allows automated optogenetic stimulation and spectroscopy in each well of a 96-well plate. The oPR integrates an optoPlate optical stimulation module with a module called the optoReader, an array of 96 photodiodes and LEDs that allows 96 parallel light measurements. The oPR was optimized for stimulation with blue light and for measurements of optical density and fluorescence. After calibration of all device components, we used the oPR to measure growth and to induce and measure fluorescent protein expression in E. coli. We further demonstrated how the optical read/write capabilities of the oPR permit computer-in-the-loop feedback control, where the current state of the sample can be used to adjust the optical stimulation parameters of the sample according to pre-defined feedback algorithms. The oPR will thus help realize an untapped potential for optogenetic experiments by enabling automated reading, writing, and feedback in microwell plates through open-source hardware that is accessible, customizable, and inexpensive.",

    "abstract": "Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease that in recent years has become a major international public health concern. Dengue is a tropical neglected disease with increasing global incidences, affecting millions of people worldwide, and without the availability of specific treatments to combat it. The identification of host-target genes essential for the virus life cycle, for which effective modulators may already exist, would provide an alternative path to a rapid drug development of the much needed anti-Dengue agents. For this purpose, we performed the first genome-wide RNAi screen, combining two high content readouts for DENV infection (FLUO) and host cell toxicity (NUCL), against an arrayed lentiviral based shRNA library covering 16,000 genes with a redundancy of at least 5 hairpins per gene. The screen identified 1,924 gene candidates in total; of which, 1,730 gene candidates abrogated Dengue infection, while 194 gene candidates were found to enhance its infectivity in HEK293 cells. A first pass clustering analysis of hits revealed a well orchestrated gene-network dependency on host cell homeostasis and physiology triggering distinct cellular pathways for infectivity, replication, trafficking and egress; a second analysis revealed a comprehensive gene signature of 331 genes common to hits identified in 28 published RNAi host-viral interactions screens. Taken together, our findings provide novel antiviral molecular targets with the potential for drug discovery and development.",

This requires discrimination between structurally highly similar self and nonself nucleic acids to avoid aberrant inflammatory responses as in the autoinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS). How vast amounts of self RNA are shielded from immune recognition to prevent autoinflammation is not fully understood. Here we show that SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), one of the AGS-causing genes, functions as a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) 3exonuclease, the lack of which causes cellular RNA accumulation. Increased ssRNA in cells leads to dissolution of RNA-protein condensates, which sequester immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Release of sequestered dsRNA from condensates triggers activation of antiviral type I interferon via retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors. Our results establish SAMHD1 as a key regulator of cellular RNA homeostasis and demonstrate that buffering of immunogenic self RNA by condensates regulates innate immune responses.",

Upon injury, ducts can become proliferative and contribute to tissue regeneration; however, the identity of the ductal cells that contribute to these processes is unknown. We combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting, a methylcellulose-containing 3-dimensional culture, droplet RNA-sequencing, and a clonal lineage tracing tool to identify and isolate a distinct subpopulation of pancreatic ductal cells that exhibit progenitor cell properties. These ductal cells are unique in that they form tightly-bound clusters (termed FSCmid-high), with an average of 8 cells per cluster. FSCmid-high clusters comprise only about 0.1% of the total pancreas, are tri-potent for duct, acinar and endocrine lineages, and self-renew robustly in vitro. Transcriptomic analysis of FSCmid-high clusters reveals enrichment for genes involved in cell-cell interactions, organ development, and cancer pathways. FSCmid-high clusters express embryonic pancreatic progenitor markers Sox9, Pdx1, and Nkx6-1 at both transcription and protein levels. FSCmid-high clusters are resistant to enzymatic dissociation and survive severe in vivo acinar injury, which induces formation of ductal rosettes that become proliferative within 14 days. Thus, FSCmid-high clusters represent a small subset of ductal cells with progenitor cell properties. These rare progenitor-like duct cell clusters have implications in pancreas regeneration and tumor initiation/progression.",

    "abstract": "ER tubules form and maintain membrane contact sites (MCSs) with late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/lys). The molecular composition and cellular functions of these MCSs are poorly understood. Here we find that Tex2, an SMP domain-containing lipid transfer protein conserved in metazoen and yeast, is a tubular ER protein, and enriches at ER-LE/lys MCSs dependent on TMEM55, phosphatases that convert PI(4,5)P2 to PI5P on LE/lys. We show that the Tex2-TMEM55 interaction occurs between a N-terminal region of Tex2 and a catalytic motif in PTase domain of TMEM55. The Tex2-TMEM55 interaction can be regulated by endosome-resident type 2 PI4K activities. Functionally, Tex2 knockout results in severe defects in lysosomal digestive capacity and blocked autophagic flow, as well as an aberrant accumulation of PI3P on the LE/lys membranes. These defects can be substantially rescued by wild type Tex2 other than a lipid transfer-defective Tex2 mutant, indicating an important role of lipid transfer in these processes. Together our data identify Tex2 as a tubular ER protein that resides at TMEM55-depedent ER-LE/lys MCSs required for lysosomal functions.",
