    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is an aggressive, primary brain tumor. Despite gross surgery and forceful radio- and chemotherapy, survival of GBM patients did not improve over decades. Several studies reported transcription deregulation in GBMs but regulatory mechanisms driving overexpression of GBM-specific genes remain largely unknown. Transcription in open chromatin regions is directed by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific motifs, recruit co-activators/repressors and the transcriptional machinery. Identification of GBM-related TFs-gene regulatory networks may reveal new and targetable mechanisms of gliomagenesis.\n\nResultsWe predicted TFs-regulated networks in GBMs in silico and intersected them with putative TF binding sites identified in the accessible chromatin in human glioma cells and GBM patient samples. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Glioma Atlas datasets (DNA methylation, H3K27 acetylation, transcriptomic profiles) were explored to elucidate TFs-gene regulatory networks and effects of the epigenetic background. In contrast to the majority of tumors, c-Jun expression was higher in GBMs than in normal brain and c-Jun binding sites were found in multiple genes overexpressed in GBMs such as VIM, FOSL2 or UPP1. Binding of c-Jun to the VIM gene promoter is stronger in GBM cells than in cells derived from benign glioma as evidenced by gel shift and supershift assays. Regulatory regions of a majority of the c-Jun targets have distinct DNA methylation in GBMs suggesting the contribution of DNA methylation to the c-Jun-dependent regulation.\n\nConclusionsWe identified distinct TFs-gene networks in GBMs compared to benign gliomas, a predominant role of c-Jun in controlling genes driving gliomagenesis and a modulatory role of DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplast proteome is a dynamic mosaic of plastid- and nuclear-encoded proteins. Plastid protein homeostasis is maintained through the balance between de novo synthesis and proteolysis. Intracellular communication pathways, including the plastid-to-nucleus signalling and the protein homeostasis machinery, made of stromal chaperones and proteases, shape chloroplast proteome based on developmental and physiological needs. However, the maintenance of fully functional chloroplasts is costly and under specific stress conditions the degradation of damaged chloroplasts is essential to the maintenance of a healthy population of photosynthesising organelles while promoting nutrient redistribution to sink tissues. In this work, we have addressed this complex regulatory chloroplast- quality-control pathway by modulating the expression of two nuclear genes encoding plastid ribosomal proteins PRPS1 and PRPL4. By transcriptomics, proteomics and transmission electron microscopy analyses, we show that the increased expression of PRPS1 gene leads to chloroplast degradation and early flowering, as an escape strategy from stress. On the contrary, the overaccumulation of PRPL4 protein is kept under control by increasing the amount of plastid chaperones and components of the unfolded protein response (cpUPR) regulatory mechanism. This study advances our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast retrograde communication and provides new insight into cellular responses to impaired plastid protein homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae causes a devastating disease which threatens global rice production. In spite of intense study, the biology of plant tissue invasion during blast disease remains poorly understood. Here we report a high resolution, transcriptional profiling study of the entire plant-associated development of the blast fungus. Our analysis revealed major temporal changes in fungal gene expression during plant infection. Pathogen gene expression could be classified into 10 modules of temporally co-expressed genes, providing evidence of induction of pronounced shifts in primary and secondary metabolism, cell signalling and transcriptional regulation. A set of 863 genes encoding secreted proteins are differentially expressed at specific stages of infection, and 546 were predicted to be effectors and named MEP (Magnaporthe effector protein) genes. Computational prediction of structurally-related MEPs, including the MAX effector family, revealed their temporal co-regulation in the same co-expression modules. We functionally characterised 32 MEP genes and demonstrate that Mep effectors are predominantly targeted to the cytoplasm of rice cells via the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), and use a common unconventional secretory pathway. Taken together, our study reveals major changes in gene expression associated with blast disease and identifies a diverse repertoire of effectors critical to successful infection.",

    "abstract": "Protein degradation is one of the essential mechanisms that enables reshaping of the proteome landscape in response to various stimuli. The largest E3 ubiquitin ligase family that targets proteins to degradation by catalyzing ubiquitnation is the cullin-RING ligases (CRL). Many of the proteins that are regulated by CRLs are central to tumorigenesis and tumour progression, and dysregulation of the CRL family is frequently associated with cancer. The CRL family comprises [~]300 complexes all of which are regulated by the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN). Therefore, the CSN is considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Research efforts for targeted CSN inhibition have been directed towards inhibition of the complex enzymatic subunit, CSN5. Here, we have taken a fresh approach focusing on CSNAP, the smallest CSN subunit. Our results show that the C-terminal region of CSNAP is tightly packed within the CSN complex, in a groove formed by CSN3 and CSN8. We show that a 16 amino acid C-terminal peptide, derived from this CSN interacting region, can displace the endogenous CSNAP subunit from the complex. This, in turn, leads to a CSNAP null phenotype that attenuates CSN activity and consequently CRLs function. Overall, our findings emphasize the potential of a CSNAP-based peptide for CSN inhibition as a new therapeutic avenue.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolism can best be described as a highly interconnected network of biochemical reactions and metabolites. The flow of metabolites, i.e., flux, throughout these networks can be predicted and analyzed using approaches such as flux balance analysis (FBA). By knowing the network topology and employing only a few simple assumptions, FBA can efficiently predict metabolic functions at the genome scale as well as microbial phenotypes. The network topology is represented in the form of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), which provide a direct mapping between network structure and function via the enzyme-coding genes and corresponding metabolic capacity. Recently, the role of protein limitations in shaping metabolic phenotypes have been extensively studied following the reconstruction of enzyme-constrained GEMs. This framework has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of predicting microbial phenotypes, and it has demonstrated that a global limitation in protein availability can prompt the ubiquitous metabolic strategy of overflow metabolism. Being one of the most abundant and differentially expressed proteome sectors, metabolic proteins constitute a major cellular demand on proteinogenic amino acids. However, little is known about the impact and sensitivity of amino acid availability with regards to genome-scale metabolism. Here, we explore these aspects by extending on the enzyme-constrained GEM framework by also accounting for the usage of amino acids in expressing the metabolic proteome. Including amino acids in an enzyme-constrained GEM of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that the expanded model is capable of accurately reproducing experimental amino acid levels. We further show that the metabolic proteome exerts variable demands on amino acid supplies in a condition-dependent manner, suggesting that S. cerevisiae must have evolved to efficiently fine-tune the synthesis of amino acids for expressing its metabolic proteins in response to changes in the external environment. Finally, our results demonstrate how the metabolic network of S. cerevisiae is robust towards perturbations of individual amino acids, while simultaneously being highly sensitive when the relative amino acid availability is set to mimic a priori distributions of both yeast and non-yeast origins.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to potyviruses in plants have been largely provided by the selection of natural variant alleles of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF) 4E in many crops. However, the sources of such variability for breeding can be limited for certain crop species, while new virus strains continue to emerge. Different methods of mutagenesis have been applied to inactivate the eIF4E genes to generate virus resistance, but with limited success due to the physiological importance of translation factors and their redundancy. Here, we employed genome editing approaches at the base level to induce non-synonymous mutations in the eIF4E1 gene and create genetic diversity in cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme). We sequentially edited the genomic sequences coding for two regions of eIF4E1 protein, located around the cap-binding pocket and known to be important for susceptibility to potyviruses. We show that the editing of only one of the two regions, by gene knock-in and base-editing, respectively, is not sufficient to provide resistance. However, combining amino acid mutations in both regions resulted in resistance to multiple potyviruses without affecting its functionality in translation initiation. Meanwhile, we report that extensive base editing in exonic region can alter RNA splicing pattern, resulting in gene knockout. Altogether our work demonstrates that precision editing allows to design plant factors based on the knowledge on evolutionarily selected alleles and enlarge the gene pool to potentially provide advantageous phenotypes such as pathogen resistance.",

    "abstract": "Rice is an ideal crop with huge germplasm diversity and post-genomic resources for improvement of nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE). There is a paucity of comparative studies on rice genotypes contrasting for NUE, especially with urea, the predominant fertilizer in rice growing countries. In this study, low urea-responsive transcriptomes of contrasting rice genotypes namely Nidhi (low NUE) and Panvel1 (high NUE) were compared. They were based on whole plants grown for 21 days in pots containing nutrient-depleted soil fertilized with normal (15 mM) and low urea (1.5 mM) media. There were 1497 and 2819 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Nidhi and Panvel1, respectively, of which 271 were common. Though 1226 DEGs were genotype-specific in Nidhi and 2548 in Panvel1, there was far higher commonality in underlying processes. High NUE is associated with the urea-responsive regulation of other nutrient transporters, miRNAs, transcription factors and better photosynthesis, water use efficiency and post translational modifications. Many of their genes co-localized to NUE QTLs on chromosomes 1, 3 and 9. Field evaluation of the contrasting genotypes under different doses of urea revealed better performance of Panvel1 in different agronomic parameters including grain yield, transport/uptake efficiencies and NUE. Comparison of our urea-based transcriptomes with our previous nitrate-based transcriptomes from the same contrasting rice genotypes revealed many common processes despite large differences in their expression profiles. Our model proposes that differential involvement of transporters and transcription factors among others contributes to better urea uptake, translocation, utilization, flower development and yield for high NUE.\n\nSummaryRice genotypes with contrasting urea use efficiency differ in the role of transporters, transcription factors, miRNAs, post-translational modifications, photosynthesis and water use efficiency",

However, until recently, no single tag could offer this complete set of functionalities on its own. Here, we present a plasmid-based toolkit named ALIBY (ALFA Toolkit for Imaging and Biochemistry in Yeast) that provides a universal workflow to adopt the versatile ALFA tag/NbALFA system within the well-established model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The kit comprises of tagging plasmids for labelling a protein-of-interest with the ALFA tag, and detection plasmids encoding a fluorescent protein-tagged NbALFA for live-cell imaging purposes. We demonstrate the suitability of ALIBY for visualizing the spatiotemporal localization of yeast proteins (i.e., cytoskeleton, nucleus, centrosome, divisome and exocyst) in live cells. Our approach has yielded an excellent signal-to-noise ratio without off-targeting or effect on cell growth. In summary, our yeast-specific toolkit aims to simplify and further advance the live-cell imaging of differentially abundant yeast proteins while also being suitable for biochemical applications.\n\nImportanceIn yeast research, conventional fluorescent protein tags and small epitope tags are widely used to study the spatiotemporal dynamics and activity of proteins. Though proven to be efficient, these tags lack the versatility for usage across different cell biological and biochemical studies of a given protein-of-interest. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a unified platform for visualization, biochemical, and functional analyses of proteins-of-interest in yeast. Herein, we have engineered ALIBY, a plasmid-based toolkit which expands the benefits of the recently developed ALFA tag/NbALFA system to studies in the well-established model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that ALIBY provides a simple and versatile strain construction workflow for long duration live-cell imaging and biochemical applications in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Reproducibility is science has plagued efforts to understand biology at both basic and biomedical and preclinical research levels. Poor experimental design and execution can result in datasets that are improperly powered to produce rigorous and reproducible results. In order to help biologists better model their data, here we present a statistical package called RMeDPower in R, which is a complete package of statistical tools that allow a scientist to understand the effect size and variance contribution of a set of variables one has within a dataset to a given response. RMeDPower can estimate the effect size of variables within an experiment based on an initial pilot dataset. In this way, RMeDPower can inform the user how to predict the scope, dimension and size of biological data needed for a particular experimental design. RMeDPower employs a generalized linear mixed model (LMM) -based power analysis, specifically targeting cell culture-based biological experimental designs. This package simulates experiments based on user-provided experimental design related variables, such as experiments, plates, and cell lines as random effects variables. This package not only allows us to use pilot data to estimate variance components for power simulation, it also accepts a set of variance components, which is an estimation of variance of the random effects linked to experimental variables and transformed into Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICC), as input which is precalculated from different data sets. The latter case is suitable when pilot data has an insufficient number of replications of experimental variables to directly estimate associated variance components. RMeDPower is a powerful package that any scientist or cell biologist can use to determine if a dataset is adequately powered for each experiment and then model accordingly.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus infects the lungs of immunocompromised hosts, including patients undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation. More recently however, immunocompetent patients with severe SARS-CoV2 have been reported to be affected by COVID-19 Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA), in the absence of the conventional risk factors for invasive aspergillosis. This paper explores the hypothesis that contributing causes are the destruction of the lung epithelium permitting colonization by opportunistic pathogens. At the same time, the exhaustion of the immune system, characterized by cytokine storms, apoptosis, and depletion of leukocytes may hinder the response to A. fumigatus infection. The combination of these factors may explain the onset of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompetent patients.\n\nMethodsWe used a previously published computational model of the innate immune response to infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. Variation of model parameters was used to create a virtual patient population. A simulation study of this virtual patient population to test potential causes for co-infection in immunocompetent patients.\n\nResultsThe two most important factors determining the likelihood of CAPA were the inherent virulence of the fungus and the effectiveness of the neutrophil population, as measured by granule half-life and ability to kill fungal cells. Varying these parameters across the virtual patient population generated a realistic distribution of CAPA phenotypes observed in the literature.\n\nConclusionsComputational models are an effective tool for hypothesis generation. Varying model parameters can be used to create a virtual patient population for identifying candidate mechanisms for phenomena observed in actual patient populations.",

However, its impact on specific neuronal subtypes is unclear. Using reversible unilateral naris closure in concert with longitudinal in vivo imaging we show here that newborn GABAergic interneurons undergo significant cell death under sensory deprivation. In contrast, dopaminergic OB neurons survive under deprivation, but react with a reversible downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression.\n\nlong abstractNeurogenesis persists in the mammalian subventricular zone after birth, producing various populations of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. These include GABAergic and mixed dopaminergic/GABAergic double neurotransmitter neurons for the glomerular layer. While olfactory sensory activity is one of the main factors controlling newborn neuron integration, its effect on specific neuronal subtypes is far less clear. Here we use a reversible unilateral deprivation paradigm in combination with longitudinal in vivo imaging to characterize the behavior of newborn glomerular neurons. We find that a substantial fraction of purely GABAergic neurons die after four weeks of sensory deprivation. Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive dopaminergic/ GABAergic neurons show no signifficant cell death under deprivation, but react with an important decrease in TH expression levels. Importantly, this effect reverses after naris reopening, pointing to a specific adaptation of this neuron population to the level of sensory activity. We conclude that sensory deprivation induces adjustments in the excitation/inhibition balance of the OB implicating cell death and adaptation of neurotransmitter use in specific neuron types.",

    "abstract": "As the immune protection conferred by first booster shot wanes over time and new Omicron subvariant emerges with stronger immune evasion, the need for variant-adapted COVID vaccine booster is increasingly imminent. However, the rapid replacement of dominant Omicron subvariants (from BA.1 to BA.2, then BA.2.12.1 and now BA.4/5) poses a great challenge to update COVID vaccine targeting the fast-evolving variants while maintaining potency against existing variants. It is a crucial question to ask which variant-based antigen(s) to use in the next generation COVID vaccine to elicit potent and broad response to past, present, and potential rising variants. Bivalent vaccine candidates have been under active clinical testing such as Modern mRNA-1273.214. In this study, we generate a Delta + BA.2 bivalent mRNA vaccine candidate and tested in animals. We compare the antibody response elicited by ancestral (wild type, WT), Delta, BA.2 spike based monovalent or Delta & BA.2 bivalent mRNA boosters against Omicron BA.2, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 subvariants. In mice pre-immunized with two doses of WT lipid nanoparticle mRNA (LNP-mRNA), all three monovalent and one bivalent boosters elevated Omicron neutralizing antibody titers to various degree. The boosting effect of Delta and BA.2 specific monovalent or bivalent LNP-mRNAs is universally higher than that of WT LNP-mRNA, which modestly increased antibody titer in neutralization assays of Omicron BA.5, BA.2.12.1 and BA.2. The Delta & BA.2 bivalent LNP-mRNA showed better performance of titer boosting than either monovalent counterparts, which is especially evident in neutralization of Omicron BA.4 or BA.5. Interestingly compared to the neutralizing titers of BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 pseudovirus, BA.2 monovalent but not Delta & BA.2 bivalent booster suffered a significant loss of BA.4/5 neutralizing titer, indicative of broader activity of bivalent booster and strong neutralization evasion of Omicron BA.4 or BA.5 even in the BA.2 mRNA vaccinated individuals. These data provide evaluation of WT, Delta, BA.2 monovalent and bivalent boosters antibody potency against Omicron BA.2, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 subvariants.",

Heterologous boosting of rVSV-Wuhan with rVSV-Delta induced strong nAb responses against Delta and Omicron viruses, with rVSV-Trivalent vaccine consistently effective in inducing nAbs against all the SARS-CoV-2 variants tested. All vaccines, including rVSV-Beta, elicited a spike-specific immunodominant CD8+ T cell response.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, a positive single-stranded RNA virus, interacts with host cell proteins throughout its life cycle. These interactions are necessary for the host to recognize and hinder the replication of SARS-CoV-2. For the virus, to translate, transcribe and replicate its genetic material. However, many details of these interactions are still missing. We focused on the proteins binding to the highly structured 5 and 3 end regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that were predicted by the catRAPID algorithm to attract numerous proteins, exploiting RNA-Protein Interaction Detection coupled with Mass Spectrometry (RaPID-MS) technology. The validated interactors, which agreed with our predictions, include pseudouridine synthase PUS7 that binds to both ends of the viral RNA. Nanopore direct-RNA sequencing confirmed that the RNA virus is heavily modified, and PUS7 consensus regions were found in both SARS-CoV-2 RNA end regions. Notably, a modified site was detected in the viral Transcription Regulatory Sequence - Leader (TRS-L) and can influence the viral RNA structure and interaction propensity. Overall, our data map host protein interactions within SARS-CoV-2 UTR regions, pinpointing to a potential role of pseudouridine synthases and post-transcriptional modifications in the viral life cycle. These findings contribute to understanding virus-host dynamics and may guide the development of targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "In the light of global climate change and biodiversity loss, understanding the role of functional diversity in the response of food webs to environmental change is growing ever more important. Using a tritrophic food web model, with a variable degree of functional diversity at each trophic level, we studied the role of functional diversity on the resistance of a system against press perturbations affecting either nutrient availability or the mortality of the species, which can be interpreted as effects of eutrophication and warming respectively. We compared food webs with different levels of functional diversity by investigating the species trait and biomass dynamics, the overall changes in the species standing biomass as measured by the warping distance, and the duration of the system transients after the onset of a perturbation (transition time). We found that higher functional diversity increased resistance since it buffered trophic cascading effects and delayed the onset of oscillatory behaviour caused by either bottom-up forcing via perturbations to nutrient concentration or top-down forcing via perturbations to mortality rate. This increased resistance emerged from a higher top-down control of the intermediate species on the basal species. Functional diversity also promoted a higher top biomass, in particular via a higher proportion of top selective species undergoing high mortality rates. Additionally, functional diversity had context-dependent effects on warping distances, and increased transition times. Overall, this study encourages accounting for functional diversity in future investigations about the response of multitrophic systems to global change and in management strategies.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWith the advent of high throughput sequencing, the amount of genomic data available for animals (Metazoa) species has bloomed over the last decade, especially from transcriptomes due to lower sequencing costs and easier assembling process compared to genomes. Transcriptomic data sets have proven useful for phylogenomic studies, such as inference of phylogenetic interrelationships (e.g., species tree reconstruction) and comparative genomics analyses (e.g., gene repertoire evolutionary dynamics). However, these data sets are often analyzed following different analytical pipelines, particularly including different software versions, leading to potential methodological biases when analyzed jointly in a comparative framework. Moreover, these analyses are computationally expensive and not affordable for a large part of the scientific community. More importantly, assembled transcriptomes are usually not deposited in public databases. Furthermore, the quality of these data sets is hardly ever taken into consideration, potentially impacting subsequent analyses such as orthology and phylogenetic or gene repertoire evolution inference. To alleviate these issues, we present Metazoan Assemblies from Transcriptomic Ensembles (MATEdb), a curated database of 335 high-quality transcriptome assemblies from different animal phyla analyzed following the same pipeline. The repository is composed, for each species, of (1) a de novo transcriptome assembly, (2) its candidate coding regions within transcripts (both at the level of nucleotide and amino acid sequences), (3) the coding regions filtered using their contamination profile (i.e., only metazoan content), (4) the longest isoform of the amino acid candidate coding regions, (5) the gene content completeness score as assessed against the BUSCO database, and (6) an orthology-based gene annotation. We complement the repository with gene annotations from high-quality genomes, which are often not straightforward to obtain from individual sequencing projects, totalling 423 high-quality genomic and transcriptomic data sets. We invite the community to provide suggestions for new data sets and new annotation features to be included in subsequent versions, that will be analyzed following the same pipeline and be permanently stored in public repositories. We believe that MATEdb will accelerate research on animal phylogenomics while saving thousands of hours of computational work in a plea for open and collaborative science.",

    "abstract": "Fasting increases lifespan in invertebrates, improves biomarkers of health in vertebrates, and is increasingly proposed as a promising route to improve human health. Nevertheless, little is known about how fasted animals use resources upon refeeding, and how such decisions affect putative trade-offs between somatic growth and repair, reproduction, and gamete quality. Such fasting-induced trade-offs are based on strong theoretical foundations and have been recently discovered in invertebrates, but the data on vertebrates is lacking. Here we report that fasted female zebrafish, Danio rerio, increase investment in soma upon refeeding but it comes at a cost of egg quality.\n\nSpecifically, an increase in fin re-growth was accompanied by a reduction in 24-hours post-fertilization offspring survival. Refed males showed a reduction in sperm velocity and impaired 24-hour post-fertilisation offspring survival. These findings underscore the necessity of considering the impact on eggs and sperm when assessing evolutionary and biomedical implications of lifespan-extending treatments in females and males and call for careful evaluation of the effects of fasting (both during and post) on fertilisation.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors are typically deployed as individual, passive, surface-functionalized electrodes, but they exhibit limited sensitivity especially when the area of the electrode is reduced for miniaturization purposes. We demonstrated that organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), electrolyte gated tran-istors with volumetric gating, can serve as on-site amplifiers to improve the sensitivity of single electrode-based E-AB sensors. By monolithically integrating an Au working/sensing electrode, on-chip Ag/AgCl reference electrode and Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) counter electrode -- also serving as the OECT channel, we can simultaneously perform OECT testing and traditional electroanalytical measurement on E-AB sensors including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV). This device can directly amplify the current from the E-AB sensor via the in-plane current modulation in the counter electrode/transistor channel. The integrated OECT-based E-AB sensor is able to sense transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-{beta}1) with 3 to 4 orders of magnitude enhancement of sensitivity compared to that in a single electrode-based E-AB sensor (292 {micro}A/dec vs. 85 nA/dec for OECT vs. single electrode SWV). This approach is believed to be universal, which can be applied to a wide range of tethered electrochemical reporter-based sensors to enhance sensitivity, aiding in sensor miniaturization and easing the burden on backend signal processing.",

However, current 3D tissues are limited in size and thickness due to the lack of an effective vascularization method.

Spheroids were created from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and cardiac fibroblasts (FB) using special dimple plates for mass production. One centimeter cubic tissues were created from spheroids using a DLP 3D printed mold with vascular channels. The tissue was maintained in a perfusion chamber under regulated flow and pressure following differentiation to cardiac tissue and endothelialization. Mass production of large spheroids (35,000 / tissue, diameter of 395.99 um +/- 101.15 um) was achieved from 170 million iPSCs and 50 million FBs for the creation of 1cm3 cardiac tissue in a 3D printed mold with vascular channels. The cardiac tissues (n=5) were perfused for 20 days under stable pressure of 17.5 +/- 3.05 PSI and flow of 5000 uL/min +/- 1116.42 uL/min. On days 10 and 20, Alamar blue assays showed viability for all five tissues (Alamar blue intensity: Day 10 1.57 +/- 0.15. Day 20 2.21 +/- 0.19).

    "abstract": "Satellites are mobile genetic elements that rely on helper phages for their mobilization. The many known satellite-helper interactions are trans-regulatory, with gene products from one partner modulating the nucleic acid or protein activities of the other. We discovered a satellite type with a more intimate cis-regulatory configuration: integrated within, and co-oriented with, a late gene of its lambdoid helper prophage. This helper-embedded satellite (HES) configuration would delay expression of the interrupted helper late gene until the satellite excises; it also offers potential passive components to both HES replication and late transcription, driven by the helper. Induction of a helper-satellite composite was monitored; precise excision of the entire composite was observed, followed by its replication, and the excision of the satellite from it. We mapped 491 HESs to one of 14 sites in cognates of phage lambda late genes A, B, C, E, V, T, H, L and J. The associated integrases form a single phylogenetic clade with subclades respecting the 14 site groups, while the attP attachment site regions contained a new doubled DNA sequence motif. This clade thus exhibits a repeated tropism for prophage late genes as it develops new integration sites. HESs bear close genomic similarities to gram-negative phage-induced chromosomal islands (PICIs, of which we found many more integrated into fis and hpt genes). We describe four ordered zones in a general HES/PICI genome organization: an integration zone encoding integrase and AlpA, a Bro zone encoding members of the Bro-N network of domain-swapping DNA-interactive proteins and immunity repressor RNAs, a replication zone, and a late zone in which clusters as large as 18 consecutive helper late genes have been captured. Like the late zone, the Bro zone is dynamic, perhaps due to activity of the Bro proteins themselves.",

    "abstract": "The high mutation rates of RNA viruses, coupled with short generation times and large population sizes, allow viruses to evolve rapidly and adapt to the host environment. The rapidity of viral mutation also causes problems in developing successful vaccines and antiviral drugs. With the spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, thousands of mutations have been identified, some of which have relatively high incidences, but their potential impacts on virus characteristics remain unknown. The present study analyzed mutation patterns, SARS-CoV-2 AASs retrieved from the GISAID database containing 10,500,000 samples. Python 3.8.0 programming language was utilized to pre-process FASTA data, align to the reference sequence, and analyze the sequences. Upon completion, all mutations discovered were categorized based on geographical regions and dates. The most stable mutations were found in nsp1(8% S135R), nsp12(99.3% P323L), nsp16 (1.2% R216C), envelope (30.6% T9I), spike (97.6% D614G), and Orf8 (3.5% S24L), and were identified in the United States on April 3, 2020, and England, Gibraltar, and, New Zealand, on January 1, 2020, respectively. The study of mutations is the key to improving understanding of the function of the SARS-CoV-2, and recent information on mutations helps provide strategic planning for the prevention and treatment of this disease. Viral mutation studies could improve the development of vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic assays designed with high accuracy, specifically useful during pandemics. This knowledge helps to be one step ahead of new emergence variants.\n\nIMPORTANCEMore than two years into the global COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of attention is shifted to the emergence and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that cause the evolutionary trend.\n\nHere, we analyzed and compared about 10.5 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to extract the stable mutations, frequencies and the substitute amino acid that changed with the wild-type one in the evolutionary trend.\n\nAlso, developing and designing accurate vaccines could prepare long-term immunization against different local variants. In addition, according to the false negative results of the COVID-19 PCR test report in the diagnosis of new strains, investigating local mutation patterns could help to design local primer and vaccine.",

In general females show less sway than males, but this difference only begins to appear around puberty, pointing to different levels of sex hormones as one potential mechanism for sway sex differences. In this study, we followed one group of young females using oral contraceptives (n = 32) and one group not using oral contraceptives (n = 19), to investigate associations between estrogen availability and postural sway, both over the course of the menstrual cycle (in the group not using oral contraceptives) and long-term (between the two groups). All participants visited the lab four times over the putative 28-day menstrual cycle. At each visit, we performed blood draws to measure plasma estrogen (estradiol) levels, and tests of postural sway using a force plate. Due to the hormone-stabilizing effects of oral contraceptives, estradiol levels were higher in participants not using oral contraceptives (690.45 pmol/L versus 464.50 pmol/L), reflecting higher estradiol concentrations during the late follicular and luteal phase. Postural sway was similar on average for participants not using oral contraceptives (21.47 cm versus 23.56 cm). Overall, we found no significant effects of the estimated menstrual cycle phase - or absolute levels of estradiol - on postural sway.",

    "abstract": "Ethiopias livestock sector supports the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers. However, despite the improvements of recent years, livestock productivity remains low due to critical constraints, including infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to collate and synthesise the published evidence on ruminant disease frequency and disease-associated mortality in Ethiopia, by identifying knowledge gaps and clusters in the literature to provide the basis for a decision-making tool. Searches on both bibliographic and organisation databases were conducted in English and were restricted to the period 2010-2019. Search results were screened for relevance at title, abstract and full text level, which identified 716 articles relevant to the research question. The systematic map revealed an increased publication output from 2012-2017, compared to 2010-2011 and 2018-2019. Most studies were conducted in Oromia, Amhara and SNNPR. A substantial body of evidence was found for trypanosomosis, ectoparasite infestation, fasciolosis, nematodiasis, echinococcosis, brucellosis and bovine brucellosis. This study suggests that despite the high output of epidemiological publications, further understanding of a considerable number of diseases is required and where evidence is abundant, synthesis of information should be carried out in order to better inform decisions on disease control priorities in the livestock sector.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to play key roles in learning by conveying the difference between expected and actual outcomes. While this teaching signal is often considered to be uniform, recent evidence instead supports diversity in dopamine signaling. However, it remains poorly understood how heterogeneous signals might be organized to facilitate the role of downstream circuits mediating distinct aspects of behavior. Here we investigated the organizational logic of dopaminergic signaling by recording and labeling individual midbrain dopamine neurons during associative behavior. We defined combinations of protein expression and cellular localization to sort recorded neurons according to the striatal regions they innervate. Our findings show that reward information and task variables are not only heterogeneously encoded, with multiplexing, but also differentially distributed across populations of dopamine neurons projecting to different regions of striatum. These data, supported by computational modelling, indicate that such distributional coding can maximize dynamic range and tailor dopamine signals to facilitate the specialized roles of different striatal regions.",

Aiming toward hardware implementation in bio-inspired Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems for mobile robotics, we base our model on logic operations that reduce its computational complexity. The model compensates for parameter variations in the behaviors of the population of constituent Theta cells, and allows the Theta cells to have square-wave oscillation profiles. The robustness of the model, with respect to mismatch in the Theta cells base oscillation frequency and gain--as a function of modulatory inputs--is demonstrated. Place cell composed of 48 Theta cells with base frequency variations with a 25% standard deviation from the mean and a gain error with 20% standard deviation from the mean only result in a 20% deformations within the place field and 0.24% outer side lobes, and an overall pattern with 0.0015 mean squared error on average. We also present how the model can be used to achieve the localization and path-tracking functionalities of SLAM.",

    "abstract": "Could non-pharmacological constructs, such as beliefs, impact brain activities in a dose-dependent manner as drugs do? While beliefs shape many aspects of our behavior and wellbeing, the precise mapping between subjective beliefs and neural substrates remains elusive. Here, nicotine-addicted humans were instructed to think that an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) contained either \"low\", \"medium\", or \"high\" levels of nicotine, while nicotine content was kept constant. After vaping the e-cigarette, participants performed a decision-making task known to engage neural circuits affected by nicotine while being scanned by fMRI. Activity in the thalamus, a key binding site for nicotine, increased parametrically according to belief dosage. Furthermore, the functional coupling between thalamus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in value and state representations, also scaled to belief dosage. These findings illustrate a dose-dependent relationship between a thalamic circuit and nicotine-related beliefs in humans, a mechanism previously known to only apply to pharmacological agents.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol, the main non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, has potential as a treatment for anxiety-related disorders since it reduces learned fear expression and enhances fear extinction. The return of fear over time after successful extinction and stress-induced extinction resistance are potential barriers to the treatment of these disorders with extinction-based psychological therapy. In two experiments using rats subjected to auditory fear conditioning, we determined the effects of systemic cannabidiol treatment on (1) delayed extinction and later spontaneous fear recovery, and (2) extinction resistance caused by immediate extinction (the immediate extinction deficit (IED)). In Experiment 1, cannabidiol was given before delayed extinction occurring 24 hr after conditioning, with extinction recall and spontaneous fear recovery tested drug-free 1 and 21 days after extinction, respectively. We found that cannabidiol had no effect on extinction recall but it prevented spontaneous fear recovery. In Experiment 2, the IED procedure was first validated, with immediate extinction occurring 30 min after conditioning. We confirmed that immediate extinction impaired extinction recall, compared to delayed extinction. Next, cannabidiol was given before immediate or no extinction, with extinction recall tested drug-free the next day. We found that cannabidiol rescued the IED, which did not involve effects on fear memory consolidation. In summary, cannabidiol prevented spontaneous fear recovery after delayed extinction and ameliorated extinction resistance caused by immediate extinction. Although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, our results add to evidence indicating that cannabidiol might prove useful as an adjunct for potentiating the psychological treatment of anxiety-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian brain, rapid conduction of neural information is supported by the myelin, whose functional efficacy shows steep dependence on its nanoscale cytoarchitecture. Although previous in vitro studies suggested that neural activity accompanies nanometer-scale cellular deformations, it has remained unexplored whether neural activity can dynamically remodel the myelinated axon due to the technical challenge in observing its nanostructural dynamics in living tissues. To this end, we introduced a novel all-optical approach combining a nanoscale dynamic readout based on spectral interferometry and optogenetic control of neural excitation on a living brain slice preparation. In response to optogenetically evoked neuronal burst firing, the myelinated axons exhibited progressive and reversible spectral redshifts, corresponding to the transient swelling at a subnanometer scale. We further revealed that the activity-dependent nanostructural dynamics was localized to the paranode. In summary, our novel all-optical studies substantiate that myelinated axon exhibits activity-dependent nanoscale swelling, which potentially serves to dynamically tune the transmission speed of neural information.\n\nRESEARCH SUMMARIESAs neural activity involves rapid ion flux across the cell membrane, researchers have long been tried to detect the accompanying nanoscale morphological dynamics. However, measuring the activity-dependent nanostructural dynamics in the living mammalian brain has been an enigma due to the technical limitations. By combining excitatory optogenetics and in situ nanoscale metrology based on spectral interference, we demonstrate the first direct observation that the mammalian axons exhibit transient activity-dependent swelling at subnanometer-scale.",

    "abstract": "Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant, BA.2.75, displayed a local growth advantage over BA.2.38, BA.2.76 and BA.5 in India. The underlying mechanism of BA.2.75s enhanced infectivity, especially compared to BA.5, remains unclear. Here, we show that BA.2.75 exhibits substantially higher ACE2-binding affinity than BA.5. Also, BA.2.75 spike shows decreased thermostability and increased \"up\" RBD conformation in acidic conditions, suggesting enhanced low-pH-endosomal cell-entry pathway utilization. BA.2.75 is less humoral immune evasive than BA.4/BA.5 in BA.1/BA.2 breakthrough-infection convalescents; however, BA.2.75 shows heavier neutralization evasion in Delta breakthrough-infection convalescents. Importantly, plasma from BA.5 breakthrough infection exhibit significantly weaker neutralization against BA.2.75 than BA.5, mainly due to BA.2.75s distinct RBD and NTD-targeting antibody escaping pattern from BA.4/BA.5. Additionally, Evusheld and Bebtelovimab remain effective against BA.2.75, and Sotrovimab recovered RBD-binding affinity. Together, our results suggest BA.2.75 may prevail after the global BA.4/BA.5 wave, and its increased receptor-binding capability could allow further incorporation of immune-evasive mutations.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAmphibians are among the most threatened taxa as they are highly sensitive to habitat degradation and fragmentation. They are considered as model species to evaluate habitats quality in agricultural landscapes. In France, all amphibian species have a protected status requiring recovery plans for their conservation. Conservation networks combining protected areas and green infrastructure can help the maintenance of their habitats while favouring their movement in fragmented landscapes such as farmlands. Yet, assessing the effectiveness of conservation networks is challenging.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we compared the ecological requirements of amphibian species with existing conservation network coverage in a human-dominated region of western France. First, we mapped suitable habitat distributions for nine species of amphibian with varying ecological requirements and mobility. Second, we used stacking species distribution modelling (SSDM) to produce multi-species habitat suitability maps. Then, to identify spatial continuity in suitable habitats at the regional scale, we defined species and multi-species core habitats to perform a connectivity analysis using Circuitscape theory. Finally, we compared different suitability maps with existing conservation networks to assess conservation coverage and efficiency.\nC_LIO_LIWe highlighted a mismatch between the most suitable amphibian habitats at the regional scale and the conservation network, both for common species and for species of high conservation concern. We also found two bottlenecks between areas of suitable habitat which might be crucial for population movements induced by global change, especially for species associated with hedgerow mosaic landscapes. These bottlenecks were not covered by any form of protection and are located in an intensive farmland context.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications - We advocate the need to better integrate agricultural landscape mosaics into species conservation planning as well as to protect and promote agroecological practices suitable for biodiversity, including mixed and extensive livestock farming.

Clock misalignment can lead to various pathologies including obesity and diabetes, both of which are associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - a devastating cancer with an 80% five-year mortality rate. Although circadian desynchrony is associated with an increased risk of several solid-organ cancers, the correlation between clock misalignment and pancreas cancer is unclear. Using a chronic jetlag model, we investigated the impact of clock misalignment on pancreas cancer initiation in mice harboring a pancreas-specific activated Kras mutation. We found that chronic jetlag accelerated the development of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions, with a concomitant increase in precursor lesion grade. Cell-autonomous knock-out of the clock in pancreatic epithelial cells of Kras-mutant mice demonstrated no acceleration of precursor lesion formation, indicating non-cell-autonomous clock dysfunction was responsible for the expedited tumor development. Therefore, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing over time and identified fibroblasts as the cell population manifesting the greatest clock-dependent changes, with enrichment of specific cancer-associated fibroblast pathways due to circadian misalignment. Collectively, these results suggest fibroblasts as the putative target of chronic jetlag-induced accelerated pancreas cancer initiation.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to learn and memorize is a key determinant for the quality of life, but is known to decline to varying degrees with age. Previous ERP research methods had the limitation that their design did not allow to track the gradual memory formation process. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation and the critical features that determine the extent to which aging affects learning are still unknown. By using a visual sequence learning task, which consists of the repeated presentation of a simple sequence of tokens, we are able to track the progress of gradual memory formation through both neurophysiological and behavioral markers. On a neurophysiological level, we focused on two learning related centroparietal ERP components: the P300 and broad positivity.\n\nOur results revealed that although both age groups showed significant learning progress, young individuals learned faster and remembered more stimuli than older participants. Successful learning was directly linked to a decrease of P300 amplitude. However, young participants showed larger P300 amplitude with a sharper decrease during the memory formation process. The P300 amplitude predicted learning success in both age groups, was associated with increased fronto-parietal brain network activation and showed good test-retest reliability. Highly, similar results were found for the broad positivity component, which raises the questions if the BP is a distinct component or just a prolonged P300. In a series of analyses, including topographic analysis of variance (TANOVA), equivalence testing and source reconstruction analysis, we addressed the unresolved questions. These analyses revealed concordant distributed brain activation patterns within parietal circuits. Thus, there is no evidence (rather evidence for equivalence) for distinct underlying neural generators for the two components.\n\nTaken together, the results highlight the importance of the P300 as a neurophysiological marker of learning and may enable the development of preventive measures for age-related impeded learning.",

However, the specificity of native mammalian enhancers and how it shapes cell-type-specific gene expression landscapes remain largely unknown. We show that endogenous enhancers are broadly compatible with the promoters of developmental and housekeeping genes. Broad enhancer compatibility affords  retrofitting new regulatory capabilities to housekeeping genes that evolved before the advent of enhancers. This enables cell-type-specific tuning of ubiquitously expressed genes. Segregation between enhancer-dependent and -independent type regulation is blurred. Within the same cell type, a single promoter can be activated by enhancers and non-enhancer promoter-regulatory elements (PREs). It is the tunable and integrated strengths of enhancers and PREs that quantitatively shape gene expression landscapes, within and across cell types.

Antibody titers generally waned over this time frame, but three deer had a temporary 4 to 8-fold increases in PRNT titers over a month after seroconversion; anamnestic response cannot be ruled out.",
