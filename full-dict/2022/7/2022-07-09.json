    "abstract": "Planarians possess naturally occurring pluripotent adult somatic stem cells (neoblasts) required for homeostasis and whole-body regeneration. However, no reliable neoblast culture methods are currently available, hindering mechanistic studies of pluripotency and the development of transgenic tools. We report the first robust methods for neoblast culture and delivery of exogenous mRNAs. We identify optimal culture media for maintaining neoblasts in vitro, and show via transplantation that cultured stem cells retain pluripotency for two days. We developed a new procedure that significantly improves neoblast yield and purity by modifying standard flow cytometry methods. These methods enable the introduction and expression of exogenous mRNAs in neoblasts, overcoming a key hurdle impeding the application of transgenics in planarians. The advances in cell culture reported here create new opportunities for mechanistic studies of planarian adult stem cell pluripotency, and provide a systematic framework to develop cell culture techniques in other emerging research organisms.",

    "abstract": "In behavior analysis, the modulation of the effect of time-based schedules by the spatial characteristics of the environment has been scarcely studied. Furthermore, the spatial organization of behavior, despite its ubiquity and ecological relevance, has not been widely addressed. The purpose of the present work was to analyze the effect of water delivery location (peripheral vs. central) on the spatial organization of water-feeding behavior under time-based schedules. One group of rats was exposed to a Fixed Time 30 s-water-delivery schedule and a second group to a Variable Time 30 s schedule. For both groups, in the first phase, the water dispenser was located in the perimetral zone. In the second condition, the water dispenser was located in the central zone. Each location was presented for 20 sessions. Rats trajectories, distance to the dispenser, accumulated time in regions, and entropy measures were analyzed. A differential effect of the location of water delivery in interaction with the time-based schedule was observed on all the analyzed spatial qualities of behavior. The findings are discussed in relation to the ecological proposal of Timberlakes behavioral systems.",

    "abstract": "Memories are stored in the brain as cellular ensembles activated during learning and reactivated during retrieval. Using the Tet-tag system in mice, we label dorsal dentate gyrus neurons activated by positive, neutral or negative experiences with channelrhodopsin-2. Following fear-conditioning, these cells are artificially reactivated during fear memory recall. Optical stimulation of a competing positive memory is sufficient to update the memory during reconsolidation, thereby reducing conditioned fear acutely and enduringly. Moreover, mice demonstrate operant responding for reactivation of a positive memory, confirming its rewarding properties. These results show that interference from a rewarding experience can counteract negative affective states. While memory-updating, induced by memory reactivation, involves a relatively small set of neurons, we also find that activating a large population of randomly labeled dorsal dentate gyrus neurons is effective in promoting reconsolidation. Importantly, memory-updating is specific to the fear memory. These findings implicate the dorsal dentate gyrus as a potential therapeutic node for modulating memories to suppress fear.",

Yet, little is known about the mental and neural computations that allow the visual system to infer this structure online from a volatile stream of visual information. We propose online hierarchical Bayesian inference as a principled solution for how the brain might solve this complex perceptual task. We derive an online Expectation-Maximization algorithm that explains human percepts qualitatively and quantitatively for a diverse set of stimuli, covering classical psychophysics experiments, ambiguous motion scenes, and illusory motion displays. We thereby identify normative explanations for the origin of human motion structure perception and make testable predictions for new psychophysics experiments. The proposed online hierarchical inference model furthermore affords a neural network implementation which shares properties with motion-sensitive cortical areas and motivates a novel class of experiments to reveal the neural representations of latent structure.",

    "abstract": "Many agricultural management tactics, such as reduced tillage, aim to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services. Responses to such tactics can be context dependent, however, and differentially impact (i) functional groups of service-providing organisms and (ii) crop yields. In canola (Brassica napus L., B. rapa L.) crop fields we assessed how soil tillage and landscape context (amount of semi-natural habitat within 1 km of each field) affected arthropod biodiversity and crop yield. We assessed effects of full (multiple tillage passes that leave soil surface bare), intermediate (tilled once and some stubble remains), or no (seed planted directly into last years stubble) tillage on functional groups with unique diets and reproductive strategies: (i) herbivores, (ii) kleptoparasites, (iii) parasitoids, (iv) pollinators, and (v) predators. Effects of tillage and landscape context on arthropod abundance and diversity varied across functional groups. Pollinators responded strongest to tillage, benefitting from intermediate tillage. Predators and herbivores responded strongly to landscape context, as both were more abundant in landscapes with more semi-natural habitat. Our results suggest natural history differences among functional groups mediate effects of landscape context on biodiversity. However, variation in arthropod communities had little effect on canola crop yield. The effects of soil management practices on aboveground arthropods are complex, and practices thought to increase some aspects of agricultural sustainability may not be beneficial in other contexts. Identifying practices such as intermediate tillage that may increase soil quality and arthropod diversity is a key to designing agricultural ecosystems that will effectively benefit both biodiversity and human well-being.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) is the second most important Alzheimers disease (AD) risk gene, but its physiological roles in neurons and its contribution to brain pathology remain largely elusive. In this work, we show that BIN1 plays a critical role in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, electrical activity, and gene expression of glutamatergic neurons.\n\nMethodsWe generated 3D cerebral organoids and 2D enriched neuronal cell cultures from isogenic BIN1 wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HET) and homozygous knockout (KO) human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, biochemical assays, immunocytochemistry and multi-electrode array(MEA) electrophysiology, we characterized the molecular and functional consequences of reduced BIN1 expression in different neural cell types.\n\nResultsWe show that BIN1 is mainly expressed by oligodendrocytes and glutamatergic neurons of cerebral organoids, like in the human brain. Both BIN1 HET and KO cerebral organoids show specific transcriptional alterations, mainly associated with ion transport and synapses in glutamatergic neurons. We then demonstrate that BIN1 cell-autonomously regulates gene expression in glutamatergic neurons by using a novel protocol to generate pure culture of human-derived induced neurons (hiNs). Using this system, we also show that BIN1 plays a key role in the regulation of neuronal calcium transients and electrical activity via its interaction with the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.2. BIN1 KO hiNs show reduced activity-dependent internalization and higher Cav1.2 expression compared to WT hiNs. Pharmacological treatment with clinically relevant doses of nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, partly rescues neuronal electrical and gene expression alterations in BIN1 KO glutamatergic neurons. Further, we show that transcriptional alterations in BIN1 KO hiNs affecting biological processes related to calcium homeostasis are also present in glutamatergic neurons of the human brain at late stages of AD pathology.\n\nConclusionsTogether, our findings suggest that BIN1-dependent alterations in neuronal properties could contribute to AD pathophysiology and that treatment with low doses of clinically approved calcium blockers should be considered as an option to dampen disease onset and progression.",

    "abstract": "V-ATPases are highly regulated, multi-subunit proton pumps that acidify organelles. The V-ATPase a-subunit is a two-domain protein containing a C-terminal transmembrane domain that participates in proton transport and a N-terminal cytosolic domain (aNT) that acts as a regulatory hub, integrating environmental inputs to regulate assembly, localization, and V-ATPase activity. Tissue- and organelle-specific a-subunit isoforms exist in most organisms, but how regulatory inputs are decoded by aNT isoforms is unknown. The yeast S. cerevisiae encodes only two organelle-specific a-isoforms, Stv1 in the Golgi and Vph1 in the vacuole. Based on recent structures, we designed chimeric yeast aNTs in which the globular proximal and distal ends are exchanged. The Vph1 proximal-Stv1 distal (VPSD) aNT chimera binds to the glucose-responsive RAVE assembly factor in vitro but exhibits little binding to phosphoinositide lipids that activate V-ATPases. The Stv1 proximal-Vph1 distal (SPVD) aNT lacks RAVE binding but binds more tightly to phosphoinositides than Vph1 or Stv1. When attached to the Vph1 C-terminal domain in vivo, both chimeras complement growth defects of a vph1{Delta} mutant, but only the SPVD chimera exhibits wild-type V-ATPase activity. Cells containing the SPVD chimera adapt more slowly to a poor carbon source than wild-type cells but grow more rapidly than wild-type after a shift to alkaline pH. This is the first example of a \"redesigned\" V-ATPase with altered regulatory properties and adaptation to specific stresses.",

In this work, we sought to establish spatio-temporal context of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) reprogramming during obesity.\n\nMethodsWe captured single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and histological imagining of murine WAT over the course of diet-induced obesity to study macrophage phenotype dynamics. We developed a straightforward mathematical approach to integrating multi-modal data to quantify obesityinduced changes to WAT organization. We aligned ATM phenotypes with crown-like structures (CLS) in early obesity and used spatial network analysis to uncover signalling mechanisms implicated in CLS formation.\n\nResultsWe identified novel diversity of the lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) phenotype, whose transcriptional profile, signaling mechanisms, and spatial context serve as indicators of CLS formation in early obesity. We demonstrated that dysregulation of lipid-metabolic signalling is a critical turning point in the monocyte-LAM lineage and identified novel ligand-receptor mechanisms including Apoe, Lrp1, Lpl and App that serve as hallmarks of nascent CLS in WAT.\n\nConclusionsMulti-modal spatio-temporal profiling demonstrates that LAMs disproportionately accumulate in CLS and are preceded by a transition-state macrophage phenotype with monocytic origins.

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositides are pivotal regulators of vesicular traffic and signaling during phagocytosis. Phagosome formation, the initial step of the process, is characterized by local membrane remodelling and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that leads to formation of the pseudopods that drive particle engulfment. Using genetically-encoded fluorescent probes we found that upon particle engagement a localized pool of PtdIns(3,4)P2 is generated by the sequential activities of class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases and phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases. Depletion of the enzymes responsible for this locally generated pool of PtdIns(3,4)P2 blocks pseudopod progression and ultimately phagocytosis. We show that the PtdIns(3,4)P2 effector Lamellipodin (Lpd) is recruited to nascent phagosomes by PtdIns(3,4)P2. Furthermore, we show that silencing of Lpd inhibits phagocytosis and produces aberrant pseudopodia with disorganized actin filaments. Lastly, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was identified as a key actin-regulatory protein mediating phagosome formation downstream of Lpd. Mechanistically, our findings imply that a pathway involving PtdIns(3,4)P2, Lpd and VASP mediates phagocytosis at the stage of particle engulfment.",

    "abstract": "Half a billion years of evolutionary battle forged the vertebrate adaptive immune system, an astonishingly versatile factory for molecules that can adapt to arbitrary attacks. The history of an individual encounter is chronicled within a clonotype: the descendants of a single fully rearranged adaptive immune cell. For B cells, reading this immune history for an individual remains a fundamental challenge of modern immunology. Identification of such clonotypes is a magnificently challenging problem for three reasons:\n\nO_LIThe cell history is inferred rather than directly observed: the only available data are the sequences of V(D)J molecules occurring in a sample of cells.\nC_LIO_LIEach immune receptor is a pair of V(D)J molecules. Identifying these pairs at scale is a technological challenge and cannot be done with perfect accuracy--real samples are mixtures of cells and fragments thereof.\nC_LIO_LIThese molecules can be intensely mutated during the optimization of the response to particular antigens, blurring distinctions between kindred molecules.\nC_LI\n\nIt is thus impossible to determine clonotypes exactly. All solutions to this problem make a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity; useful solutions must address actual artifacts found in real data.\n\nWe present enclone1, a system for computing approximate clonotypes from single cell data, and demonstrate its use and value with the 10x Genomics Immune Profiling Solution. To test it, we generate data for 1.6 million individual B cells, from four humans, including deliberately enriched memory cells, to tax the algorithm and provide a resource for the community. We analytically determine the specificity of enclones clonotyping algorithm, showing that on this dataset the probability of co-clonotyping two unrelated B cells is around 10-9. We prove that using only heavy chains increases the error rate by two orders of magnitude.\n\nenclone comprises a comprehensive toolkit for the analysis and display of immune receptor data.

Expression of capn8.3, a novel calpain, was located in cells immediately flanking the AER. The Wnt antagonist Dkk1 was AER-specific in Xenopus limbs. Two transcription factors, sall1 and zic5, were expressed in distal mesenchyme. Zic5 has no described association with limb development. We also describe expression of two proximal genes, gata5 and tnn, not previously associated with limb development.

However, since the evolutionary origin of the systems are different, how much they exploit common systems or distinct systems to architect their structures are largely unknown. To understand the regulatory mechanism how bryophytes architect rhizoid system responding to an environmental factor, such as gravity, and compare it with the root system of vascular plants, we have developed the methodology to visualize and quantitatively analyze the rhizoid system of the moss, Physcomitrium patens in 3D. The rhizoids having the diameter of 21.3 m on the average were visualized by refraction-contrast X-ray micro-CT using coherent X-ray optics available at synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8. Three types of shape (ring-shape, line, black circle) observed in tomographic slices of specimens embedded in paraffin were confirmed to be the rhizoids by optical and electron microscopy. Comprehensive automatic segmentation of the rhizoids which appeared in different three form types in tomograms was tested by a method using Canny edge detector or machine learning. Accuracy of output images was evaluated by comparing with the manually-segmented ground truth images using measures such as F1 score and IoU, revealing that the automatic segmentation using the machine learning was more effective than that using Canny edge detector. Thus, machine learning-based skeletonized 3D model revealed quite dense distribution of rhizoids, which was similar to root system architecture in vascular plants.

    "abstract": "Zygomycetes are phylogenetically early diverged, ecologically diverse, industrially valuable, agriculturally beneficial, and clinically pathogenic fungi. Although new phyla and subphyla have been constantly established to accommodate specific members and a subkingdom, Mucoromyceta, was erected to unite core zygomycetous fungi, their phylogenetic relationships have not been well resolved. Taking account of the information of monophyly and divergence time estimated from ITS and LSU rDNA sequences, the present study updates the classification framework of the subkingdom Mucoromyceta from the phylum down to the generic rank: six phyla (including two new phyla Endogonomycota and Umbelopsidomycota), eight classes, 15 orders (including five new orders Claroideoglomerales, Cunninghamellales, Lentamycetales, Phycomycetales and Syncephalastrales), 41 families (including six new families Circinellaceae, Gongronellaceae, Protomycocladaceae, Rhizomucoraceae, Syzygitaceae and Thermomucoraceae), and 121 genera. The taxonomic hierarchy was calibrated with estimated divergence times: phyla 810-639 Mya, classes 651-585 Mya, orders 570-400 Mya, and families 488-107 Mya. Along with this outline, 71 genera are annotated and 73 new species are described. In addition, three new combinations are proposed. In this paper, we update the taxonomic backbone of the subkingdom Mucoromyceta and reinforce its phylogeny. We also contribute numerous new taxa and enrich the diversity of Mucoromyceta.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics can induce mutations that cause antibiotic resistance, triggered by stress responses. The identities of the stress-response activators reveal environmental cues that elicit mutagenesis, and are weak links in mutagenesis networks, inhibition of which could slow evolution of resistance during antibiotic therapies. Despite pivotal importance, few identities and fewer functions of stress responses in mutagenesis are clear. Here, we identify the stringent starvation response in fluoroquinolone-antibiotic ciprofloxacin (stress)-induced mutagenesis. We show its role in transient differentiation of a mutable \"gambler\" cell subpopulation. Stringent activity is induced by reactive oxygen and upregulates two small (s)RNAs that induce the general stress response, which allows mutagenic DNA-break repair. Surprisingly, RNA polymerase and response-activator nucleotide (p)ppGpp promote ciprofloxacin-induced DNA-damage signaling. We propose a model for their regulation of DNA-damage processing in transcribed regions. The data demonstrate a critical node in ciprofloxacin-induced mutagenesis, imply RNA-polymerase regulation of DNA-break repair, and identify promising targets for resistance-resisting drugs.",

    "abstract": "Associating multiple sensory cues with objects and experience is a fundamental brain process that improves object recognition and memory performance. However, neural mechanisms that bind sensory features during learning and augment memory expression are unknown. Here we demonstrate multisensory appetitive and aversive memory in Drosophila. Combining colors and odors improved memory performance, even when each sensory modality was tested alone. Temporal control of neuronal function revealed visually-selective mushroom body Kenyon Cells (KCs) to be required for both enhancement of visual and olfactory memory after multisensory training. Voltage imaging in head-fixed flies showed that multisensory learning binds activity between streams of modality-specific KCs, so that unimodal sensory input generates a multimodal neuronal response. Binding occurs between regions of the olfactory and visual KC axons, which receive valence-relevant dopaminergic reinforcement, and is propagated downstream. Dopamine locally releases GABA-ergic inhibition to permit specific microcircuits within KC-spanning serotonergic neurons to function as an excitatory bridge between the previously  modality-selective KC streams. Cross-modal binding thereby expands the olfactory memory engram by recruiting visual path KCs to become odor responsive. This broadening of the engram improves memory performance after multisensory learning and permits a single sensory feature to retrieve the memory of the multimodal experience.",

    "abstract": "Lipid transport proteins at membrane contact sites, where organelles are closely apposed, are critical in redistributing lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are made, to other cellular membranes. Such protein mediated transfer is especially important for maintaining organelles disconnected from secretory pathways, like mitochondria. Here we identify mitoguardin-2, a mitochondrial protein at contacts with the ER and/or lipid droplets (LDs), as a lipid transporter. An X-ray structure shows that the C-terminal domain of mitoguardin-2 has a hydrophobic cavity that binds lipids. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals that both glycerophospholipids and free-fatty acids co-purify with mitoguardin-2 from cells, and that each mitoguardin-2 can accommodate up to two lipids. Mitoguardin-2 transfers glycerophospholipids between membranes in vitro, and this transport ability is required for roles both in mitochondrial and LD biology. While it is not established that protein-mediated transfer at contacts plays a role in LD metabolism, our findings raise the possibility that mitoguardin-2 functions in transporting fatty acids and glycerophospholipids at mitochondria-LD contacts.",

Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we show that MEC-2 Stomatin undergoes a rigidity phase transition during maturation from fluid to viscoelastic, glass-like condensates that facilitate either transport or mechanotransduction. This switch is promoted by the SH3 domain of UNC-89/Titin/Obscurin through a direct interaction with MEC-2 and suggests a physiological role for a percolation transition in force transmission during body wall touch. Together, our data demonstrate a novel function for rigidity maturation during mechanotransduction and a previously unidentified role for Titin homologs in neurons.",

However, a motor functionally equivalent to the conventional kinesin has not been identified in plants, which lack the kinesin-1 genes. Here, we show that plant-specific armadillo repeat-containing kinesin (ARK) is the long sought-after versatile anterograde transporter in plants. In ARK mutants of the moss Physcomitrium patens, the anterograde motility of nuclei, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and secretory vesicles was suppressed. Ectopic expression of non-motile or tail-deleted ARK did not restore organelle distribution. Another prominent macroscopic phenotype of ARK mutants was the suppression of cell tip growth. We showed that this defect was attributed to the mislocalisation of actin regulators, including RopGEFs; expression and forced apical localisation of RopGEF3 suppressed the growth phenotype of the ARK mutant. The mutant phenotypes were partially rescued by ARK homologues in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting the conservation of ARK functions in plants.",

    "abstract": "Sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) oocytes are an important species for aquaculture and as a model species for multiple scientific fields. Despite their importance, methods of cryopreserved biobanking of oocytes are currently not possible. Optimized cryoprotectant loading may enable vitrification methods of cryopreservation and thus long-term storage of oocytes. Determining an optimized protocol requires membrane characteristics and models of damage associated with the vitrification loading protocol, namely osmotic, temperature, and cytotoxic damage. We present and experimentally evaluated state-of-the-art models alongside our novel models. We experimentally verify the damage models throughout time at difference treatment intensities. Osmotic damage experiments consisted of hypertonic solutions composed of seawater supplemented with NaCl or sucrose and hypotonic solutions composed of seawater diluted with deionized water. Treatment times ranged from 2 to 30 minutes. To test temperature damage (in particular chill injury), oocytes were exposed to 1.7 {degrees}C, 10 {degrees}C, and 20 {degrees}C (control) for exposure times ranging from 2 to 90 minutes. Cytotoxicity was investigated by exposing oocytes to solutions of Me2SO for exposure times ranging from 2 to 30 minutes. We identify appropriate models and use these to search for an optimal loading protocol, namely the time dependent osmotic damage model (for osmotic damage), the temperature dependent model (for temperature damage), and the external molality Arrhenius power model (for cytotoxicity). We combined these models to estimate total damage during a cryopreservation loading protocol and performed a exhaustive grid search for optimal loading for a given goal intracellular cryoprotectant concentration. Given our fitted models, we find sea urchin oocytes can only be loaded to 0.13 Me2SO v/v with a 50% survival, For reference, levels for vitrification are approximately 0.45 v/v. Our synthesis of damages is the first of its kind, and enables a fundamentally novel approach to modelling survival for cells in general.",

    "abstract": "Cancer alters both local and distant tissue by influencing the microenvironment. In this regard, the interplay with the stromal fraction is considered critical as this latter can either foster or hamper the progression of the disease. Accordingly, the modality by which tumor may alter distant niches of stromal cells is still unclear, expecially at early stages. In this short report we attempt to better understand the biology of this cross talk. In our \"autologous stromal experimental setting\", we found that remote adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mediastinal AMSC) obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinoma sustain proliferation and clonogenic ability of A549 and human primary lung adenocarcinoma cells similarly to the autologous stromal lung counterpart (LMSC). This effect is not observed in lung benign diseases as the hamartochondroma. This finding was validated by conditioning benign AMSC with supernatants from LAC up to 21 days. The new reconditioned media of the stromal fraction so obtained, was able to increase cell proliferation of A549 cells at 14 and 21 days similarly to that derived from AMSC of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The secretome generated by remote AMSC revealed overlapping to the corresponding malignant microenvironment of the autologous local LMSC. Among the plethora of 80 soluble factors analysed by arrays, a small pool of 5 upregulated molecules including IL1-{beta}, IL-3, MCP-1, TNF- and EGF, was commonly shared by both malignant-like autologous A- and LMSC derived microenvironments vs those benign. The bioinformatic analysis both revealed that these proteins were strictly and functionally interconnected to the lung fibrosis and proinflammation and that miR-126, 101, 486 and let-7-g were their main targets. Accordingly, we found that in lung cancer tissues and blood samples from the same set of patients here employed, miR-126 and miR-486 displayed the highest expression levels in tissue and blood, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Lamins A and C, encoded by the LMNA gene, are nuclear intermediate filaments that provide structural support to the nucleus and contribute to chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation. LMNA mutations cause muscular dystrophies, dilated cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. The mechanisms by which many LMNA mutations result in muscle-specific diseases have remained elusive, presenting a major hurdle in the development of effective treatments. Previous studies using striated muscle laminopathy mouse models found that cytoskeletal forces acting on mechanically fragile Lmna-mutant nuclei led to transient nuclear envelope rupture, extensive DNA damage, and activation of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in skeletal muscle cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, hearts of Lmna mutant mice have elevated activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, a central regulator of DDR signaling. We hypothesized that elevated p53 activation could present a pathogenic mechanism in striated muscle laminopathies, and that eliminating p53 activation could improve muscle function and survival in laminopathy mouse models. Supporting a pathogenic function of p53 activation in muscle, stabilization of p53 was sufficient to reduce contractility and viability in wild-type muscle cells in vitro. Using three laminopathy models, we found that increased p53 activity in Lmna-mutant muscle cells primarily resulted from mechanically induced damage to the myonuclei, and not from altered transcriptional regulation due to loss of lamin A/C expression. However, global deletion of p53 in a severe muscle laminopathy model did not reduce the disease phenotype or increase survival, indicating that additional drivers of disease must contribute to the disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In Bacillus subtilis, a master regulator Spo0A controls several cell-differentiation pathways. Under moderate starvation, phosphorylated Spo0A (Spo0A~P) induces biofilm formation by indirectly activating genes controlling matrix production in a subpopulation of cells via a SinI-SinR-SlrR network. Under severe starvation, Spo0A~P induces sporulation by directly and indirectly regulating sporulation gene expression. However, what determines the heterogeneity of individual cell fates is not fully understood. In particular, it is still unclear why, despite being controlled by a single master regulator, biofilm matrix production and sporulation are mutually exclusive on a single-cell level. In this work, with mathematical modeling, we showed that the fluctuations in the growth rate and the intrinsic noise amplified by the bistability in the SinI-SinR-SlrR network could explain the single-cell distribution of matrix production. Moreover, we predicted an incoherent feed-forward loop: the decrease in the cellular growth rate activates matrix production by increasing in Spo0A phosphorylation level but represses it via changing the relative concentrations of SinR and SlrR. Experimental data provide evidence to support model predictions. In particular, we demonstrate how the degree to which matrix production and sporulation appear mutually exclusive is affected by genetic perturbations.\n\nImportanceThe mechanisms of cell-fate decisions are fundamental to our understanding of multicellular organisms and bacterial communities. However, even for the best-studied model systems we still lack a complete picture of how phenotypic heterogeneity of genetically identical cells is controlled. Here, using B. subtilis as a model system, we employ a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments to explain the population-level dynamics and single-cell level heterogeneity of biofilm gene expression. The results demonstrate how the two cell fates, biofilm matrix production and sporulation, can appear mutually exclusive without explicitly inhibiting one another. Such a mechanism could be used in a wide range of other biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that may cause genital pathology via induction of destructive host immune responses. Human-adapted Chlamydia trachomatis causes inflammatory disease in human hosts but is easily cleared in mice, and mouse-adapted Chlamydia muridarum establishes a productive and pathogenic infection in murine hosts. While numerous anti-chlamydial host resistance factors have been discovered in mice and humans alike, little is known about host factors promoting host fitness independent of host resistance. Here, we show that interferon-inducible immunity-related GTPase M (Irgm) proteins function as such host factors ameliorating infection-associated sequalae in the murine female genital tract, thus characterizing Irgm proteins as mediators of disease tolerance. Specifically, we demonstrate that mice deficient for all three murine Irgm paralogs (pan-Irgm-/-) are defective for cell-autonomous immunity to C. trachomatis, which correlates with an early and transient increase in bacterial burden and sustained hyperinflammation in vivo. In contrast, upon infection of pan-Irgm-/- mice with C. muridarum, bacterial burden is unaffected, yet genital inflammation and scarring pathology are nonetheless increased, demonstrating that Irgm proteins can promote host fitness without altering bacterial burden. Additionally, pan-Irgm-/- mice display increased granulomatous inflammation in genital Chlamydia infection, implicating Irgm proteins in the regulation of granuloma formation and maintenance. These findings demonstrate that Irgm proteins regulate pathogenic immune responses to Chlamydia infection in vivo, establishing an effective infection model to examine the immunoregulatory functions and mechanisms of Irgm proteins.\n\nImportanceIn response to genital Chlamydia infection, the immune system mounts a proinflammatory response to resist the pathogen, yet inflammation must be tightly controlled to avoid collateral damage and scarring to host genital tissue. Variation in the human IRGM gene is associated with susceptibility to autoinflammatory diseases but its role in ameliorating inflammatory diseases caused by infections is poorly defined. Here we use mice deficient for all three murine Irgm paralogs to demonstrate that Irgm proteins not only provide host resistance to Chlamydia infections but also limit associated inflammation in the female genital tract. In particular, we find that murine Irgm expression prevents granulomatous inflammation, which parallels inflammatory diseases associated with variants in human IRGM. Our findings therefore establish genital Chlamydia infection as a useful model to study the roles for Irgm proteins in both promoting protective immunity and limiting pathogenic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "In the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the presence of the amino acid glutamate triggers potassium uptake due to the glutamate-mediated activation of the potassium channel KtrCD. As a result, the intracellular accumulation of glutamate is toxic in strains lacking the second messenger cyclic di-AMP since these cells are unable to limit potassium uptake. We observed that the presence of histidine, which is degraded to glutamate, is also toxic for a B. subtilis strain that lacks all three c-di-AMP synthesizing enzymes. However, suppressor mutants emerged, and whole genome sequencing revealed mutations in the azlB gene encoding the repressor of the azl operon. This operon encodes an exporter and an importer for branched-chain amino acids. The suppressor mutations result in overexpression of the azl operon. Deletion of the azlCD genes encoding the branched-chain amino acid exporter restored the toxicity of histidine indicating that this exporter is required for histidine export and resistance to otherwise toxic levels of the amino acid. The higher abundance of the amino acid exporter AzlCD increased the extracellular concentration of histidine, thus confirming the new function of AzlCD as a histidine exporter. Unexpectedly, AzlB-mediated repression of the operon remains active even in the presence of amino acids suggesting that expression of the azl operon requires mutational inactivation of AzlB.\n\nIMPORTANCEAmino acids are building blocks for protein biosynthesis in each living cell. However, due to their reactivity as well as the similarity between several amino amino acids, they may also be involved in harmful reactions or in non-cognate interactions and thus be toxic. Bacillus subtilis can deal with otherwise toxic histidine by overexpressing a bipartite amino acid exporter AzlCD. Although encoded in an operon that also contains a gene for an amino acid importer, the corresponding genes are not expressed, irrespective of the availability or not of amino acids in the medium. This suggests that the azl operon is a last resort to deal with histidine stress that can be expressed due to mutational inactivation of the cognate repressor, AzlB.",

    "abstract": "Current influenza virus vaccines have to be closely matched to circulating strains to provide good protection and antigenic drift and emerging pandemic influenza virus strains present a difficult challenge for them. Universal influenza virus vaccines, including chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA)-based constructs that target the conserved stalk domain of hemagglutinin, are in clinical development. Due to the conservation of the stalk domain, antibodies directed to it show broad binding profiles, usually within group 1 and group 2 influenza A or influenza B virus phylogenies. However, determining the binding breadth of these antibodies with commonly used immunological methods can be challenging. Here, we analyzed serum samples from a phase I clinical trial (CVIA057, NCT03300050) using an influenza virus protein microarray (IVPM). The IVPM technology allowed us to assess immune responses not only to a large number of group 1 hemagglutinins but also group 2 and influenza B hemagglutinins. In CVIA057, different vaccine modalities including a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine and inactivated influenza virus vaccines with or without adjuvant, all in the context of cHA constructs, were tested. We found that vaccination with adjuvanted, inactivated vaccines induced a very broad antibody response covering group 1 hemagglutinins, with limited induction of antibodies to group 2 hemagglutinins. Our data show that cHA constructs do indeed induce very broad immune responses and that the IVPM technology is a useful tool to measure this breadth that broadly protective or universal influenza virus vaccines aim to induce.\n\nImportanceThe development of a universal influenza virus vaccine that protects against seasonal drifted, zoonotic or emerging pandemic influenza viruses would be an extremely useful public health tool. Here we test a technology designed to measure the breadth of antibody responses induced by this new class of vaccines.",

    "abstract": "During the initiation step of bacterial genome replication, replicative helicases depend on specialized proteins for their loading onto oriC. DnaC and DnaI were the first loaders characterized. However, most bacteria do not contain any of these genes, which are domesticated phage elements that replaced the ancestral and unrelated loader gene dciA several times during evolution. To understand how DciA assists the loading of DnaB, we determined the crystal structure of the complex from Vibrio cholerae, in which two VcDciAs interact with a dimer of VcDnaB, without changing its canonical structure. Our data showed that the VcDciA binding site on VcDnaB is the conserved module formed by the linker helix LH of one monomer and the determinant helix DH of the second one. Interestingly, DnaC from Escherichia coli also targets this module onto EcDnaB. Thanks to their common target site, we showed that VcDciA and EcDnaC could be functionally interchanged in vitro, despite sharing no structural similarities. This is a milestone in understanding the mechanism employed by phage helicase loaders to hijack bacterial replicative helicases during evolution.",

    "abstract": "Mutations allowing pathogens to escape host immunity promote the spread of infectious diseases in heterogeneous host populations and can lead to major epidemics. Understanding the conditions favoring these evolutionary emergences is key for the development of durable control strategies against pathogens. Here we compare the durability of three different control strategies: (i) a mixing strategy where the host population results from the mix of two single-resistant genotypes, (ii) a pyramiding strategy where host resistance is due to a single double-resistant genotype, (iii) a combining strategy where host resistance is due to a mix between a single-resistant genotype and a double-resistant genotype. First, we use evolutionary epidemiology theory to clarify the interplay between demographic stochasticity and evolutionary dynamics to show that the pyramiding strategy always yields lower probability of evolutionary emergence. Second, we confirm experimentally these predictions using virulent bacteriophages introduced in bacterial populations where we can manipulate the diversity and the depth of CRISPR immunity. Our work shows that pyramiding multiple defenses into the same individual host and avoiding mixing with single-defense strategies is a robust way to protect individuals and populations against pathogen evolutionary emergence. These results have practical implications for the optimal deployment of host resistance in agriculture and biotechnology but also for the optimal use of vaccination against human pathogens.",

We have now investigated the role of {beta}-catenin/CTNNB1 in the evolution of T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) patients and its involvement in therapy resistance. We have identified a specific gene signature that is directly regulated by {beta}-catenin, TCF/LEF factors and ZBTB33/Kaiso in T-ALL cell lines, which is highly and significantly represented in 5 out of 6 refractory patients from a cohort of 40 children with T-ALL. By subsequent refinement of this gene signature, we found that a subset of {beta}-catenin target genes involved with RNA-processing function are sufficient to segregate T-ALL refractory patients in three independent cohorts. We demonstrate the implication of {beta}-catenin in RNA and protein synthesis in T-ALL and provide experimental evidence that {beta}-catenin is crucial for the cellular response to chemotherapy, mainly in the cellular recovery phase after treatment.\n\nWe propose that combination treatments involving chemotherapy plus {beta}-catenin inhibitors will enhance chemotherapy response and prevent disease relapse in T-ALL patients.",

    "abstract": "Cellular ATP that is consumed to perform energetically expensive tasks must be replenished by new ATP through the activation of metabolism. Neuronal stimulation, an energetically demanding process, transiently activates aerobic glycolysis, but the precise mechanism underlying this glycolysis activation has not been determined. We previously showed that neuronal glycolysis is correlated with Ca2+ influx, but is not activated by feedforward Ca2+ signaling (Diaz-Garcia, Meyer, et al., 2021). Since ATP-powered Na+ and Ca2+ pumping activities are increased following stimulation to restore ion gradients and are estimated to consume most neuronal ATP, we aimed to determine if they are coupled to neuronal glycolysis activation. By using two-photon imaging of fluorescent biosensors and dyes in dentate granule cell somas of acute mouse hippocampal slices, we observed that production of cytoplasmic NADH, a byproduct of glycolysis, is strongly coupled to changes in intracellular Na+, while intracellular Ca2+ could only increase NADH production if both forward Na+/Ca2+ exchange and Na+/K+ pump activity were intact. Additionally, antidromic stimulation-induced intracellular [Na+] increases were reduced >50% by blocking Ca2+ entry. These results indicate that neuronal glycolysis activation is predominantly a response to an increase in activity of the Na+/K+ pump, which is strongly potentiated by Na+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger during extrusion of Ca2+ following stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Sequence processing in humans is thought to rely on two distinct mechanisms: the computation of transition probabilities between adjacent elements and the extraction of larger hierarchical structures. Previous studies indicate that both mechanisms contribute to auditory sequence processing, but whether language processing involves one or the other remains debated. To address this issue, we designed a linguistic version of the local-global auditory test, which contrasts sequential versus hierarchical violations of expectations in sentences, and we searched for violation responses in both human magnetoencephalography and computational models. We found that in models, both mechanisms coexist, whereas humans only show hierarchical structure effects. Our results suggest that human sentence processing is dominated by structure-based computations and robust to sequential effects. They point to major differences between language processing in humans versus neural models and, within humans, between the processing of linguistic sentences versus non-linguistic sequences.",

The superior colliculus mediates visually guided innate defensive behaviors via cell-type specific projections. However, how brain-wide inputs to the superior colliculus are organized to modulate visual processing and enable flexible behavior remains unknown. To determine these rules, we focused on inhibitory projection (Gad2) neurons. Trans-synaptic tracing and neuronal recordings revealed that Gad2 neurons projecting to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd) and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG) form two separate anatomical and functional populations, where each circuit received a different set of non-retinal inputs. Inhibiting LGd or PBG projecting Gad2 neurons resulted in opposing effects on behavior; increasing freezing or escape probability to visual looming stimuli, respectively. These data suggest that projection-specific sampling of brain-wide inputs provide a circuit design principle that enables feed-forward transfer of visual threat to be independently adjusted to produce context specific behavior.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are common and can be debilitating, with effective treatments remaining hampered by an incomplete understanding of the underlying genetic etiology. Improvements have been made in understanding the genetic influences on mouse behavioral models of anxiety, yet it is unclear the extent to which genes identified in these experimental systems contribute to genetic variation in human anxiety phenotypes. Leveraging new and existing large-scale human genome-wide association studies, we tested whether sets of genes previously identified in mouse anxiety-like behavior studies contribute to a range of human anxiety disorders. When tested as individual genes, thirteen mouse-identified genes were associated with human anxiety phenotypes, suggesting an overlap of individual genes contributing to both mouse models of anxiety-like behaviors and human anxiety traits. When genes were tested as sets, we did identify fourteen significant associations between mouse gene sets and human anxiety, but the majority of gene sets showed no significant association with human anxiety phenotypes. These few significant associations indicate a need to identify and develop more translatable mouse models by identifying sets of genes that  match between model systems and specific human phenotypes of interest. We suggest that continuing to develop improved behavioral paradigms and finer-scale experimental data, for instance from individual neuronal subtypes or cell-type-specific expression data, is likely to improve our understanding of the genetic etiology and underlying functional changes in anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Human childhood is characterized by dramatic changes in the mind and brain. However, little is known about the large-scale intrinsic cortical network changes that occur during childhood due to methodological challenges in scanning young children. Here, we overcome this barrier by using sophisticated acquisition and analysis tools to investigate functional network development in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years (n = 92). At multiple spatial scales, age is positively associated with brain network segregation. At the system level, age was associated with segregation of systems involved in attention from those involved in abstract cognition, and with integration among attentional and perceptual systems. Associations between age and functional connectivity are most pronounced in visual and medial prefrontal cortex, the two ends of a gradient from perceptual, externally oriented cortex to abstract, internally oriented cortex. These findings suggest that both ends of the sensory-association gradient may develop early, in contrast to the classical theories that cortical maturation proceeds from back to front, with sensory areas developing first and association areas developing last. More mature patterns of brain network architecture, controlling for age, were associated with better visuospatial reasoning abilities. Our results suggest that as cortical architecture becomes more specialized, children become more able to reason about the world and their place in it.\n\nSignificanceAnthropologists have called the transition from early to middle childhood the \"age of reason\", when children across cultures become more independent. We employ cutting-edge neuroimaging acquisition and analysis approaches to investigate associations between age and functional brain architecture in childhood. Age was positively associated with segregation between cortical systems that process the external world, and those that process abstract phenomena like the past, future, and minds of others. Surprisingly, we observed pronounced development at both ends of the sensory-association gradient, challenging the theory that sensory areas develop first and association areas develop last. Our results open new directions for research into how brains reorganize to support rapid gains in cognitive and socioemotional skills as children reach the age of reason.",

    "abstract": "The envelope stress response (ESR) of Gram-negative enteric bacteria senses fluctuations in nutrient availability and environmental changes to avert damage and promote survival. It has a protective role towards antimicrobials but direct interactions between ESR components and antibiotic resistance genes have not been demonstrated. Here we report specific interactions between the two-component conjugative pilus expression (Cpx)RA signal transduction system and the recently described mobile colistin resistance (MCR-1) protein. Purified MCR-1 is specifically cleaved by the serine endoprotease DegP within a structurally conserved periplasmic bridging domain. Cleavage-site mutations in MCR-1 render derivatives either protease-resistant or degradation-susceptible with widely differing consequences for colistin resistance. Transfer of the degradation-susceptible mutant to strains that lack either DegP or its regulator CpxRA restores expression and colistin resistance. MCR-1 production in Escherichia coli induces a Cpx-dependent ESR and imposes growth restriction in strains lacking either DegP or CpxRA, effects that are reversed by transactive expression of DegP. MCR-1 production impairs bacterial motility indicating dissipation of cytoplasmic transmembrane potential. Indeed, growth in media with low pH dramatically increases both MCR-1-dependent phosphoethanolamine (PEA) modification of lipid A as well as colistin-resistance activity. In vitro transferase- and lipid A reconstitution-assays demonstrate that MCR-1 is highly active at acidic pH. Acquiring MCR-1 also renders strains more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. Thus, a conserved motif within MCR-1 induces components of the ESR to confer resilience to stimuili commonly encountered in the environment such as to changes in pH and towards antimicrobial peptides. Excipient allosteric activation of the DegP protease specifically inhibits growth of isolates carrying mcr-1 plasmids indicating that a targeted strategy can lead to the elimination of transferable colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune disorders like type 1 diabetes (T1D) are complex diseases caused by numerous factors including both genetic variance and environmental influences. Two such exogenous factors, intestinal microbial composition and enterovirus infection, have been independently associated with T1D onset in both humans and animal models. Since environmental factors rarely work in isolation, we examined the cross-talk between the microbiome and Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), an enterovirus that accelerates T1D onset in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We demonstrate that CVB4-infection induced restructuring of the intestinal microbiome prior to T1D onset that was associated with thinning of the mucosal barrier, bacterial translocation to the pancreatic lymph node, and increased detection of circulating and intestinal commensal-reactive antibodies. Notably, the CVB4-induced change in community composition was strikingly similar to that of uninfected NOD mice that spontaneously developed diabetes, thus implying a mutual \"diabetogenic\" microbiome. Furthermore, fecal microbiome transfer (FMT) of the diabetogenic microbiota from CVB4-infected mice was sufficient to enhance T1D susceptibility in naive NOD recipients. These findings support a model whereby CVB infection disrupts the microbiome and intestinal homeostasis in a way that promotes activation of autoreactive immune cells and T1D.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear envelope (NE) is important in maintaining genome organization. The role of lipids in the communication between the NE and telomere silencing was investigated, including how changes in lipid composition impact gene expression and overall nuclear architecture. For this purpose, yeast cells were treated with the non-metabolizable lysophosphatidylcholine analog edelfosine, known to accumulate at the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum. Edelfosine treatment induced NE deformation and disrupted telomere clustering but not anchoring. In addition, the association of Sir4 at telomeres measured by ChIP decreased. RNA-seq analysis showed altered expression of Sir-dependent genes located at sub-telomeric (0-10 kb) regions, which was consistent with Sir4 dispersion. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that two lipid metabolic circuits were activated in response to edelfosine, one mediated by the membrane sensing transcription factors, Spt23/Mga2, and the other by a transcriptional repressor, Opi1. Activation of these combined transcriptional programs resulted in higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids and the formation of nuclear lipid droplets. Interestingly, cells lacking Sir proteins displayed resistance to unsaturated fatty acids and edelfosine, and this phenotype was connected to Rap1.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=65 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499406v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a46borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a7f44org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95ceforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b4678c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SummaryThe nuclear envelope (NE) is important for nuclear organization.

As DNA-based Cas9 nuclease delivery is preferable because of its low cost and higher stability, effective vector-based CRISPR/Cas9 administration is urgently needed. Here, we used the multicellular organism Caenorhabditis elegans to optimize the polymer-mediated DNA delivery system to generate mutants with CRISPR/Cas9. Toward this end, the cationically quaternized polymer of POEGMA-b-P4VP (POEGMA-b-QP4VP) as a carrier of CRISPR/Cas9 components was first synthesized, followed by the formation of plasmid DNA-polymer complex called polyplexes. 1H NMR, Zeta-Sizer, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis, and gel retardation experiments confirmed the polyplexes formation, including pRF4 (Roller) and sgRNA dpy-10, which were then incubated with C. elegans. The polymer-mediated delivery system facilitated the generation of transgenic Roller animals and heritable Dumpy mutants with CRISPR/Cas9. Our study for the first time demonstrated optimized administration of CRISPR/Cas 9 components to C. elegans.",

Both genetic and epigenetic information are vital to our understanding of biology and disease states. Most DNA sequencing approaches address either genetics or epigenetics and thus capture incomplete information. Methods widely used to detect epigenetic DNA bases typically fail to capture common C-to-T mutations or distinguish 5mC from 5hmC. Here, we present a single-base-resolution sequencing methodology that will simultaneously sequence complete genetics and complete epigenetics in a single workflow. The approach is non-destructive to DNA and provides a digital readout of bases, which we exemplify by simultaneous sequencing of G, C, T, A, 5mC and 5hmC; 6-Letter sequencing. We demonstrate sequencing of human genomic DNA and also cell-free DNA taken from a blood sample of a cancer patient. The approach is accurate, requires low DNA input and has a simple workflow and analysis pipeline. We envisage it will be versatile across many applications in life sciences.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImportant regulation occurs at the level of transcription in Plasmodium falciparum and growing evidence suggests that these apicomplexan parasites have complex regulatory networks. Recent studies implicate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as transcriptional regulators in P. falciparum. However, due to limited research and the lack of necessary experimental tools, our understanding of their role in the malaria-causing parasite remains largely unelucidated. In this work, we address one of these limitations, the lack of an updated and improved lncRNA annotation in P. falciparum.\n\nResultsWe generated long-read RNA sequencing data and integrated information extracted and curated from multiple sources to manually annotate lncRNAs. We identified 1522 novel lncRNAs and validated and refined 847 existing annotations. Utilising the collated datasets, we generated evidence-based ranking scores for each annotation and characterised the distinct genomic contexts and features of P. falciparum lncRNAs. Certain features indicated subsets with potential biological significance such as 25 lncRNAs containing multiple introns, 335 lncRNAs lacking mutations in piggyBac mutagenic studies and lncRNAs associated with specific biologic processes including two new types of lncRNAs found proximal to var genes.\n\nConclusionsThe insights and the annotation presented in this study will serve as valuable tools for researchers seeking to understand the role of lncRNAs in parasite biology through both bioinformatics and experimental approaches.",

    "abstract": "Translation termination requires release factors that read a STOP codon in the decoding center and subsequently facilitate the hydrolysis of the nascent peptide chain from the peptidyl tRNA within the ribosome. In human mitochondria eleven open reading frames terminate in the standard UAA or UAG STOP codon, which can be recognized by mtRF1a, the proposed major mitochondrial release factor. However, two transcripts encoding for COX1 and ND6 terminate in the non-conventional AGA or AGG codon, respectively. How translation termination is achieved in these two cases is not known. We solve this long-standing open question by showing that the non-canonical release factor mtRF1 is a specialized release factor that triggers COX1 translation termination, while mtRF1a terminates the majority of other mitochondrial translation events including the non-canonical ND6. Loss of mtRF1 leads to isolated COX deficiency and activates the mitochondrial ribosome-associated quality control accompanied by the degradation of COX1 mRNA to prevent an overload of the ribosome rescue system. Taken together, these results establish the role of mtRF1 in mitochondrial translation, which had been a mystery for almost 25 years, and lead to a comprehensive picture of translation termination in human mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the neurons, glial cells, and other somatic cells. Although CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC have been identified in most East Asian patients with NIID, the pathophysiology of NIID remains unclear. Intranuclear inclusions are the pathological hallmark of NIID. Previously, immunohistochemistry has revealed that intranuclear inclusions are ubiquitin-, p62-, and SUMO-1-positive, suggesting the possible alteration of the ubiquitin-proteasomal protein degradation system in the nuclei with inclusions. However, the molecular mechanisms within these nuclei remain unclear. Herein, we analyzed the proteomic profile of nuclei with p62-positive inclusions in NIID with CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC to discover the proteins involved in the NIID pathophysiology. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify each protein identified in the nuclei with p62-positive inclusions. The distribution of increased proteins in the autopsy brain samples from three NIID patients was confirmed via immunofluorescence. Overall, 526 proteins were identified, of which 243 were consistently quantified using MS. A 1.4-fold increase was consistently observed for 20 proteins in nuclei with p62-positive inclusions compared to those without. Fifteen proteins identified with medium or high confidence in the LC-MS/MS analysis were further evaluated. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed enrichment of several terms, including poly(A) RNA binding, nucleosomal DNA binding, and protein binding. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the fluorescent intensities of increased RNA-binding proteins identified by proteomic analysis, namely hnRNP A3, hnRNP A2/B1, and hnRNP C1/C2, were higher in the nuclei with p62-positive inclusions than those without; however, they were not confined to the intranuclear inclusions. We identified several increased proteins in nuclei with p62-positive inclusions. These data can form the basis for understanding the pathophysiology of NIID.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation requires substantial metabolic energy in form of ATP, as well as low-potential electrons that must derive from central metabolism. During aerobic growth, the free-living soil diazotroph Azotobacter vinelandii transfers electrons from the key metabolite NADH to the low-potential ferredoxin FdxA that serves as a direct electron donor to the dinitrogenase reductases. This process is mediated by the RNF complex that exploits the proton motive force over the cytoplasmic membrane to lower the midpoint potential of the transferred electron. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the nitrogenase-associated RNF complex of A. vinelandii, a seven-subunit membrane protein assembly that contains four flavin cofactors and six iron-sulfur centers. Its function requires the strict coupling of electron and proton transfer but also involves major conformational changes within the assembly that can be traced with a combination of electron microscopy and modeling.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryBiological nitrogen fixation requires electrons with a negative redox potential, and the diazotroph Azotobacter vinelandii can provide these through the evolutionarily ancient RNF complex that bridges the energy difference between NADH and a low-potential ferredoxin by exploiting the transmembrane proton gradient.",

However, despite various known biological activities and therapeutic potential, the low abundance of flavonoids in nature limits their development for industrial applications. In this study, we aimed to enhance flavonoid production by silencing cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), an enzyme involved in the branch point of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) approach. We designed three sgRNAs targeting the promoter region of NtC4H and cloned them into a CRISPRi construct. After introducing into Nicotiana tabacum cell suspension culture, the transformed cells were sampled for qPCR and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Sixteen of 21 cell lines showed PCR-positive, confirming the presence of CRISPRi transgene. The NtC4H transcript in the transgenic cells was 0.44-fold lower than in the wild-type. In contrast, the flavonoid-related genes at the other branching pathway, such as Nt4CL and NtCHS, in the C4H-silenced cells showed a higher expression than wild-type. The upregulation of these genes increased their respective products, including pinostrobin, naringenin, and chlorogenic acid.

    "abstract": "PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE (PKS) proteins are involved in light-regulated growth orientation responses. They act downstream of phytochromes to control hypocotyl gravitropism in the light and act early in phototropin signaling. Despite their importance for plant development, little is known about their molecular mode of action except that they belong to a protein complex comprising the phototropins at the plasma membrane. Identifying evolutionarily conservation is one approach to reveal biologically important protein motifs. Here, we show that PKS sequences are restricted to seed plants and that these proteins share 6 motifs (A to F from the N- to the C-terminus). While motif D is also found in BIG GRAIN proteins the remining domains are PKS specific. We provide evidence that motif C is S-acylated on highly conserved cysteines, which mediates PKS protein association with the plasma membrane. This motif is also required for PKS4-mediated phototropism and control of hypocotyl gravitropism in the light. Finally, our data suggests that the mode of PKS4 plasma membrane association is important for its biological activity. Our work identifies the mode of plasma membrane association of PKS proteins and strongly suggests that this is their site of action to modulate environmentally regulated organ positioning.",

We propose a novel methodology to quantify DNA using Sanger sequencing, that we validated experimentally with specially-engineered plasmids both in vitro and in co-transformed E. coli by and assessing our predictions with qPCR and fluorescence quantifications. The method relies on the alignment of the electropherograms from the query and reference samples, where we quantify the DNA concentration from the amplitude ratio of aligned electropherogram peaks.

    "abstract": "Latent Interacting Variable Effects (LIVE) modeling is a framework to integrate different types of microbiome multi-omics data by combining latent variables from single-omic models into a structured meta-model to determine discriminative, interacting multi-omics features driving disease status. We implemented and tested LIVE modeling in publicly available metagenomics and metabolomics datasets from Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis patients. Here, LIVE modeling reduced the number of feature correlations from the original data set for CD and UC to tractable numbers and facilitated prioritization of biological associations between microbes, metabolites, enzymes and IBD status through the application of stringent thresholds on generated inferential statistics. We determined LIVE modeling confirmed previously reported IBD biomarkers and uncovered potentially novel disease mechanisms in IBD. LIVE modeling makes a distinct and complementary contribution to the current methods to integrate microbiome data to predict IBD status because of its flexibility to adapt to different types of microbiome multi-omics data, scalability for large and small cohort studies via reliance on latent variables and dimensionality reduction, and the intuitive interpretability of the linear meta-model integrating -omic data types. The results of LIVE modeling and the biological relationships can be represented in networks that connect local correlation structure of single omic data types with global community and omic structure in the latent variable VIP scores. This model arises as novel tool that allows researchers to be more selective about omic feature interaction without disrupting the structural correlation framework provided by sPLS-DA interaction effects modeling. It will lead to form testable hypothesis by identifying potential and unique interactions between metabolome and microbiome that must be considered for future studies.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLatent Interacting Variable Effects (LIVE) modeling integrates microbiome multiomics features by encoding them in a set of latent variables (LVs) from single-omic sparse Partial Lease Squares models, and then combine these LVs into structured metamodel to determine the most discriminative features driving IBD.

    "abstract": "Widespread shutoff of host gene expression through RNA degradation is an advantageous way for many viruses to block antiviral responses. However, viruses still need to maintain expression of their own genes and host genes necessary for replication. The influenza A virus host shutoff endoribonuclease PA-X solves this problem by sparing viral mRNAs and some host RNAs. To understand how PA-X distinguishes between RNAs, we characterized PA-X cut sites transcriptome-wide. This analysis shows that PA-Xs from multiple influenza strains cleave RNAs at GCUG tetramers in hairpin loops. Importantly, GCUG tetramers are enriched in the human but not the influenza transcriptome. Moreover, optimal PA-X cut sites inserted in the influenza A virus genome are quickly selected against during viral replication. This finding suggests that PA-X evolved these cleavage characteristics to target host but not viral mRNAs, in a manner reminiscent of cellular self vs. non-self discrimination.",

    "abstract": "The divergence of sister orders, Trichoptera (caddisflies) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), from a silk-spinning ancestor occurred around 290 million years ago. Trichoptera larvae are mainly aquatic and Lepidoptera larvae are almost entirely terrestrial, distinct habitats that required molecular adaptation of their silk for deployment in water versus air. The major protein components of their silks are Heavy chain and Light chain fibroins. In an effort to identify molecular changes in L-fibroins that may have contributed to the divergent use of silk in water versus air, we used the ColabFold implementation of AlphaFold2 to predict three-dimensional structures of L-fibroins from both orders. Comparison of the structures revealed that despite the ancient divergence, profoundly different habitats, and low sequence conservation, a 10-helix core structure was strongly conserved in L-fibroins from both orders. Previously known intra- and intermolecular disulfide linkages were accurately predicted. Structure variations observed outside of the core may represent molecular changes that contributed to the evolution of silks adapted to water or air. The distributions of electrostatic potential, for example, are not conserved and present distinct order-specific surfaces for potential interactions with or modulation by external factors. Also, the interactions of L-fibroins with the H-fibroin C-termini are different between the orders; lepidopteran L-fibroins have N-terminal insertions, not present in trichopteran L-fibroins, which form an unstructured ribbon in isolation but become part of an intermolecular {beta}-sheet when folded with their corresponding H-fibroin C-termini. The results may serve as another example of protein structure prediction from deep sequence data of understudied proteins made possible by AlphaFold2.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for population-level surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is gaining significant traction, but the impact of wastewater sampling methods on results is unclear. In this study we characterised taxonomic and resistome differences between single-timepoint-grab and 24H-composites of wastewater influent from a large UK-based wastewater treatment work (WWTW [population equivalent:223,435]).\n\nWe autosampled hourly influent grab samples (n=72) over three consecutive weekdays, and prepared additional 24H-composites (n=3) from respective grabs. For taxonomic profiling, metagenomic DNA was extracted from all samples and 16S-rRNA gene sequenced. One composite and six grabs from day one underwent metagenomic sequencing for metagenomic dissimilarity estimation and resistome profiling.\n\nTaxonomic abundances of phyla varied significantly across hourly grab samples but followed a repeating diurnal pattern for all three days. Hierarchical clustering grouped grab samples into four time periods dissimilar in both 16S rRNA gene-based profiles and metagenomic distances. 24H-composites resembled mean daily phyla abundances and showed low variability of taxonomic profiles. Of the 122 AMR gene families (AGFs) identified across all day one samples, single grab samples identified a median of 6 (IQR:5-8) AGFs not seen in the composite. However, 36/36 of these hits were at lateral coverage <0.5 (median:0.19; IQR:0.16-0.22) and potential false positives. Conversely, the 24H-composite identified three AGFs not seen in any grab with higher lateral coverage (0.82; 0.55-0.84). Additionally, several clinically significant human AGFs (blaVIM, blaIMP, blaKPC) were intermittently or completely missed by grab sampling but captured by the 24H-composite.\n\nWastewater influent undergoes significant taxonomic and resistome changes on short timescales potentially affecting interpretation of results based on sampling strategy. Grab samples are more convenient and potentially capture low-prevalence/transient targets but are less comprehensive and temporally variable. Therefore, we recommend 24H-composite sampling where feasible. Further validation and optimisation of WBE methods is vital for its development into a robust AMR surveillance approach.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInfluent undergoes significant taxonomic/resistome changes over short timescales.\nC_LIO_LITaxonomic abundances fluctuate diurnally but repeat for the 3 weekdays sampled.\nC_LIO_LIDetection of less prevalent AMR determinants is time-dependent for grab sampling.\nC_LIO_LISingle timepoint grab samples may produce temporally variable metagenomic profiles.\nC_LIO_LI24H-composites reflect mean daily taxa and more reliably captured AMR determinants.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidases constitute a class of non-classical serine proteases that regulate an array of biological functions, making them pharmacologically attractive enzymes. With this work, we identified and characterized a dipeptidyl peptidase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtDPP) displaying a strong preference for proline residues at the P1 substrate position and an unexpectedly high thermal stability. MtDPP was also characterized with alanine replacements of residues of its active site that yielded, for the most part, loss of catalysis. We show that MtDPP catalytic activity is inhibited by well-known human DPP4 inhibitors. Using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry we also describe that in vitro, MtDPP mediates the truncation of the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, indicating a plausible role in immune modulation for this mycobacterial enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Chloride is an essential anion for all forms of life. Beyond electrolyte balance, an increasing body of evidence points to new roles for chloride in normal physiology and disease. Over the last two decades, this understanding has been advanced by chloride-sensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging applications in living cells. To our surprise, these sensors have been primarily engineered from the green fluorescent protein (GFP) found in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. However, the GFP family has a rich sequence space that could already encode for new sensors with desired properties, thereby minimizing protein engineering efforts and accelerating biological applications. To efficiently sample this space, we present and validate a stepwise bioinformatics strategy focused first on the chloride binding pocket and second on a monomeric oligomerization state. Using this, we identified GFPxm163 from GFPxm found in the jellyfish Aequorea macrodactyla. In vitro characterization shows that the binding of chloride as well as bromide, iodide, and nitrate rapidly tunes the ground state chromophore equilibrium from the phenolate to the phenol state generating a pH-dependent, turn-off fluorescence response. Furthermore, live-cell fluorescence microscopy reveals that GFPxm163 provides a reversible, yet indirect readout of chloride transport via iodide exchange. With this demonstration, we anticipate that the paring of bioinformatics with protein engineering methods will provide an efficient methodology to discover and design new chloride-sensitive fluorescent proteins for cellular applications.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499230v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (68K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c0daaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14553cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@817107org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23a6ba_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
