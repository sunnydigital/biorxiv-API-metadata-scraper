    "abstract": "RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcribes a variety of noncoding RNAs, including transfer RNA (tRNA) and the B2 family of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). B2 SINEs are noncoding retrotransposons that possess tRNA-like promoters and are normally silenced in healthy somatic tissue. Infection with the murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68 induces transcription of both SINEs and tRNAs, in part through the activity of the viral protein kinase encoded by ORF36. Here, we identify the conserved MHV68 tegument protein ORF45 as an additional activator of these RNAPIII loci. MHV68 ORF45 and ORF36 form a complex, resulting in an additive induction RNAPIII and increased ORF45 expression. ORF45-induced RNAPIII transcription is dependent on its activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which in turn increases the abundance of the RNAPIII transcription factor Brf1. Other viral and non-viral activators of MAPK/ERK signaling also increase the levels of Brf1 protein, B2 SINE RNA and tRNA, suggesting that this is a common strategy to increase RNAPIII activity.\n\nImportanceGammaherpesviral infection alters the gene expression landscape of a host cell, including through induction of non-coding RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII). Among these are a class of repetitive genes known as retrotransposons, which are normally silenced elements that can copy and spread throughout the genome, and transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are fundamental components of protein translation machinery. How these loci are activated during infection is not well understood. Here, we identify ORF45 from the model murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68 as a novel activator of RNAPIII transcription. To do so, it engages the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is a central regulator of cellular response to environmental stimuli. Activation of this pathway leads to upregulation of a key factor required for RNAPIII activity, Brf1. These findings expand our understanding of the regulation and dysregulation of RNAPIII transcription and highlight how viral co-option of key signaling pathways can impact host gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is abundant in the healthy human intestinal microbiota, and the absence or scarcity of this bacterium has been linked with inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders. F. prausnitzii thus shows promise as a next-generation probiotic for use in restoring the balance of the gut microbial flora and, due to its strong anti-inflammatory properties, for the treatment of certain pathological conditions. However, very little information is available about gene function and regulation in this species. Here, we utilized a systems biology approach - weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) - to analyze gene expression in three publicly available RNAseq datasets from F. prausnitzii strain A2-165, all obtained in different laboratory conditions. The co-expression network was then subdivided into 24 co-expression gene modules. A subsequent enrichment analysis revealed that these modules are associated with different kinds of biological processes, such as arginine, histidine, cobalamin, or fatty acid metabolism as well as bacteriophage function, molecular chaperones, stress response, or SOS response. Some genes appeared to be associated with mechanisms of protection against oxidative stress and could be essential for F. prausnitziis adaptation and survival under anaerobic laboratory conditions. Hub and bottleneck genes were identified by analyses of intramodular connectivity and betweenness, respectively; this highlighted the high connectivity of genes located on mobile genetic elements, which could promote the genetic evolution of F. prausnitzii within its ecological niche. This study provides the first exploration of the complex regulatory networks in F. prausnitzii, and all of the \"omics\" data are available online for exploration through a graphical interface at https://feaprau.omics.ovh/.",

    "abstract": "Microbial sensors play an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Our knowledge is limited on how microbial sensing helps in differential immune response and its link to inflammatory diseases. Recently, we have shown that cytosolic sensor ELMO1 (Engulfment and Cell Motility Protein-1) binds to effectors from pathogenic bacteria and controls intestinal inflammation. Here, we show that ELMO1 interacts with another sensor, NOD2 (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2), that recognizes bacterial cell wall component muramyl dipeptide (MDP). The polymorphism of NOD2 is linked to Crohns disease (CD) pathogenesis. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of ELMO1 and mutant NOD2 (L1007fs) were not able to clear the CD-associated adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC-LF82). To understand the interplay of microbial sensing of ELMO1-NOD2 in epithelial cells and macrophages, we used enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) from ELMO1 and NOD2 KO mice and ELMO1 and NOD2-depleted murine macrophage cell lines. The infection of murine EDMs with AIEC-LF82 showed higher bacterial load in ELMO1-KO, NOD2 KO EDMs, and ELMO1 KO EDMs treated with NOD2 inhibitors. The murine macrophage cells showed that the downregulation of ELMO1 and NOD2 is associated with impaired bacterial clearance that is linked to reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Our results indicated that the crosstalk between microbial sensors in enteric infection and inflammatory diseases impacts the fate of the bacterial load and disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The localization of RNAs in cells is critical for many cellular processes. Whereas motor-driven transport of RNP condensates plays a prominent role in RNA localization in cells, their studies remain limited by the scarcity of available tools allowing to manipulate condensates in a spatial manner. To fill this gap, we reconstitute in cellula a minimal RNP transport system based on bioengineered condensates which were functionalized with kinesins and dynein-like motors, allowing for their positioning at either the cell periphery or centrosomes. This targeting mostly occurs through the active transport of the condensate scaffolds, which leads to localized nucleation of phase-separated condensates. Then, programming the condensates to recruit specific mRNAs is able to shift the localization of these mRNAs towards the cell periphery or the centrosomes. Our method opens novel perspectives to examine the role of RNA localization as a driver of cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF{beta}) is released from cells as part of a trimeric latent complex consisting of TGF{beta}, the TGF{beta} propeptides, and either a latent TGF{beta} binding protein (LTBP) or glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant (GARP) protein. LTBP1 and 3 modulate latent TGF{beta} function with respect to secretion, matrix localization, and activation and, therefore, are vital for the proper function of the cytokine in a number of tissues. TGF{beta} modulates stem cell differentiation into adipocytes (adipogenesis), but the potential role of LTBPs in this process has not been studied. We observed that 72 h post adipogenesis initiation Ltbp1, 2, and 4 expression levels decrease by 74-84%, whereas Ltbp3 expression levels remain constant during adipogenesis. We found that LTBP3 silencing in C3H/10T1/2 cells reduced adipogenesis, as measured by the percentage of cells with lipid vesicles and the expression of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}). Lentiviral mediated expression of an Ltbp3 mRNA resistant to siRNA targeting rescued the phenotype, validating siRNA specificity. Knockdown (KD) of Ltbp3 expression in 3T3-L1, M2, and primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) indicated a similar requirement for Ltbp3. Epididymal and inguinal white adipose tissue fat pad weights of Ltbp3-/- mice were reduced by 62% and 57%, respectively, compared to wild-type mice. Inhibition of adipogenic differentiation upon LTBP3 loss is mediated by TGF{beta}, as TGF{beta} neutralizing antibody and TGF{beta} receptor I kinase blockade rescue the LTBP3 KD phenotype. These results indicate that LTBP3 has a TGF{beta}-dependent function in adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nSignificanceUnderstanding the control of mesenchymal stem cell fate is crucial for the potential use of these cells for regenerative medicine.\n\nHighlightsO_LILatent TGF{beta} binding protein 3 (LTBP3) is required for adipogenesis\nC_LIO_LILTBP3 mediates TGF{beta} levels in adipogenesis\nC_LIO_LILoss of LTBP3 results in enhanced rather than decreased levels of active TGF{beta}\nC_LI",

Mitochondria are responsible for the production of energy and for essential metabolic pathways in the cell, as well as fundamental processes such as apoptosis and aging. Here we show that functional mitochondria, isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae release vesicles, independent of the fission machinery. We were then able for the first time to isolate these Mitochondrial Derived Vesicles (MDVs) and found that they are relatively uniform in size, of about 100nm and carry selective protein cargo including enrichment of ATP synthase subunits. Remarkably, we further found that these MDVs harbor a functional ATP synthase complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that these vesicles have a membrane potential, produce ATP, and seem to fuse with naive mitochondria. Our findings reveal a possible delivery mechanism of ATP producing vesicles, which can potentially regenerate ATP deficient mitochondria and may participate in organelle to organelle communication.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol abuse and dependence have a substantial heritable component. Although the genome has been considered the sole vehicle of heritable phenotypes, recent studies suggest that drug or alcohol exposure may induce alterations in gene expression that are transmitted across generations. Still, the transgenerational impact of alcohol use (and abuse) remains largely unexplored in part because multigenerational studies using rodent models present challenges for time, sample size, and genetic heterogeneity. Here, we took advantage of the extremely short generation time, large broods, and clonal form of reproduction of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We developed a model of preconception parental alcohol exposure to test alterations in behavioral responses to acute alcohol treatment (intoxication) in subsequent F1, F2 and F3 generations. We found that a chronic alcohol-treatment paradigm in the parental generation resulted in alcohol-naive F3 progeny displaying moderate resistance to intoxication. To compare the treatment duration and timing on this transgenerational effect, we repeated the study using an intermittent treatment paradigm. We found that intermittent treatment resulted in alcohol-naive F3 progeny displaying moderate hypersensitivity to intoxication. Further study of this phenomena using this new C. elegans model may yield mechanistic insights into how transgenerational effects may occur in other animals.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae) is an annual flowering herb of Eurasian origin that has been associated with humans for over 26,000 years. Multiple independent domestications occurred with different events leading to use as food, fiber, and medicine, with human intervention likely accelerating a division in the genus with varietals broadly known today as either hemp-type or drug-type. Using publicly available sequence data, we assessed genome wide diversity and population relationships across seven independently developed datasets. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted, with data sources providing a unique sampling of Cannabis varieties, with landrace and modern cultivars represented. Comparing nucleotide diversity over chromosomal length in landrace and domesticated modern drug-type varieties, genomic regions with decreased diversity where humans may have selected for specific traits were identified. Population structure was evident based on use type. Evidence of hybridization was extensive across the datasets. In a subset of landrace individuals where geographic origin was known, population separation was observed between varieties collected from Northern India in the Hindu Kush Mountains and Myanmar. The use of publicly available data provides an initial impression of the complexity within the Cannabis genus and adds to our understanding of the genetics underlying evolutionary history and population stratification, which will be critical for future crop improvement for any potential human use.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenerating the most contiguous, accurate genome assemblies given available sequencing technologies is a long-standing challenge in genome science. With the rise of long-read sequencing, assembly challenges have shifted from merely increasing contiguity to correctly assembling complex, repetitive regions of interest, ideally in a phased manner. At present, researchers largely choose between two types of long read data: longer, but less accurate sequences, or highly accurate, but shorter reads (i.e., >Q20 or 99% accurate). To better understand how these types of long-read data as well as scale of data (i.e., mean length and sequencing depth) influence genome assembly outcomes, we compared genome assemblies for a caddisfly, Hesperophylax magnus, generated with longer, but less accurate, Oxford Nanopore (ONT) R9.4.1 and highly accurate PacBio HiFi (HiFi) data. Next, we expanded this comparison to consider the influence of highly accurate long-read sequence data on genome assemblies across 6,750 plant and animal genomes. For this broader comparison, we used HiFi data as a surrogate for highly accurate long-reads broadly as we could identify when they were used from GenBank metadata.\n\nResultsHiFi reads outperformed ONT reads in all assembly metrics tested for the caddisfly data set and allowed for accurate assembly of the repetitive [~]20 Kb H-fibroin gene. Across plants and animals, genome assemblies that incorporated HiFi reads were also more contiguous. For plants, the average HiFi assembly was 501% more contiguous (mean contig N50 = 20.5 Mb) than those generated with any other long-read data (mean contig N50 = 4.1 Mb). For animals, HiFi assemblies were 226% more contiguous (mean contig N50 = 20.9 Mb) versus other long-read assemblies (mean contig N50 = 9.3 Mb). In plants, we also found limited evidence that HiFi may offer a unique solution for overcoming genomic complexity that scales with assembly size.\n\nConclusionsHighly accurate long-reads generated with HiFi or analogous technologies represent a key tool for maximizing genome assembly quality for a wide swath of plants and animals. This finding is particularly important when resources only allow for one type of sequencing data to be generated. Ultimately, to realize the promise of biodiversity genomics, we call for greater uptake of highly accurate long-reads in future studies.",

Moreover, the prevalence of NAFLD not only increases the demand for liver transplantation, but also limits the supply of suitable donor organs because steatosis predisposes grafts to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). There are currently no pharmacological interventions to limit hepatic IR injury because the mechanisms by which steatosis leads to increased injury are unclear. To identify potential novel mediators of IR injury, we used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to assess temporal changes in the hepatic lipidome in steatotic and non-steatotic livers after warm IRI in mice. Our untargeted analyses revealed distinct differences between the steatotic and non-steatotic response to IRI and highlighted dynamic changes in lipid composition with marked changes in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. These findings enhance our knowledge of the lipidomic changes that occur following IRI and provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying such changes will lead to novel therapeutic strategies to combat IR injury.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease prevalent in North America, Europe, and Asia. Dissemination of vector-borne pathogens, such as Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), results in infection of distant tissues and is the main contributor to poor outcomes. Despite the accumulated knowledge from epidemiological, in vitro, and in animal studies, the understanding of dissemination remains incomplete with several important knowledge gaps, especially related to invasion and intravasation at the site of a tick bite, which cannot be readily studied in animal models or humans. To elucidate the mechanistic details of these processes we developed a tissue-engineered human dermal microvessel model. Fluorescently-labeled Bb (B31 strain) were injected into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the model to mimic tick inoculation. High resolution, confocal imaging was performed to visualize Bb migration in the ECM and intravasation into circulation. From analysis of migration paths we found no evidence to support adhesin-mediated interactions between Bb and components of the ECM or basement membrane, suggesting that collagen fibers serve as inert obstacles to migration. Transendothelial migration occurred at cell-cell junctions and was relatively fast, consistent with Bb swimming in ECM. In addition, we found that Bb alone can induce endothelium activation, resulting in increased immune cell adhesion but no changes in global or local permeability. Together these results provide new insight into the minimum requirements for dissemination of Bb at the site of a tick bite, and highlight how tissue-engineered models are complementary to animal models in visualizing dynamic processes associated with vector-borne pathogens.\n\nSignificance StatementUsing a tissue-engineered human dermal microvessel model we reveal new insight into the invasion and intravasation of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), a causative agent of Lyme disease in North America, following a tick bite. These results show how tissue-engineered models enable imaging of dynamic processes that are challenging in animal models or human subjects.",

While there are medications to control blood glucose in type 2 diabetics, currently there are no interventions prescribed for pre diabetes. Alternate strategies to control blood glucose are needed either to act alone in pre diabetes or as supplement to the existing drugs for type 2 diabetes. We report here the targeting of critical molecular steps in muscle glucose uptake and metabolism to result in glucose lowering using a combination of safe vitamins. Our in vitro and in vivo data support the potential for using such vitamin combination for glucose control in pre diabetes and as a supplement in type 2 diabetics.",

    "abstract": "Land plants and microalgae convert solar energy into electrochemical energy by using cooperative two photosystems (PSI and PSII). To maintain optimal photosynthetic rates under variable light conditions in nature, phosphorylation of light-harvesting complex for PSII (LHCII) balances the excitation energy distribution between the two photosystems. Here, we investigated the mechanism of this balancing in a green alga. We show that phospho-LHCIIs physically bind to both photosystems. The energy transfer from the LHCIIs to the PSII core complexes becomes less efficient, whereas the excitation level of PSI increases. The time-resolved fluorescence spectra showed an increase in delayed PSI fluorescence, which represents energetical spillover from PSII to PSI. In addition, the spillover is likely mediated by phospho-LHCIIs and PSI antennas. We hypothesize that the spillover explains the larger extent of phospho-LHCIIs dependent energy balancing in the green alga than land plants, which is important for the short-term photoadaptaion in the algal habitat.",

Here, the non-pathogenic soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida was adopted as a platform for synthetic formate assimilation. The metabolism of genome-reduced variants of P. putida was rewired to establish synthetic auxotrophies that could be functionally complemented by expressing components of the reductive glycine (rGly) pathway. The rGly pathway mediates the formate [-&gt;] glycine [-&gt;] serine transformations that yield pyruvate, ultimately assimilated into biomass. We adopted a modular engineering approach, dividing C1 assimilation in segments composed of both heterologous activities (sourced from Methylorubrum extorquens) and native reactions. Promoter engineering of chromosomally-encoded functions coupled to modular expression of rGly pathway elements enabled growth on formate as carbon source and acetate for energy supply. Adaptive laboratory evolution of two lineages of engineered P. putida formatotrophs significantly reduced doubling times to ca. 15 h. During evolution, two catabolic regimes became predominant in independently evolved clones, either via glycine hydroxymethylation (GlyA) or oxidation (ThiO). Taken together, our results expand the landscape of microbial platforms for C1-based biotechnological production towards supporting a formate bioeconomy.\n\nGO_SCPLOWRAPHICALC_SCPLOW AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOW\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=63 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499488v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b12edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a4eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc101aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a52d5a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cargo transport by molecular motors along microtubules is essential for the function of eucaryotic cells, in particular neurons in which axonal transport defects constitute the early pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Mainly studied in motor and sensory neurons, axonal transport is still difficult to characterize in neurons of the brain in absence of appropriate in vivo tools. Here, we measured fast axonal transport by tracing the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) nanocrystals endocytosed by brain neurons of zebrafish (Zf) larvae. Thanks to the optical translucency of Zf larvae and of the perfect photostability of nanoKTP SHG, we achieved a high scanning speed of 20 frames (of {approx} 90 mx60 m size) per second in Zf brain. We focused our study on endolysosomal vesicle transport in axons of known polarization, separately analyzing kinesin and dynein motor-driven displacements. To validate our assay, we used either loss-of-function mutations of dynein or kinesin 1 or the dynein inhibitor dynapyrazole, and quantified several transport parameters. We successfully demonstrated that dynapyrazole reduces nanoKTP mobile fraction and retrograde run length consistently, while the retrograde run length increased in kinesin 1 mutants. Taking advantage of nanoKTP SHG directional emission, we also quantified fluctuations of vesicle orientation. Thus, by combining endocytosis of nanocrystals having non-linear response, fast two-photon microscopy, and high-throughput analysis, we are able to finely monitor fast axonal transport in vivo in the brain of a vertebrate, and reveal subtle axonal transport alterations. The high spatiotemporal resolution achieved in our model may be relevant to precisely investigate axonal transport impairment associated to disease models.",

We reported that preventing addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) on the NaV1.7-interacting cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) blocked NaV1.7 functions and was antinociceptive in rodents. Here, we discovered a 15 amino acid CRMP2 regulatory sequence (CRS) unique to NaV1.7 that is essential for this regulatory coupling. CRMP2 preferentially bound to the NaV1.7 CRS over other isoforms. Substitution of the NaV1.7 CRS with the homologous domains from the other eight voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms decreased tetrodotoxin-sensitive NaV1.7 currents in rodent sensory neurons. A cell-penetrant version of NaV1.7-CRS reduced NaV1.7 currents and trafficking, decreased presynaptic NaV1.7 localization, reduced spinal neurotransmitter release, and reversed mechanical allodynia in a rat spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. Interfering with NaV1.7-CRMP2 coupling did not produce motor impairment and spared thermal, inflammatory, and post-surgical nociception. As proof-of-concept for NaV1.7-targeted gene therapy, we found that NaV1.7-CRS packaged into an adeno-associated virus recapitulated the effects on NaV1.7 function in both rodent and rhesus macaque sensory neurons and both reversed and prevented the development of mechanical allodynia in a neuropathic pain model in male and female rodents.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA novel regulatory domain on the voltage gated sodium channel NaV1.7 that can be targeted to produce analgesia.",

To understand this interplay at a tissue level, we generated a single-cell atlas of immune, glial and retinal pigment epithelial cells from adult mouse retina before and at multiple time points after axonal transection (optic nerve crush; ONC), identifying rare and undescribed subsets, and delineating changes in cell composition, expression programs, and interactions. Computational analysis charted an inflammatory cascade after injury with three phases. The early phase consisted of reactivation of retinal macroglia and microglia, providing chemotactic signals for immune infiltration, concurrent with infiltration of CCR2+ monocytes from the circulation. In the second phase, these differentiated to macrophage subsets resembling resident border-associated macrophages. In parallel, a multicellular interferon program, likely driven by microglia-derived type-I interferon, was synchronously activated across resident glia, expanding beyond rare interferon-responding subsets of glia unexpectedly present in the naive retina. Our findings provide insights regarding post-injury CNS tissue dynamics and a framework to decipher cellular circuitry, spatial relationships and molecular interactions following tissue injury.",

    "abstract": "Maternal pre-pregnancy (pregravid) obesity is associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and offspring. Amongst the complications for the offspring is increased susceptibility and severity of neonatal infections necessitating admission to the intensive care unit, notably bacterial sepsis and enterocolitis. Previous studies have reported aberrant responses to LPS and polyclonal stimulation by umbilical cord blood monocytes that were mediated by alterations in the epigenome. In this study, we show that pregravid obesity dysregulates umbilical cord blood monocyte responses to bacterial and viral pathogens. Specifically, interferon-stimulated gene expression and inflammatory responses to E. coli and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were significantly dampened. Although upstream signaling events were comparable, translocation of the key transcription factor NF-{kappa}B and chromatin accessibility at pro- inflammatory gene promoters following TLR stimulation was significantly attenuated. Using a rhesus macaque model of western style diet induced obesity, we further demonstrate that this defect is detected in fetal peripheral monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages during gestation. Collectively, these data indicate that maternal obesity and high-fat diet present metabolic, signaling, and epigenetic impediments to pathogen recognition in fetal innate immune cells that result in a state of immune paralysis during gestation and at birth.",

    "abstract": "Remdesivir is a leading therapy in patients with moderate to severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; the majority of whom are older individuals. Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that incorporates into nascent viral RNA, inhibiting RNA-directed RNA polymerases, including that of SARS-CoV-2. Less is known about remdesivirs effects on mitochondria, particularly in older adults where mitochondria are known to be dysfunctional. Furthermore, its effect on age-induced mitochondrial mutations and copy number has not been previously studied. We hypothesized that remdesivir adversely affects mtDNA copy number and deletion mutation frequency in aged rodents. To test this hypothesis, 30-month-old male F333BNF1 rats were treated with remdesivir for three months. To determine if remdesivir adversely affects mtDNA, we measured copy number and mtDNA deletion frequency in rat hearts, kidneys, and skeletal muscles using digital PCR. We found no effects from three months of remdesivir treatment on mtDNA copy number or deletion mutation frequency in 33-month-old rats. For the 33-month-old control rats, the average mtDNA copy number per nucleus was 2567, 1100, and 1869 for heart, kidney, and quadriceps, respectively. MtDNA deletion mutation frequency was 2.6x10-4, 1.6x10-4 and 4.7x10-3for heart, kidney, and quadriceps, respectively. These data support the notion that remdesivir does not compromise mtDNA quality or quantity at old age in mammals. Future work should focus on examining additional tissues such as brain and liver, and extend testing to human clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "The study of turbulence in physiologic blood flow is important due to its strong relevance to endothelial mechanobiology and vascular disease. Recently, Saqr et al (Sci Rep 10, 15492, 2020) discovered non-Kolmogorov turbulence in physiologic blood flow in vivo, traced its origins to the Navier-Stokes equation and demonstrated some of its properties using chaos and hydrodynamic-stability theories. The present work extends these findings and investigates some inherent characteristics of non-Kolmogorov turbulence in monoharmonic and multiharmonic pulsatile flow under ideal physiologic conditions. The purpose of this work is to propose a conjecture for the origins for picoNewton forces that are known to regulate endothelial cells functions. The new conjecture relates these forces to physiologic momentum-viscous interactions in the near-wall region of the flow. Here, we used high-resolution large eddy simulation (HRLES) to study pulsatile incompressible flow in a straight pipe of L/D = 20. The simulations presented Newtonian and Carreau-Yasuda fluid flows, at Reynolds number of 256 and 228, respectively, each represented by one, two and three boundary harmonics. Comparison was established based on maintaining constant time-averaged mass flow rate in all simulations. First, we report the effect of primary harmonics on the global power budget using primitive variables in phase space. Second, we describe the non-Kolmogorov turbulence in frequency domain. Third, we investigate the near-wall coherent structures in time, space and frequency domains. Finally, we propose a new conjecture for the role of turbulence in endothelial cells mechanobiology. The proposed conjecture correlates near-wall turbulence to a force field of picoNewton scale, suggesting possible relevance to endothelial cells mechanobiology.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-voxel (OOV) signals are common spurious echo artifacts in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). These signals often manifest in the spectrum as very strong  ripples which interfere with spectral quantification by overlapping with targeted metabolite resonances. Dephasing Optimization Through Coherence Order Pathway Selection (DOTCOPS) gradient schemes are algorithmically optimized to suppress all potential alternative coherence transfer pathways (CTPs), and should suppress unwanted OOV echoes. In addition, second-order shimming uses non-linear gradient fields to maximize field homogeneity inside the voxel, which unfortunately increases the diversity of local gradient fields outside of the voxel. Given that strong local spatial B0 gradients can refocus unintended CTPs, it is possible that OOVs are less prevalent when only linear first-order shimming is applied. Here we compare the size of unwanted OOV signals in Hadamard-edited (HERMES) data acquired with either a local gradient scheme (which we refer to here as \"Shared\") or DOTCOPS, and with first or second-order shimming. We collected data from 15 healthy volunteers in two brain regions (voxel size 30x26x26mm3) from which it is challenging to acquire MRS data: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and left temporal cortex (LTC). Characteristic OOV echoes were seen in both GABA- and GSH-edited spectra for both brain regions, gradient schemes, and shimming approaches. A linear mixed-effect (LME) model revealed a statistically significant difference in the average residual based on gradient scheme in both GABA-(p < 0.001) and GSH-edited (p < 0.001) spectra; that is, the DOTCOPS gradient scheme resulted in smaller OOV artifacts compared with the Shared scheme. There were no significant differences in OOV artifacts associated with shimming method. Thus, these results suggest that the DOTCOPS gradient scheme for J-difference-edited PRESS acquisitions yields spectra with smaller OOV echo artifacts than the Shared gradient scheme implemented in a widely disseminated editing sequence.",

Here, we combined morpho-physiological analyses with metabolic profiling of roots and leaves of Valencia orange scions grafted onto Rangpur lime, Swingle citrumelo or Sunki mandarin rootstocks under water deficit. Our aim was to present a comprehensive spatio-temporal evaluation of citrus responses to drought and highlight the metabolic adjustments associated with drought tolerance induced by Rangpur lime. Plant responses were evaluated during the initial phase of reduction in water availability, when water deficit was maximum and also after rehydration. Fifty-eight primary metabolites were modulated by water deficit, mainly amino acids, organic acids and sugars. Metabolic changes indicated adjustments related to osmotic, energetic and redox processes under low water availability, which were dependent on rootstock and varied between roots and leaves and along the experimental period. Rangpur lime prioritized root growth in the initial phase of water deficit, which was linked to less sugar accumulation, changes in nucleotide metabolism, downregulation in Shikimic acid pathway and accumulation of arginine. After rehydration, the resume of shoot growth was associated with high accumulation of arginine and asparagine. The better performance of Rangpur lime seems to be associated with its high sensitivity of roots to changes in water availability and possible signaling compounds have been suggested.",

Here, we present a high-quality genome sequence of G. gynandra, anchored onto 17 main super- scaffolds with a total length of 740 Mb, an N50 of 42 Mb and 30,933 well-supported gene models. The G. gynandra genome and previously released genomes of C3 relatives in the Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae make an excellent model for studying the role of genome evolution in the transition from C3 to C4 photosynthesis. We revealed that G. gynandra and its C3 relative Tarenaya hassleriana shared a whole-genome duplication event (Gg-), then an addition of a third genome (Th-, +1x) took place in T. hassleriana but not in G. gynandra. Analysis of syntenic copy number of C4 photosynthesis-related gene families indicates that G. gynandra generally retained more duplicated copies of these genes than C3 T. hassleriana, and also that the G. gynandra C4 genes might have been under positive selection pressure. Both whole-genome and single-gene duplication were found to contribute to the expansion of the aforementioned gene families in G. gynandra. Collectively, this study enhances our understanding of the impact of gene duplication and gene retention on the evolution of C4 photosynthesis in Cleomaceae.",

    "abstract": "One-carbon (C1) compounds such as methanol, formate, and CO2 are alternative, sustainable microbial feedstocks for the biobased production of chemicals and fuels. In this study, we engineered the carbon metabolism of the industrially important bacterium Pseudomonas putida to assimilate these three substrates through the reductive glycine pathway. First, we demonstrated the functionality of the C1-assimilation module by coupling the growth of auxotrophic strains to formate assimilation. Next, we extended the module from formate to methanol using both NAD and PQQ - dependent methanol dehydrogenases. Finally, we demonstrated CO2-dependent growth through CO2 reduction to formate by the native formate dehydrogenase, which required short-term evolution to rebalance the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio. This research paves the way to engineer P. putida towards growth on formate, methanol, and CO2 as sole feedstocks, thereby substantially expanding its potential as a sustainable and versatile cell factory.",

    "abstract": "A subset of clinical isolates of Clostridioides difficile contains one or more plasmids and these plasmids can harbor virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants. Despite their potential importance, C. difficile plasmids remain poorly characterized. Here, we describe a human clinical isolate that carries three plasmids from three different plasmid families that are therefore compatible. For two of these, we identify a region capable of sustaining plasmid replication in C. difficile. Together, our data advance our understanding of C. difficile plasmid biology.\n\nHighlightsThe complete circular genome sequence is provided for a C. difficile isolate harboring three plasmids\nThese three plasmids (pJMR5-1, pJMR5-4 and pJRM5-W) are therefore compatible in a single strain\nSequence analysis suggest a modular nature of plasmid families to which the pJMR-plasmids belong\nA functional replicon was cloned from pJMR5-1 (pCD-ECE1 family) and pJMR5-W (pCD-WTSI1 family) and plasmids carrying this replicon are compatible with plasmid pCD630",
