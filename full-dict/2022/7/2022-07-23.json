    "abstract": "Plants and their insect herbivores have been a dominant component of the terrestrial ecological landscape for the past 410 million years and feature intricate evolutionary patterns and co-dependencies. A complex systems perspective allows for both detailed resolution of these evolutionary relationships as well as comparison and synthesis across systems. Using proxy data of insect herbivore damage (denoted by the damage type or DT) preserved on fossil leaves, functional bipartite network representations provide insights into how plant-insect associations depend on geological time, paleogeographical space, and environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation. However, the metrics measured from such networks are prone to sampling bias. Such sensitivity is of special concern for plant-DT association networks in paleontological settings where sampling effort is often severely limited. Here, we explore the sensitivity of functional bipartite network metrics to sampling intensity and identify sampling thresholds above which metrics appear robust to sampling effort. Across a broad range of sampling efforts, we find network metrics to be less affected by sampling bias and/or sample size than richness metrics, which are routinely used in studies of fossil plant-DT interactions. These results provide reassurance that cross-comparisons of plant-DT networks offer insights into network structure and function and support their widespread use in paleoecology. Moreover, these findings suggest novel opportunities for using plant-DT networks in neontological terrestrial ecology to understand functional aspects of insect herbivory across geological time, environmental perturbations, and geographic space.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that animals and their associated bacteria interact via intricate molecular mechanisms, and it is hypothesized that disturbances to the microbiome can influence animal development. Sponges diverged from other animals more than 750 MYA and represent one of the earliest branching animal phyla that exhibit symbiotic relationships with diverse bacteria. Over 41 microbial phyla have been found in association with sponges, forming a holobiont that is integral to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Sponge-associated microbes contain an enriched set of proteins bearing eukaryotic-like domains, and their metabolism supports the host with nutrients. This indicates strong physiological interconnections in the holobiont, which are thought to be modulated by sponge immunity and pattern-recognition proteins. Despite the hypothesized tight physiological integration and ancient origin of the sponge holobiont, the effect of changes in the symbiotic community on the sponge metabolism and morphogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of a key microbial sponge symbiont correlates with a stark body plan reorganization of the sponge host. This reorganization is coupled with broad transcriptomic changes and includes the modulation of signaling pathways known to be involved in morphogenesis and innate immune response in sponges and other animals. This study provides a combined genetic, physiological, and morphological assessment of the effect of changes in the microbiome on sponge post-embryonic development and homeostasis. The drastic microbiome reorganization and the correlated response observed in the sponge host provide evidence for a coupling between sponge transcriptomic state and the state of its microbiome. Our results suggest that sponges use molecular mechanisms to respond to changes in their microbiome and that the ability to sense and respond to microbiome perturbations has deep evolutionary origins among animals.",

    "abstract": "The gut brain axis is thought to play a role in behavior and physiological responses through chemical, immunological, and metabolite signaling. Antibiotics, diet, and drugs can alter the transit time of gut contents as well as the makeup of the microbiome. Heterogeneity in genetics and environment are also well-known factors involved in the initiation and perpetuation of substance use disorders. Few viable genetic or biological markers are available to identify individuals who are at risk of escalating opioid intake. Primarily, the addiction field has focused on the nervous system, limiting the discovery of peripheral factors that contribute to addiction. To address this gap, we characterized the microbiome before and after drug exposure, and after antibiotics depletion in male and female heterogenous stock rats to determine if microbiome constituents are protective of escalation. We hypothesized that individuals that are prone to escalation of opioid self-administration will have distinct microbial and metabolic profiles. The fecal microbiome and behavioral responses were measured over several weeks of oxycodone self-administration and after antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment reduces circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by depleting microbes that ferment fiber into these essential signaling molecules for the gut-brain axis. Depletion of the microbiome increased oxycodone self-administration in a subpopulation of animals (Responders). Supplementation of SCFAs in antibiotic depleted animals decreased elevated oxycodone self-administration. Phylogenetic functional analysis reveals distinct metabolic differences in the subpopulations of animals that are sensitive to antibiotic depletion and animals rescued by SCFA supplementation. In conclusion, this study identifies pre-existing microbiome and metabolic vulnerabilities to escalation of oxycodone self-administration, demonstrates that escalation of oxycodone self-administration dysregulates the microbiome and metabolic landscape, and identifies a causal role of short-chain fatty acids in addiction-like behaviors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe evolution of insect resistance to pesticides poses a continuing threat to sustainable pest management. While much is known about the molecular mechanisms that confer resistance in model insects and few agricultural pests, far less is known about fruit pests.\n\nRESULTSHere we found that functional redundancy and preference of metabolism by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) genes in the CYP9A subfamily confer resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin in Cydia pomonella, a major invasive pest of pome fruit. A total of four CYP9A genes, including CYP9A61, CYP9A120, CYP9A121, and CYP9A122, were identified from C. pomonella. Among these, CYP9A120, CYP9A121, and CYP9A122 were predominantly expressed in the midgut of larvae. The expression levels of these P450 genes were significantly induced by LD10 of lambda-cyhalothrin and were overexpressed in a field-evolved lambda-cyhalothrin resistant population. Knockdown of CYP9A120 and CYP9A121 by RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) increased the susceptibility of larvae to lambda-cyhalothrin. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant P450s expressed in Sf9 cells can metabolize lambda-cyhalothrin, but with functional redundancy and divergence through regioselectivity of metabolism. CYP9A121 preferred to convert lambda-cyhalothrin to 2'-hydroxy-lambda-cyhalothrin, whereas CYP9A122 only generated 4'-hydroxy metabolite of lambda-cyhalothrin. Although possesses a relatively low metabolic capability, CYP9A120 balanced catalytic competence to generate both 2'- and 4'-metabolites.\n\nCONCLUSIONCollectively, these results reveal that metabolic functional redundancy of three members of the CYP9A subfamily leads to P450-mediated lambda-cyhalothrin resistance in C. pomonella, thus representing a potential adaptive evolutionary strategy during its worldwide expansion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci associated with common vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), and hypertension. However, the lack of mechanistic insights for a majority of these loci limits translation of these findings into the clinic. Among these loci with unknown functions is UFL1-FHL5 (chr6q16.1), a locus that reached genome-wide significance in a recent CAD/MI GWAS meta-analysis. In addition to CAD/MI, UFL1-FHL5 is also implicated to coronary calcium, intracranial aneurysm, and migraine risk, consistent with the widespread pleiotropy observed among other GWAS loci.\n\nMethodsWe apply a multimodal approach leveraging statistical fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and imaging of human coronary artery tissues to implicate Four-and-a-half LIM domain 5 (FHL5) as the top candidate causal gene. We unravel the molecular mechanisms of the cross-phenotype genetic associations through in vitro functional analyses and epigenomic profiling experiments.\n\nResultsWe prioritized FHL5 as the top candidate causal gene at the UFL1-FHL5 locus through eQTL colocalization methods. FHL5 gene expression was enriched in the SMC and pericyte population in human artery tissues with coexpression network analyses supporting a functional role in regulating SMC contraction. Unexpectedly, under procalcifying conditions, FHL5 overexpression promoted vascular calcification and dysregulated processes related to extracellular matrix organization and calcium handling. Lastly, by mapping FHL5 binding sites and inferring FHL5 target gene function using artery tissue gene regulatory network analyses, we highlight regulatory interactions between FHL5 and downstream CAD/MI loci, such as FOXL1 and FN1 that have roles in vascular remodeling.\n\nConclusionTaken together, these studies provide mechanistic insights into the pleiotropic genetic associations of UFL1-FHL5. We show that FHL5 mediates vascular disease risk through transcriptional regulation of downstream vascular remodeling loci. These trans-acting mechanisms may account for a portion of the heritable risk for complex vascular diseases.",
