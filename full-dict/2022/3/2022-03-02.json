    "abstract": "Understanding immune memory to Common Cold Coronaviruses (CCCs) is relevant for assessing its potential impact on the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for the prospects of pan-corona vaccines development. We performed a longitudinal analysis, of pre-pandemic samples collected from 2016-2019. CD4+ T cells and antibody responses specific for CCC and to other respiratory viruses, and chronic or ubiquitous pathogens were assessed. CCC-specific memory CD4+ T cells were detected in most subjects, and their frequencies were comparable to those for other common antigens. Notably, responses to CCC and other antigens such as influenza and Tetanus Toxoid (TT) were sustained over time. CCC-specific CD4+ T cell responses were also associated with low numbers of HLA-DR+CD38+ cells and their magnitude did not correlate with yearly changes in the prevalence of CCC infections. Similarly, spike RBD-specific IgG responses for CCC were stable throughout the sampling period. Finally, high CD4+ T cell reactivity to CCC, but not antibody responses, was associated with high pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Overall, these results suggest that the steady and sustained CCC responses observed in the study cohort are likely due to a relatively stable pool of CCC-specific memory CD4+ T cells instead of fast decaying responses and frequent reinfections.",

    "abstract": "A number of experiments were done to further our understanding of the substrate utilization in button mushroom crops (Agaricus bisporus). An analysis of the degradation of dry matter of the substrate during a crop cycle revealed that for pin formation the upper layer is used, for the production of flush one all layers are involved and for flush two mainly the lower layer is used. A reduction in substrate depth leads to a decrease in yield/m2 but an apparent increase in yield per ton of substrate but with a lower mushroom quality. A short daily interruption of the connection between the casing soil with all the substrate results in a delay of the first flush. Repetitive interruption of the connection with all or only part of the substrate leads to a shift in yield from flush one to flush two but the total yield remains unchanged. The mycelial biomass in the substrate increases from filling up to pinning, a steeper increase during flush one, levelling off during flush two, indicating that in the period of venting and up to/including flush one, enzymes are secreted by growing hyphae generating nutrients to feed a fixed amount of mushroom biomass for two flushes. A sidewise extension of the substrate (without casing soil, thus not producing mushrooms) showed that the substrate at a distance more than 20-50 cm away from the casing soil does not contribute to feeding mushrooms in the first two flushes. The observations are discussed with respect to relevant previous research.\n\nImportanceButton mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) are cultivated on a substrate prepared of composted wheat straw, chicken and/or horst manure and gypsum. This manuscript describes a number of experiments indicating that in a harvesting strategy towards quality mushrooms there is a fixed amount of nutrients prepared/available to feed two flushes. The increase of mycelial biomass in the substrate after venting and especially during the development of flush one indicates that likely a branching of mycelium occurs during this period, leading to a substantial number of growing hyphal tips excreting lignocellulolytic enzymes that degrade substrate and make nutrients available during flush one which are utilised in flush one and two. The presently used substrate seems to have reached its limits and there are hardly opportunities for further improvement. Research on alternative, more energy dense, substrates are needed to improve the efficiency of the present production system.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage (phage) are bacterial predators that can also spread antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes between bacteria by generalised transduction. Phage are often present alongside antibiotics in the environment, yet evidence of their joint killing effect on bacteria is conflicted, and the dynamics of transduction in such systems are unknown. Here, we combine in vitro data and mathematical modelling to identify conditions where phage and antibiotics act in synergy to remove bacteria or drive AMR evolution.\n\nWe adapt a published model of phage-bacteria dynamics, including transduction, to add the pharmacodynamics of erythromycin and tetracycline, parameterised from new in vitro data. We simulate a system where two strains of Staphylococcus aureus are present at stationary phase, each carrying either an erythromycin or tetracycline resistance gene, and where multidrug-resistant bacteria can be generated by transduction only. We determine rates of bacterial clearance and multidrug-resistant bacteria appearance, when either or both antibiotics and phage are present at varying timings and concentrations.\n\nAlthough phage and antibiotics act in synergy to kill bacteria, by reducing bacterial growth antibiotics reduce phage production. A low concentration of phage introduced shortly after antibiotics fails to replicate and exert a strong killing pressure on bacteria, instead generating multidrug-resistant bacteria by transduction which are then selected for by the antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant bacteria numbers were highest when antibiotics and phage were introduced simultaneously.\n\nThe interaction between phage and antibiotics leads to a trade-off between a slower clearing rate of bacteria (if antibiotics are added before phage), and a higher risk of multidrug-resistance evolution (if phage are added before antibiotics), exacerbated by low concentrations of phage or antibiotics. Our results form hypotheses to guide future experimental and clinical work on the impact of phage on AMR evolution, notably for studies of phage therapy which should investigate varying timings and concentrations of phage and antibiotics.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYBacteriophage (\"phage\") are viruses that can infect and kill bacteria, but also natural drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) evolution by transduction, when they carry non-phage DNA between bacteria, including AMR genes. Phage are often present alongside antibiotics in the environment and in humans, yet the joint dynamics of phage, antibiotics, and bacteria are unclear. Using laboratory work and mathematical modelling, we show for the first time that depending on timing and concentration, phage and antibiotics can either work together to kill bacteria faster, or phage can generate multidrug-resistant bacteria by transduction which are then selected for by antibiotics. This may be particularly important in the context of phage therapy, where phage are used to treat bacterial infections, often alongside antibiotics. Our conclusions highlight the urgent need for clinical and laboratory work to quantify the currently unknown contribution of phage to AMR evolution in humans. Otherwise, we may be missing opportunities to reduce the global public health burden of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Precise and reliable cell-specific gene delivery remains technically challenging. Here we report a splicing-based approach for controlling gene expression whereby separate translational reading frames are coupled to the inclusion or exclusion of cell-specific alternative exons. Candidate exons are identified by analyzing thousands of publicly available RNA sequencing datasets and filtering by cell specificity, sequence conservation, and local intron length. This method, which we denote splicing-linked expression design (SLED), can be combined in a Boolean manner with existing techniques such as minipromoters and viral capsids. SLED vectors can leverage the strong expression of constitutive promoters, without sacrificing precision, by decoupling the tradeoff between promoter strength and selectivity. We generated SLED vectors to selectively target all neurons, photoreceptors, or excitatory neurons, and demonstrated that specificity was retained in vivo when delivered using AAVs. We further demonstrated the utility of SLED by creating what would otherwise be unobtainable research tools, specifically a GluA2 flip/flop reporter and a dual excitatory/inhibitory neuronal calcium indicator. Finally, we show the translational potential of SLED by rescuing photoreceptor degeneration in Prph2rds/rds mice and by developing an oncolytic vector that can selectively induce apoptosis in SF3B1 mutant cancer cells. The flexibility of SLED technology enables new avenues for basic and translational research.",

A hybrid network theoretic methodology comprising of random walk with restart (RWR) and graphlet degree vectors (GDV) was implemented to explore the local topology of the interologous, Tulsi protein interaction network (TulsiPIN) and mine CC associated raw candidate proteins. Statistical and biological significance of the raw candidates was determined using permutation and enrichment tests.

    "abstract": "Germ cells provide the cellular basis for sexual reproduction in multicellular animals. In males, germ cells differentiate into sperm, one of the most morphologically diverse eukaryotic cell types. Owing both to this remarkable diversity and to the rapid evolution of reproduction-related genes, the transcriptional program of male germ cells is widely regarded as divergent across species1,2. However, the possibility that these cells retain a distinctive evolutionarily-conserved genetic basis remains largely unexplored. Here we show, using phylostratigraphy, that the complex male germ cell transcriptome has an old evolutionary origin shared between vertebrate and invertebrate species. Through multilayer network analysis of the human, mouse and fruit fly meiotic transcriptome, we establish that old genes serve as a genetic scaffold from which complexity has evolved, and identify a core set of 79 ancient functional interactions at the heart of male germ cell identity. By silencing a cohort of 920 candidate genes likely to affect the acquisition and maintenance of this identity, we uncover 164 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes. Integrating this information with whole-exome sequencing data from azoospermic men reveals three novel genetic causes of human male infertility shared between species that have diverged for more than 600 million years. Our results redefine the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and illustrate the translational potential of a new synergy between comparative network biology and medical genetics. We anticipate that our open-access and easily-adaptable interdisciplinary research platform will be harnessed in the context of other cell types and diseases.",

In this study, we present an experimental brain organoid platform for modeling infection with multiple viruses (e.g., influenza virus or enterovirus). Brain organoids challenged by influenza viruses (H1N1-WSN and H3N2-HKT68) had decreased overall organoid size, similar to ZIKA virus infection, while enteroviruses (EV68 and EV71) infected brain organoids displayed the opposite result. Then, we studied the molecular events in WSN-infected organoids, and we found that WSN could widely infect multiple cell types, and preferentially infected MAP2+ neurons compared to SOX2+ neural stem cells (NSCs) and GFAP+ astrocytes in brain organoids, and induced apoptosis of NSCs and neurons, but not astrocytes. The inflammatory responses in organoids observed to occur (Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin 6) after WSN infection may further facilitate brain damage. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling revealed several upregulated genes (CSAG3 and OAS2) and downregulated genes (CDC20B, KCNJ13, OTX2-AS1, CROCC2, and F5) after WSN infection for 24 hpi and 96 hpi, implicating antiviral drugs development responses to WSN. Finally, we explored neurotrophic factors (e.g., BDNF, GDNF, and NT3) and PYC-12 as antiviral and neuroprotective reagents, which could significantly suppress virus infection, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Collectively, we established a tractable experimental model system to investigate the impact and mechanism of virus infection on human brain development, and provide a platform for rapidly screening therapeutic compounds, advancing the development of antiviral strategies.",

    "abstract": "Fox genes are a large and conserved family of transcription factors involved in many key biological processes, including embryogenesis and body patterning. Although the role of Fox genes has been studied in an array of model systems, comprehensive comparative studies in Spiralia--a large clade of invertebrate animals including molluscs and annelids--are scarce but much needed to better understand the evolutionary history of this gene family. Here, we reconstruct and functionally characterise the Fox gene complement in the annelid Owenia fusiformis, a slow evolving species and member of the sister group to all remaining annelids. The genome of O. fusiformis contains at least a single ortholog of each of the 23 Fox gene classes that are ancestral to Bilateria, except for foxE and foxI. Temporal and spatial expression dynamics reveal a conserved role of Fox genes in gut formation (foxA), mesoderm patterning (foxF, foxL1, foxC, foxH) and cilia formation (foxJ1) in Annelida and Spiralia. Moreover, we uncover an ancestral expansion of foxQ2 genes in Spiralia, represented by 11 paralogs in O. fusiformis. Notably, although all foxQ2 copies have apical expression in O. fusiformis, they show variable spatial domains and staggered temporal activation, which suggest cooperation and sub-functionalisation among foxQ2 genes for the development of apical fates in this annelid. Altogether, our study informs the evolution and developmental roles of Fox genes in Annelida and Spiralia generally, providing the basis to explore how regulatory changes in Fox gene expression might have contributed to developmental and morphological diversification in Spiralia.\n\nSignificance statementThe role of Fox genes, a group of DNA-binding proteins required for the formation of many animal organs, is poorly understood in invertebrate groups such as molluscs and annelids. Here, by studying the genome and embryogenesis of the annelid Owenia fusiformis, we demonstrate that Fox genes are involved in the development of the gut, muscles, cilia, and nervous system. Importantly, we find that a group of Fox genes (referred to as foxQ2) expressed in the anterior end of most animals has more copies in annelids and molluscs than in other invertebrate groups like insects and sea stars. Together, our findings clarify the evolution of Fox genes and their contribution to the diversity of forms and organs found in marine invertebrates.",

We leveraged whole genome sequencing data for 152 recombinant inbred (RI) strains from the BXD family derived from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice to study the effects of genetic background on genome-wide patterns of new mutations at STRs. We defined quantitative phenotypes describing the numbers and types of germline STR mutations in each strain and identified a locus on chromosome 13 associated with the propensity of STRs to expand. Several dozen genes lie in the QTL region, including Msh3, a known modifier of STR stability at pathogenic repeat expansions in mice and humans. Detailed analysis of the locus revealed a cluster of variants near the 5 end of Msh3, including multiple protein-coding variants within the DNA mismatch recognition domain of MSH3, and a retrotransposon insertion overlapping an annotated exon. Additionally, gene expression analysis demonstrates co-localization of this QTL with expression QTLs for multiple nearby genes, including Msh3. Our results suggest a novel role for Msh3 in regulating genome-wide patterns of germline STR mutations and demonstrate that inherited genetic variation can contribute to variability in accumulation of new mutations across individuals.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic interplay between cell adhesion and protrusion is a critical determinant of many forms of cell motility. When modeling cell spreading on adhesive surfaces, traditional mathematical treatments often consider passive cell adhesion as the primary, if not exclusive, mechanistic driving force of this cellular motion. To better assess the contribution of active cytoskeletal protrusion to immune-cell spreading during phagocytosis, we here develop a computational framework that allows us to optionally investigate both purely adhesive spreading (\"Brownian zipper hypothesis\") as well as protrusion-dominated spreading (\"protrusive zipper hypothesis\"). We model the cell as an axisymmetric body of highly viscous fluid surrounded by a cortex with uniform surface tension and incorporate as potential driving forces of cell spreading an attractive stress due to receptor-ligand binding and an outward normal stress representing cytoskeletal protrusion, both acting on the cell boundary. We leverage various model predictions against the results of a directly related experimental companion study of human neutrophil phagocytic spreading on substrates coated with different densities of antibodies. We find that the concept of adhesion-driven spreading is incompatible with experimental results such as the independence of the cell-spreading speed on the density of immobilized antibodies. In contrast, the protrusive zipper model agrees well with experimental findings and, when adapted to simulate cell spreading on discrete adhesion sites, it also reproduces the observed positive correlation between antibody density and maximum cell-substrate contact area. Together, our integrative experimental/computational approach shows that phagocytic spreading is driven by cellular protrusion, and that the extent of spreading is limited by the density of adhesion sites.\n\nAuthor SummaryTo accomplish many routine biological tasks, cells must rapidly spread over different types of surfaces. Here, we examine the biophysical underpinnings of immune cell spreading during phagocytosis, the process by which white blood cells such as neutrophils engulf pathogens or other foreign objects. Our computational framework models the case in which a human neutrophil spreads over a flat surface coated with antibodies, which we also test experimentally in a companion paper. Our primary purpose is to assess whether phagocytic spreading is actively driven by protrusive forces exerted by the cell, or passively by adhesive forces acting between receptors in the cell membrane and antibodies on the surface. By directly comparing our model predictions to experimental results, we demonstrate that phagocytic spreading is primarily driven by protrusion, but the extent of spreading is still limited by the availability of binding sites. Our findings improve the fundamental understanding of phagocytosis and may also pave the way for future investigations of the balance between adhesion and protrusion in other forms of cell spreading, such as wound healing or cancer cell migration.",

    "abstract": "The entomopathogenic nematodes play a pivotal role as bio-control agents of different species of insect pests including red palm weevil. In current investigations, infective capabilities of four species of entomopathogenic nematodes including Hetrerorhabditis bacteriophora, Steinernema feltiae, Steinernema glesri and Steinernema carpocapsae were evaluated against larvae, pupae and adult red palm weevil, under laboratory and field conditions. The pathogenic potential of selected nematode species was assessed based on dissection and adult emergence of weevils. Results indicated that S. carpocapsae and H. bacteriophora with 94.68 and 92.68% infection were found most effective EPN species against red palm weevil larvae. Focusing the adult emergence, aforementioned EPNs were found most pathogenic when pupae of red palm weevil were treated and resulted into 83.60 and 80.20% infested pupae. It was noted that the adult emergence is the better option for the evaluation of pathogenic potential of EPN compared to dissection of insect. The S. carpocapsae was found most effective against 6th instar larvae of red palm weevil and caused 100% mortality at 340 hours after treatment; whereas; S. glesri and S. feltiae were found least pathogenic and caused 70 and 76% mortality. All the evaluated nematode species were found highly infective under field conditions. The S. carpocapsae was found most pathogenic causing 83.60% mortality of red palm weevil. Overall; the tested nematodes were found most effective against larvae followed by adult weevils. The tested nematode species were found least effective against pupae of red palm weevil. Based on current findings, it is concluded that the tested species of nematodes can be used as sustainable option for the management of red palm weevil.",

    "abstract": "For the first time, dolphins wearing video cameras were observed capturing and eating live native fish. While freely swimming in San Diego Bay, one dolphin caught 69 resident fish, 64 demersal, 5 near surface, while the other caught 40, 36 demersal and 4 near the surface. Two other dolphins were observed capturing 135 live native fish in a sea water pool. Two additional dolphins were observed feeding opportunistically during open water sessions in the Pacific Ocean. Notably, one of these dolphins was observed to consume 8 yellow-bellied sea snakes (Hydrophis platurus). Searching dolphins clicked at intervals of 20 to 50 ms. On approaching prey, click intervals shorten into a terminal buzz and then a squeal. Squeals were bursts of clicks that varied in duration, peak frequency, and amplitude. Squeals continued as the dolphin seized, manipulated and swallowed the prey. If fish escaped, the dolphin continued the chase and sonar clicks were heard less often than the continuous terminal buzz and squeal. During captures, the dolphins lips flared to reveal nearly all of the teeth. The throat expanded outward. Fish continued escape swimming even as they entered the dolphins mouth, yet the dolphin appeared to suck the fish right down.",

    "abstract": "The wolf is a generalist-opportunistic predator that displays diverse and remarkably adaptable feeding strategies across its range with local adaptations to certain prey species depending on their availability and vulnerability. The multi-prey system of the Slovak Carpathians supports important portion of the European wolf population; however, it has been markedly understudied. We evaluated winter diet composition and prey selection of Slovak wolves based on 321 scat samples collected between September - February within four different study areas during 2015 - 2017. The winter diet of wolves in the Slovak Carpathians was characterized by a 98% occurrence of wild large-sized and medium-sized ungulates with red deer occurring in wolf scats most often, consistent with their highest density among other wild ungulates. However, by comparing the consumption with availability of wild prey, we found that wolves in fact selected for wild boar especially in areas with higher altitudinal range, while selected for red deer in areas with low altitudinal range where this prey species was more spatially predictable. Although wolves showed the potential to switch between red deer and wild boar when their density increases, we found that this variation can be rather linked to changing prey vulnerability, which is dependent on particular environmental conditions at local scale such as topography and snow accumulation. The present study provides valuable insights into the winter foraging ecology of Slovak wolves in a multi-prey system of the Carpathians and allows for practical implications in the management of the rapidly increasing populations of wild ungulates across Europe.",
