    "abstract": "Enhanced glucose metabolism is a feature of almost all cancers, but downstream functional effects of aberrant glucose flux are difficult to mechanistically determine. The objective of this study is to characterize a mechanism by which elevated glucose level drives a tumorigenic pathway in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We used chemical biology methods to track how a metabolite of glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), is linked to the transcriptional regulatory protein tet-methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) as an O-linked GlcNAc post translational modification (O-GlcNAc). In this work, we revealed that intracellular protein glycosylation by O-GlcNAc is driven by high glucose levels in TNBC models, including on TET1. A single enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), is responsible for catalyzing protein modification of O-GlcNAc. We showed that OGT activity is higher in TNBC cell lines compared to non-tumor breast cell lines and is associated with hyperglycemia. Furthermore, enhanced OGT activity activated a pathway for cancer stem-like cell (CSC) reprogramming in TNBC cells. In our model, O-GlcNAcylated TET1 upregulated expression of splicing factor TAR-DNA binding protein (TARDBP), which drives CSC induction as well as higher OGT levels. We show that this OGT-TET1-TARDBP axis \"feeds-forward\" in hyperglycemic conditions both in cell lines and diet-induced obese mice, which displayed higher blood glucose levels and tumor O-GlcNAc levels than lean littermates. This data converges on a novel pathway whereby hyperglycemia drives aberrant OGT activity, activating a pathway for CSC induction in TNBC. Our findings partially explain a key aspect of how obesity is associated with TNBC risk and negative outcomes.\n\nStatement of ImplicationThis work presents a novel mechanism to explain how obesity is a risk factor for triple-negative breast cancer via elevated sugar-transfer activity by O-GlcNAc transferase in hyperglycemia, leading to the induction of a cancer stem-like cells and revealing a targetable pathway in obesity-associated tumors.",

    "abstract": "A lack of models that recapitulate the complexity of human bone marrow has hampered mechanistic studies of normal and malignant hematopoiesis and the validation of novel therapies. Here, we describe a step-wise, directed-differentiation protocol in which organoids are generated from iPSCs committed to mesenchymal, endothelial and hematopoietic lineages. These 3-dimensional structures capture key features of human bone marrow - stroma, lumen-forming sinusoidal vessels and myeloid cells including pro-platelet forming megakaryocytes. The organoids supported the engraftment and survival of cells from patients with blood malignancies, including cancer types notoriously difficult to maintain ex vivo. Fibrosis of the organoid occurred following TGF{beta} stimulation and engraftment with myelofibrosis but not healthy donor-derived cells, validating this platform as a powerful tool for studies of malignant cells and their interactions within a human bone marrow-like milieu. This enabling technology is likely to accelerate discovery and prioritization of novel targets for bone marrow disorders and blood cancers.\n\nSignificance StatementWe present a 3D, vascularised human bone marrow organoid that supports growth of primary cells from patients with myeloid and lymphoid blood cancers. This model allows for mechanistic studies of blood cancers in the context of their microenvironment, and provides a much-needed, ex vivo tool for prioritization of new therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing many cancer types including acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), a subset of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) characterized by expression of the PML-RAR oncogene. The molecular mechanisms linking obesity and APL development are not known. To model clinical observations, we established a mouse model of diet-induced obesity using transgenic mice constitutively expressing PML-RARA  in the hematopoietic system (PML-RAR KI mice) fed either standard (SD) or high-fat (HFD) diets. HFD-fed PML-RAR KI mice developed leukaemia with reduced latency and increased penetrance, as compared to SD-fed mice. HFD leads to accumulation of DNA damage in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but, surprisingly, this was not associated with mutational load gain, as shown by whole genome/exome sequencing of pre-leukemic and leukemic cells. Importantly, very few of the observed mutations were predicted to act as cancer drivers, suggesting the relevance of nongenetic mechanisms. HFD led to an expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells with a concomitant reduction in long-term hematopoietic stem cells, and in the presence of PML-RAR this was also accompanied by an enhancement of in vitro and in vivo self-renewal. Interestingly, Linoleic Acid (LA), abundant in HFD, recapitulates the effect of HFD on the self-renewal of PML-RAR HPCs by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR{delta}), a central regulator of fatty acid metabolism involved in the promotion of cancer progression. Our findings have implications for dietary or pharmacological interventions aimed at counteracting the cancer-promoting effect of obesity.\n\nKey pointsO_LIhigh fat diet (HFD) promotes APL leukemogenesis in mouse models, reproducing the exquisite sensitivity to obesity observed in humans\nC_LIO_LIalthough HFD leads to DNA damage and mutations, the molecular mechanism is nongenetic and linked to the transcription factor PPAR{delta}\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The RAS oncogene and upregulation of the RAS signalling pathway is highly prevalent in human cancer, and therefore, therapeutically targeting the RAS pathway is a common treatment in cancer. However, RAS pathway upregulation is not sufficient to drive malignant cancer, since senescence mechanisms prevent cancer progression. Thus, additional mutations, such as mutations that prevent senescence or alter the tissue architecture (cell polarity), are required for RAS-driven tumour progression. Moreover, targeting RAS-driven cancers with RAS pathway inhibitors can often lead to undesirable side-effects and to drug resistance. Thus, identifying compounds that synergise with RAS-pathway inhibitors would enable lower doses of the RAS pathway inhibitors to be used and also decrease the acquisition of drug resistance. Here, in a boutique chemical screen using a Drosophila model of Ras-driven cell polarity-impaired cancer, we have identified compounds that reduce tumour burden by synergising with subtherapeutic doses of the RAS pathway inhibitor, Trametinib, which inhibits mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK). Analysis of one of the hits from the screen, Ritanserin, which targets serotonin receptors and diacy glycerol kinase alpha (DGK), revealed that DGK was the critical target in its synergism with Trametinib. We show that human mammary epithelial cells harbouring the H-RAS oncogene and knockdown of the cell polarity gene, SCRIB, are also sensitive to treatment with low doses of Trametinib and DGK inhibition. Mechanistically, DGK inhibition synergises with Trametinib by inhibiting MEK and mTOR activity. Altogether, our results provide evidence that targeting RAS-driven human cancers with RAS pathway and DGK inhibitors will be an effective combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Exogenous RNA application is a promising transgene-free approach for crop protection and improvement. In almost all applications reported so far, exogenous RNA molecules (double stranded RNAs or small RNAs) are applied to plants in order to trigger degradation of a given mRNA (of plant, pest or pathogen origin), in a process termed post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). However, whether exogenous RNAs can also trigger epigenetic modifications to plants such as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) remains largely unaddressed. Here, we provide evidence that high pressure spraying of a 24-nt short interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to target the CaMV 35S promoter that drives the expression of a GFP transgene, resulted in promoter RdDM in N. benthamiana. Moreover, the methylation at the target site spreads both up and downstream neighboring sites. Importantly, GFP expression was reduced in the sprayed leaf tissues. Small RNA sequencing excluded the presence siRNAs mapping to the GFP gene body and documented substantial amount of secondary RNAs in the promoter, suggesting that the GFP silencing was transcriptional rather than post-transcriptional. Our study provides a proof of principle for spray induced epigenetic modification (SPIEM) that could be used in modern crop breeding platforms.",

    "abstract": "Carbon dots (CDs) have been proposed for nucleic acid delivery in many biological applications. In this work we have obtained carbon dots by a hydrothermal synthesis method for developing nanocomposites with dsRNA. These CDs were produced using glucose or saccharose as the nucleation source and passivated with branched polyethyleneimines for conferring positive charges. Hydrodynamic analyses and transmission electron microscopy TEM showed that they sized on average 4 and 5 nm, depending on the sugar. The CDs were fluorescent and showed a peak at 468 nm when excited with UV light. Physicochemical characteristics of their surfaces were revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The {zeta} potential determined that both types of CDs had positive charges as well as good electrophoretic mobility and conductivity. Coating of the CDs to dsRNA was efficient but did not protect from nucleases. DsRNA naked or coated with the CDs were delivered to leaves of cucumber plants by spraying at 2.5 bar. Quantitation of the dsRNA that entered the leaves showed that when coated with the CDs, 50-fold more dsRNA was detected than when naked dsRNA was applied. Moreover, specific siRNAs derived from the sprayed dsRNAs were 130 times more abundant when the dsRNA was coated with the CDs. Systemic dsRNAs were determined in distal leaves showing a dramatic increase in concentration when delivered as a nanocomposite. Similarly, systemic siRNAs were significantly more abundant in distal leaves when spraying with the CD-dsRNA nanocomposite. Furthermore, FITC-labeled dsRNA was shown to accumulate in the apoplast and increase its entry in the plant when coated with CDs. These results indicate that CDs obtained by hydrothermal synthesis are suitable for dsRNA foliar delivery in RNAi plant applications and provide insight into CD-dsRNA translocations.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, studies have revealed the importance of PSI-driven cyclic electron flow (CEF) in stress acclimation in model organisms like C. reinhardtii; however, these studies focused on transient, short-term stress. In addition, PSI-supercomplexes are associated with CEF during state transition response to short-term stress. On the other hand, the role of CEF during long-term stress acclimation is still largely unknown. In this study, we elucidate the involvement of CEF in acclimation response to long-term high salinity in three different Chlamydomonas species displaying varying salinity tolerance. We compared CEF rates, capacity for state transitions, and formation of supercomplexes after salinity acclimation in the model mesophile C. reinhardtii and two psychrophilic green algae C. priscuii (UWO241) and C. sp. ICE-MDV. CEF was activated under high salt in all three species, with the psychrophilic Chlamydomonas spp. exhibiting the highest CEF rates. High salt acclimation was also correlated with reduced state transition capacity and a PSI-supercomplex was associated with high CEF. We propose that under long-term stress, CEF is constitutively activated through assembly of a stable PSI-supercomplex. The proteomic composition of the long-term PSI-supercomplex is distinct from the supercomplex formed during state transitions, and its presence attenuates the state transition response.",

    "abstract": "Organization of membrane topologies in plants has so far been mainly attributed to the cell wall and the cytoskeleton. Taking rhizobial infections of legume root cells, where plasma membranes undergo dynamic and large-scale topology changes, as an initial model, we challenged this paradigm and tested whether additional scaffolds such as plant-specific remorins that accumulate on highly curved and often wall-less plasma membrane domains, control local membrane dynamics. Indeed, loss-of-function mutants of the remorin protein SYMREM1 failed to develop stabilized membrane tubes as found in colonized cells in wild-type plants, but released empty membrane spheres instead. Expression of this and other remorins in wall-less protoplasts allowed engineering different membrane topologies ranging from membrane blebs to long membrane tubes. Reciprocally, mechanically induced membrane indentations were equally stabilized by SYMREM1. This function is likely supported by remorin oligomerization into antiparallel dimers and the formation of higher order membrane scaffolding structures. Taken together we describe an evolutionary confined mechanism that allows the stabilization of large-scale membrane conformations and curvatures in plants.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe remorin SYMREM1 evolved as structural membrane scaffold that stabilizes membrane tubulation and curvature during symbiotic intracellular infections.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPrevious work within the community led to the identification of a single dominant allele that controls the everbearing trait. However, frequent observations have indicated that crosses do not segregate in a Mendelian fashion, as would be expected for a trait controlled by a single dominant gene. Therefore, it was hypothesised that one or more unidentified epistatic alleles interact with the major gene.\nC_LIO_LIA GWAS was conducted on 587 June-bearers and 207 everbearers to assess the genetic components associated with flowering habit. The segregation ratios of parental strawberry lines with known phenotypes were used to validate the identified alleles.\nC_LIO_LIThree loci including the known, major FaPFRU locus and two epistatic modifiers were identified. These modifiers function as enhancers of the everbearing trait in individuals containing a single copy of the FaPFRU everbearing allele and appear to be functionally redundant. Principally, heterozygous individuals required the presence of two modifying alleles in order to allow expression of the everbearing trait.\nC_LIO_LIInclusion of the epistatic alleles improved the prediction of everbearing segregation ratios, beyond that of a single allele model, however, a large proportion of the variation remained unexplained. Future work should identify the additional repressor and enhancer modifiers not identified here. Discovering the genetic components controlling the everbearing trait can enable genetic informed strawberry improvement.\nC_LI\n\nSociety Impact StatementUntil the 1970s, the majority of commercial strawberry varieties produced a single bloom of flowers. However, continuously flowering, everbearing strawberries are now routinely cultivated and use is increasing. Indeed, introgression of the everbearing flowering trait can lead to economic benefits for growers through the production of a continual crop from the same plant. Utilising genetic guided improvement has the power to streamline everbearing generation. As such, utilising the genetic markers reported here, can help to identify everbearing individuals at an early time point in the breeding process. Furthermore, these markers can help to improve the predictions of progeny segregation ratios.",

We examined the relationship between leaf lobing and leaf size across grapevine populations which varied in extent of leaf lobing.\n\nMethodsWe used homologous landmarking techniques to measure 2,632 leaves across two years in 476 unique, genetically distinct grapevines from 5 biparental crosses which vary primarily in the extent of lobing. We determined to what extent leaf area could explain variation in lobing, vein length, and vein to blade ratio.\n\nResultsAlthough lobing was the primary source of variation in shape across the leaves we measured, leaf area varied only slightly as a function of lobing. Rather, leaf area increases as a function of total major vein length, total branching vein length, and decreases as a function of vein to blade ratio. These relationships are stronger for more highly lobed leaves, with the residuals for each model differing as a function of distal lobing.\n\nConclusionsFor a given leaf area, more highly lobed leaves have longer veins and higher vein to blade ratios, allowing them to maintain similar leaf areas despite increased lobing. These findings show how more highly lobed leaves may compensate for what would otherwise result in a reduced leaf area, allowing for increased photosynthetic capacity through similar leaf size.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging markers based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combined with various other measures (such as informative covariates, vascular risks, brain activity, neuropsychological test etc.,) might provide useful predictions of clinical outcomes during progression towards Alzheimers disease (AD). The Bayesian approach aims to provide a trade-off by employing relevant features combinations to build decision support systems in clinical settings where uncertainties are relevant. We tested the approach in the MRI data across 959 subjects, aged 59-89 years and 453 subjects with available neuropsychological test scores and CSF biomarker status (amyloid-beta (A{beta})42/40 & and phosphorylated tau (pTau)) from a large sample multi-centric observational cohort (DELCODE). In order to explore the beneficial combinations of information from different sources, we presented a MRI-based predictive modelling of memory performance and CSF biomarker status (positive or negative) in the healthy ageing group as well as subjects at risk of Alzheimers disease using a Gaussian process multikernel framework. Furthermore, we systematically evaluated predictive combinations of input feature sets and their model variations, i.e. (A) combinations of brain tissue classes and feature type (modulated vs. unmodulated), choices of filter size of smoothing (ranging from 0 to 15 mm full width at half maximum), and image resolution (1mm, 2mm, 4mm and 8mm); (B) incorporating demography and covariates (C) the impact of the size of the training data set (i.e., number of subjects); (D) the influence of reducing the dimensions of data and (E) choice of kernel types. Finally, the approach was tested to reveal individual cognitive scores at follow-up (up to 4 years) using the baseline features. The highest accuracy for memory performance prediction was obtained for a combination of neuroimaging markers, demographics, genetic information (ApoE4) and CSF-biomarkers explaining 57% of outcome variance in out of sample predictions. The best accuracy for A{beta}42/40 status classification was achieved for combination demographics, ApoE4 and memory score while usage of structural MRI improved the classification of individual patients pTau status.",

Understanding how these physical stimuli translate into transcriptional programs could provide insight into mechanisms underlying mammalian pre-implantation development. Here, we explore this by exerting microenvironmental control over mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Microfluidic encapsulation of ESCs in agarose microgels stabilized the naive pluripotency network and specifically induced expression of Plakoglobin (Jup), a vertebrate homologue of {beta}-catenin. Indeed, overexpression of Plakoglobin was sufficient to fully re-establish the naive pluripotency gene regulatory network under metastable pluripotency conditions, as confirmed by single-cell transcriptome profiling. Finally, we found that in the epiblast, Plakoglobin was exclusively expressed at the blastocyst stage in human and mouse embryos - further strengthening the link between Plakoglobin and naive pluripotency in vivo.

    "abstract": "Ecosystems are complex systems of various physical, biological, and chemical processes. Since ecosystem dynamics are composed of a mixture of different levels of stochasticity and nonlinearity, handling these data is a challenge for existing methods of time-series based causal inferences. Here we show that, by harnessing contemporary machine learning approaches, the concept of Granger causality can be effectively extended to the analysis of complex ecosystem time series and bridge the gap between dynamical and statistical approaches. The central idea is to use an ensemble of fast and highly predictive artificial neural networks to select a minimal set of variables that maximizes the prediction of a given variable. It enables decomposition of the relationship among variables through quantifying the contribution of an individual variable to the overall predictive performance. We show how our approach, EcohNet, can improve interaction network inference for a mesocosm experiment and simulated ecosystems. The application of the method to a long-term lake monitoring dataset yielded new but interpretable results on the drivers causing cyanobacteria blooms, which is a serious threat to ecological integrity and ecosystem services. Since performance of EcohNet is enhanced by its predictive capabilities, it also provides an optimized forecasting of overall components in ecosystems. EcohNet could be used to analyze complex and hybrid multivariate time series in many scientific areas not limited to ecosystems.\n\nSignificance StatementEffective use of ecosystem monitoring data to resolve global environmental issues is a major challenge of the 21st century ecology. A promising solution to address this challenge is a time-series-based causal analysis which can provide insight on the mechanical links between ecosystem components. In this work, a model-free framework named EcohNet is proposed. EcohNet utilizes ensemble predictions of echo state networks, which are known to be fast, accurate, and highly relevant for a variety of dynamical systems, and can robustly predict causal networks of ecosystem components. It also can provide an optimized forecasting of overall ecosystem components, and could be used to analyze complex and hybrid multivariate time series in many scientific areas, not limited to ecosystems.",

Among dance flies, there is extraordinary variation in sexual dimorphism. Females of many species have conspicuous ornaments (leg scales and inflatable abdominal sacs). Meanwhile males of some species have regions of their eyes with larger ommatidial facets, common traits in many arthropod taxa that allow for regionally elevated photosensitivity and/or acuity. Here, we conduct a comparative study of these traits using both species descriptions available from the literature, as well as quantitative measures of eyes and ornaments from wild-caught flies. We show a conspicuous covariance between exaggerated male dorsal eye regions and the extent of female ornaments: species with highly ornamented females have males with more exaggerated eyes.

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for causal inference, they are unethical in many scenarios. Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used in such cases, but importantly both RCTs and MR assume unidirectional causality. In this paper, we developed a new model, MRDoC2, that can be used to identify bidirectional causation in the presence of confounding due to both familial and non- familial sources. Our model extends the MRDoC model (Minic[a] et al 2018), by simultaneously including risk scores for each trait. Furthermore, the power to detect causal effects in MRDoC2 does not require the phenotypes to have different additive genetic or shared environmental sources of variance, as is the case in the direction of causation twin model (Heath et al., 1993).",

We conducted the first cell-type-specific TWAS of breast cancer in 58,648 women and identified 12 transcriptome-wide significant genes using MiXcan compared with only eight genes using conventional approaches. Importantly, MiXcan identified genes with distinct associations in mammary epithelial versus stromal cells, including three new breast cancer susceptibility genes.

The protein-temperature representations learned by DeepET provide a temperature-related statistical summary of protein sequences and capture structural properties that affect thermal stability. For prediction of enzyme optimal catalytic temperatures and protein melting temperatures via a transfer learning approach, our DeepET model outperforms classical regression models trained on rationally designed features and other recent deep-learning-based representations.

    "abstract": "Although clonal propagation is frequently used in commercial plant breeding and plant biotechnology programs because it minimizes genetic variation, it is not uncommon to observe clonal plants with stable phenotypic changes, a phenomenon known as somaclonal variation. Several studies have shown that epigenetic modifications induced during regeneration are associated with this newly acquired phenotypic variation. However, the factors that determine the extent of somaclonal variation and the molecular changes associated with it remain poorly understood. To address this gap in our knowledge, we compared clonally propagated Arabidopsis thaliana plants derived from somatic embryogenesis using two different embryonic transcription factors-RWP-RK DOMAIN-CONTAINING 4 (RKD4) or LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) and from two epigenetically distinct tissues. We found that both the epi(genetic) status of explant and the regeneration protocol employed play critical roles in shaping the molecular and phenotypic state of clonal plants. Phenotypic variation of regenerated plants can be largely explained by the inheritance of tissue-specific DNA methylation imprints, which are associated with specific transcriptional and metabolic changes in sexual progeny of clonal plants. Moreover, regenerants from roots were particularly affected by the inheritance of epigenetic imprints, which resulted in increased accumulation of salicylic acid in leaves and accelerated plant senescence. Collectively, our data reveal pathways for targeted manipulation of phenotypic variation in clonal plants.",

Using this strategy, we aimed to restore microglia function and ameliorate stroke outcome in aged mice.

In aged mice, a subset of microglia accumulates lipid droplets under steady state and displays exacerbated innate immune responses after stroke.

    "abstract": "The function of long-term memory is not just to reminisce about the past, but also to make predictions that help us behave appropriately and efficiently in the future. This predictive function of memory provides a new perspective on the classic question from memory research of why we remember some things but not others. If prediction is a key outcome of memory, then the extent to which an item generates a prediction signifies that this information already exists in memory and need not be encoded. We tested this principle using human intracranial EEG as a time-resolved method to quantify prediction in visual cortex during a statistical learning task and link the strength of these predictions to subsequent episodic memory behavior. Epilepsy patients of both sexes viewed rapid streams of scenes, some of which contained regularities that allowed the category of the next scene to be predicted. We verified that statistical learning occurred using neural frequency tagging and measured category prediction with multivariate pattern analysis. Although neural prediction was robust overall, this was driven entirely by items that were subsequently forgotten. Such interference provides a mechanism by which prediction can regulate memory formation to prioritize encoding of information that could help learn new predictive relationships.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen faced with a new experience, we are rarely at a loss for what to do. Rather, because many aspects of the world are stable over time, we rely upon past experiences to generate expectations that guide behavior. Here we show that these expectations during a new experience come at the expense of memory for that experience. From intracranial recordings of visual cortex, we decoded what humans expected to see next in a series of photographs based on patterns of neural activity. Photographs that generated strong neural expectations were more likely to be forgotten in a later behavioral memory test. Prioritizing the storage of experiences that currently lead to weak expectations could help improve these expectations in future encounters.",

    "abstract": "Saccadic eye-movements play a crucial role in visuo-motor control by allowing rapid foveation onto new targets. However, the neural processes governing saccades adaptation are not fully understood. Saccades, due to the short-time of execution (20-100 ms) and the absence of sensory information for online feedback control, must be controlled in a ballistic manner. Incomplete measurements of the movement trajectory, such as the visual end-point error, are supposedly used to form internal predictions about the movement kinematics resulting in predictive control. In order to characterize the synaptic and neural circuit mechanisms underlying predictive saccadic control, we have reconstructed the saccadic system in a digital controller embedding a spiking neural network of the cerebellum with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules driving parallel fiber - Purkinje cell long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD). This model implements a control policy based on a dual plasticity mechanism, resulting in the identification of the roles of LTP and LTD in optimizing saccade movement control: it turns out that LTD regulates the accuracy and LTP the speed (vigor) of the ballistic eye movement. The control policy also required cerebellar PCs to be divided into two subpopulations, characterized by burst or pause responses. To our knowledge, this is the first model that explains in mechanistic terms the accuracy and vigor regulation of ballistic eye movements in forward mode exploiting spike-timing to regulate firing in different populations of the neuronal network. This elementary model of saccades could be extended and applied to other more complex cases in which single jerks are concatenated to compose articulated and coordinated movements.\n\nAuthor summaryIt has been suggested that the cerebellum plays a crucial role in oculomotor adaptation. Computationally, the cerebellum is described as a supervised learner whose activity can be adjusted by synaptic changes proportional to the amount of mismatch between expected and actual movements outcomes (sensorimotor-errors). However, the spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) underlying adaptation has been so far modeled in behaviors where the error is continuously available as tracking-error. Such models depend on detailed tracking-errors to improve movement quality. We asked if the cerebellum can maintain good motor control even if the error is not completely available? This is important considering that error-dependent-STDP is only a subset among a family of STDP processes in the cerebellum. Moreover, even the physiological signals that were generally thought to carry sensorimotor-errors (called complex-spikes) are shown to encode multiple types of information regarding the movement. In this context, we characterize the role of cerebellar STDPs in saccade control, where the error information is constrained because of sensory suppression. We show that even in the absence of detailed error, the cerebellum can leverage two of its STDPs to increase movement quality. Hence, we emphasize the need to go beyond error-centric view to understand how the cerebellum improves motor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have provided insights into the immune response to COVID-19; however, little is known about the immunological changes and immune signaling occurring during COVID-19 resolution. Individual heterogeneity and variable disease resolution timelines obscure unifying immune characteristics. Here, we collected and profiled >200 longitudinal peripheral blood samples from patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with other respiratory infections, and healthy individuals, using mass cytometry to measure immune cells and signaling states at single cell resolution. COVID-19 patients showed a unique immune composition and an early, coordinated and elevated immune cell signaling profile, which correlated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient time course analysis tied to clinically relevant events of recovery revealed a conserved set of immunological processes that accompany, and are unique to, disease resolution and discharge. This immunological process, together with additional changes in CD4 regulatory T cells and basophils, accompanies recovery from respiratory failure and is associated with better clinical outcomes at the time of admission. Our work elucidates the biological timeline of immune recovery from COVID-19 and provides insights into the fundamental processes of COVID-19 resolution in hospitalized patients.",

    "abstract": "Size-selective harvesting evolutionary alters the life-history, behavioural and physiological traits in exploited fish populations. Changes in these traits may cause alteration in learning and decision-making abilities, either due to energetic trade-offs with brain investment that may vary across development or via correlations with boldness, sociability or other personality traits. Whether size-selective harvesting evolutionarily alters learning and decision-making abilities in fish remains unexplored, despite the global scale of fisheries. We tested the hypothesis that persistent removal of large-bodied individuals typical of many fisheries reduces learning ability in adults but not in juveniles, increases cognitive flexibility but reduces decision-making ability in adults. We examined associative learning through ontogeny, and reversal learning and collective decision-making in adults in three selection lines of zebrafish (Danio rerio) generated through positive, negative and random size-selective harvesting for five generations. Fish groups of each selection line were tested across ontogeny using a colour-discrimination paradigm with a food reward. The associative reversal task was conducted with a social reward, and the propensity to make group decisions was tested in an associative task. All selection lines showed significant learning ability and improved performance across ontogeny. Consistent with our hypothesis, the large-harvested line fish revealed a significantly reduced learning speed as subadults and adults, while the small-harvested line fish showed slower error rate compared to controls as 4-month old adults. We found no evidence of memory decay, and the selection lines did not vary in associative reversal ability. Decision-making speed did not vary across lines, but the large-harvested line made faster decisions during the probe trial. We conclude that size-selective harvesting typical of many fisheries evolutionarily alters learning and decision making. As this is likely to negatively and persistently affect resource acquisition and survival in exploited populations, we suggest that the cognition-related mechanism we identify may increase natural mortality.",

    "abstract": "As newer variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to pose major threats to global human health and economy, identifying novel druggable antiviral targets is the key towards sustenance. Here, we identify an evolutionary conserved \"E-L-L\" motif present within the HR2 domain of all human and non-human coronavirus spike (S) proteins that play a crucial role in stabilizing the post-fusion six-helix bundle (6-HB) structure and thus, fusion-mediated viral entry. Mutations within this motif reduce the fusogenicity of the S protein without affecting its stability or membrane localization. We found that posaconazole, an FDA-approved drug, binds to this \"E-L-L\" motif resulting in effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells. While posaconazole exhibits high efficacy towards blocking S protein-mediated viral entry, mutations within the \"E-L-L\" motif rendered the protein completely resistant to the drug, establishing its specificity towards this motif. Our data demonstrate that posaconazole restricts early stages of infection through specific inhibition of membrane fusion and viral genome release into the host cell and is equally effective towards all major variants of concerns of SARS-CoV-2 including beta, kappa, delta, and omicron. Together, we show that this conserved essential \"E-L-L\" motif is an ideal target for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2.",

Vaccines have been successful in reducing rates of infection and hospitalization, but there is still a need for an acute treatment for the disease. We investigate whether compounds that bind the human ACE2 protein can interrupt SARS-CoV-2 replication without damaging ACE2s natural enzymatic function. Initial compounds were screened for binding to ACE2 but little interruption of ACE2 enzymatic activity. This set of compounds was extended by application of quantitative structure-activity analysis, which resulted in 512 virtual hits for further confirmatory screening. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 replication assay revealed that five of these compounds inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Further effort is required to completely determine the antiviral mechanism of these compounds, but they serve as a strong starting point for both development of acute treatments for COVID-19 and research into the mechanism of infection.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=98 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484484v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@173d7c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c0021org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c9caaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d23_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TOC Graphic: Overall study design.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two essential plant macronutrients that can limit plant growth by different mechanisms. We aimed to shed light on how soybean respond to low nitrogen (LN), low phosphorus (LP) and their combined deficiency (LNP). Generally, these conditions triggered changes in gene expression of the same processes, including cell wall organization, defense response, response to oxidative stress, and photosynthesis, however, response was different in each condition. A typical primary response to LN and LP was detected also in soybean, i.e., the enhanced uptake of N and P, respectively, by upregulation of genes for the corresponding transporters. The regulation of genes involved in cell wall organization showed that in LP roots tended to produce more casparian strip, in LN more secondary wall biosynthesis occurred, and in LNP reduction in expression of genes involved in secondary wall production accompanied by cell wall loosening was observed. Flavonoid biosynthesis also showed distinct pattern of regulation in different conditions: more anthocyanin production in LP, and more isoflavonoid production in LN and LNP, which we confirmed also on the metabolite level. Interestingly, in soybean the nutrient deficiencies reduced defense response by lowering expression of genes involved in defense response, suggesting a role of N and P nutrition in plant disease resistance. In conclusion, we provide detailed information on how LN, LP, and LNP affect different processes in soybean roots on the molecular and physiological levels.",

    "abstract": "Invasive wild pigs are a global problem and are established in large areas across Canada. Domestic European wild boar were first introduced to Canadian farms in the 1980s, and their escape and intentional release have since led to free-ranging populations, which have expanded rapidly in numbers and range. Wild pigs are associated with widespread damage to crops and natural environments, as well as risks of disease transmission. African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of global concern, that can spread between domestic and free-ranging swine and cause catastrophic economic impacts. As ASF preparedness requires a detailed understanding of the distribution and movements of all pig types, this paper aimed to characterize an unregulated  grey swine market in Canada to understand risks to domestic swine production and potential contributions to free-ranging wild pig populations. Kijiji.ca is a free Canadian internet classified advertising service, almost exclusively cash-based with no receipts and few, if any, records kept of transactions. We monitored Kijiji for sales of domestic wild boar, pot-bellied pigs, and their hybrids across Canada over two months from April 28 - June 30, 2021. Data was collected from all advertisements, including how the seller labelled pigs breed, age, sex, number for sale, sexual intactness, presence of tattoos and/or ear tags, as well as the date and location of the posting. Locations were mapped and compared to the spatial distribution of existing free-ranging wild pigs in Canada to identify areas they were likely to facilitate new populations or potentially supplement and genetically diversify existing populations. We identified 151 advertisements on Kijiji, the most coming from Ontario (34.4%; n = 52) and Alberta (29.1%; n = 44), followed by Saskatchewan (11.3%; n = 17), British Columbia (10.6%; n = 16), Nova Scotia (7.3%; n = 11), New Brunswick (4.0%; n = 6), Manitoba (2.0%; n = 3), Quebec (0.7%; n = 1), and Prince Edward Island (0.7%; n = 1). No listings were observed in Newfoundland and Labrador, or Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. Overall, 62 (41%) of advertisements were within watersheds with existing wild pigs that may contribute to supplementing additional swine, and 89 (59%) were within watersheds where wild pigs have not yet been identified. African swine fever preparedness should include policies and action to address this unmonitored and unregulated sale of swine in Canada, including ear tags, tattoos, genetic analysis, and mandatory reporting.",

    "abstract": "Chronic opioid exposure causes structural and functional changes in brain circuits, which may contribute to opioid use disorders. Synaptic cell-adhesion molecules are prime candidates for mediating this opioid-evoked plasticity. Neuroligin-3 (NL3) is an X-linked postsynaptic adhesion protein that shapes synaptic function at multiple sites in the mesolimbic dopamine system. We therefore studied how genetic knockout of NL3 alters responses to chronic morphine in male mice. Constitutive NL3 knockout caused a persistent reduction in psychomotor sensitization after chronic morphine exposure and changed in the topography of locomotor stimulation produced by morphine. This latter change was recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion of NL3 from cells expressing the Drd1 dopamine receptor, whereas reduced psychomotor sensitization was recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion from dopamine neurons. Without NL3 expression, dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area exhibited diminished activation following chronic morphine exposure, by measuring in vivo calcium signals with fiber photometry. This altered pattern of dopamine neuron activity may be driven by aberrant forms of opioid-evoked synaptic plasticity in the absence of NL3: dopamine neurons lacking NL3 showed weaker synaptic inhibition at baseline, which was subsequently strengthened after chronic morphine. In total, our study highlights neurobiological adaptations in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area that correspond with increased behavioral sensitivity to opioids, and further suggests that NL3 expression by dopamine neurons provides a molecular substrate for opioid-evoked adaptations in brain function and behavior.",

In simulations, our method accurately recovers selective trajectories, and is robust to mis-specification of population size. We applied it to a large dataset of ancient and present-day human genomes from Britain, and identified seven loci with genome-wide significant evidence of selection in the past 4500 years. Almost all of them are related to increased vitamin D or calcium levels, and we conclude that lack of vitamin D and consequent low calcium was consistently the most important selective pressure in Britain since the Bronze Age. However, the strength of selection on individual loci varied substantially over time, suggesting that cultural or environmental factors moderated the genetic response to this pressure. Of 28 complex anthropometric and metabolic traits, skin pigmentation was the only one with significant evidence of polygenic selection, further underscoring the importance of phenotypes related to vitamin D. Our approach illustrates the power of ancient DNA to characterize selection in human populations and illuminates the recent evolutionary history of Britain.",

We present metabolic labeling with propargyl-selenohomocysteine (PSH) in combination with click chemistry to detect N6- methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytidine (m5C) sites in mRNA with single nucleotide precision in the same sequencing run (MePMe-seq). Intracellular formation of the corresponding SAM analogue leads to detectable levels of N6-propargyl-A (prop6A) and 5-propargyl-C (prop5C). MePMe-seq overcomes the problems of antibodies for enrichment and sequence-motifs for evaluation, limiting previous methodologies.

In this study, we seek to define possible new targetable sites on the apo structure of TDP-43 RRM domains. To do so, we used molecular dynamic (MD) simulations on the NMR solved TDP-43RRM1-2 structure bound to RNA to predict the apo structure. Contact analysis of TDP-43 showed that while the integrity of the individual domains was maintained upon RNA removal, a decrease in interdomain contacts was observed. Moreover, we compared apo TDP-43 structures obtained from MD to AlphaFold 2 (AF2) predicted TDP-43 structures and found differences in loop regions. A Sitemap analysis identified five druggable sites for the RNA bound structure solved by NMR, while fewer sites were identified following MD simulations and AF2 predicted apo structures.",

The prevailing interpretation of QS is that by sensing AI concentrations, bacteria estimate population density to regulate the expression of functions that are only beneficial when carried out by a sufficiently large number of cells. However, a major challenge to this interpretation is that the concentration of AIs strongly depends on the environment, often rendering AI-based estimates of cell density unreliable. Here we propose an alternative interpretation of QS, where bacteria, by releasing and sensing AIs, harness social interactions to sense the environment as a collective. As shown by a model, this functionality can explain the evolution of QS, and results from individuals improving their estimation accuracy by pooling many imperfect estimates - analogous to the  wisdom of the crowds in decision theory.

    "abstract": "The obligate intracellular bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, replicates within a parasitophorous vacuole termed an inclusion. During development, host proteins critical for regulating intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis interact with the inclusion membrane. The inclusion membrane protein, MrcA, interacts with the inositol-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), an ER cationic channel that conducts Ca2+. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an ER transmembrane protein important for regulating store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), localizes to the inclusion membrane via an uncharacterized interaction. We therefore examined Ca2+ mobilization in C. trachomatis infected cells. Utilizing a variety of Ca2+ indicators to assess changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, we demonstrate that C. trachomatis impairs host cell SOCE. Ca2+ regulates many cellular signaling pathways. We find that the SOCE-dependent NFAT/calcineurin signaling pathway is impaired in C. trachomatis L2 infected HeLa cells and likely has major implications on host cell physiology as it relates to C. trachomatis pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Puccinia triticina is a highly damaging wheat pathogen. The efficacy of leaf rust control by genetic resistance is mitigated by the adaptive capacity of the pathogen, expressed as changes in its virulence combinations (pathotypes). An extensive P. triticina population survey has been carried out in France over the last 30 years, describing the evolution dynamics of this pathogen in response to cultivar deployment. We analyzed the dataset for the 2006-2016 period to determine the relationship between the Lr genes in the cultivars and virulence in the pathotypes. Rust populations were dominated by a small number of pathotypes, with variations in most of the virulence frequencies related to the corresponding Lr gene frequencies in the cultivated landscape. Furthermore, the emergence and spread of a new virulence matched the introduction and use of the corresponding Lr gene (Lr28), confirming that the deployment of qualitative resistance genes is an essential driver of evolution in P. triticina populations. However, PCA revealed that certain pathotype-cultivar associations cannot be explained solely by the distribution of Lr genes in the landscape. This conclusion is supported by the predominance of a few pathotypes on some cultivars, with the persistence of several other compatible pathotypes at low frequencies. Specific interactions are not, therefore, sufficient to explain the distribution of virulence in rust populations. Our findings suggest that aggressiveness is a driver of changes in pathotype frequencies. Accordingly, the hypothesis of \"dual selection\", based on both qualitative and quantitative interactions between P. triticina populations and bread wheat cultivars, is favored.",

    "abstract": "Brucellosis imposes substantial impacts on livestock production and public health worldwide. A stochastic, age-structured model incorporating herd demographics was developed describing within- and between-herd transmission of Brucella abortus in dairy cattle herds. The model was fitted to data from a cross-sectional study conducted in Punjab State of India and used to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies under consideration. Based on model results, stakeholder acceptance and constraints regarding vaccine supply, vaccination of replacement calves in large farms should be prioritised. Test and removal applied at early stages of the control programme where seroprevalence is high would not constitute an effective use of resources. Critically, under current model assumptions, significant numbers of animals  removed (culled or not used for breeding) in this strategy would be removed based on false positive results. To achieve sustained reductions in brucellosis, policymakers must commit to maintaining vaccination in the long term, which may eventually reduce frequency of infection in the livestock reservoir to a low enough level for elimination to be a realistic objective. This exercise provided important insights into the control of brucellosis in India, which has the largest cattle population globally, and a general framework for evaluating control strategies in endemic settings.",

    "abstract": "One interference mechanism of bacterial competition is the production of antibiotics. Bacteria exposed to antibiotics can resist antibiotic inhibition through intrinsic and/or acquired mechanisms. Here, we performed a coevolution experiment to understand long-term consequences of antibiotic production and antibiotic resistance for two environmental bacterial strains. We grew five independent lines of the antibiotic-producing environmental strain, Burkholderia thailandensis E264, and the antibiotic-inhibited environmental strain, Flavobacterium johnsoniae UW101, together and separately on agar plates for 7.5 months (1.5 month incubations), transferring each line five times to new agar plates. We first observed that the F. johnsoniae ancestor could tolerate the B. thailandensis-produced antibiotic through efflux mechanisms. We then sequenced the genomes of clonal isolates from the coevolved and monoculture F. johnsoniae lines, and uncovered mutational ramifications to the long-term antibiotic exposure. The coevolved genomes from F. johnsoniae revealed four potential mutational signatures of antibiotic resistance that were not observed in the evolved monoculture lines. Two mutations were found in tolC: one corresponding to a 33 bp deletion and the other corresponding to a nonsynonymous mutation. A third mutation was observed as a 1 bp insertion coding for a RagB/SusD nutrient uptake protein. The last mutation was a G83R nonsynonymous mutation in acetyl-coA carboxylayse carboxyltransferase subunit alpha (AccA). Placing the tolC 33 bp deletion back into the F. johnsoniae ancestor conferred some antibiotic resistance, but not to the degree of resistance observed in coevolved lines. Furthermore, the accA mutation matched a previously described mutation conferring resistance to B. thailandensis-produced thailandamide. Analysis of B. thailandensis transposon mutants for thailandamide production revealed that thailandamide was bioactive against F. johnsoniae, but also suggested that additional B. thailandensis-produced antibiotics were involved in the inhibition of F. johnsoniae. This study reveals how long-term interspecies chemical interactions can result in a novel mutation in efflux that contribute to antibiotic resistance.",

It encapsulates carbonic anhydrase and Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalysing carbon fixation inside a proteinaceous shell. How Rubisco packs into the carboxysomes is unknown. Using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, we present 3D organization of Rubisco inside two types of native -carboxysomes from a marine -cyanobacterium Cyanobium sp.

We determined the structures of Rubiscos within native Halothiobacillus and Cyanobium carboxysomes at 3.3 [A] and 3.8 [A] resolution respectively and further identified an associated CsoS2 segment. Interestingly, CsoS2 is only associated with a sub-population of Rubiscos that are close to the shell in Halothiobacillus, but with all Rubiscos throughout Cyanobium carboxysome. Moreover, Rubiscos in Cyanobium carboxysomes are organized in three concentric layers whereas Rubiscos in Halothiobacillus carboxysomes are arranged in spiral arrays. Calcium treatment induced a drastic re-organization of Rubiscos, converting these two distinct assemblies into ordered lattice arrays in both -carboxysomes. Our findings provide critical knowledge of the assembly principles of -carboxysomes, which may aid in rational design and repurpose of carboxysome structures for new functions.",

    "abstract": "Rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria is needed for rapid diagnostics allowing adequate and timely treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of Secondary Electro-Spray Ionization-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (SESI-HRMS) as a diagnostic tool for rapid detection of bacterial infections and compare its performance with the current standard of diagnostics. We compared the time required to confirm growth of the pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by conventional detection by culture and MAL-DI-TOF vs. detection of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by these human pathobionts. SESI-HRMS could consistently detect VOCs produced by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae on blood agar plates within minutes, allowing to positively identify bacteria within hours. Unique S. aureus and S. pneumoniae features were detected already at bacterial densities as low as [~]103 colony forming units. Rich mass spectral fingerprints allowed for the distinction of these two bacteria on a species and even strain level. To give an incentive towards clinical application of this technology, further analyzed 17 clinical samples previously diagnosed by conventional methods. We predominantly obtained a separation of samples which showed growth (i.e. presence of living bacteria) compared to samples with no bacterial growth (i.e. presence of dead bacteria). We conclude that SESI-HRMS allows rapid identification of unique bacterial features. Further development of real-time analysis of clinical samples by SESI-HRMS will shorten the time required for microbiological diagnosis with a high level of confidence and sensitivity and should help to improve patients tailored treatment.\n\nIMPORTANCEA timely identification of a pathogenic bacteria causing the infection is of pivotal importance for the initiation of an adequate antimicrobial therapy. In this regard, different technologies have been developed with the aim to achieve a highly reliable, specific, and overall fast identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, conventional diagnostic techniques still require long preprocessing times (hours to days) to acquire enough biological material for an accurate identification of the pathogen. Therefore, in this work, we aimed to further shorten the detection time of current gold standards for microbiological diagnostics by providing a system capable of a fast, sensitive and specific discrimination of different pathogenic bacteria. This system relies on the real-time mass spectrometric detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by a given organism during its growth, potentially leading to a significant shortening of the time required to obtain a positive reliable diagnostic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) is a major respiratory pathogen that causes acute respiratory infections in infants and children. Since September 2021, an out-of-season HPIV3 rebound has been noted in Korea. The objective of this study was to analyze the molecular characteristics of the HPIV3 strains responsible for the outbreak in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nMethodsA total of 61 HPIV3-positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected between October and November 2021. Using 33 HPIV3-positive specimens, partial nucleotide sequences of the HPIV3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene were aligned with previously published HN gene sequences for phylogenetic and genetic distance (p-distance) analyses.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic tree revealed that all Seoul HPIV3 strains grouped within the phylogenetic subcluster C3. However, these strains formed a unique cluster that branched separately from the C3a lineage. This cluster showed 99% bootstrap support with a p-distance < 0.001. Genetic distances within the other C3 lineages ranged from 0.013 (C3a) to 0.023 (C3c). Deduced amino acid sequences of the HN gene revealed four protein substitutions in Seoul HPIV3 strains that have rarely been observed in other reference strains: A22T, K31N, G387S, and E514K.\n\nConclusionsPhylogenetic analysis of Seoul HPIV3 strains revealed that the strain belonged to a separate cluster within subcluster C3. Genetic distances among strains within subcluster C3 suggest the emergence of a new genetic lineage. The emergence of a new genetic lineage could pose a potential risk of a new epidemic. Further monitoring of the circulating HPIV3 strains is needed to understand the importance of newly discovered mutations.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is infamous among flaviviruses for its unique association with congenital birth defects, notably microcephaly. We previously mapped ZIKV-host protein interactions and identified the interaction between ZIKV NS4A and host ANKLE2, which itself has established ties to congenital microcephaly. In fruit flies, NS4A induces microcephaly phenotypes in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. This suggests that NS4A interacts with ANKLE2 to dysregulate cell behavior and contributes to abnormal host neurodevelopment. Here, we explore the role of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication to understand the biological significance of the interaction from the viral perspective. We show that knockdown of ANKLE2 reduces replication of two ZIKV strains, across multiple MOIs and timepoints. We observe that localization of ANKLE2 is drastically shifted to sites of NS4A accumulation during infection. We investigate which domains of ANKLE2 mediate this behavior and the interaction with NS4A. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we show that deletion of either the transmembrane or LEM domain has little impact on the interaction, but deletion of both significantly reduces interaction with NS4A. We show that the C-terminal transmembrane domains of NS4A stabilize the interaction with ANKLE2. Finally, we explore this interaction in other flaviviruses and observe ANKLE2 interacts with NS4A across four additional mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Together, these results suggest NS4A interacts with ANKLE2 through a combination of its transmembrane and LEM domains, bringing it to sites of ZIKV replication to promote replication through an unknown mechanism. Taken together with our previous results, our findings indicate that, in the process of hijacking ANKLE2 for replication, ZIKV disrupts its physiological function to cause disease.\n\nImportanceThe ZIKV epidemic led to the astonishing revelation that congenital ZIKV infection is associated with devastating birth defects, including microcephaly. Microcephaly is the condition in which head and brain size are severely reduced, and is often accompanied by intellectual disability. The molecular mechanisms by which ZIKV replicates and causes microcephaly are still incompletely understood. We previously identified the protein interaction between ZIKV NS4A and host ANKLE2, which is associated with congenital microcephaly. In flies, NS4A induces microcephaly in an ANKLE2-dependent manner, suggesting this interaction is crucial for ZIKV pathogenesis. Here, we explore the relevance of this physical interaction for virus replication. We find that ANKLE2 promotes ZIKV replication, concentrates at sites of NS4A accumulation during infection, and interacts with NS4A via its N-terminal domain. Thus, this represents a rare example of a ZIKV-host protein interaction that impacts both disease and virus replication.",

    "abstract": "The Antarctic ecosystem is a combination of conditions including extremely low values of temperature. The environmental temperature is one of the parameters thoroughly affecting the structure and composition of fungal membranes lipids. The psychrophilic fungi generally increase the disorder within macromolecules to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. The strategy adopted by Antarctic fungi is to increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acid that allows maintaining a semi-fluid state of the membranes. This ecological feature might be exploited for using Antarctic fungi as potential alternative source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for human diet.\n\nThis study provides both the characterization of fungal strains isolated from Antarctica by lipidomic analysis and the laboratory/large-scale production of fungal biomass with high content of beneficial PUFAs. In detail, three fungal species isolated from environmental matrices from Antarctica were tested and identified at genome level. Growth experiments to evaluate the influence of temperature and substrate in the yield in biomass and unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) were conducted. The results showed that the selected fungi have a high percentage of UFA compared to saturated ones; low growth temperatures increase the yield in linolenic fatty acid (C18:3); the biomass yield depends on the composition of the growth substrate and a satisfying qualitative-quantitative yield has also been obtained by using an agri-food chain waste product as growth substrate.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in human and animal diet is gaining attention because PUFAs have several recognized functional properties: they modulate immune response, have anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activity, cardio-protective effect and reduce blood LDL cholesterol levels. Human diets typically do not contain sufficient PUFAs because foods rich in PUFAs are few and it is therefore necessary to supplement this diet. Food supplements with these types of fatty acid currently commercially available come from marine fish oils and this source is no longer sustainable. It is necessary to develop efficient industrial processes capable of producing good quality PUFAs and in quantity, even using as carbon and nitrogen sources agro-industrial chains (in our case spent yeast from brewing and whey waste) waste products. Like microorganisms we used Antarctic fungi because they are adapted at very low temperature increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acid that allows maintaining a semi-fluid state of the membranes.",

    "abstract": "A male mutation bias is observed across vertebrates, and, where data are available, this bias is accompanied by increased per-generation mutation rates with parental age. While continuing mitotic cell division in the male germline post-puberty has been proposed as the major cellular mechanism underlying both patterns, little direct evidence for this role has been found. Understanding the evolution of the per-generation mutation rate among species requires that we identify the molecular mechanisms that change between species. Here, we study the per-generation mutation rate in an extended pedigree of the brown (grizzly) bear, Ursus arctos horribilis. Brown bears hibernate for one-third of the year, a period during which spermatogenesis slows or stops altogether. The cessation of spermatogenesis is predicted to lessen the male mutation bias and to lower the per-generation mutation rate in this species. However, using whole-genome sequencing, we find that both male bias and per-generation mutation rates are the same as expected for a non-hibernating species. We also carry out a phylogenetic comparison of substitution rates along the lineage leading to brown bear and panda (a non-hibernating species) and find no slowing of the substitution rate in the hibernator. Our results contribute to accumulating evidence that suggests that male germline cell division is not the major determinant of mutation rates and mutation biases. The results also provide a quantitative basis for improved estimates of the timing of carnivore evolution.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic elements that encode a wide variety of phenotypes and can be maintained in bacterial populations through vertical and horizontal transmission, thus increasing bacterial adaptation to hostile environmental conditions like those imposed by antimicrobial sub-stances. To circumvent the segregational instability resulting from randomly distributing plasmids between daughter cells upon division, non-transmissible plasmids tend to be carried in multiple copies per cell, with the added benefit of exhibiting increased gene dosage and resistance levels. But carrying multiple copies also results in a high metabolic burden to the bacterial host, therefore reducing the overall fitness of the population. This trade-off poses an existential question for plasmids: What is the optimal plasmid copy number? In this manuscript, we address this question by postulating and analyzing a population genetics model to evaluate the interaction between selective pressure, the number of plasmid copies carried by each cell, and the metabolic burden associated with plasmid bearing in the absence of selection for plasmid-encoded traits. Parameter values of the model were estimated experimentally using Escherichia coli K12 carrying a multicopy plasmid encoding for a fluorescent protein and blaTEM-1, a gene conferring resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. By numerically determining the optimal plasmid copy number for constant and fluctuating selection regimes, we show that plasmid copy number is a highly optimized evolutionary trait that depends on the rate of environmental fluctuation and balances the benefit between increased stability in the absence of selection with the burden associated with carrying multiple copies of the plasmid.",

    "abstract": "The Trithorax group (trxG) proteins counteract repressive effect of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes and maintain transcriptional memory of active states of key developmental genes. Although, chromatin structure and modifications appear to play a fundamental role in this process, it is not clear how trxG prevents PcG-silencing and heritably maintain an active gene expression state. Here, we report a hitherto unknown role of Drosophila Multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain (Mask), which emerged as one of the candidate trxG genes in our reverse genetic screen. The genome-wide binding profile of Mask correlates with known trxG binding sites across Drosophila genome. In particular, association of Mask at chromatin overlaps with CBP and H3K27ac, which are known hallmarks of actively transcribed genes by trxG. Importantly, Mask predominantly associates with actively transcribed genes in Drosophila. Depletion of Mask not only results in downregulation of trxG targets but also correlates with drastic reduction in H3K27ac levels and an increased H3K27me3 levels. The fact that MASK positively regulates H3K27ac levels in flies was also found to be conserved in human cells. Finally, strong suppression of Pc mutant phenotype by mutation in mask provides physiological relevance that Mask contributes to the anti-silencing effect of trxG, maintaining expression of key developmental genes. Since Mask is a downstream effector of multiple cell signaling pathways, we propose that Mask may connect cell signaling with chromatin mediated epigenetic cell memory governed by trxG.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that hundreds of small proteins were occulted when protein coding genes were annotated. These proteins, called alternative proteins, have failed to be annotated notably due to the short length of their open reading frame (less than 100 codons) or the enforced rule establishing that messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are monocystronic. Several alternative proteins were shown to be biologically active molecules and seem to be involved in a wide range of biological functions. However, genome wide exploration of the alternative proteome is still limited to a few species. In the present article we describe a deep peptidomics workflow which enabled the identification of 401 alternative proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Subcellular localization, protein domains and short linear motifs were predicted for 235 of the alternative proteins identified and point towards specific functions of these small proteins. Several alternative proteins had approximated abundances higher than their canonical counterparts, suggesting that these alternative proteins are actually the main products of their corresponding genes. Finally, we observed fourteen alternative proteins with developmentally regulated expression patterns and ten induced upon heat shock treatment of embryos, demonstrating stage or stress specific production of alternative proteins.",

    "abstract": "SummarySince the inception of single-cell level measuring techniques, identification of distinct cell stages, phenotypes and populations has been a challenge. Cell clustering and dimensionality reduction methods are the most popular approaches to identify heterogeneity of single-cell data. But, as public repositories continue to grow in number, integrative analyses and merging of large pools of samples from different and heterogeneous datasets becomes a difficult challenge, which showcases the impossibility of scalability of some of the existing methods. Here we present ClusterFoldSimilarity, an R package that calculates a measure of similarity between clusters from different datasets/batches, without the need of correcting for batch effect or normalizing and merging the data, thus avoiding artifacts and the loss of information derived from these kinds of techniques. The similarity metric is based on the average vector module and sign of the product of logarithmic fold-changes. ClusterFoldSimilarity compares every single pair of clusters from any number of different samples/datasets, including different number of clusters for each sample. Additionally, the algorithm is able to select the top genes which contribute the most to the similarity of two specific clusters, serving also as a feature selection tool.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe algorithm is freely available as an R package at: https://github.com/OscarGVelasco/ClusterFoldSimilarity\n\nContactoscargvelasco@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Our current understanding of the bacterial cell cycle is framed largely by population-based experiments that focus on the behavior of idealized average cells. Most famously, the contributions of Cooper and Helmstetter help to contextualize the phenomenon of overlapping replication cycles observed in rapidly growing bacteria. Despite the undeniable value of these approaches, their necessary reliance on the behavior of idealized average cells washes out the stochasticity inherent in single cell growth and physiology limiting their mechanistic value. To bridge this gap, we propose an updated and agnostic framework, informed by extant single-cell data, that quantitatively accounts for stochastic variations in single-cell dynamics and the impact of medium composition on cell growth and cell cycle progression. In this framework, stochastic timers sensitive to medium composition impact the relationship between cell cycle events, accounting for observed differences in the relationship between cell cycle events in slow and fast growing cells. We conclude with a roadmap for potential application of this framework to longstanding open questions in the bacterial cell cycle field.",

To evaluate methylation associated regulation in AT/RTs, we compared them to medulloblastomas and choroid plexus tumors by integrating DNA methylation (507 samples), gene expression (120 samples), and public transcription factor (TF) binding data. We showed that elevated DNA methylation masks the binding sites of TFs driving neural development and is associated with reduced transcription for specific neural regulators in AT/RTs. Part of the hypermethylated sites behaved similarly in AT/RTs and pluripotent stem cells, revealing DNA methylation -driven halted cell differentiation. AT/RT-unique DNA hypermethylation was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 members, like EZH2, and linked to suppressed genes with a role in neural development and tumorigenesis. The obtained results highlight and characterize these DNA methylation programs as drivers of AT/RT malignancy.",

Tumor-induced immunosuppression diminishes the efficacy of endogenous immune responses and decreases the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we describe a new immunosuppressive pathway in which adenosine promotes Cbl-b-mediated Notch1 degradation, causing suppression of CD8+ T-cells effector functions. Genetic KO and pharmacological inhibition of Cbl-b prevents Notch1 degradation in response to adenosine and reactivates its signaling. Reactivation of Notch1 results in enhanced CD8+ T-cell effector functions, anti-cancer response and resistance to immunosuppression.

Many cell-free biosensors rely on transcription factors responding to small molecules, but their discovery and implementation still remain challenging. Here we report the engineering of PeroxiHUB, an optimized H2O2-centered sensing platform supporting cell-free detection of different metabolites. H2O2 is a central metabolite and a by-product of numerous enzymatic reactions. PeroxiHUB uses enzymatic transducers to convert metabolites of interest into H2O2, enabling rapid reprogramming of sensor specificity using alternative transducers. We first screen several transcription factors and optimize OxyR for the transcriptional response to H2O2 in cell-free, highlighting the need for pre-incubation steps to obtain suitable signal-to-noise ratios. We then demonstrate modular detection of metabolites of clinical interest - lactate, sarcosine, and choline - using different transducers mined via a custom retro-synthesis workflow publicly available on the SynBioCAD Galaxy portal. We find that expressing the transducer during the pre-incubation step is crucial for optimal sensor operation. Finally, we show that different reporters can be connected to PeroxiHUB, providing high adaptability for various applications. Given the wide range of enzymatic reactions producing H2O2, the PeroxiHUB platform will support cell-free detection of a large number of metabolites in a modular and scalable fashion.",

However, their strain-specificity in direct and indirect immune modulation remain largely uncharacterized. We have shown that B. pseudolongum UMB-MBP-01, a murine isolate, is capable of suppressing inflammation and reducing fibrosis in vivo. To ascertain the mechanism driving this activity and to determine if it is specific to UMB-MBP-01, we compared it to B. pseudolongum type strain ATCC25526 of porcine origin using a combination of in vitro and in vivo experimentation and comparative genomics approaches. Despite many shared features, we demonstrate that these two strains possess distinct genetic repertoires in carbohydrate assimilation, differential activation signatures and cytokine responses in innate immune cells, and differential effects on lymph node morphology with unique local and systemic leukocyte distribution. Importantly, the administration of each B. pseudolongum strain resulted in major divergence in the structure, composition, and function of gut microbiota. This was accompanied by markedly different changes in intestinal transcriptional activities, suggesting strain-specific modulation of the endogenous gut microbiota as a key to host responses of immune modulation and changes in intestinal B. pseudolongum strains. These observations highlight the importance of strain-specificity characteristics of Bifidobacterium for prophylactic supplementation for immune modulation and advance our understanding of the mechanisms which drive the association between Bifidobacterium and health benefit.",

From the proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged Cyr1, 38 were assigned as authentic Cyr1-interacting partners, including two previously characterized Cyr1-binding proteins, Cap1 and Act1. Many of the identified proteins remain uncharacterized, but some can be classified into several functional groups, such as actin regulatory proteins, cell wall components, and mitochondrial proteins. We used biochemical and genetic methods to further characterize the interaction of Cyr1 with Mp65, a cell surface mannoprotein previously reported to have a role in cell wall integrity and possess several virulence-related traits. Taken together, our comprehensive analysis of the Cyr1-interacting proteins provides important information for establishing the Cyr1 interactome and uncovers a potential role for cell wall proteins in Cyr1-mediated cAMP signaling.",

Here, we investigated the role of a previously uncharacterized protein, BvaP, in GBS vaginal colonization. BvaP was previously identified as the most highly upregulated gene in the GBS A909 transcriptome when comparing vaginal colonization to growth in liquid culture. We found that expression of BvaP affects GBS adherence to extracellular matrix components and human vaginal epithelial cells and a{Delta} bvaP mutant was significantly decreased in its ability to colonize the murine vaginal tract. Cellular morphological alterations such as changes in cell shape, chain length, and clumping were also observed in a knockout mutant strain. Given its high expression in vivo, high degree of conservation among GBS strains, and role in vaginal colonization, BvaP may be an eligible target for GBS vaccination and/or drug therapy.\n\nIMPORTANCENeonatal GBS disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and maternal vaginal colonization is the leading risk factor for disease. Colonization prevention would greatly impact rates of disease transmission, but vaccine development has stalled as capsular polysaccharide vaccines have low immunogenicity in vivo. While these vaccines are still in development, addition of a protein conjugate may prove fruitful in increasing immunogenicity and strain coverage across GBS serotypes. Previous research identified sak_1753 as a gene very highly upregulated gene during murine vaginal colonization. This study reveals that Sak_1753 is required to maintain proper GBS cellular morphology and colonization phenotypes and is required for in vivo vaginal colonization in a murine model. We have renamed Sak_1753 Group B Strep vaginal adherence protein (BvaP). The findings of this study indicate that BvaP is important in GBS colonization of the vaginal tract and may be a candidate for vaccine development.",

Based on this system, we generated a human osteosarcoma cell line which allows for inducible expression of an EGFP-fusion of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), which has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Consistent with previous findings, TDP-43 overexpression led to the accumulation of aggregates and limited the viability of U2OS. Using this inducible system, we conducted a chemical screen with a library that included FDA-approved drugs. While the primary screen identified several compounds that prevented TDP-43 toxicity, further experiments revealed that these chemicals abrogated doxycyclinedependent TDP-43 expression. This antagonistic effect was observed with both doxycycline and tetracycline, and in several Tet-On cell lines expressing different genes, confirming the general effect of these compounds as inhibitors of the tetR system. Using the same cell line, a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identified epigenetic regulators such as the G9a methyltransferase or TRIM28 as potential modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity. Yet again, further experiments revealed that G9a inhibition or TRIM28 loss prevented doxycycline-dependent expression of TDP-43. Together, these results suggest that none of the medically approved drugs significantly mitigates TDP-43 toxicity, identify new chemical and genetic regulators of the tetR system, and raise awareness on the limitations of this approach to conduct chemical or genetic screenings in mammalian cells.",

These complexes have been termed assemblysomes, a type of soluble condensates distinct from other known granules. Here, we use bioinformatics to identify additional proteins that likely form assemblysomes during translation. We characterize soluble condensates of the DNA helicase Sgs1, one such identified protein and a key player in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in yeast. We show that paused ribosome-associated nascent chains of Sgs1 in condensates are able to resume translation upon UV irradiation, consistent with the return of mRNA to the ribosome pool. By extending our studies to human cell lines, we found that EDTA-resistant pellets of ribosomes from the human prostate cancer cell line DU145 are sensitive to treatment with 1,6-hexanediol, which is known to dissolve liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates. In addition, transmission electron microscopy shows that 1,6-hexanediol dissolves ring ribosomal structures from the cytoplasm of radioresistant A549 cells while making the cells more sensitive to X-rays. These results suggest that the stress response is based on a conserved mechanism involving the regulated return of phase-separated paused ribosome-nascent chain complexes to translating ribosomes.",

With rates of C-section at approximately 30% of deliveries in the US and that are projected to continue to climb, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which these pregnancy disorders arise and opportunities for intervention are needed. However, there are no animal models to date that comprehensively assess the consequences of uterine injury. Here we describe a rodent model of uterine injury on subsequent in utero outcomes. We observed three distinct phenotypes: increased rates of resorption and death, embryo spacing defects, and placenta accreta-like features of reduced decidua and expansion of invasive trophoblasts. We show that the appearance of embryo spacing defects depends entirely on the phase of estrous cycle at the time of injury. Using RNA-seq, we identified perturbations in the expression of components of the COX/prostaglandin pathway after recovery from injury, a pathway that has previously been demonstrated to play an important role in embryo spacing. Therefore, we demonstrate that uterine damage in this mouse model causes morphological and molecular changes, most notably perturbed expression of COX/prostaglandin pathway-related genes, that ultimately lead to placental and embryonic developmental defects.",

    "abstract": "Variable phenotypes help plants ensure fitness and survival in the face of unpredictable environmental stresses. Leaf bacteria (bacteriomes) can extend plant phenotypes and are well-known to vary from one plant to the next, but little is known about controls on this variation. Here, we find in 9 populations of Arabidopsis thaliana that core leaf bacteriomes are largely, but not completely, shared with other ground-dwelling ruderal plant species. Strength of differentiation between plant species and between A. thaliana populations shifts from year to year, becoming stronger when plants within populations have more similar leaf bacteriomes (less plant-to-plant variation or stochasticity). Interestingly, across different populations, plants with shared leaf aliphatic glucosinolate chemotypes exhibited similar strong year-to-year stochasticity shifts. Therefore, stochasticity of leaf bacteriomes in plant populations changes in specific ways and might be controlled by plant traits, with important implications for how plants adapt to complex and shifting environments.",

    "abstract": "Experimental inactivation of certain genes involved in metabolism attenuates cancer cell growth in vitro. However, loss-of-function mutations in metabolic pathways are not negatively selected in human cancers, indicating that these genes are not essential in vivo. We hypothesize that spontaneous mutations affecting metabolic pathways do not necessarily result in a functional defect because affected cells may be rescued by exchanging metabolites with neighboring wild-type cells via gap junctions. Using fluorescent substances to probe inter-cellular diffusion, we show that colorectal cancer (CRC) cells are coupled by gap junctions assembled from connexins, particularly the constitutively expressed Cx26. In co-cultures of wild-type cells with cells that had inactivated components of pH regulation (SLC9A1), glycolysis (ALDOA), or mitochondrial metabolism (NDUFS1), we show that diffusive coupling was able to rescue the functional defect associated with the inactivation of metabolite-handling genes. Function rescue was dependent on Cx26 channels and reduced phenotypic heterogeneity among cells. Since the phenotypic landscape did not map onto genotype, an individual cell should not be considered as the unit under selection, at least in the case of metabolite-handling processes. Our findings can explain why certain loss-of-function mutations in genes, previously ascribed as being  essential, do not influence the growth of human cancers.",

    "abstract": "The oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) is of interest when investigating the effects of early adversity on DNA methylation. However, there is heterogeneity regarding the selection of the most promising CpG sites to target for analyses. The goal of this study was to determine functionally relevant clusters of CpG sites within the OXTR CpG island in 113 mother-infant dyads, with 58 of the mothers having experienced childhood maltreatment (CM). OXTR DNA methylation and gene expression was analyzed in peripheral/umbilical blood mononuclear cells. Different complexity reduction approaches were used to reduce the 188 CpG sites into clusters of co-methylated sites. Furthermore, associations between OXTR DNA methylation (cluster- and site-specific level) and OXTR gene expression and CM were investigated. Results showed that, first, CpG sections differed strongly regarding their statistical utility for research of individual differences in DNA methylation. Second, cluster analyses and Partial Least Squares (PLS) suggested two clusters consisting of intron1/exon2 and the protein-coding region of exon 3, respectively, as most strongly associated with outcome measures. Third, cross-validated PLS regression explained 7% of variance in CM, with low cross-validated variance explained for the prediction of gene expression. Fourth, very high mother-child correspondence was observed in correlation patterns within the identified clusters, but only modest correspondence outside these clusters. This study characterized the DNA methylation landscape of the OXTR CpG island by highlighting clusters of CpG sites that show desirable statistical properties and predictive value. We provide a Companion Web Application to guide future studies in their choice of CpG sites.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a \"cold\" tumor lacking T cell infiltration and tryptophan metabolites such as kynurenine function as an immune suppressor by binding to aryl hydrocarbon receptor(AHR). Hence AHR antagonists have been developed and some shown to activate the immune response in IDO over-expressing cancer models. Paradoxically, AHR has been reported to block glioma cell invasion like a tumor suppressor, and how to target AHR in cancer remains an open question. We previously discovered that an AHR agonist ITE can effectively inhibit glioma invasion. Here we report that ITE combined with PD1 antibody significantly increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells while reducing that of the myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), extending mouse survival. To identify factors that possibly mediated ITEs effects, we analyzed RNA-seq data and discovered that ITE significantly down-regulated IL11, a known MDSC regulator. In contrast, kynurenine upregulated IL11, further supporting IL11 as an AHR target. Moreover, ITE inhibited IL11s induction of MDSC from mouse PBMC in vitro, supporting that IL11 might mediate ITEs MDSC regulation effects. The discovery of ITEs immune-activating effects highlighted the complexity of AHRs signaling in cancers. The unexpected increase in STAT3, downstream of IL11 provided clues for combination therapy development.",

    "abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum is a destructive pathogen that causes bacterial wilt disease of diverse crops. Wilt disease prevention and management is difficult because R. solanacearum persists in soil, water, and plant material. Growers need practical methods to kill R. solanacearum in irrigation water, a common source of disease outbreaks. Additionally, the Race 3 biovar 2 (R3bv2) subgroup is a quarantine pest in many countries and a highly regulated U.S. Select Agent. Plant protection officials and researchers need validated protocols to eradicate R. solanacearum for regulatory compliance. To meet these needs, we measured survival of four R3bv2 and three phylotype I R. solanacearum strains following treatment with hydrogen peroxide, stabilized hydrogen peroxide (HuwaSan), active chlorine, heat, ultraviolet radiation, and desiccation. No surviving R. solanacearum cells were detected after cultured bacteria were exposed for ten minutes to 400 ppm hydrogen peroxide, 50 ppm HuwaSan, 50 ppm active chlorine, or temperatures above 50{degrees}C. R. solanacearum cells on agar plates were eradicated by 30s UV irradiation and killed by desiccation on most biotic and all abiotic surfaces tested. R. solanacearum did not survive the cell lysis steps of four nucleic acid extraction protocols. However, bacteria in planta were more difficult to kill. Stems of infected tomato plants contained a subpopulation of bacteria with increased tolerance of heat and UV light, but not oxidative stress. This result has significant management implications. We demonstrate the utility of these protocols for compliance with Select Agent research regulations and for management of a bacterial wilt outbreak in the field.\n\nImportanceRalstonia solanacearum, a globally distributed wilt pathogen of many high-value crops, is spread via diseased plant material and contaminated soil, tools, and irrigation water. The Race 3 biovar 2 Select Agent subgroup of R. solanacearum is subject to stringent and constantly evolving regulations intended to prevent pathogen introduction or release. We validated eradication and inactivation methods that can be used by: 1) growers seeking to disinfest water and manage bacterial wilt disease outbreaks; 2) researchers who must remain in compliance with regulations; and 3) regulators who are expected to define containment practices. Relevant to all these stakeholders, we show that while cultured R. solanacearum cells are sensitive to relatively low levels of oxidative chemicals, dessication, and heat, more aggressive treatment such as autoclaving or incineration is required to eradicate R. solanacearum cells growing inside plant material.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human fungal pathogen for which the external environment is its primary niche. To cause infection and disease, C. neoformans must adapt to a plethora of conditions and stresses inherent to the host environment. Of these stresses, the role of central carbon metabolism has been of interest not only at the level of fundamental pathobiology but also as a potential target for new antifungal drug therapy. Previous work has shown that two non-essential acetyl-CoA metabolism enzymes, ATP-citrate lyase (ACL1) and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS1), play important roles in C. neoformans infection. Here, we took a genetic interaction approach to studying the interplay between these two enzymes along with an enzyme initially called ACS2 but which we have found is an acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase; we have renamed the gene 2-ketobutyryl CoA synthetase 1 (KBC1) based on its biochemical activity and the systematic name of its substrate. ACL1 and ACS1 represent a synthetic lethal pair of genes based on our genetic interaction studies. Double mutants of KBC1 with either ACS1 or ACL1 do not have significant synthetic phenotypes in vitro, although we find that deletion of any one of these enzymes reduces fitness within macrophages. Importantly, the acs1{Delta} kbc1{Delta} double mutant has significantly reduced fitness in the CNS relative to either single mutant as well as WT (~2 log10 CFU reduction in fungal burden), indicating the important role these enzymes play during infection. The expression of both ACS1 and KBC1 is increased in vivo relative to in vitro conditions. The acs1{Delta} mutant is hypersusceptible to fluconazole in vivo despite its minimal in vitro phenotypes. These data not only provide insights into the in vivo mechanism of action for a new class of antifungal Acs inhibitors but also into metabolic adaptations of C. neoformans to the host environment.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe adaptation of environmental fungal pathogens to the mammalian host is critical to pathogenesis. Of these adaptations, the remodeling of carbon metabolism is particularly important. Here, we generated a focused set of double mutants of non-essential genes (ACL1, ACS1, KBC1) involved in acetyl-CoA metabolism and examined their fitness in vitro and during CNS infection. From these studies, we found that all three enzymes play important roles during infection but that the role of ACS1/KBC1 was minimal in vitro. Consistent with these observations, the expression of ACS1 and KBC1 was increased in vivo relative to standard in vitro conditions. Furthermore, strains lacking both ACL1 and ACS1 were not viable. These data clearly show that C. neoformans employs multiple carbon metabolism pathways to adapt to the host environment. They also provide insights into the potential mechanism of action for anti-cryptococcal Acs inhibitors.",
