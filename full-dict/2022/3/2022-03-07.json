    "abstract": "Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, elicits a homeostatic mechanism known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR reprograms gene expression to promote adaptation to chronic ER stress. The UPR comprises an acute phase involving inhibition of bulk protein synthesis and a chronic phase of transcriptional induction coupled with the partial recovery of protein synthesis. However, the role of transcriptional regulation in the acute phase of the UPR is not well understood. Here we analyzed the fate of newly synthesized mRNA encoding the protective and homeostatic transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) during this acute phase. We have previously shown that global translational repression induced by the acute UPR was characterized by decreased translation and increased stability of XBP1 mRNA. We demonstrate here that this stabilization is independent of new transcription. In contrast, we show XBP1 mRNA newly synthesized during the acute phase accumulates with long poly(A) tails and escapes translational repression. Inhibition of nascent RNA polyadenylation during the acute phase decreased cell survival with no effect in unstressed cells. Furthermore, during the chronic phase of the UPR, levels of XBP1 mRNA with long poly(A) tails decreased in a manner consistent with co-translational deadenylation. Finally, additional pro-survival, transcriptionally-induced mRNAs show similar regulation, supporting the broad significance of the pre-steady state UPR in translational control during ER stress. We conclude that the biphasic regulation of poly(A) tail length during the UPR represents a previously unrecognized pro-survival mechanism of mammalian gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Healthy progression of human pregnancy relies on cytotrophoblast progenitor (CTB) self-renewal and their differentiation towards multi-nucleated syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs) and invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). However, underlying molecular mechanisms that fine-tune CTB self-renewal or direct their differentiation towards STBs or EVTs during human placentation are poorly defined. Here, we show that hippo signaling cofactor WW Domain Containing Transcription Regulator 1 (WWTR1) is a master regulator of trophoblast fate choice during human placentation. Using human trophoblast stem cells (human TSCs), primary CTBs and human placental explants, we demonstrate that WWTR1 promotes self-renewal in human CTBs and is essential for their differentiation to EVTs. In contrast, WWTR1 prevents induction of STB fate in undifferentiated CTBs. Our single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses in first-trimester human placenta along with mechanistic analyses in human TSCs revealed that WWTR1 fine-tunes trophoblast fate by directly regulating Wnt signaling components. Importantly, our analyses of placentae from pathological pregnancies show that extreme preterm birth (gestational time [&le;]28weeks) and intrauterine growth restriction along with preeclampsia (IUGR/PE) are often associated with loss of WWTR1 expression in CTBs. In summary, our findings establish a critical importance of WWTR1 at the crossroads of human trophoblast progenitor self-renewal vs. differentiation. It plays positive instructive roles to promote CTB self-renewal and EVT differentiation and safeguards undifferentiated CTBs from obtaining the STB fate.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHuman pregnancy relies on formation of the transient organ placenta and trophoblast cells are the major building blocks of the placenta. A defect in trophoblast progenitor self-renewal or their differentiation is associated with either pregnancy loss or pathological pregnancies, yet underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate trophoblast differentiation are poorly understood. In this study, we discovered that WWTR1, a transcription cofactor and a component of conserved Hippo signaling pathway, optimizes trophoblast progenitor self-renewal and is essential for their differentiation into the invasive extravillous trophoblast cell lineage. Our findings establish WWTR1 as a critical regulator for success in human placentation and progression of a healthy pregnancy.",

However, it is challenging to gather data on individual-level variation at large spatial scales. Model organisms are potentially important systems for biogeographical studies, given the available range-wide natural history collections, and the importance of providing biogeographical context to their genetic and phenotypic diversity.\n\nLOCATIONGlobal\n\nTAXONArabidopsis thaliana (\"Arabidopsis\")\n\nMETHODSWe fit occurrence records to climate data, and then projected the distribution of Arabidopsis under last glacial maximum, current, and future climates. We confronted model predictions with individual performance measured on 2,194 herbarium specimens, and we asked whether predicted suitability was associated with life-history and genomic variation measured on [~]900 natural accessions.\n\nRESULTSThe most important climate variables constraining the Arabidopsis distribution were winter cold in northern and high elevation regions and summer heat in southern regions. Herbarium specimens from regions with lower habitat suitability in both northern and southern regions were smaller, supporting the hypothesis that the distribution of Arabidopsis is constrained by climate-associated factors. Climate anomalies partly explained interannual variation in herbarium specimen size, but these did not closely correspond to local limiting factors identified in the distribution model. Late-flowering genotypes were absent from the lowest suitability regions, suggesting slower life histories are only viable closer to the center of the realized niche. We identified glacial refugia farther north than previously recognized, as well as refugia concordant with previous population genetic findings. Lower latitude populations, known to be genetically distinct, are most threatened by future climate change. The recently colonized range of Arabidopsis was well-predicted by our native-range model applied to certain regions but not others, suggesting it has colonized novel climates.\n\nMAIN CONCLUSIONSIntegration of distribution models with performance data from vast natural history collections is a route forward for testing biogeographical hypotheses about species distributions and their relationship with evolutionary fitness across large scales.",

    "abstract": "AimAbiotic factors, such as temperature and precipitation, vary markedly along elevational gradients, and can in turn, shape key biotic interactions, such as herbivory and pollination. Despite the well-known effects of climatic conditions on pollinator activity and efficiency, we know little about the role of climate in pollinator shifts in animal-pollinated plants at broad geographic scales. Here we investigate patterns of altitudinal turnover in pollination mode across the Americas, with a focus on the most common pollinators (bees and hummingbirds). Specifically, we test Crudens classic hypothesis that plants are likely to shift to bird pollination at high elevations because endothermic pollinators are more reliable in cold and rainy conditions.\n\nLocationAmericas\n\nTime periodCurrent\n\nMajor taxa studied2232 plant taxa from 26 clades\n\nMethodsWe collated information on pollination mode (1262 insect-pollinated, 970 vertebrate-pollinated) for the study taxa from the literature, and used GBIF occurrence data to estimate median distributions and bioclimatic attributes of each species. We used (phylogenetic) GLMMs to test for associations between pollination mode and ecogeographic variables.\n\nResultsTo our surprise, we found flipped elevational patterns of insect- and vertebrate-pollination strategies across latitudes, with vertebrate pollination dominating at high elevations in the tropics, but not in temperate zones. We term this pattern the  Tropical flip. We recovered a strong association of vertebrate-pollinated plants with moist, forested habitats across latitudes, while insect-pollinated plants were often found in cool and dry or warm and moist conditions.\n\nMain conclusionsAltitudinal gradients in temperature may not serve as a universal explanation for shifts among endothermic insect and ectothermic vertebrate pollination. Instead, strong abiotic niche differentiation among insect- and vertebrate-pollinated plants, along with competition for pollination niche space, has likely shaped the  tropical flip.",

    "abstract": "Development of the C. elegans vulva is a classic model of organogenesis. This system, which starts with six equipotent cells, encompasses diverse types of developmental event, including developmental competence, multiple signaling events to control precise and faithful patterning of three cell fates, execution and proliferation of specific cell lineages, and a series of sophisticated morphogenetic events. Early events have been subjected to extensive mutational and genetic investigations and later events to cell biological analyses. We infer the existence of dramatically changing profiles of gene expression that accompanies the observed changes in development. Yet except from serendipitous discovery of several transcription factors expressed in dynamic patterns in vulval lineages, our knowledge of the transcriptomic landscape during vulval development is minimal. This study describes the composition of a vulva-specific transcriptome. We used tissue specific harvesting of mRNAs via immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged poly(A) binding protein, PAB-1, heterologously expressed by a promoter known to express GFP in vulval cells throughout their development. The identified transcriptome was small but tightly interconnected. From this data set we identified several genes with identified functions in development of the vulva and validated more with promoter-GFP reporters of expression. For one target, lag-1, promoter-GFP expression was limited but fluorescent tag of the endogenous protein revealed extensive expression. Thus, we have identified a transcriptome of the C. elegans as a launching pad for exploration of functions of these genes in organogenesis.",

Six prediction models were explored to assess the predictive ability of hyperspectral and genomic data for inoculation status and plant growth-related traits. The best models for hyperspectral prediction were partial least squares and automated machine learning. The Bayesian ridge regression and BayesB were the best performers for genomic prediction. Overall, hyper-spectral prediction showed greater predictive ability for shoot dry mass and stalk diameter, whereas genomic prediction was better for plant height. The prediction models that simultaneously accommodated both hyperspectral and genomic data resulted in a predictive ability as high as that of phenomics or genomics alone.

Such inferences can reveal the time-scales and processes associated with the emergence and spread of pandemic plant pathogens, such as the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (Syn. Pyricularia oryzae). However, the specificity and sensitivity of SNP calls depend on the filtering parameters applied to the data. Here, we used a benchmarking approach to evaluate the impact of SNP calling on different population genetic analyses of the rice blast fungus, namely genetic clustering, topology of phylogenetic reconstructions and estimation of evolutionary rates.\n\nResultsTo benchmark SNP calling parameters, we generated a gold standard set of validated SNPs by sequencing nine M. oryzae genomes with both Illumina short-reads and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We used the gold standard set of SNPs to identify the SNP calling parameter configuration that maximizes sensitivity and specificity. We found that the choice of parameter configurations can substantially change the number of ascertained SNPs, preferentially affecting SNPs segregating at low population frequency. However, SNP calling parameter configurations did not significantly affect the clustering of isolates in clonal lineages, the monophyly of each clonal lineage, and the estimation of evolutionary rates. We leverage the evolutionary rates obtained from each SNP calling parameter configuration to generate divergence time estimates that take into account the uncertainty associated with both the estimation of evolutionary rates and SNP calling. Our analysis indicates that M. oryzae clonal lineage expansions took place ~300 years ago.",

    "abstract": "It has been known for centuries that cats respond euphorically to Nepeta cataria (catnip). Recently, we have shown that Lonicera tatarica (Tatarian honeysuckle), Actinidia polygama (silver vine) and Valeriana officinalis (valerian) can also elicit this \"catnip response\". The aim of this study was to learn if the behavior seen in response to these plants is similar to the response to catnip. Furthermore, we studied if these responses are fixed or if there are differences between cats. While nepetalactone was identified decades ago as the molecule responsible for the \"catnip response\", we know that this volatile is found almost exclusively in catnip. Therefore, we also aimed to identify other compounds in these alternative plants that can elicit the blissful behavior in cats. Bioassays with 6 cats were performed in a stress-free environment, where 6 plants and 13 single compounds were each tested for at least 100 and 17 hours, respectively. All responses were video recorded and BORIS software was used to analyze the cats behavior. Both response duration and behavior differed significantly between the cats. While individual cats had preferences for particular plants, the behavior of individual cats was consistent among all plants. About half a dozen lactones similar in structure to nepetalactone were able to elicit the \"catnip response\", as were the structurally more distinct molecules actinidine and dihydroactinidiolide. Most cats did not respond to actinidine, whereas those who did, responded longer to this volatile than any of the other secondary plant metabolites, and different behavior was observed. Interestingly, dihydroactinidiolide was also found in excretions and secretions of the red fox, making this the first report of a compound produced by a mammal, that can elicit the \"catnip response\". A range of different cat-attracting compounds was detected by chemical analysis of plant materials but differences in cat behavior could not be directly related to differences in chemical composition of the plants. Together with among other results of habituation / dishabituation experiments, this indicates that additional cat-attracting compounds may be present in the plant materials that remain to be discovered. Collectively, these findings suggest that both the personality of the cat and genetic variation in the genes encoding olfactory receptors may play a role in how cats respond to cat-attracting plants. Furthermore, the data suggest a potential distinct mechanism of action for actinidine.",

    "abstract": "The rise in the number of protein sequences in the post-genomic era has led to a major breakthrough in fitting generative sequence models for contact prediction, protein design, alignment, and homology search. Despite this success, the interpretability of the modeled pairwise parameters continues to be limited due to the entanglement of coevolution, phylogeny, and entropy. For contact prediction, post-correction methods have been developed to remove the contribution of entropy from the predicted contact maps. However, all remaining applications that rely on the raw parameters, lack a direct method to correct for entropy. In this paper, we investigate the origins of the entropy signal and propose a new spectral regularizer to down weight it during model fitting. We find the added regularizer to GREMLIN, a Markov Random Field or Potts model, allows for the inference of a sparse contact map without loss in precision, meanwhile improving interpretability, and resolving overfitting issues important for sequence evaluation and design.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany wild species have suffered drastic population size declines over the past centuries, which have led to  genomic erosion processes characterized by reduced genetic diversity, increased inbreeding, and accumulation of harmful mutations. Yet, genomic erosion estimates of modern-day populations often lack concordance with dwindling population sizes and conservation status of threatened species. One way to directly quantify the genomic consequences of population declines is to compare genome-wide data from pre-decline museum samples and modern samples. However, doing so requires computational data processing and analysis tools specifically adapted to comparative analyses of degraded, ancient or historical, DNA data with modern DNA data as well as personnel trained to perform such analyses.\n\nResultsHere, we present a highly flexible, scalable, and modular pipeline to compare patterns of genomic erosion using samples from disparate time periods. The GenErode pipeline uses state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to simultaneously process whole-genome re-sequencing data from ancient/historical and modern samples, and to produce comparable estimates of several genomic erosion indices. No programming knowledge is required to run the pipeline and all bioinformatic steps are well-documented, making the pipeline accessible to users with different backgrounds. GenErode is written in Snakemake and Python3 and uses Conda and Singularity containers to achieve reproducibility on high-performance compute clusters.

We have conducted computational modeling and analysis of transcriptomic data of 4750 human tissue samples of nine cancer types in the TCGA database. Built on our previous study, we have quantitatively estimated the (average) production rate of OH- by cytosolic Fenton reactions, which continuously disrupt the intracellular pH homeostasis. Our predictions indicate that all or a subset of 43 reprogrammed metabolisms (RMs) are induced to produce net protons (H+) at comparable rates of Fenton reactions to keep the intracellular pH stable. We have then discovered that a number of well-known phenotypes of cancers, including increased growth rate, metastasis rate and local immune cell composition, can be naturally explained in terms of the Fenton reaction level and the induced RMs. This study strongly suggests the possibility to have a unified framework for studies of cancer-inducing stressors, adaptive metabolic reprogramming, and cancerous behaviors. In addition, strong evidence is provided to demonstrate that a popular view of that Na+/H+ exchangers, along with lactic acid exporters and carbonic anhydrases are responsible for the intracellular alkalization and extracellular acidification in cancer may not be justified.",

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces an intrinsically different data type than scRNA-seq and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas as well as from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results.

    "abstract": "Pharmacological agents that prolong action potential duration (APD) to a larger extent at slow rates than at the fast excitation rates typical of ventricular tachycardia exhibit reverse rate dependence. Reverse rate dependence has been linked to the lack of efficacy of class III agents at preventing arrhythmias. In this report we show that, in computer models of the ventricular action potential, APD prolongation by accelerating phase 2 repolarization (by increasing IKs) and decelerating phase 3 repolarization (by blocking IKr and IK1) results in a robust positive rate dependence (i.e., larger APD prolongation at fast rates than at slow rates). In contrast, APD prolongation by blocking a specific potassium channel type results in reverse rate dependence or a marginal positive rate dependence. Interventions that result in a strong positive rate dependence tend to decrease the repolarization reserve because they require substantial IK1 block. However, limiting IK1 block to [~]50% results in a strong positive rate dependence with moderate decrease in repolarization reserve. In conclusion, the use of a combination of IKs activators and IKr and IK1 blockers could result in APD prolongation that potentially maximizes anti-arrhythmic effects (by maximizing APD prolongation at fast excitation rates) and minimizes pro-arrhythmic effects (by minimizing APD prolongation at slow excitation rates).",

    "abstract": "Attention allows us to focus sensory processing on behaviorally relevant aspects of the visual world. One potential mechanism of attention is a change in the gain of sensory responses. However, changing gain at early stages could have multiple downstream consequences for visual processing. Which, if any, of these effects can account for the benefits of attention for detection and discrimination? Using a model of primate visual cortex we document how a Gaussian-shaped gain modulation results in changes to spatial tuning properties. Forcing the model to use only these changes failed to produce any benefit in task performance. Instead, we found that gain alone was both necessary and sufficient to explain category detection and discrimination during attention. Our results show how gain can give rise to changes in receptive fields which are not necessary for enhancing task performance.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) gene were recently identified as a genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Several KIF5A ALS variants cause exon 27 skipping and produce motor proteins with an altered C-terminal tail (referred to as {Delta}Exon27). However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of {Delta}Exon27 at the single-molecule, cellular, and organism levels. Our results show that {Delta}Exon27 is prone to form cytoplasmic aggregates and is neurotoxic. The mutation relieves motor autoinhibition and increases motor self-association, leading to drastically enhanced processivity on microtubules. Finally, ectopic expression of {Delta}Exon27 in Drosophila melanogaster causes wing defects, motor impairment, paralysis and premature death. Our results suggest gain of function as an underlying disease mechanism in KIF5A-associated ALS.",

    "abstract": "1 Face cells are visual neurons that respond more to faces than other objects. Clustered together in inferotemporal cortex, they are thought to carry out face processing specifically and are thus studied using faces almost exclusively. Analyzing neural responses in and around macaque face patches to hundreds of objects, we found graded response profiles for non-faces that were predictive of the degree of face selectivity and provided information on face-cell tuning that could not be characterized with actual faces. This relationship between non-face and face responses was not predicted by color and simple shape properties, but by information encoded in deep neural networks trained on general object classification rather than face identification. These findings contradict the long-standing assumption that face cells owe their category selectivity to face-specific features, instead providing evidence for the notion that category-selective neurons are best understood as tuning directions in an integrated, domain-general object space.",

    "abstract": "Great interest has been given to developing non-invasive approaches for studying cortical plasticity in humans. High frequency presentation of auditory and visual stimuli, or sensory tetanization, can induce long-term-potentiation-like (LTP-like) changes in cortical activity. However, contrasting effects across studies suggest that sensory tetanization may be unreliable. We review these contrasting effects, conduct our own study of auditory and visual tetanization, and perform meta-analyses to determine the average effect of sensory tetanization across studies. We measured auditory-evoked amplitude changes in a group of younger (18-29 years of age) and older (55-83 years of age) adults following tetanization to 1 kHz and 4 kHz tone bursts and following a slow-presentation control. We also measured visual-evoked amplitude changes following tetanization to horizontal and vertical sign gradients. Auditory and visual response amplitudes decreased following tetanization, consistent with some studies but contrasting with others finding amplitude increases (i.e., LTP-like changes). Older adults exhibited more modest auditory-evoked amplitude decreases, but visual-evoked amplitude decreases like those of younger adults. Changes in response amplitude were not specific to tetanized stimuli. Importantly, slow presentation of auditory tone-bursts produced response amplitude changes approximating those observed following tetanization in younger adults. Meta-analyses of visual and auditory tetanization studies found that the overall effect of sensory tetanization was not significant across studies or study sites. The results suggest that sensory tetanization may not produce reliable changes in cortical responses and more work is needed to determine the validity of sensory tetanization as a method for inducing human cortical plasticity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "There is significant interest in pooling magnetic resonance image (MRI) data from multiple datasets to enable mega-analysis. Harmonization is typically performed to reduce heterogeneity when pooling MRI data across datasets. Most MRI harmonization algorithms do not explicitly consider downstream application performance during harmonization. However, the choice of downstream application might influence what might be considered as study-specific confounds. Therefore, ignoring downstream applications during harmonization might potentially limit downstream performance. Here we propose a goal-specific harmonization framework that utilizes downstream application performance to regularize the harmonization procedure. Our framework can be integrated with a wide variety of harmonization models based on deep neural networks, such as the recently proposed conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) harmonization model. Three datasets from three different continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10085 anatomical T1 scans were used for evaluation. We found that cVAE removed more dataset differences than the widely used ComBat model, but at the expense of removing desirable biological information as measured by downstream prediction of mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores and clinical diagnoses. On the other hand, our goal-specific cVAE (gcVAE) was able to remove as much dataset differences as cVAE, while improving downstream cross-sectional prediction of MMSE scores and clinical diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Drought disrupts soil microbial activity and many biogeochemical processes. Although plant-associated fungi can support plant performance and nutrient cycling during drought, their effects on nearby drought-exposed soil microbial communities are not well resolved. We used H 18O quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) and 16S rRNA gene profiling to investigate bacterial community dynamics following water limitation in the hyphospheres of two distinct fungal lineages (Rhizophagus irregularis and Serendipita bescii) grown with the bioenergy model grass Panicum hallii. In uninoculated soil, a history of water limitation resulted in significantly lower bacterial growth potential and growth efficiency, as well as lower diversity in the actively growing bacterial community. In contrast, both fungal lineages had a protective effect on hyphosphere bacterial communities exposed to water limitation: bacterial growth potential, growth efficiency, and the diversity of the actively growing bacterial community were not suppressed by a history of water limitation in soils inoculated with either fungus. Despite their similar effects at the community level, the two fungal lineages did elicit different taxon-specific responses, and bacterial growth potential was greater in R. irregularis- compared in S. bescii- inoculated soils. Several of the bacterial taxa that responded positively to fungal inocula belong to lineages that are considered drought-susceptible. Overall, H 18O qSIP highlighted treatment effects on bacterial community structure that were less pronounced using traditional 16S rRNA gene profiling. Together, these results indicate that fungal-bacterial synergies may support bacterial resilience to moisture limitation.",

    "abstract": "The 3C protease is distinguished from most proteases due to the presence of cysteine nucleophile that plays an essential role in viral replication. This peculiar structure encompassed with its role in viral replication has promoted 3C protease as an interesting target for therapeutic agents in the treatment of diseases caused by human rhinovirus (HRV). Herein we present a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the comparison of two potent inhibitors, sg85 and rupintrivir complexed with HRV-3C protease. The binding free energy studies revealed a higher binding affinity for sg85 -58.853 kcal/mol than for rupintrivir -54.0873 kcal/mol and this was found to be in correlation with the experimental data. The energy decomposition analysis showed that, residues Leu 127, Thr 142, Ser 144, Gly 145, Tyr 146, Cys 147, His 161, Val 162, Gly 163, Gly 164, Asn 165, Phe 170 largely contributed to the binding of sg85, whereas His 40, Leu 127 and Gly 163 impacted the binding of rupintrivir. It further showed that His 40, Glu 71, Leu 127, Cys 147 Gly 163 and Gyl 164 are crucial residues that play a key role in ligand-enzyme binding; amongst these residues are residues of the conserved active site (His 40, Glu 71 and Cys 147). These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and structural features and will serve as guidance in the design and development of potent novel inhibitors of HRV.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of understanding how hydrophobic interactions are encoded by fusion peptide sequences within coronavirus (CoV) spike proteins. Within the fusion peptides of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, a largely conserved peptide sequence called FP1 (SFIEDLLFNK and SAIEDLLFDK in SARS-2 and MERS, respectively) has been proposed to play a key role in encoding hydrophobic interactions that drive viral-host cell membrane fusion. While a non-polar triad (LLF) is common to both FP1 sequences, and thought to dominate the encoding of hydrophobic interactions, FP1 from SARS and MERS differ in two residues (Phe 2 versus Ala 2 and Asn 9 versus Asp 9, respectively). Here we explore if single molecule force measurements can quantify hydrophobic interactions encoded by FP1 sequences, and then ask if sequence variations between FP1 from SARS and MERS lead to significant differences in hydrophobic interactions. We find that both SARS-2 and MERS wild-type FP1 generate measurable hydrophobic interactions at the single molecule level, but that SARS-2 FP1 encodes a substantially stronger hydrophobic interaction than its MERS counterpart (1.91 {+/-} 0.03 nN versus 0.68 {+/-} 0.03 nN, respectively). By performing force measurements with FP1 sequences with single amino acid substitutions, we determine that a single residue mutation (Phe 2 versus Ala 2) causes the almost threefold difference in the hydrophobic interaction strength generated by the FP1 of SARS-2 versus MERS, despite the presence of LLF in both sequences. Infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism measurements support the proposal that the outsized influence of Phe 2 versus Ala 2 on the hydrophobic interaction arises from variation in the secondary structure adopted by FP1. Overall, these insights reveal how single residue diversity in viral fusion peptides, including FP1 of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, can lead to substantial changes in intermolecular interactions proposed to play a key role in viral fusion, and hint at strategies for regulating hydrophobic interactions of peptides in a range of contexts.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEFusion of coronaviruses (CoVs) and host cells is mediated by the insertion of the fusion peptide (FP) of the viral spike protein into the host cell membrane. Hydrophobic interactions between FPs with their host cell membranes regulate the viral membrane fusion process and are key to determining infection ability. However, it is not fully understood how the amino acid sequences in FPs mediate hydrophobic interactions. We use single-molecule force measurements to characterize hydrophobic interactions of FPs from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which the amino acid composition of FPs encodes hydrophobic interactions and their implications for fusion activity critical to the spread of infection.",

Whether evolving cancer lineages similarly adapt mutation rates to increase tumour cell fitness is unknown. Here, by mapping the clonal topography of mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) colorectal cancer, we show that genomic MMRd mutability co-evolves with neoantigen selection to drive intratumour diversification and immune escape. Mechanistically, we find that microsatellite instability modulates subclonal DNA repair by toggling two hypermutable mononucleotide homopolymer runs in the mismatch repair genes MSH6 and MSH3 (C8 and A8, respectively) through stochastic frameshift switching. Spontaneous mutation and reversion at these evolvability switches modulates subclonal mutation rate, mutation bias, and clonal HLA diversity during MMRd cancer evolution. Combined experimental and simulation studies demonstrate that subclonal immune selection favours incremental MMR mutations. MMRd cancers thus fuel intratumour heterogeneity by adapting subclonal mutation rate and mutation bias to immune selection, revealing a conserved co-evolutionary arms race between neoantigen selection and adaptive genomic mutability. Our work reveals layers of mutational complexity and microsatellite biology in MMRd cancer evolution previously hidden in bulk analyses.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear medicine plays a key role in modern diagnosis and cancer therapy. The development of tumor targeting radionuclide conjugates (also named Small Molecule-Radio Conjugates - SMRCs) represents a significant improvement over the clinical use of metabolic radiotracers (e.g., [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose) for imaging and over the application of biocidal external beam radiations for therapy. During the discovery of SMRCs, molecular candidates must be carefully evaluated typically by performing biodistribution assays in preclinical tumor models. Quantification methodologies based on radioactive counts are typically demanding due to safety concerns, availability of radioactive material, and infrastructures. In this article, we report the development of a mass spectrometry (MS)-based method for the detection and quantification of small molecule-metal conjugates (SMMCs) as cold surrogates of SMRCs. We applied this methodology for the evaluation of the biodistribution of a particular class of tumor-targeting drug candidates based on natLu, natGa, natF and directed against Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP). The reliability of the LC-MS analysis was validated by direct comparison of MSbased and radioactivity-based biodistribution data. Results show that MS biodistribution of stable isotope metal conjugates is an orthogonal tool for the preclinical characterization of different classes of radiopharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "As transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) protocols advance, assumptions underlying the technique need to be retested to ensure they still hold. Whilst the safety of stimulation has been demonstrated mainly for a small number of sessions, and small sample size, adverse events (AEs) following multiple sessions remain largely untested. Similarly, whilst blinding procedures are typically assumed to be effective, the effect of multiple stimulation sessions on the efficacy of blinding procedures also remains under question. This is especially relevant in multisite projects where small unintentional variations in protocol could lead to inter-site difference. We report AE and blinding data from 1,019 participants who received up to 11 semi-consecutive sessions of active or sham transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), direct current stimulation (tDCS), and random noise stimulation (tRNS), at 4 sites in the UK and US. We found that AEs were often best predicted by factors other than tES, such as testing site or session number. Results from the blinding analysis suggested that blinding was less effective for tDCS and tACS than tRNS. The occurrence of AEs did not appear to be linked to tES despite the use of smaller electrodes or repeated delivery. However, blinding efficacy was impacted in tES conditions with higher cutaneous sensation, highlighting a need for alternative stimulation blinding protocols. This may be increasingly necessary in studies wishing to deliver stimulation with higher intensities.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a tightly coordinated response against bacterial and viral infections, triggered by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COVID-19 disease, characterized by an inflammatory response mediated through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which results in the production of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 along with pyroptotic cell death. The NLRP3 inflammasome could be also triggered by sterile danger signals such as extracellular ATP triggering the purinergic P2X7 receptor. Severe inflammation in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is associated with pneumonia, hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, these being the causes of death associated with COVID-19. Both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3 have been considered as potential pharmacological targets for treating inflammation in COVID-19. However, there is no experimental evidence of the involvement of the P2X7 receptor during COVID-19 disease. In the present study we determined the concentration of different cytokines and the P2X7 receptor in the plasma of COVID-19 patients and found that along with the increase in IL-6, IL-18 and the IL-1 receptor antagonist in the plasma of COVID-19 patients, there was also an increase in the purinergic P2X7 receptor. Increase in COVID-19 severity and C-reactive protein concentration positively correlated with increased concentration of the P2X7 receptor in the plasma, but not with IL-18 cytokine. The P2X7 receptor was found in the supernatant of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells after inflammasome activation. Therefore, our data suggest that determining levels of the P2X7 receptor in the plasma could be a novel biomarker of COVID-19 severity.",

    "abstract": "The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) exhibit enhanced transmission and immune escape, reducing the efficacy and effectiveness of the two FDA-approved mRNA vaccines. Here, we explored various strategies to develop novel mRNAs vaccines to achieve safer and wider coverage of VOCs. Firstly, we constructed a cohort of mRNAs that feature a furin cleavage mutation in the spike (S) protein of predominant VOCs, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2). Not present in the mRNA vaccines currently in use, the mutation abolished the cleavage between the S1 and S2 subunits, potentially enhancing the safety profile of the immunogen. Secondly, we systematically evaluated the induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) in vaccinated mice, and discovered that individual VOC mRNAs elicited strong neutralizing activity in a VOC-specific manner. Thirdly, the IgG produced in mice immunized with Beta-Furin and Washington (WA)-Furin mRNAs showed potent cross-reactivity with other VOCs, which was further corroborated by challenging vaccinated mice with the live virus of VOCs. However, neither WA-Furin nor Beta-Furin mRNA elicited strong neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant. Hence, we further developed an Omicron-specific mRNA vaccine that restored protection against the original and the sublineages of Omicron variant. Finally, to broaden the protection spectrum of the new Omicron mRNA vaccine, we tested the concept of bivalent immunogen. Instead of just fusing two RBDs head-to-tail, we for the first time constructed an mRNA-based chimeric immunogen by introducing the RBD of Delta variant into the entire S antigen of Omicron. The resultant chimeric mRNA was capable of inducing potent and broadly acting nAb against Omicron (both BA.1 and BA.2) and Delta, which paves the way to develop new vaccine candidate to target emerging variants in the future.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the first-line treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon (IFN)-{gamma}. Prolonged inflammation and IFN-{gamma} exposure are known to cause an adaptive immune response, enabling immune escape and proliferation by tumor cells. We investigated HLA-E and NKG2A, a novel T and NK cell checkpoint pathway, as a driver of adaptive resistance in BCG unresponsive NMIBC. We observed ubiquitous inflammation in all patients after BCG immunotherapy, regardless of recurrence status. IFN-{gamma} was shown to drive tumor expression of HLA-E and PD-L1. Further, NKG2A-expressing NK and CD8 T cells were enriched in BCG unresponsive tumors and with enhanced capacity for cytolytic functions. Strikingly, in situ spatial analyses revealed that HLA-EHIGH tumors are activated to recruit NK and T cells via chemokine production, potentially sparing HLA-ELOW tumors that would otherwise be susceptible to lysis. Finally, blood-derived NK cells retained anti-tumor functions at the time of tumor recurrence. These data support combined NKG2A and PD-L1 blockade for BCG unresponsive disease.",

    "abstract": "Current RNA viral pandemic of COVID-19 has been worsened by rapidly spreading viral variants. To inhibit mutation-based development of new escape variants, elements that are indispensable for the virus may be targeted. The 5-polyU tract of the antigenome offers one such target. Host cells do not harbor 5-polyU tracts on any of their transcripts, making the tract an attractive virus-specific target. We hypothesize that inhibiting the 5-polyU by complementary oligonucleotide can limit the use of the tract as template for virus to generate 3 polyA tails of RNA viruses. Here, we used a frameshift-inducing DNA oligonucleotide with 3 polyAs to target the 5-polyU tract of mouse coronavirus (MHV-A59). Results from assays for double stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis, infectivity of released virions, and syncytium formation indicate that the oligonucleotide treatment prevented generation of infectious virions. Our results show a unique mode of action of the designed 3-polyA oligonucleotide against mouse coronavirus which leaves host cells unaffected. This strategy can be adopted for the development of novel classes of oligonucleotide-based drugs that inhibit the production of infectious RNA viruses, including the coronaviruses. Since the 5-polyU tract is conserved and is essential for variants of coronaviruses, this strategy can potentially address coronavirus variant emergence as well.",

    "abstract": "Survival of M. tuberculosis within the host macrophages requires presence of the virulence regulator PhoP, but the underlying mechanism is yet to be understood. We discovered a signalling pathway which controls mycobacterial cAMP-inducible gene expression and cAMP homeostasis. We show that the level of intra-mycobacterial cAMP, one of the most widely used second messengers, is regulated by the virulence regulator PhoP, which recruits the cAMP responsive protein, CRP. We provide evidence to show that PhoP -dependent repression of cAMP specific phosphodiesterase Rv0805, which degrades cAMP hydrolytically, accounts for mycobacterial cAMP homeostasis. In keeping with these findings, genetic manipulation to inactivate PhoP-Rv0805-cAMP pathway leads to disruption of cAMP homeostasis, increased stress sensitivity and most critically, reduced mycobacterial survival in macrophages and animal models. Together, PhoP-dependent cAMP inducible gene expression and cAMP homeostasis represent a molecular checkpoint during intra-phagosomal survival and growth program of mycobacteria.",

    "abstract": "New therapeutic targets are a valuable resource in the struggle to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk loci, but some loci are associated with co-morbidities and are not specific to host-virus interactions. Here, we identify and experimentally validate a link between reduced expression of EXOSC2 and reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. EXOSC2 was one of 332 host proteins examined, all of which interact directly with SARS-CoV-2 proteins; EXOSC2 interacts with Nsp8 which forms part of the viral RNA polymerase. Lung-specific eQTLs were identified from GTEx (v7) for each of the 332 host proteins. Aggregating COVID-19 GWAS statistics for gene-specific eQTLs revealed an association between increased expression of EXOSC2 and higher risk of clinical COVID-19 which survived stringent multiple testing correction. EXOSC2 is a component of the RNA exosome and indeed, LC-MS/MS analysis of protein pulldowns demonstrated an interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and the majority of human RNA exosome components. CRISPR/Cas9 introduction of nonsense mutations within EXOSC2 in Calu-3 cells reduced EXOSC2 protein expression, impeded SARS-CoV-2 replication and upregulated oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) genes, which have been linked to a successful immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Reduced EXOSC2 expression did not reduce cellular viability. OAS gene expression changes occurred independent of infection and in the absence of significant upregulation of other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Targeted depletion or functional inhibition of EXOSC2 may be a safe and effective strategy to protect at-risk individuals against clinical COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "While vaccines and antivirals are now being deployed for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we require additional antiviral therapeutics to not only effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, but also future coronaviruses. All coronaviruses have relatively similar genomes that provide a potential exploitable opening to develop antiviral therapies that will be effective against all coronaviruses. Among the various genes and proteins encoded by all coronaviruses, one particularly \"druggable\" or relatively easy-to-drug target is the coronavirus Main Protease (3CLpro or Mpro), an enzyme that is involved in cleaving a long peptide translated by the viral genome into its individual protein components that are then assembled into the virus to enable viral replication in the cell. Inhibiting Mpro with a small-molecule antiviral would effectively stop the ability of the virus to replicate, providing therapeutic benefit. In this study, we have utilized activity-based protein profiling (ABPP)-based chemoproteomic approaches to discover and further optimize cysteine-reactive pyrazoline-based covalent inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry and modular synthesis of di- and tri-substituted pyrazolines bearing either chloroacetamide or vinyl sulfonamide cysteine-reactive warheads enabled the expedient exploration of structure-activity relationships (SAR), yielding nanomolar potency inhibitors against Mpro from not only SARS-CoV-2, but across many other coronaviruses. Our studies highlight promising chemical scaffolds that may contribute to future pan-coronavirus inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) marks the third novel {beta}-coronavirus to cause significant human mortality in the last two decades. Although vaccines are available, too few have been administered worldwide to keep the virus in check and to prevent mutations leading to immune escape. To determine if antibodies could be identified with universal coronavirus activity, plasma from convalescent subjects was screened for IgG against a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domain, which is highly conserved between human {beta}-coronavirus. From these subjects, several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were developed that neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with recognition of all variants of concern (VoC) tested (Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron). The hmAb 1249A8 emerged as the most potent and broad hmAb, able to recognize all human {beta}-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 1249A8 demonstrated significant prophylactic activity in K18 hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A and lineage B Beta, and Omicron VoC. 1249A8 delivered as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal (i.n.) dose to hamsters 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta protected them from weight loss, with therapeutic activity further enhanced when combined with 1213H7, an S1-specific neutralizing hmAb. As little as 2 mg/kg of 1249A8 i.n. dose 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV Urbani strain, protected hamsters from weight loss and significantly reduced upper and lower respiratory viral burden. These results indicate in vivo cooperativity between S1 and S2 specific neutralizing hmAbs and that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential can be induced in humans and can guide universal coronavirus vaccine development.",

Vaccination of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice and rhesus macaque with COReNAPCIN(R) induced strong humoral responses with high titers of virus-binding and neutralizing antibodies. Upon vaccination, a robust SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity was also observed in both mice and non-human primate models. Additionally, vaccination protected rhesus macaques from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathological damage to the lung upon challenging the animals with high viral loads of up to 2x108 live viral particles. Overall, our data provide supporting evidence for COReNAPCIN(R) as a potent vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Variation of the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been the bane of COVID-19 control. Documented variation includes point mutations, deletions, insertions, and recombination among closely or distantly related coronaviruses. Here, we describe yet another aspect of genome variation by beta- and alphacoronaviruses. Specifically, we report numerous genomic insertions of 5-untranslated region sequences into coding regions of SARS-CoV-2, other betacoronaviruses, and alphacoronaviruses. To our knowledge this is the first systematic description of such insertions. In many cases, these insertions change viral protein sequences and further foster genomic flexibility and viral adaptability through insertion of transcription regulatory sequences in novel positions within the genome. Among human Embecorivus betacoronaviruses, for instance, from 65% to all of the surveyed sequences in publicly available databases contain 5-UTR-derived inserted sequences. In limited instances, there is mounting evidence that these insertions alter the fundamental biological properties of mutant viruses. Intragenomic rearrangements add to our appreciation of how variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other beta- and alphacoronaviruses may arise.\n\nSignificanceUnderstanding mechanisms of variation in coronaviruses is vital to control of their associated diseases. Beyond point mutations, insertions, deletions and recombination, we here describe for the first time intragenomic rearrangements and their relevance to changes in transmissibility, immune escape and/or virulence documented during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped RNA virus. Despite the high economic and life losses caused by SARS-CoV-2, the detailed viral cycle, especially how it assembles and traffics in the secretory pathway, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces global alterations of the host endomembrane system, including dramatic Golgi fragmentation. Disrupting Golgi function with small molecules strongly inhibits viral infection. Furthermore, expression of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins individually is sufficient to trigger Golgi fragmentation. Significantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection down-regulates GRASP55 but up-regulates TGN46 expression, while expression of GRASP55 or knockdown of TGN46 reduces the infection rate of both USA-WA1 and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. Our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 modulates Golgi structure and function via altering GRASP55 and TGN46 expression to facilitate viral trafficking, indicating the Golgi as a novel therapeutic target to block SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Acute systemic gas embolism in these beaked whales was published together with enigmatic cystic liver lesions (CLL), characterized by intrahepatic encapsulated gas-filled cysts, tentatively interpreted as \"gas-bubble\" lesions in various cetacean species. Here we provide a pathologic reinterpretation of CLL in cetaceans. From 1,200 cetaceans necropsied, CLL were only observed in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), with a low prevalence (2%), and recapitulated pathologic features of Budd-Chiari syndrome in humans. Our results strongly suggest that CLL are the result of the combination of pre-existing or concomitant hepatic vascular disorder (e.g., severe hepatobiliary trematodiasis) superimposed and exacerbated by gas bubbles, and clearly differ from acute systemic gas embolism in stranded beaked whales linked to MFAS.",

Additionally, the effect of persistent high or low exocytosis activity on intermediate steps remains unknown. Through time-resolved cryo-electron tomography, we ordered events into a sequence. Following stimulation, proximal tethered SVs rapidly form additional tethers with the PM. Simultaneously, fusion initiation occurs by membrane curvature ( buckling) of the SV and PM. It is followed by the formation of a fusion pore, and the collapse of SV membrane. At this time, membrane-proximal, but not membrane-distal, vesicles lose their interconnections, allowing them to move towards the PM. Two mutations of SNAP-25 that arrests or disinhibit spontaneous release, respectively, both caused a loss of interconnectors, while the disinhibiting mutant also caused a loss of membrane proximal multiple-tethered SVs. Overall, tether formation and connector dissolution is triggered by stimulation and respond to the spontaneous fusion rate. These morphological observations likely correspond to the transition of SVs from one functional pool to another.",

In a comprehensive study design, 48 participants performed center-out reaching movements before and during exposure to a 60{degrees} rotation of visual feedback. Awareness and intermanual transfer were then determined. Twelve participants each were assigned to one of the following adaptation conditions: gradual adaptation, sudden adaptation without instructions, sudden adaptation with a single instruction before adaptation, and sudden adaptation with multiple instructions before and during adaptation. The explicit instructions explained the nature of the visual feedback perturbation and were given using an illustration of a clock face. Analysis of adaptation indices revealed neither increased nor decreased adaptation after repeated instructions compared with a single instruction. Our data also show less adaptation with gradual than with sudden adaptation and less adaptation without than with instruction. These differences were pronounced at the beginning of adaptation; however, by the end of adaptation, all four groups reached similar levels of adaptation. In addition, we found significant group differences for the awareness index, with lower awareness after gradual adaptation than after sudden, instructed adaptation. Intermanual transfer did not differ between groups. However, we found a significant correlation between the awareness and intermanual transfer indices. We conclude that the magnitude of the explicit process cannot be further increased by repeated instruction and that intermanual transfer appears to be largely related to the explicit adaptation process.",

    "abstract": "Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are mesenchymal stromal cells that play a crucial role during skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration. FAPs build and maintain the extracellular matrix that acts as a molecular myofiber scaffold. In addition, FAPs are indispensable for myofiber regeneration as they secrete a multitude of beneficial factors sensed by the muscle stem cells (MuSCs). In diseased states, however, FAPs are the cellular origin of intramuscular fat and fibrotic scar tissue. This fatty fibrosis is a hallmark of sarcopenia and neuromuscular diseases, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. One significant barrier in determining why and how FAPs differentiate into intramuscular fat is effective preservation of adipocytes, especially in frozen tissue sections. Conventional methods of skeletal muscle tissue processing, such as snap-freezing, do not properly preserve the morphology of individual adipocytes, thereby preventing accurate visualization and quantification. Here, we describe a protocol that provides robust preservation of adipocyte morphology in skeletal muscle sections allowing visualization, imaging, and quantification of intramuscular fat. We also outline how to process a portion of muscle tissue for RT-qPCR, enabling users to confirm observed changes in fat formation by viewing differences in expression of adipogenic genes. Additionally, we will describe how our protocol can be adopted to visualize adipocytes by whole mount immunofluorescence of muscle samples. Finally, we will outline how to combine this protocol with genetic lineage tracing of Pdgfr-expressing FAPs to study the adipogenic conversion of FAPs. Our protocol consistently yields high-resolution and morphologically accurate immunofluorescent images of adipocytes that, along with confirmation by RT-qPCR, allows for robust, rigorous, and reproducible visualization and quantification of intramuscular fat. Together, our analysis pipeline is the first step to improve our understanding of how FAPs differentiate into intramuscular fat and provides a framework to validate novel interventions to prevent fat formation.",

    "abstract": "The Human Impacts Database (www.anthroponumbers.org) is a curated searchable resource housing quantitative data relating to the diverse anthropogenic impacts on our planet, with topics ranging from sea level rise, to livestock populations, greenhouse gas emissions, fertilizer use, and beyond. Each entry in the database relates a quantitative value (or a time-series of values) along with clear referencing of the primary source, the method of measurement or estimation, an assessment of uncertainty, links to the underlying data, as well as a permanent identifier called an Human Impacts ID (\"HuID\"). While there are other databases that house some of these values, they are typically focused on a single topic area like energy usage or greenhouse gas emissions. The Human Impacts Database provides centralized access to quantitative information about the myriad ways in which humans impact the Earth, giving links to more specialized databases for interested readers. Here, we outline the structure of the database and describe our curation procedures. Finally, we use this database to generate a graphical summary of the current state of human impacts on the Earth, illustrating both their numerical values and their dense interconnections.\n\nThe Bigger PictureOver the last 10,000 years, human activities have transformed the Earth through farming, forestry, mining and industry. The complex results of these activities are now observed and quantified as \"human impacts\" on Earths atmosphere, oceans, biosphere and geochemistry. While myriad studies have explored facets of human impacts on the planet, they are necessarily technical and often tightly-focused. Thus, finding reliable quantitative information requires a significant investment of time to assess each quantity, its methods of determination, and associated uncertainty. We present the Human Impacts Database (www.anthroponumbers.org), which houses a diverse array of such quantities. We review a subset of these values and how they help build intuition for understanding the Earth-human system. While collation alone does not tell us how to best ameliorate human impacts, we contend that any future plans should be made in light of a quantitative understanding of the interconnected ways in which humans impact the planet.",

This strain has insecticidal activity against insect pests from different orders. Also, it is characterized by its significant activity against plant fungal infections and as plant growth promotion.\n\nAimsTo report the whole genome sequencing (WGS) and annotation of the Bt SY49.1 strain.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe Bt SY49.1 strain was isolated from the soil sample in Adana city by using a sodium acetate enriched medium. Bacterial DNA was extracted then sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology. After data filtering and quality control, de novo assembly and genomic annotation were applied. Evolutionary and comparative genomic analysis and variant calling were performed using various in silico tools.\n\nResultsThe WGS of strain Bt SY49.1 is 6. 32 Mbp long with a GC content of 34.68%. It reveals large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and InDels. The assembled genome contains 6,562 protein-encoding genes. In addition, it encodes various gene inventories for the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds such as insecticidal delta endotoxins, growth stimulatory deaminase and phosphatases, fungicidal thuricin, bacillibactin, petrobactin, fengycin / plipastin, and zwittermycin A.\n\nConclusionThe strain Bt SY49.1 could have several potential utilities as a source of antibiotics compounds, plant growth promoting metabolites, and biocontrol agents for fungal phytopathogens, and insects. We expect that the draft genome of the Bt SY49.1 strain may provide a model for proper understanding and studying of antimicrobial compound mining, genetic diversity among the B. cereus group, and pathogenicity against insect pests and plant diseases, and growth-promoting activity.",

    "abstract": "Using contemporary people as proxies for ancient communities is a contentious but necessary practice in anthropology. In Southern Africa, the distinction between the Cape KhoeSan and eastern KhoeSan remains unclear as ethnicity labels are continually changed through time and most communities were extirpated. The eastern KhoeSan may reflect an  essentialistic biological distinction from neighbouring Bantu-speaking communities or it may not be tied to  race and instead denote communities with a nomadic  life-way distinct from agro-pastoralism. The BaPhuthi of the 1800s in the Maloti-Drakensberg, Southern Africa had a substantial San constituency and a life-way of nomadism, cattle raiding, and horticulture. The BaPhuthi heritage could provide insights into the history of the eastern KhoeSan. We examine for the first time genetic affinities of 23 BaPhuthi to distinguish if KhoeSan ancestry reflects biologically distinct heritage or a shared life-way. Data were merged with 52 global populations. The Principle Component Analysis, ADMIXTURE clustering and F3 tests show no support for a unique eastern KhoeSan ancestry distinct from other KhoeSan or southern Bantu-speaking communities. The BaPhuthi have strong affinities with Nguni communities, as the non-Nguni show strong evidence of recent African admixture possibly related to late-iron age migrations. The BaPhuthi may have an interesting connection to the early iron-age Bantu-speaking communities as MALDER detected no signals for late-iron age admixture. We demonstrate how the  essentialistic understanding of references in historic literature creates misconstrued notions of ethnic/biological distinctions when  San and  Bushman may have reflected ambiguous references to the non-sedentary polities and practices.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with complex etiology and no strategies for complete cure. IBD are often complicated by mental disorders like anxiety and depression, indicating substantial shifts in the gut-brain axis. However, the mechanisms connecting IBD to mental diseases are still under debate. Here we use Muc2 mutant mouse model of chronic colitis to uncouple the effects of the intestinal microbiota on host behavior from chronic inflammation in the gut. Muc2 mutant male mice exhibit high exploratory activity, reduced anxiety-related behaviors, impaired sensorimotor gating, and altered social preference towards males and females. Microbial transfer to wild-type mice via littermate co-housing shows that colitis-associated microbiota rather than inflammation per se defines behavioral features in Muc2 colitis model. Metagenomic profiling and combination of antibiotic treatments revealed that bacterial species Akkermansia muciniphila is associated with the behavioral phenotype in mutants, and that its intestinal abundance correlates with social preference towards males. Metabolomic analysis together with pharmacological inhibition of Gly and NMDA receptors helped us to determine that brain glycine is responsible for the behavioral phenotype in Muc2 mice. Blood and brain metabolic profiles suggest that microbiota-dependent changes in choline metabolism might be involved in regulation of central glycine neurotransmission. Taken together, our data demonstrates that colitis-associated microbiota controls anxiety, sensorimotor gating and social behavior via metabolic regulation of the brain glycinergic system, providing new venues to combat neurological complications of IBD.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional video-based pose estimation is a technique that can estimate human skeletal coordinates from video data alone. It is also being applied to gait analysis and, particularly, due to its simplicity of measurement, it has the potential to be applied to the gait analysis of large populations. In contrast, it is considered difficult to completely homogenize the environment and settings during the measurement of large populations. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately deal with technical errors that are not related to the biological factors of interest. In this study, by analyzing a large cohort database, we have identified four major types of anomalies that occur during gait analysis using OpenPose in uncontrolled environments: anatomical, biomechanical, and physical anomalies and errors due to estimation. We have also developed a workflow for identifying and correcting those anomalies and confirmed that the workflow is reproducible through simulation experiments. Our results will help obtain a comprehensive understanding of the anomalies to be addressed in a pre-processing for 2D video-based gait analysis of large populations.\n\nAuthor summaryGait is one of the important biomarkers of health conditions. With developing mobile health technologies, it is becoming easier to measure our health. However, to realize preventive medicine, establishing evidence is a critical issue, and we need to collect data from a large population. Two-dimensional video-based pose estimation can be a solution for the gait analysis of such a population. However, the technical accuracy and limitations of this analysis have not yet been sufficiently discussed. In this study, by analyzing the largest database currently available, we systematically identified four types of technical anomalies that occur during gait measurement: anatomical, biomechanical, and physical anomalies and errors dues to estimation. We have also shown how to deal with these issues and made solutions available as software so that researchers can reproduce them. In the future, increasing number of studies will use 2D video-based pose estimation to research health-related gait among large populations. We believe that our work will provide a guideline for researchers and clinicians involved in these studies to discuss design and algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Human brain demonstrates amazing readiness for speech and language learning at birth, but the auditory development preceding such readiness remains unknown. Cochlear implanted (CI) children with prelingual deafness provide a unique opportunity to study this developmental stage. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, we revealed that the brain of CI children was nearly irresponsive to sounds at CI hearing onset. With increasing CI experiences up to 32 months, the brain demonstrated function, region and hemisphere specific development. Most strikingly, the left anterior temporal lobe showed an oscillatory trajectory, changing in opposite phases for speech and noise. In addition, speech responses increased linearly in left sylvian parieto-temporal area and right inferior frontal gyrus, and noise responses changed in U shape in right supramarginal gyrus. Such cortical development predicted behavioral improvement. The study provides the first longitudinal brain imaging evidence for early auditory development preceding speech acquisition in the human brain.\n\nGraphic abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483211v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d84974org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be9ba0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db5fb7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68f420_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe brain of cochlear implanted toddlers is functionally inferior to neonates\nC_LIO_LIHearing experiences drive functional development in auditory related cortical areas\nC_LIO_LISpeech and noise processing develop in anti-phasic oscillatory trajectories\nC_LIO_LIAuditory cortical development predicts post-implantation behavioral improvement\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Manipulating neuronal homeostasis, which enables neurons to regulate their intrinsic excitability, offers an attractive opportunity to prevent seizures. However, no anticonvulsant compounds have yet been reported that directly manipulate neuronal homeostasis. Here, we describe a novel class of anticonvulsant compounds, based on 4-tert-butyl-benzaldehyde (4-TBB), with a mode-of-action that includes increased expression of the homeostatic regulator Pumilio (Pum). In Drosophila and mouse we use a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced seizure model, and an electrically induced seizure model for refractory seizures to evaluate anticonvulsant efficacy. The pyrazole analogue (RAB216) demonstrates best efficacy, protecting 50% of mice from PTZ-induced seizure. Knock-down of Pum, in Drosophila, blocks anticonvulsive effects, whilst analysis of validated Pum targets show significant reductions following exposure of mouse brain to 4-TBB. This study provides proof-of-principle that anticonvulsant effects can be achieved through regulation of neuronal homeostasis and identifies a chemical lead compound for future development.",

Goji berry is being used for the treatment of various cancers, gastrointestional disorders, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and glaucoma. However, its use for management of oral inflammatory diseases has not been explored. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial, anti-adhesion, and anti-biofilm, and cytotoxic properties of an ethanolic extract of Lycium barbarum (LBE) against oral and periodontal pathogens. The antimicrobial properties of LBE against five microorganisms were tested and compared against Chlorhexidine and doxycycline along with cytotoxicity and cell viability on the gingival fibroblast and modified keratinocyte cell lines. The anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm properties of LBE against Porphyromonas gingivalis, at its minimal bactericidal value, were evaluated. The antimicrobial, anti-adhesion and antibiofilm properties of LBE were found to be comparable to chlorhexidine but less than that of doxycycline. The LBE extract was also compactible to gingival fibroblast tissues and oral keratinocytes at 1 mg/ml. The results proved that goji berry is as effective as chlorhexidine and can be used as a promising natural herb for the management of inflammatory diseases of oral cavity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTicks are vectors that can harbor pathogens like viruses, protozoa and bacteria that can cause zoonotic diseases in human. Human gets infected through tick bites where the pathogens are passed to the human blood. One tick bite can lead to transmission of more than one disease. Ticks are obligate hematophagous, infest most vertebrates globally. Lack of surveillance information about the tick-borne pathogens and diseases has made it impossible to assess its impact to the community.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe morphologically identified ticks collected from two game reserves in Kenya, locations near the Shimba Hills National Reserve (SHNR) and Tsavo National Reserve (TNR). We identified tick-borne pathogens by HRM analysis and sequencing of specific RT-PCR products of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia.\n\nResultsA total of 317 (281 adult ticks and 36 nymphs) was collected at near Tsavo National Reserve in Taita Taveta County, which includes seven species. Amblyomma was the most sampled genus with Amblyomma gemma being the most sampled species (n=135, 42.6%). Other Amblyomma species sampled was Amblyomma Variegatum (n= 40, 12.62%). Greatest species diversity was identified in Rhipicephalus genus with four species identified that includes; Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (n=44, 13.9%), Rhipicephalus Averts (n=1, 0.31%), Rhipicephalus Decoloratus (n=5, 1.6%), Rhipicephalus Pulchellus (n= 91, 28.7%). A single species of Hyalomma sp. was sampled. From near Shimba Hill game reserve (SHNR), a total of 240 adults ticks were sampled that comprises of eight species. Amblyomma was the most sampled genus and again Amblyomma gemma being the most sampled species (n=156, 65 %). Other Amblyomma species sampled includes; Amblyomma Lepidum (n= 5, 2.1 %), Amblyomma Variegatum (n= 15, 6.3 %). Greatest species diversity was also identified in Rhipicephalus genus with four species identified that includes; Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (n=18, 7.5 %), Rhipicephalus Averts (n=6, 2.5 %), Rhipicephalus Decoloratus (n=4, 1.7 %), Rhipicephalus Pulchellus (n= 34, 14.2 %). The least sampled species was a single species of Hyalomma Scupense (n=2, 0.83 %). At near Tsavo National Reserve (TNR) in Taita Taveta County, a total of three pools of Rhipicephaline appendiculatus were positive for Theileria parva, two pools of Rhipicephaline evertsi for Anaplasma platys and one pool of Amblyomma variegatum nymphs for Rickettsia africae. From near Shimba Hill game reserve (SHNR), Kwale County, Rickettsia africae pathogen was detected in two pools of Am. variegatum and one pool of Am. Gemma. Rickettsia sp. and Anaplasma sp. were detected in Am. Gemma and Rh. evertsi respective. R. aeschlimannii was detected in a pool of Am. Gemma. These findings highlight the risk of transmission of zoonotic R. africae and unclassified Rickettsia spp. to humans causing African tick-bite fever and other spotted-fever group rickettsioses.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) consists of highly metabolically active adipocytes that catabolize nutrients to produce heat. Playing an active role in triacylglycerol (TAG) clearance, research has shown that dietary fatty acids can modulate the TAG chemistry deposition in BAT after weeks-long dietary intervention, similar to what has been shown in white adipose tissue (WAT). Our objective was to compare the influence of sustained, non-chronic dietary intervention (a one-week interval) on WAT and BAT lipid metabolism and deposition in situ. We use quantitative, label-free chemical microscopy to show that one week of HFD intervention results in dramatically larger lipid droplet (LD) growth in BAT (and liver) compared to LD growth in inguinal WAT (IWAT). Moreover, BAT showed lipid remodeling as increased unsaturated TAGs in LDs, resembling the dietary lipid composition, while WAT (and liver) did not show lipid remodeling on this time scale. Concurrently, expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, particularly desaturases, was reduced in BAT and liver from HFD-fed mice after one week. Our data show that BAT lipid chemistry remodels exceptionally fast to dietary lipid intervention compared WAT, which further points towards a role in TAG clearance.",

Such species provide an opportunity to study rapid adaptation to complex environmental conditions.\n\nMETHODSUsing replicate reciprocal transplants of clones across three habitats, we described patterns of phenotypic response and assessed degree of local adaptation.\n\nKEY RESULTSWe found plants from beach habitats had decreased height, number of leaves, leaf area, and biomass allocation to roots and shoots compared to plants from marsh and roadside habitats when grown in their home habitat. In the marsh habitat, marsh plants were generally larger than beach plants, but not different from roadside plants. There were no differences among plants from different habitats grown in the roadside habitat. Despite this evidence of differentiation in beach and marsh habitats, we found mixed evidence for local adaptation. In their \"home site\" plants from the marsh habitat had greater biomass than plants from the beaches but not compared to plants from roadsides. Biomass comparisons in other habitats were either maladaptive or not significant. However, plants from the roadside had greater survival in their \"home site\" compared to foreign plants. There were no differences in survival in the other habitats.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe found phenotypic differentiation associated with habitats despite the low reported genetic diversity for these populations. Our results partially support the hypothesis of local adaptation in marsh and roadside habitats. Identifying whether these patterns of differentiation result from genetic or heritable non-genetic mechanisms will require further work.",

Here, we further studied this overlap to identify potential candidate drugs for repurposing to treat the cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. We first defined a cognition-related schizophrenia interactome from network propagation analyses, and identified drugs known to target more than one protein within this network. Thereafter, we used gene expression data to further select drugs that could counteract schizophrenia-associated gene expression perturbations. Additionally, we stratified these analyses by sex to identify sex-specific pharmacological treatment options for the cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. After excluding drugs contraindicated in schizophrenia, we identified eight drug candidates, most of which have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Due to gene expression differences in male and female patients, four of those drugs were also selected in our male-specific analyses, and the other four in the female-specific analyses. Based on our bioinformatics analyses of disease genetics, we suggest eight candidate drugs that warrant further examination for repurposing to treat the cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia, and suggest that these symptoms could be addressed by sex-specific pharmacological treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Strategy switching is a form of cognitive flexibility that requires inhibiting a previously successful strategy and then switching to a new strategy of a different categorical modality. It is dependent on dopamine (DA) receptor activation and release in ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex, two primary targets of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA projections. Although the circuitry that underlies strategy switching early in learning has been studied, few studies have examined it after extended discrimination training. This may be important as DA activity and release patterns change across learning, with several studies demonstrating a critical role for substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DA activity and release once behaviors are well learned.\n\nOur previous studies demonstrated that medial septum (MS) activation simultaneously increased VTA and decreased SNc DA population activity, as well as improved reversal learning via these actions on DA population activity. We hypothesized that MS activation would improve strategy switching both early in learning and after extended training through its ability to increase VTA DA population activity and decrease SNc DA population activity, respectively. To test this, we activated the MS of male and female rats with designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs and measured their performance on an operant-based strategy switching task, following 1, 10, or 15 days of discrimination training. Contrary to our hypothesis, MS activation did not affect strategy switching after 1 day of discrimination training. MS activation improved strategy switching after 10 days of discrimination training, but only in females. MS activation improved strategy switching in both sexes after 15 days of discrimination training. This improvement in strategy switching was attenuated by intra-ventral subiculum bicuculline infusion, which selectively inhibited the MS-mediated decrease in SNc DA population activity, and prevented by infusion of both bicuculline and scopolamine, which inhibited both the MS-mediated decrease in SNc and increase in VTA DA population activity. These data indicate that MS activation improves strategy switching, but only once the original strategy has been sufficiently well learned. They also suggest that the mechanism by which this occurs is likely via the MSs regulation of DA neuron responsivity, primarily via its ability to down-regulate DA population activity in the SNc.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles (NP) are being increasingly explored as vehicles for targeted drug delivery because they can overcome free therapeutic limitations by drug encapsulation, thereby increasing solubility and transport across cell membranes. However, a translational gap exists from animal to human studies resulting in only several NP having FDA approval. Because of this, researchers have begun to turn toward physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to guide in vivo NP experimentation. However, typical PBPK models use an empirically derived framework that cannot be universally applied to varying NP constructs and experimental settings. The purpose of this study was to develop a physics-based multiscale PBPK compartmental model for determining continuous NP biodistribution. We successfully developed two versions of a physics-based compartmental model, models A and B, and validated the models with experimental data. The more physiologically relevant model (model B) had an output that more closely resembled experimental data as determined by normalized root mean squared deviation (NRMSD) analysis. A branched model was developed to enable the model to account for varying NP sizes. With the help of the branched model, we were able to show that branching in vasculature causes enhanced uptake of NP in the organ tissue. The models were solved using two of the most popular computational platforms, MATLAB and Julia. Our experimentation with the two suggests the highly optimized ODE solver package DifferentialEquations.jl in Julia outperforms MATLAB when solving a stiff system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We experimented with solving our PBPK model with a neural network using Julias Flux.jl package. We were able to demonstrate that a neural network can learn to solve a system of ODEs when the system can be made non-stiff via quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). In the future, this model will incorporate modules that account for varying NP surface chemistries, multiscale vascular hydrodynamic effects, and effects of the immune system to create a more comprehensive and modular model for predicting NP biodistribution in a variety of NP constructs.\n\nAuthor summaryNanoparticles (NP) have been used in various drug delivery contexts because they can target specific locations in the body. However, there is a translational gap between animals and humans, so researchers have begun toward computational models to guide in vivo NP experimentation.

We successfully developed two versions of ODE-based compartmental models (models A and B) and an ODE-based branched vascular model implemented in MATLAB and Julia and validated models with experimental data. Additionally, we demonstrated using a neural network to solve our ODE system.

Although these studies are publicly available, substantial computational expertise and manual effort are required to compare similar studies, visualize gene expression patterns within studies, and use published data to generate new experimental hypotheses. Furthermore, it is difficult to filter available studies by domain-relevant attributes such as strain, treatment, or media, or for a researcher to assess how a specific gene responds to various experimental conditions across studies. To reduce these barriers to data re-analysis, we have developed an R Shiny application called CF-Seq, which works with a compendium of 147 studies and 1,446 individual samples from 13 clinically relevant CF pathogens. The application allows users to filter studies by experimental factors and to view complex differential gene expression analyses at the click of a button. Here we present a series of use cases that demonstrate the application is a useful and efficient tool for new hypothesis generation. (CFSeq: http://scangeo.dartmouth.edu/CFSeq/)",

    "abstract": "Grey matter damage has been established as a key contributor to disability progression in multiple sclerosis. Aside from neuronal loss and axonal transections, which predominate in cortical demyelinated lesions, synaptic alterations have been detected in both demyelinated plaques and normal-appearing grey matter, resulting in functional neuronal damage. The axon initial segment is a key element of neuronal function, responsible for action potential initiation and maintenance of neuronal polarity. Despite several reports of profound axon initial segment alterations in different pathological models, among which experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis, whether the axon initial segment is affected in multiple sclerosis is still unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed axon initial segments from control and multiple sclerosis tissue, focusing on layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons in the neocortex and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and performed analysis on the parameters known to control neuronal excitability, i.e., axon initial segment length and position. We found that the axon initial segment length was unchanged among the different multiple sclerosis samples, and not different from controls. In contrast, in both cell types, the axon initial segment position was altered, with an increased soma-axon initial segment gap, in both active and inactive demyelinated lesions. In addition, using a computational model, we show that this increased gap between soma and axon initial segment might increase neuronal excitability. Taken together, these results show for the first time changes of axon initial segments in multiple sclerosis, in active as well as inactive grey matter lesions in both neocortex and cerebellum, which might alter neuronal function.",

Here, we characterized the complete heterotrimeric G protein complement in Schmidtea mediterranea for the first time and found that seven heterotrimeric G protein subunits promote regeneration. We further characterized two subunits critical for regeneration, Gq1 and G{beta}1-4a, finding that they promote the late phase of anterior polarity re-establishment, likely through anterior pole-produced Follistatin. Incidentally, we also found that five heterotrimeric G proteins modulate planarian behavior. We further identified a putative serotonin receptor, gcr052, that we propose works with G{beta}x2 in planarian locomotion, demonstrating the utility of our strategy for identifying relevant GPCRs. Our work provides foundational insight into roles of heterotrimeric G proteins in planarian biology and serves as a useful springboard towards broadening our understanding of GPCR signaling in adult tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of lung hypoplasia in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a common birth defect, is poorly understood. The diaphragmatic defect can be repaired surgically, but the abnormal lung development contributes to a high mortality in these patients. To better understand the underlying pathobiology, we used the nitrofen rat model of CDH and characterized the proteome of hypoplastic CDH lungs at the alveolar stage (E21). Amongst the 218 significantly altered proteins between CDH and control lungs were Tenascin C, CREBBP, LYN and STAT3. We showed that Tenascin C was decreased around the distal airway branches in nitrofen and human fetal CDH lungs. In contrast, STAT3 was significantly increased in the airway epithelium of nitrofen lungs at E21. STAT3 inhibition after direct nitrofen exposure to fetal rat lung explants (E14.5) partially reversed the hypoplastic lung phenotype ex vivo by increasing peripheral lung budding. Moreover, we demonstrated that several STAT3 associated cytokines (IL-15, IL-9, IL-2) are increased in fetal tracheal aspirates of CDH survivors compared to non-survivors after fetoscopic tracheal occlusion. Using pathway analysis for significantly altered proteins in our proteomic analysis, we observed an enrichment in inflammatory response associated with Epstein Barr Virus and cytokine signaling in nitrofen CDH lungs. However, we were unable to detect EBV mRNA via in-situ Hybridization in human CDH lungs. With our unbiased proteomics approach, we show for the first time that inflammatory processes are likely underlying the pathogenesis of abnormal lung development in CDH.",

    "abstract": "While the One Health issues of intensive animal farming are commonly discussed, keeping companion animals is less associated with the interspecies headway of antimicrobial resistance. With the constant advance of veterinary standards, antibiotics are regularly applied in companion animal medicine. Due to the close coexsistance of dogs and humans, dog bites and other casual encounters with dog saliva (e.g. licking the owner) are common. According to our metagenome studies based on 26 new generation sequencing canine saliva datasets from 2020 and 2021 reposited in NCBI SRA by The 10,000 Dog Genome Consortium and the Broad Institute within Darwins Ark project, canine saliva is rich in bacteria with predictably transferable antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). In the genom of potentially pathogenic Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Corynebacterium, Fusobacterium, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, that are some of the most relevant bacteria in dog bite infections, ARGs against aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins, glycylcyclines, lincosamides, macrolides, oxazolidinone, penams, phenicols, pleuromutilins, streptogramins, sulfonamides and tetracyclines could be identfied. Several ARGs, including ones against amoxicillin-clavulanate, the most commonly applied antibiotic by dog bites, was predicted to be potentially transferable based on their association with mobile genetic elements (e.g. plasmids, phages, integrated mobile genetic elements). According to our findings canine saliva may be a source of transfer of ARG-rich bacteria, that can either colonize the human body or transport ARGs to the host bacteriota and thus can be considered as a risk in the spread of antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 spike requires proteolytic processing for viral entry. The presence of a polybasic furin-cleavage site (FCS) in spike, and evolution towards an optimised FCS by dominant variants of concern (VOCs), are linked to enhanced infectivity and transmission. Here we show that interferon-inducible antiviral restriction factors Guanylate binding proteins (GBP) 2 and 5 interfere with furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike and inhibit the infectivity of early-lineage Wuhan-Hu-1, while VOCs Alpha and Delta have evolved to escape restriction. Strikingly, we find Omicron is unique amongst VOCs, being restricted by GBP2/5, and also IFITM1, 2 and 3. Replacing the spike S2 domain in Omicron with Delta shows S2 is the determinant of entry route and IFITM sensitivity. We conclude that VOC evolution under different selective pressures has influenced sensitivity to spike-targeting restriction factors, with Omicron selecting spike changes that not only mediate antibody escape, and altered tropism, but also sensitivity to innate immunity.",

Little is known regarding the regulation of endogenous erythritol synthesis in humans. In the present study, we investigated the stimuli that promote erythritol synthesis in human cells and characterized potential points of regulation along the PPP. Human A549 lung carcinoma cells were chosen for their known ability to synthesize erythritol. A549 cells were treated with potential substrates for erythritol production, including glucose, fructose, and glycerol. Using siRNA knockdown, we assessed the necessity of enzymes G6PD, TKT, TALDO, and SORD for erythritol synthesis. We also used position-specific 13C-glucose tracers to determine whether the carbons for erythritol synthesis are derived directly from glycolysis or through the oxidative PPP. Finally, we assessed if erythritol synthesis responds to oxidative stress using chemical and genetic models. Intracellular erythritol was directly associated with media glucose concentration. In addition, siRNA knockdown of TKT or SORD inhibited erythritol synthesis, whereas siG6PD did not. Both chemically induced oxidative stress and constitutive activation of the antioxidant response transcription factor NRF2 elevated intracellular erythritol. Our findings indicate that erythritol synthesis is proportional to flux through the PPP and is regulated by non-oxidative PPP enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The current coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has seriously disrupted the daily life of human, mainly attributed to the fact that we know too little about SARS-CoV-2. Increasing studies show that viral infection alters host cells glucose metabolism, which is crucial for viral nucleic acid replication. Here, we integrated RNA-sequencing results and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the aerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (oxiPPP), and DNA replication in lung tissues and cells. However, the direction of metabolic flux and DNA replication were dominated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell-expressed viral receptor protein. More interesting, although hosts with high expression of ACE2 are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the invading virus cannot perform nucleic acid replication well due to the restriction of glucose metabolism, and eventually resulting prolonged infection-cycle or infection failure. Our findings, after a typical epidemiological investigation and modeling analysis, preliminarily explain the reasons for the emergence of asymptomatic infections or lower copy virus at early stage in host with higher ACE2 levels, which will provide important help for the development of more accurate and effective detection methods for diagnosing COVID-19.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483197v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (70K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b51fcforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13b7f9corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136fe46org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16fc92a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed regarding: i) thymic function surrogates [T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and recent thymic emigrants (RTEs)]; ii) naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subsets; iii) T helper (Th) phenotype and chemokine receptors expression on T cells subsets; iv) regulatory T cell (Tregs) phenotype; and vi) expression of activating/inhibitory receptors by natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IgG seroprevalence.\n\nResultsNewly diagnosed RRMS patients and HC have equivalent thymic function as determined by similar numbers of RTEs, and levels of sjTRECs, DJ{beta}TRECs and sj/DJ{beta}TREC ratio. In the CD8+ T cells compartment RRMS patients have a higher naive/memory ratio and lower memory cell counts in blood, specifically of effector memory and TemRA CD8+ T cells. Among CD4+ T cells lower blood counts of effector memory cells are found in patients upon controlling for sex, age and HCMV IgG seroprevalence. RRMS patients have higher percentage of naive Tregs comparing to HC. Percentages of immature CD56bright NK cells expressing the inhibitory receptor KLRG1, and of mature CD56dimCD57+ NK cells expressing NKp30 are higher in patients. No major alterations are observed on NKT cells. MS severity and time from relapse correlate with immune cells alterations.\n\nConclusionCharacterization of the peripheral immune system of treatment-naive newly diagnosed RRMS patients unveiled immune features present at clinical onset including lower memory T cells blood counts, particularly among CD8+ T cells, higher percentage of naive Tregs and altered percentages of NK cells subsets expressing inhibitory or activating receptors.

The chromatographic capture of cells, combined with selective elution methods facilitates a greater level of experimental control over the sample inputs required for downstream high throughput and high sensitivity, analytical methods.

    "abstract": "Conjugal plasmids constitute a major engine for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, and are key drivers of the spread of antibiotic resistance, virulence, and metabolic functions. Bacteria in terrestrial habitats often inhabit surfaces that are not constantly water-saturated, where microscopic surface wetness (MSW), comprised of thin liquid films and microdroplets, permanently or intermittently occurs. How physical properties of microdroplets, and of the surfaces they reside on, affect plasmid transfer rates is not well understood. Here, building on microscopy-based microdroplet experiments, we examined the relation between droplet properties (size and spread) and plasmid transfer rates at single-cell and individual droplet resolution, using Pseudomonas putida as a model species. We show that transfer rates increase with droplet size, due to higher densities of cells on the surface in larger droplets, resulting from lower ratio between the area of the liquid-solid interface and droplet volumes. We further show that surface hydrophobicity promotes transfer rates via the same mechanism. Our results provide new insights into how physical properties of surfaces and MSW affect plasmid transfer rates, and more generally, interactions mediated by cell-to-cell contact, with important implications for our understanding of the ecology and evolution of bacteria in unsaturated environments.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic Vibrio species account for 3-5 million annual life-threatening human infections. Virulence is driven by bacterial hemolysin and toxin gene expression often positively regulated by the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) HlyU transcriptional regulator family and silenced by Histone-like nucleoid structural protein (H-NS). In the case of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, HlyU is required for virulence gene expression associated with Type 3 Secretion System-1 (T3SS-1) although its mechanism of action is not understood. Here, we provide evidence for DNA cruciform attenuation mediated by HlyU binding to support concomitant virulence gene expression. Genetic and biochemical experiments revealed that upon HlyU mediated DNA cruciform attenuation, an intergenic cryptic promoter became accessible allowing for exsA mRNA expression and initiation of an ExsA autoactivation feedback loop at a separate ExsA-dependent promoter. Using a heterologous E. coli expression system, we reconstituted the dual promoter elements which revealed that HlyU binding and DNA cruciform attenuation were strictly required to initiate the ExsA autoactivation loop. The data indicate that HlyU acts to attenuate a transcriptional repressive DNA cruciform to support T3SS-1 virulence gene expression and reveals a non-canonical extricating gene regulation mechanism in pathogenic Vibrio species.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome research is hampered by the fact that many bacteria are still unknown and by the lack of publicly available isolates. Fundamental and clinical research is in need of comprehensive and well-curated repositories of cultured bacteria from the intestine of mammalian hosts. In this work, we expanded the mouse intestinal bacterial collection (www.dsmz.de/miBC) to 212 strains, all publicly available and taxonomically described. This includes the study of strain-level diversity, small-sized bacteria, and the isolation and characterization of the first cultured members of one novel family, 10 novel genera, and 39 novel species. We demonstrate the value of this collection by performing two studies. First, metagenome-educated design allowed establishing custom synthetic communities (SYNs) that reflect different susceptibilities to DSS-induced colitis. Second, nine phylogenetically and functionally diverse species were used to amend the Oligo-Mouse Microbiota (OMM)12 model [Brugiroux et al. 2016 Nat Microbiol]. These strains compensated for differences observed between gnotobiotic OMM12 and specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice at multiple levels, including body composition and immune cell populations (e.g., T-cell subtypes) in the intestine and associated lymphoid tissues. Ready-to-use OMM stocks are available to the community for use in future studies. In conclusion, this work improves our knowledge of gut microbiota diversity in mice and enables functional studies via the modular use of isolates.",

    "abstract": "Despite enabling Streptococcus pneumoniae to acquire antibiotic resistance and evade vaccine-induced immunity, transformation occurs at variable rates across pneumococci. Phase variants of isolate RMV7, distinguished by altered methylation patterns driven by the translocating variable restriction-modification (tvr) locus, differed significantly in their transformation efficiencies and biofilm thicknesses. These differences were replicated when the corresponding tvr alleles were introduced into an RMV7 derivative lacking the locus. RNA-seq identified differential expression of the type 1 pilus, causing the variation in biofilm formation, and inhibition of competence induction in the less transformable variant, RMV7domi. This was partly attributable to lower expression of ManLMN in RMV7domi, which promoted competence induction through importing N-acetylglucosamine. This effect was potentiated by orthologues of the gram-negative competence regulatory machinery. Furthermore, a phage-related chromosomal island was more active in RMV7domi, which inhibited transformation by increasing expression of the stress response proteins ClpP and HrcA. However, HrcA increased competence induction in the other variant, with its effects depending on Ca2+ supplementation or heat shock. Hence the heterogeneity in transformation efficiency likely reflects the diverse signalling pathways by which it is affected. This regulatory complexity will modulate population-wide responses to synchronising quorum sensing signals to produce co-ordinated yet stochastic \"bet hedging\" behaviour.",

    "abstract": "RNA pol II transcribes snRNA genes in close proximity to Cajal bodies, subnuclear compartments that depend on the SUMO isopeptidase USPL1 for their assembly. We show here that overexpression of USPL1 alters snRNA 3-end cleavage, a process carried out by the Integrator complex. Beyond its role in snRNA biogenesis, this complex is responsible for regulating the expression of different non-coding and coding transcripts. We validated several subunits of the complex as SUMO conjugation substrates, and found that the SUMOylation of INTS11 subunit is regulated by USPL1. We defined Lys 381, Lys 462 and Lys 475 as bona fide SUMO attachment sites within INTS11 and observed that SUMOylation of this protein is required for efficient Integrator activity. Moreover, while an INTS11 SUMOylation deficient mutant is still capable of interacting with INTS4 and INTS9, its interaction with other subunits of the complex is affected. This mutant also shows a more cytoplasmatic localization than the wild type protein. These findings point to a regulatory role of SUMO conjugation on Integrator activity and suggest the involvement of INTS11 SUMOylation in the assembly of the complex. Furthermore, this work adds the Integrator-dependent RNA processing to the growing list of cellular processes regulated by SUMO conjugation.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Ty1 retrotransposon integrates upstream of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Specificity of integration is mediated by an interaction between the Ty1 integrase (IN1) and Pol III, currently uncharacterized at the atomic level. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of Pol III in complex with IN1, revealing a 16-residue segment at the IN1 C-terminus that contacts Pol III subunits AC40 and AC19, an interaction that we validate by in vivo mutational analysis. Unexpectedly, IN1 binding associates with insertion of subunit C11 C-terminal Zn-ribbon into the Pol III funnel, which provides atomic evidence for a two-metal mechanism during RNA cleavage. Moreover, unstructured regions of subunits C53 and C37 reorganize close to C11, likely explaining the connection between the C37/C53 heterodimer and C11 during transcription reinitiation. Our results suggest that IN1 binding induces a Pol III configuration that favors chromatin residence, thus improving the likelihood of Ty1 integration.",

    "abstract": "The enteropeptidase (EP) initiates the intestinal digestion by proteolytic processing of trypsinogen, generating catalytic active trypsin. The dysfunction of EP will cause a series of pancreatic diseases, the most severe of which is acute necrotizing pancreatitis. However, the molecular mechanism of EP activation and substrate recognition remain elusive due to the lack of structural information, hampering the structure-based research of EP and even further EP-targeted drug design. Here we report cryo-EM structures of human EP in multiple states, covering the functional cycle spanning from inactive to active state and eventually to the substrate binding state, with the inactive core region reached an atomic 2.7-[A]-resolution. The heavy chain of EP exhibits a clamping configuration with the CUB2 domain serving for substrate recognition. The N-terminus of light chain induces the surface loop remodeling from inactive to active conformation, resulting in a highly dynamic and active EP. Then the heavy chain performs like a hinge to ensure the flexibility of light chain for substrate recruitment and subsequent cleavage. Our study provides structural insights of EP remodeling and heavy chain dynamics while performing enzymatic function, facilitating our understanding of the pathogenies of EP-related pancreatitis and the EP-targeted treatment of pancreatitis.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide; hence there is an increasing focus on developing physiologically relevant in vitro cardiovascular tissue models suitable for studying personalized medicine and pre-clinical tests. Despite recent advances, models that reproduce both tissue complexity and maturation are still limited.\n\nWe have established a scaffold-free protocol to generate multicellular, beating and self-organized human cardiac organoids (hCO) in vitro from hiPSCs that can be cultured for long term. This is achieved by differentiation of hiPSC in 2D monolayer culture towards cardiovascular lineage, followed by further aggregation on low-attachment culture dishes in 3D. The generated human cardiac organoids (hCOs) containing multiple cell types that physiologically compose the heart, gradually self-organize and beat without external stimuli for more than 50 days. We have shown that 3D hCOs display improved cardiac specification, survival and maturation as compared to standard monolayer cardiac differentiation. We also confirmed the functionality of hCOs by their response to cardioactive drugs in long term culture. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hCOs can be used to study chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.\n\nThis study could help to develop more physiologically-relevant cardiac tissue models, and represent a powerful platform for future translational research in cardiovascular biology.",

    "abstract": "Formation of a properly sized and patterned embryo during gastrulation requires a well-coordinated interplay between cell proliferation, lineage specification and tissue morphogenesis. Following transient physical or pharmacological manipulations, pre-gastrulation stage mouse embryos show remarkable plasticity to recover and resume normal development. However, it remains unclear how mechanisms driving lineage specification and morphogenesis respond to defects in cell proliferation during and after gastrulation. Null mutations in DNA replication or cell-cycle related genes frequently lead to cell cycle arrest and reduced cell proliferation, resulting in developmental arrest before the onset of gastrulation; such early lethality precludes studies aiming to determine the impact of cell proliferation on lineage specification and morphogenesis during gastrulation. From an unbiased ENU mutagenesis screen, we discovered a mouse mutant, tiny siren (tyrn), that carries a hypomorphic mutation producing an aspartate to tyrosine (D939Y) substitution in Pold1, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase {delta}. Impaired cell proliferation in the tyrn mutant leaves anterior-posterior patterning unperturbed during gastrulation but results in an overall reduction in embryo size and in severe morphogenetic defects. Our analyses show that the successful execution of morphogenetic events during gastrulation requires that lineage specification and the ordered production of differentiated cell types occur in concordance with embryonic growth.\n\nSummary statementPold1 hypomorphic mutation caused reduced size and abnormal morphology of gastrulating mouse embryos, supporting the importance of coordinated embryo size, lineage specification and tissue morphogenesis for normal embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "LIM-homeobox genes play multiple roles in developmental processes, but their roles in gonad development are not completely understood. Herein, we report that Lhx2, Ils2, Lmx1a, and Lmx1b are expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner in mouse, rat, and human gonads during sex determination. Amongst these, Lhx2 has female biased expression in the developing gonads of species with environmental and genetic modes of sex determination. Single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed that Lhx2 is exclusively expressed in the germ cells of the developing mouse ovaries. To elucidate the roles of Lhx2 in the germ cells, we analyzed the phenotypes of Lhx2 knockout XX gonads. While the gonads developed appropriately in Lhx2 knockout mice and the somatic cells were correctly specified in the developing ovaries, transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of genes in the angiogenesis pathway. There was an elevated expression of several pro-angiogenic factors in the Lhx2 knockout ovaries. The elevated expression of pro-angiogenic factors was associated with an increase in numbers of endothelial cells in the Lhx2-/-ovaries at E13.5. Gonad recombination assays revealed that the increased numbers of endothelial cells in the XX gonads in absence of Lhx2 was due to ectopic migration of endothelial cells in a cell non-autonomous manner. We also found that, there was increased expression of several endothelial cell-enriched male-biased genes in Lhx2 knockout ovaries. Also, in absence of Lhx2, the migrated endothelial cells formed an angiogenic network similar to that of the wild type testis, although the coelomic blood vessel did not form. Together, our results suggest that Lhx2 in the germ cells is required to suppress vascularization in the developing ovary. These results suggest a need to explore the roles of germ cells in the control of vascularization in developing gonads.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483280v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59ca47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ef193eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@162651corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc3d0f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightO_LIMultiple LIM-HD genes are expressed in developing gonads during the window of sex determination with Lhx2 having female dominating expression in an evolutionarily conserved manner\nC_LIO_LILhx2 is expressed in the germ cells of developing mouse ovaries\nC_LIO_LILoss of Lhx2 in the developing ovaries alters the expression of genes involved in various pathways including angiogenesis\nC_LIO_LILhx2 in germ cells suppress endothelial cell migration in the developing ovaries\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAlthough genome-wide association studies (GWAS) multiple regions conferring genetic risk for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), we are still faced with the task of identifying the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the disease haplotypes that exert the biological effects that confer risk. Until we identify the risk-driving variants, identifying the genes influenced by these variants, and therefore translating genetic information to improved clinical care, will remain an insurmountable task. We used a function-based approach for identifying causal variant candidates and the target genes on JIA risk haplotypes.\n\nMethodsWe used a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in myeloid K562 cells to query the effects of 5,226 SNPs in non-coding regions on JIA risk haplotypes for their ability to alter gene expression when compared to the common allele. The assay relies on 180 bp oligonucleotide reporters (\"oligos\") in which the allele of interest is flanked by its cognate genomic sequence. Barcodes were added randomly by PCR to each oligo to achieve >20 barcodes per oligo to provide a quantitative read-out of gene expression for each allele. Assays were performed in both unstimulated K562 cells and cells stimulated overnight with interferon gamma (IFNg). As proof of concept, we then used CRISPRi to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying the genes regulated by enhancers harboring expression-altering SNPs.\n\nResultsWe identified 553 expression-altering SNPs in unstimulated K562 cells and an additional 490 in cells stimulated with IFNg. We further filtered the SNPs to identify those plausibly situated within functional chromatin, using open chromatin and H3K27ac ChIPseq peaks in unstimulated cells and open chromatin plus H3K4me1 in stimulated cells. These procedures yielded 42 unique SNPs (total = 84) for each set. Using CRISPRi, we demonstrated that enhancers harboring MPRA-screened variants in the TRAF1 and LNPEP/ERAP2 loci regulated multiple genes, suggesting complex influences of disease-driving variants.\n\nConclusionUsing MPRA and CRISPRi, JIA risk haplotypes can be queried to identify plausible candidates for disease-driving variants. Once these candidate variants are identified, target genes can be identified using CRISPRi informed by the 3D chromatin structures that encompass the risk haplotypes.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism is fundamentally intertwined with the ageing process. We here report that a key determinant of cellular lifespan is not only nutrient supply and intracellular metabolism, but also metabolite exchange interactions that occur between cells. Studying chronological ageing in yeast, we observed that metabolites exported by young, exponentially growing, cells are re- imported during the stationary phase when cells age chronologically, indicating the existence of cross-generational metabolic interactions. We then used self-establishing metabolically cooperating communities (SeMeCos) to boost cell-cell metabolic interactions and observed a significant lifespan extension. A search for the underlying mechanisms, coupling SeMeCos, metabolic profiling, proteomics and genome-scale metabolic modelling, attributed a specific role to methionine consumer cells. These cells were enriched over time, adopted glycolytic metabolism and increased export of protective metabolites. Glycerol, in particular, accumulated in the communal metabolic environment and extended the lifespan of all cells in the community in a paracrine fashion. Our results hence establish metabolite exchange interactions as a determinant of the ageing process and show that metabolically cooperating cells shape their metabolic environment to achieve lifespan extension.",

A single DNA polymerase, apPOL, is targeted to the apicoplast, where it replicates and repairs the genome. apPOL has no direct orthologs in mammals and is considered a promising drug target for the treatment and/or prevention of malaria. We previously reported screening the Malaria Box to identify MMV666123 as an inhibitor of apPOL. Herein we extend our studies and report structure-activity relationships for MMV666123 and identify key structural motifs necessary for inhibition. Although attempts to crystallize apPOL with the inhibitor were not fruitful, kinetic analysis and crystal structure determinations of WT and mutant apo-enzymes, facilitated model building and provided insights into the putative inhibitor binding site. Our results validate apPOL as an antimalarial target and provide an avenue for the design of high potency, specific inhibitors of apPOL and other A-family DNA polymerases.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) extends lifespan via pleotropic mechanisms, but one important molecular mediator of the beneficial effects of IF is AMP-kinase (AMPK). AMPK enhances lipid metabolism and modulates microtubule dynamics. Dysregulation of these two molecular pathways causes right ventricular (RV) failure in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In two models of rodent PAH, we show IF activates RV AMPK, which restores mitochondrial morphology and peroxisomal density and restructures mitochondrial/peroxisomal lipid metabolism protein regulation. IF also increases electron transport chain (ETC) protein abundance and activity in the RV. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic measures of RV function are positively associated with fatty acid oxidation and ETC protein levels in correlational heatmapping analyses. IF also combats heightened microtubule density, which normalizes t-tubule structure. In summation, we demonstrate IF-mediated AMPK signaling counteracts two key molecular drivers of RV failure. Thus, IF may be a novel treatment approach for RV dysfunction, a currently untreatable and lethal consequence of PAH.\n\nHighlights- Intermittent fasting activates AMPK to restructure right ventricular mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid fatty acid metabolism in two rodent models of PAH.\n- Intermittent fasting prevents downregulation of multiple electron transport chain proteins in both monocrotaline and Sugen-hypoxia RVs.\n- Pathological microtubule-mediated junctophilin-2 dysregulation and subsequent t-tubule remodeling is mitigated by intermittent fasting.\n- Intermittent fasting suppresses the induction of both the canonical and peroxisomal ferroptosis pathways in RV failure.",

    "abstract": "The M1 zinc metalloproteases ERAP1, ERAP2 and IRAP play a role in HLA-I antigen presentation by refining the peptidome either in the ER (ERAP1 and ERAP2) or in the endosomes (IRAP). They have been also entrusted with other, although less defined, functions such as the regulation of the angiotensin system and blood pressure. In humans, ERAP1 and IRAP are commonly expressed. ERAP2 instead has evolved under balancing selection that maintains two haplotypes one of which undergoing RNA splicing leading to nonsense-mediated decay and loss of protein. Hence, likewise in rodents in which the ERAP2 gene is missing, about a quarter of the human population does not express ERAP2. We report here that macrophages, but not monocytes or other mononuclear blood cells, express and secrete an ERAP2 shorter form independently from the haplotype. The generation of this \"short\" ERAP2 is due to an autocatalytic cleavage within a distinctive structural motif and requires an acidic microenvironment. Remarkably, ERAP2 \"short\" binds IRAP and the two molecules are co-expressed in the endosomes as well as in the cell membrane. Of note, the same phenomenon could be observed in some cancer cells. These data prompt to reconsider the role of ERAP2 which might have been maintained in humans because fulfilling a relevant function as \"short\" form in specialized cells.",

    "abstract": "The Notch pathway regulates cell fate decisions and is an emerging target for regenerative and cancer therapies. Recombinant Notch ligands are attractive candidates for modulating Notch signaling; however, their intrinsically low receptor-binding affinity restricts their utility in biomedical applications. To overcome this limitation, we evolved variants of the ligand Delta-like 4 (DLL4) with enhanced affinity and cross-reactivity. A consensus variant with maximized binding affinity, DeltaMAX, engages human and murine Notch receptors with 500- to 1000-fold increased affinity compared to wild-type human DLL4. DeltaMAX also potently activates human Notch in plate-bound, bead-bound, and cellular formats. When administered as a soluble decoy, DeltaMAX inhibits Notch activation in response to either Delta-like (DLL) or Jagged (Jag) ligands, highlighting its utility as both an agonist and antagonist. Finally, we demonstrate that DeltaMAX stimulates increased proliferation and expression of effector mediators in primary activated human T cells. Taken together, our data defines DeltaMAX as a versatile biotechnological tool for broad-spectrum activation or inhibition of Notch signaling.",

Experimental evidence shows that the catalytic activity is affected by the electrostatic environment around the peptidyl transferase center. The electrostatic field originates from the particular 3-dimensional space distribution in the phosphate moieties of the 23S (archea and bacteria) or 28S (eukarya) rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit as well as the funnel shape of the cavity at its connection with the ribosome exit tunnel. Here, we set up a minimal geometrical model fitting the available x-ray solved structure of the ribonucleoproteic cavity around the catalytic center of the large subunit of the ribosome. The purpose of this phenomenological model is to estimate quantitatively the electrostatic potential and electric field that are experienced during the peptidyl transfer reaction. At least two reasons motivate the need for developing this quantification. First, we inquire whether the electric field in this particular catalytic environment, made only of nucleic acids, is of the same order of magnitude as the one prevailing in catalytic centers of the proteic enzymes counterparts. Second, the protein synthesis rate is dependent on the nature of the amino acid sequentially incorporated in the nascent chain. The activation energy of the catalytic reaction and its detailed kinetics are expected to be dependent on the mechanical work exerted on the amino acids by the electric field, especially when one of the four charged amino acid residues (R, K, E, D) is newly incorporated in the nascent chain. Physical values of the electric field will provide quantitative knowledge of mechanical work, activation energy and kinetics of the peptide bond formation catalysed by the ribosome.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear lamins have been considered to be an important structural element of the nucleus. The nuclear lamina is thought both to shield DNA from excessive mechanical forces and to transmit mechanical forces onto the DNA. However, to date there is not yet a technical approach to directly measure mechanical forces on nuclear lamins at the protein level. To overcome this limitation, we developed a nanobody-based intermolecular tension FRET biosensor capable of measuring the mechanical strain of lamin filaments. Using this sensor, we were able to show that the nuclear lamina is subjected to significant force. These forces are dependent on nuclear volume, actomyosin contractility, functional LINC complex, chromatin condensation state, cell cycle, and EMT. Interestingly, large forces were also present on nucleoplasmic lamins, indicating that these lamins may also have an important mechanical role in the nucleus. Overall, we demonstrate that nanobody-based approach allows construction of novel force biosensors for mechanobiology studies.",

    "abstract": "Non-specificity is a key challenge in the successful development of therapeutic antibodies. The tendency for non-specific binding in antibodies is often difficult to reduce via judicious design and, instead, it is necessary to rely on comprehensive screening campaigns. A better understanding of the molecular origins that drive antibody non-specificity is therefore highly desirable in order to prevent non-specific off-target binding. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the impact of surface patch properties on antibody non-specificity using a designer antibody library as a model system and DNA as a non-specificity ligand. Using an in solution microfluidics approach, we discover patches of surface hydrogen bonding to be causative of the observed non-specificity under physiological salt conditions and suggest them to be a vital addition to the molecular origins of non-specificity. Moreover, we find that a change in formulation conditions leads to DNA-induced antibody liquid-liquid phase separation as a manifestation of antibody non-specificity. We show that this behaviour is driven by a cooperative electrostatic network assembly mechanism enabled by mutations that yield a positively charged surface patch. Together, our study provides a direct link between molecular binding events and macroscopic liquid-liquid phase separation. These findings highlight a delicate balance between surface interaction patches and their crucial role in conferring antibody non-specificity.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium virguliforme causes the Sudden Death Syndrome, an important disease in soybean crops. In this work, we investigated the defensive response mechanisms in soybean root, at cell wall level, during F. virguliforme infection using an in vitro culture system. We measured total root lignin content by the acetyl bromide method and estimated the in-situ lignin and suberin deposition by confocal microscopy on local and systemic root tissues, i.e. adjacent and distant to the pathogen entry site respectively. Moreover, the expression dynamics of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that, although the most significant increment of lignin deposition was observed in the epidermal cells of local tissues, F. virguliforme also induced lignin deposition changes in a sistemic fashion. In fact, inoculated plants presented a higher deposition of lignin in hypodermis and cortex than the control ones, independently of the distance from the inoculum source, while suberin deposition was higher in local zones. Moreover, the gene expression analysis showed an up-regulation of PAL, HCT and CAD genes after the inoculation with the pathogen, which correlates with the cell wall modifications observed in the local tissues. The results presented here suggest that the increase in lignin and suberin deposition during soybean root/F. virguliforme interaction is probably a strategy not only to stop the pathogen entrance, but to provide the plant more time to prepare its defences as well.",

Despite their high abundance in coastal areas, our knowledge of Synechococcus communities in these environments is based on only a few local studies. Here, we use the global metagenome dataset of the Ocean Sampling Day (June 21st 2014) to get a snapshot of the taxonomic composition of coastal Synechococcus communities worldwide, by recruitment on a reference database of 141 picocyanobacterial genomes, representative of the whole Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and Cyanobium diversity. This allowed us to unravel drastic community shifts over small to medium scale gradients of environmental factors, in particular along European coasts. The combined analysis of the phylogeography of natural populations and the thermophysiological characterization of eight strains, representative of the four major Synechococcus lineages (clades I to IV), also brought novel insights about the differential niche partitioning of clades I and IV, which most often co-dominate the Synechococcus community in cold and temperate coastal areas. Altogether, this study tackles the main differences between open-ocean and coastal communities worldwide.",

We further show that incomplete virus particles are capable of co-infecting mosquitoes, resulting in the rescue of infectious virus that is able to disseminate to the mosquito salivary glands.

    "abstract": "The nucleosome remodeling complexes (CRs) SWI/SNF, RSC, and Ino80C cooperate in evicting or repositioning nucleosomes to produce nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) at the promoters of many yeast genes induced by amino acid starvation. We analyzed mutants depleted of the catalytic subunits of these CRs for binding of transcriptional activator Gcn4 and recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP) during preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly. RSC and Ino80 were found to enhance Gcn4 binding to both UAS elements in NDRs upstream of promoters and to unconventional binding sites within nucleosome- occupied coding sequences; and SWI/SNF contributes to UAS binding when RSC is depleted. All three CRs are actively recruited by Gcn4 to most UAS elements and appear to enhance Gcn4 binding by reducing nucleosome occupancies at the binding motifs, indicating a positive regulatory loop. SWI/SNF acts unexpectedly in WT cells to prevent excessive Gcn4 binding at many UAS elements, indicating a dual mode of action that is modulated by the presence of RSC. RSC and SWI/SNF collaborate to enhance TBP recruitment at Gcn4 target genes, together with Ino80C, in a manner associated with nucleosome eviction at the TBP binding sites. Cooperation among the CRs in TBP recruitment is also evident at the highly transcribed ribosomal protein genes, while RSC and Ino80C act more broadly than SWI/SNF at the majority of other constitutively expressed genes to stimulate this step in PIC assembly. Our findings indicate a complex interplay among the CRs in evicting promoter nucleosomes to regulate activator binding and stimulate PIC assembly.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (CRs), including SWI/SNF and RSC in budding yeast, are thought to stimulate transcription by repositioning or evicting promoter nucleosomes, and we recently implicated the CR Ino80C in this process as well. The relative importance of these CRs in stimulating activator binding and recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to promoters is incompletely understood. Examining mutants depleted of the catalytic subunits of these CRs, we determined that RSC and Ino80C stimulate binding of transcription factor Gcn4 to nucleosome-depleted regions, or linkers between genic nucleosomes, at multiple target genes activated by Gcn4 in amino acid-starved cells, frequently via evicting nucleosomes from the Gcn4 binding motifs. At some genes, SWI/SNF functionally complements RSC, while opposing RSC at others to limit Gcn4 binding. The CRs in turn are recruited by Gcn4 to establish positive or negative feedback loops that control Gcn4 binding. The three CRs also cooperate to enhance TBP recruitment, again involving nucleosome depletion, at both Gcn4 target and highly expressed ribosomal protein genes, whereas only RSC and Ino80C act broadly throughout the genome to enhance this key step in preinitiation complex assembly. Our findings illuminate functional cooperation among multiple CRs in regulating activator binding and promoter activation.",

    "abstract": "A major ongoing research effort seeks to understand the behavior, ecology and control of the spotted lanternfly (SLF) (Lycorma delicatula), a highly invasive pest in the U.S. and South Korea. These insects undergo four nymphal stages (instars) before reaching adulthood, and appear to shift host plant preferences, feeding, dispersal and survival patterns, anti-predator behaviors, and response to traps and chemical controls with each stage. However, categorizing SLF life stage is challenging for the first three instars, which have the same coloration and shape, because no comprehensive datasets exist. We present a dataset of body mass and length for SLF nymphs throughout two growing seasons and compare our results with previously-published ranges of instar body lengths. An analysis using two clustering methods revealed that 1st-3rd instar body mass and length fell into distinct clusters that were consistent between years, supporting using these metrics to stage nymphs during a single growing season. However, the ranges for 2nd-4th instars were not consistent between our results and those from earlier studies for diverse locations. The scaling of SLF nymph body mass with body length varied between isometry (constant shape) and positive allometry (growing faster than predicted by isometry) in the two years studied. Using previously published data, we also found that SLF nymph adhesive footpad area varies in direct proportion to weight, suggesting that footpad adhesion is independent of nymphal stage, while their tarsal claws display positive allometry and hence disproportionately increasing grasp (mechanical adhesion). By contrast, mouthpart dimensions are weakly correlated with body length, consistent with predictions that these features should reflect preferred host plant characteristics rather than body size. We recommend future studies use the body mass vs length growth curve as a fitness benchmark to study how SLF instar development depends on factors such as hatch date, host plant, temperature, and geographic location, to further understanding of life history patterns that help prevent further spread of this invasive insect.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is a significant Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen responsible for a variety of lethal infections. This bacterium accounts for more deaths from diseases than any other single pathogen worldwide. Distinctively, these symptoms arise despite effective antibiotic therapy. This study unveiled a novel mechanism of resistance to S. pneumoniae infection by targeting pneumolysin (PLY) and sortase A (Srt A), the key virulence factors of S. pneumoniae. Through protein phenotype assays, we found alnustone to be a potent drug that inhibits both PLY and Srt A. Using a PLY-mediated hemolysis assay, we found that albumin can effectively reduce Srt A peptidase activity by blocking PLY oligomerization, thereby directly inhibiting PLY-expressing cytolysis. Co-incubation of S. pneumoniae D39 Srt A with small-molecule inhibitors reduces cell wall-bound Nan A (pneumococcal-anchored surface protein Srt A), inhibits biofilm formation, and significantly reduces biomass. But more interestingly, the protective effect of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) on murine streptococcus pneumoniae was further demonstrated. Our study proposes a detailed bacteriostatic mechanism of pneumococcal and highlights the major translational potential of targeting circulating PLY and Srt A to protect against pneumococcal infections. Our results suggest that the antiviral strategy of directly targeting PLY and Srt A with alnustone is a promising treatment option for Streptococcus pneumoniae and that alnustone can be used as an effective inhibitor of PLY and Srt A.",

    "abstract": "Determining critical ecological protected areas at the city (county) spatial scale is crucial for coordinating regional ecological environment management, control, and governance. It is a recognized consensus in academia that human activities significantly impact natural ecosystems. Many scholars ignore this point in the research process and only use several factors to characterize human influence. Therefore, this study takes Aksu City and Wensu County, important cities and towns in southern Xinjiang, as examples, focusing on the impact of human activities on the distribution of critical ecological protection areas. First, we simulated the range, intensity, and local natural conditions of human activities in the study area using geospatial data. We created corresponding resistance surfaces (human activity resistance surface and natural landscape resistance surface). We then assign different weights to the two resistance surfaces based on several possible scenarios, resulting in different synthetic resistance surfaces. Finally, we used the Linkage Mapper plugin to identify critical ecological reserves and compared several results. The results show that: Human activities have greatly interfered with the migration and dispersal of species, affecting the distribution of critical ecological reserves. The specific performance is that in the urban center area with high intensity of human activities, the number and location of the surrounding ecological corridors change significantly with the increase in the proportion of human activity resistance and the total area remains unchanged; As part of the ecological corridors, the ecological pinch points changes with the location of the corridor, and the whole area remains unchanged; The threshold range of the restoration value of ecological barrier points is reduced. The maximum value generated by the restoration of ecological barrier points is reduced, which shows that the restoration value of ecological barrier points decreases with increased human activities.",

In addition, we report the novel application of Shannon entropy to discover sex differences in systematicity of responses not revealed by unit-based measurements; male subjects spent more time investigating between the two shoals than female subjects. This novel technique using established versus newly-formed shoals can be used in future studies testing transgenics and pharmacological treatments that mimic autism spectrum disorder and other disorders that affect social interaction.",
