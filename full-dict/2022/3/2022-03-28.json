    "abstract": "Inhibiting the aggregation of amyloid {beta} (1-42) is a promising strategy for the development of disease-modifying Alzheimers disease therapeutics. To date, however, no sufficiently efficacious inhibitors have been identified, despite the best efforts of >200 advanced drug development campaigns. This failure can be attributed to limitations in current compound screening and in vivo validation assays. Here, we report an in vitro to in vivo screening platform based on the use of a fluorescence lifetime aggregation sensor. The microfluidic \"nanoFLIM\" assay developed circumvents issues that plague conventional assays, such as lack of reproducibility, high cost and artefactual false read-outs. The fluorescence lifetime sensor can also dynamically monitor peptide aggregation in cellular and Caenorhabditis elegans disease models, providing directly comparable aggregation kinetics, which is not achievable by any other method. The power of this unified system for accelerating hit-to-lead strategies, lowering attrition rates and expediting in vivo screening, was demonstrated with a pilot screening campaign of 445 compounds, revealing a new inhibitor that can inhibit amyloid {beta} self-assembly in vitro as well as in cellular and whole organism disease models.",

    "abstract": "Non-insect crustaceans exhibit tremendous body plan diversity. The evolution of diverse patterns of Hox gene expression has been implicated as a primary driver of body plan evolution between crustacean groups, but the mechanisms underlying Hox regulatory evolution remain unknown. We identify Polycomb and Trithorax Group proteins, crucial for proper Hox regulation across bilaterians, in the genome of the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, and demonstrate their essential functions in crustacean Hox regulation and embryonic development using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. Examination of Hox misexpression patterns between individual Hox genes with respect to timing, tissue, and PcG mutant gene in mutant embryos reveals that each crustacean Hox gene follows its own idiosyncratic regulatory mechanism. These results suggest a distinct regulation of Hox genes that may have enabled crustacean body plan evolution.\n\nPrimary Findings- The genome of the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis contains all core Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) proteins\n\n- CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis of PcG proteins induces homeotic transformations and misexpression of Hox genes that differ from similar experiments in insects\n\n- PcG knockout embryos show proper initiation of Hox expression boundaries at early developmental stages\n\n- Each of the three posterior Hox genes in Parhyale displays distinct patterns of misexpression in response to PcG knockout\n\n- Hox regulation appears to occur via different mechanisms in the nervous system vs. limbs\n\n- PcG phenotypes reveal the potential for distinct layers of Hox regulation in crustaceans\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=193 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485719v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (59K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7508a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b0c2dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cc602corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bdf7fc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "De novo mutations underlie individually rare but collectively common pediatric congenital disorders. Some of these mutations can also be detected in tissues and from cells in a parent, where their abundance and tissue distribution can be measured. We previously reported that a subset of these mutations is detectable in sperm from the father, predicted to impact the health of offspring. Here, in three independent couples undergoing in vitro fertilization, we first assessed male gonadal mosaicism, then assessed the transmission of the mutations to their preimplantation blastocysts. We found an overall predictable transmission but slight under-transmission of mutations to blastocysts based upon measured mutational abundance in sperm, and we replicated this conclusion in an independent family-based cohort. Therefore, unbiased preimplantation genetic testing for gonadal mosaicism may represent a feasible approach to reduce the transmission of potentially harmful de novo mutations, which could help to reduce their impact on miscarriage and pediatric disease.",

    "abstract": "By activating fatty acids to their CoA derivatives, acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS) play an essential role in fatty acid metabolism. We previously identified ACSF2 as an ACS that was phylogenetically distinct from known families of short-chain, medium-chain, long-chain, very long-chain, and bubblegum ACSs. Functionally, ACSF2 preferentially activated medium-chain fatty acids. In this work, we provide further characterization of this unique ACS. ACSF2 mRNA expression was found in most tissues, although immunohistochemical analysis revealed differences in protein expression between various cell types in each tissue. Endogenous ACSF2 was found in the Golgi region in Neuro2a and P19 cells, and disruption of the Golgi in Neuro2a cells with nocodazole disrupted ACSF2 localization. In contrast, MA-10, HepG2, and skin fibroblasts had a mitochondrial ACSF2 localization. ACSF2 activated saturated fatty acids containing 6 to 10 carbons when overexpressed in COS-1 cells. The Kmapp for C10:0 was 24.4 M and Vmaxapp was 385 nmol/20min/mg COS cell protein. Knockdown by RNA interference revealed that ACSF2 was responsible for most of the medium-chain ACS activity in Neuro2a cells. A lysine residue critical for activity in bacterial short-chain ACSs was found in ACSF2, and mutation of this residue to alanine abolished enzyme activity. Neurite outgrowth results when Neuro2a cells are induced to differentiate with retinoic acid, and ACSF2 migrated to nodes and points of neurite-neurite contact along with the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin. ACSF2-deficient Neuro2a cells showed significantly blunted neurite outgrowth in response to retinoic acid. These results suggest that this medium-chain ACS may play an important role in neuronal development.",

    "abstract": "The elucidation of viral-receptor interactions and an understanding of virus-spreading mechanisms are of great importance, particularly in the era of pandemic. Indeed, advances in computational chemistry, synthetic biology, and protein engineering have allowed precise prediction and characterization of such interactions. Nevertheless, the hazards of the infectiousness of viruses, their rapid mutagenesis, and the need to study viral-receptor interactions in a complex in vivo setup, call for further developments. Here, we show the development of biocompatible genetically engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) that display the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on their surface as coronavirus mimetics (EVsRBD). Loading EVsRBD with iron oxide nanoparticles makes them MRI-visible, and thus, allows mapping of the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptors non-invasively in live subjects. Importantly, the proposed mimetics can be easily modified to display the RBD of SARS-CoV-2mutants, namely Delta and Omicron, allowing rapid screening of newly raised variants of the virus. The proposed platform thus shows relevance and cruciality in the examination of quickly evolving pathogenic viruses in an adjustable, fast, and safe manner.",

    "abstract": "Viral infections are complex processes based on an intricate network of molecular interactions. The infectious agent hijacks components of the cellular machinery for its profit, circumventing the natural defense mechanisms triggered by the infected cell. The successful completion of the replicative viral cycle within a cell depends on the function of viral components versus the cellular defenses. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important cellular modulators, either promoting or preventing the progression of viral infections. Among these ncRNAs, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) family is especially relevant due to their intrinsic functional properties and ubiquitous biological roles. Specific lncRNAs have been recently characterized as modulators of the cellular response during infection of human host cells by single stranded RNA viruses. However, the role of host lncRNAs in the infection by human RNA coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 remains uncharacterized. In the present work, we have performed a transcriptomic study of a cohort of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Our results revealed the existence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection-dependent pattern of transcriptional up-regulation in which specific lncRNAs are an integral component. To determine the role of these lncRNAs, we performed a functional correlation analysis complemented with the study of the validated interactions between lncRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). This combination of in silico functional association studies and experimental evidence allowed us to identify a lncRNA signature composed of six elements - NRIR, BISPR, MIR155HG, FMR1-IT1, USP30-AS1, and U62317.2 - associated with the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose a competition mechanism between the viral RNA genome and the regulatory lncRNAs in the sequestering of specific RBPs that modulates the interferon response and the regulation of RNA surveillance by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=182 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485903v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4368c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1948201org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e31fd9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1400805_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Graphical abstractModel of interactions among lncRNA and cognate RNA-binding proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphSelective proton transport through proteins is essential for forming and utilizing proton gradients in cells. Protons are conducted along hydrogen-bonded \"wires\" of water molecules and polar sidechains, which, somewhat surprisingly, are often interrupted by dry apolar stretches in the conduction pathways inferred from static protein structures. We hypothesize that protons are conducted through such dry spots by forming transient water wires, often highly correlated with the presence of the excess proton itself in the water wire. To test this hypothesis, we used molecular dynamics simulations to design transmembrane channels with stable water pockets interspersed by apolar segments capable of forming flickering water wires. The minimalist designed channels conduct protons at rates similar to viral proton channels, and they are at least 106-fold more selective for H+ over Na+. These studies inform mechanisms of biological proton conduction and principles for engineering proton-conductive materials.",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockades (ICB) depends on the overall balance of immunogenic and immunosuppressive signals in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Chemotherapy as an immunostimulatory strategy showed potential in improving ICBs clinical efficacy. Yet, evolution of highly plastic tumor-associated myeloid cells hinders ICBs potential to reach its full therapeutic potential. In this study, we leveraged single-cell transcriptomic and trajectory analyses to delineate TIME dynamics after chemotherapy priming. We found that metronomic chemotherapy (MCT) treatment led to an accelerated T cell exhaustion through CXCL16-mediated recruitment of peripheral immature myeloid cells and expansion of STAT1-driven PD-L1 expressing myeloid cells. Inhibiting STAT1 signaling in MCT-primed breast cancer relieved T cell exhaustion and significantly enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 ICB treatment. Our study leveraged single-cell analyses to dissect the dynamics of breast cancer TIME and provides a pre-clinical rationale to translate the anti-STAT1 plus anti-PD-1 combinatorial immunotherapy regimen to maximize ICBs efficacy.\n\nManuscript SummarySingle-cell analyses on low dose chemotherapy primed breast tumor-associated immune cells demonstrates a parallel coexistence of immunogenic and immunosuppressive myeloid cell subsets.

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are critical signal transduction modules in stress responses, but how their composition and mode of activation induces a stress response is poorly understood. We showed in Arabidopsis that CRK21, a cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase (CRK), phosphorylates MAPK kinase kinase 20 (MKKK20) and thus directly activates a novel MAPK cascade, consisting of MKKK20, the MAPK kinase MKK3, and the MAPK MPK6. Furthermore, the protein phosphatase PP2C76 and the calmodulin CaM7 were identified as negative and positive modulators of the cascade, respectively. Loss-of-function in components of the MAPK cascade or in CaM7 led to susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. In contrast, loss-of-function of PP2C76 as well as transient overexpression of the genes in the MAPK cascade and CaM7 conferred resistance to the pathogens. Moreover, seven additional CRKs interacted with MKKK20 in vivo, and four of these were highly expressed after inoculation with P. syringae. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the novel CRK21-MKKK20-MKK3-MPK6 signaling pathway functions in immunity to fungal and bacterial pathogens and that CRKs may function in directly activating MKKKs.",

Here we report on the immunogenicity and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprised of stabilized, pre-fusion Spike protein trimers displayed on a ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) adjuvanted with either conventional aluminum hydroxide or the Army Liposomal Formulation QS-21 (ALFQ) in a cynomolgus macaque COVID-19 model. Vaccination resulted in robust cell-mediated and humoral responses and a significant reduction of lung lesions following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The strength of the immune response suggests that dose sparing through reduced or single dosing in primates may be possible with this vaccine.

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein neutralize infection and are efficacious for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged that partially or fully escape monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. Notably, the BA.2 sublineage of B.1.1.529/omicron escapes nearly all monoclonal antibodies currently authorized for therapeutic treatment of COVID-19. Decoy receptors, which are based on soluble forms of the host entry receptor ACE2, are an alternative strategy that broadly bind and block S from SARS-CoV-2 variants and related betacoronaviruses. The high-affinity and catalytically active decoy sACE22.v2.4-IgG1 was previously shown to be effective in vivo against SARS-CoV-2 variants when administered intravenously. Here, the inhalation of sACE22.v2.4-IgG1 is found to increase survival and ameliorate lung injury in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with a lethal dose of the virulent P.1/gamma virus. Loss of catalytic activity reduced the decoys therapeutic efficacy supporting dual mechanisms of action: direct blocking of viral S and turnover of ACE2 substrates associated with lung injury and inflammation. Binding of sACE22.v2.4-IgG1 remained tight to S of BA.1 omicron, despite BA.1 omicron having extensive mutations, and binding exceeded that of four monoclonal antibodies approved for clinical use. BA.1 pseudovirus and authentic virus were neutralized at picomolar concentrations. Finally, tight binding was maintained against S from the BA.2 omicron sublineage, which differs from S of BA.1 by 26 mutations. Overall, the therapeutic potential of sACE22.v2.4-IgG1 is further confirmed by inhalation route and broad neutralization potency persists against increasingly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

ML models were trained on HIV, influenza A virus, coronavirus 229E, vaccinia viruses, poliovirus, and adenoviruses, which together span the four major categories of virus (DNA, RNA, enveloped, and non-enveloped). A sigmoidal function, fit to virus dilution curves, yielded an R2 higher than 0.98 and a linear dynamic range comparable to or better than conventional plaque or TCID50 assays. Because this technology is based on sensitizing AIs to specific phenotypes of infection, it may have potential as a rapid, broad-spectrum tool for virus identification.",

    "abstract": "Refinement of macromolecular atomic models versus experimental maps in cryo-electron microscopy and crystallography is a critical step in structure solution. For an appropriate comparison, model maps should mimic imperfections of the experimental ones, mainly atomic disorder and its limited resolution, often inhomogeneous over the molecule. We construct these model maps as a sum of atomic contributions expressed through a specially designed function describing a solitary spherical wave. Thanks to this function, atomic contributions analytically depend on both an atomic disorder and the local resolution, a value associated now with each atom. Such fully analytic dependence of inhomogeneous-resolution map values on model parameters permits an efficient refinement of all these parameters together and, beyond structural biology, opens a way to solve similar problems in other research domains.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAn analytic decomposition of 3D-oscillating functions results in efficient tools to calculate maps and refine atomic models.",

    "abstract": "Resident microbes are a feature of vertebrate animals that influence diverse aspects of their biology from tissue development to metabolism. Here we describe transcriptional responses to the microbiota across all the cells of a model developing vertebrate, the larval zebrafish. By performing single cell transcriptomic analysis of whole germ free and conventionalized larvae, we show that the impacts of the microbiota are sensed by all major organ systems but that responses are highly specific to different cell types. The presence of microbiota stimulates the expansion of progenitor-like cells in epithelial tissues and increases proliferation gene expression in progenitor-like cell populations of the immune and nervous systems. Across many cell types, including enterocytes, immune cells, and neurons, the microbiota upregulates expression of genes involved in microbial responses, cell type-specific activities, and cell type-specific deployment of ATP metabolism genes. These combined transcriptional patterns demonstrate how the microbiota simultaneously modulate cellular immune and metabolic programs. The impacts of the microbiota on tissue development are illustrated by the exocrine pancreas, which in the absence of the microbiota is smaller and composed of uniformly differentiated acinar cells. The presence of the microbiota results in exocrine pancreas enlargement and heterogeneous cellular expression of digestive enzyme and secretion genes, demonstrating how the microbiota promotes plasticity in tissue development and function. This single cell transcriptional dataset demonstrates the impacts of the microbiota on vertebrate development across the body and provides a foundation for dissecting cell type specific responses to microbial consortia members or molecules.\n\nSummaryAnimal development proceeds in the presence of intimate microbial associations, but the extent to which different host cells across the body respond to resident microbes remains to be fully explored. Using the vertebrate model organism, the larval zebrafish, we assessed transcriptional responses to the microbiota across the entire body at single cell resolution. We find that cell types across the body, not limited to tissues at host-microbe interfaces, respond to the microbiota. Responses are cell-type specific, but across many tissues the microbiota enhances cell proliferation, increases metabolism, and stimulates a diversity of cellular activities, revealing roles for the microbiota in promoting developmental plasticity. This work provides a resource for exploring transcriptional responses to the microbiota across all cell types of the vertebrate body and generating new hypotheses about the interactions between vertebrate hosts and their microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the imprinted H19/IGF2 locus can lead to Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) in humans. However, the mechanism of how abnormal H19/IGF2 expression contributes to various SRS phenotypes remains unclear, largely due to incomplete understanding of the developmental functions of these two genes. We previously generated a mouse model with humanized H19/IGF2 ICR (hIC1) on the paternal allele that exhibited H19/Igf2 dysregulation together with SRS-like growth restriction and perinatal lethality. Here we dissect the role of H19 and Igf2 in cardiac and placental development utilizing multiple mouse models with varying levels of H19 and Igf2. We report severe cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and thinned myocardium, placental anomalies including thrombosis and vascular malformations, together with growth restriction in mouse embryos that correlated with the extent of H19/Igf2 dysregulation. Transcriptomic analysis using cardiac endothelial cells of these mouse models shows that H19/Igf2 dysregulation disrupts pathways related to extracellular matrix (ECM) and proliferation of endothelial cells. Our work links the heart and placenta through regulation by H19 and Igf2, demonstrating that accurate dosage of both H19 and Igf2 is critical for normal embryonic development, especially related to the cardiac-placental axis.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have produced several Anopheles gambiae homing gene drives that disrupt female fertility genes, thereby eventually inducing population collapse. Such drives may be highly effective tools to combat malaria. One such homing drive, based on the zpg promoter driving CRISPR/Cas9, was able to eliminate a cage population of mosquitoes. A second version, purportedly improved upon the first by incorporating an X-shredder element (which biases inheritance towards male offspring), was similarly successful. Here, we re-analyze the data of each of these gene drives and suggest an alternative interpretation of their performance. We assess each suppression drive within an individual-based simulation framework that models mosquito population dynamics in continuous space. We find that the combined homing/X-shredder drive is actually less effective at population suppression within the context of our mosquito population model. In particular, the combined drive often fails to completely suppress the population, instead resulting in an unstable equilibrium between drive and wild-type alleles. By contrast, otherwise similar drives based on the nos promoter may prove to be more promising candidates for future development due to potentially superior performance.",

    "abstract": "Over two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during the active disease phase has been extensively studied. However, the long-term impact after recovery, which is critical to advance our understanding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-associated long-term complications, remains largely unknown. Herein, we characterized multi-omic single-cell profiles of circulating immune cells in the peripheral blood of 100 patients, including covenlesent COVID-19 and sero-negative controls. The reduced frequencies of both short-lived monocytes and long-lived regulatory T (Treg) cells are significantly associated with the patients recovered from severe COVID-19. Consistently, sc-RNA seq analysis reveals seven heterogeneous clusters of monocytes (M0-M6) and ten Treg clusters (T0-T9) featuring distinct molecular signatures and associated with COVID-19 severity. Asymptomatic patients contain the most abundant clusters of monocyte and Treg expressing high CD74 or IFN-responsive genes. In contrast, the patients recovered from a severe disease have shown two dominant inflammatory monocyte clusters with S100 family genes: S100A8 & A9 with high HLA-I whereas S100A4 & A6 with high HLA-II genes, a specific non-classical monocyte cluster with distinct IFITM family genes, and a unique TGF-{beta} high Treg Cluster. The outpatients and seronegative controls share most of the monocyte and Treg clusters patterns with high expression of HLA genes. Surprisingly, while presumably short-ived monocytes appear to have sustained alterations over 4 months, the decreased frequencies of long-lived Tregs (high HLA-DRA and S100A6) in the outpatients restore over the tested convalescent time (>= 4 months). Collectively, our study identifies sustained and dynamically altered monocytes and Treg clusters with distinct molecular signatures after recovery, associated with COVID-19 severity.",

We show that protection from phage infection increases as the copy number of plasmids carrying the Esp1396l RM system is increased. However, since increased plasmid copy number leads to both increased absolute intracellular REase and MTase levels and decreased MTase to REase ratio, it is impossible to determine which factor determines resistance/susceptibility to infection. By controlled expression of Esp1396I MTase or REase genes in cells carrying the Esp1396I system, we show that a shift in the MTase to REase ratio caused by overproduction of MTase or REase leads, respectively, to decreased or increased protection from infection. Consistently, due to stochastic variation of MTase and REase amount in individual cells, bacterial cells that are productively infected by bacteriophage have significantly higher MTase to REase ratios than cells that ward off the infection. Our results suggest that cells with transiently increased MTase to REase ratio at the time of infection serve as entry points for unmodified phage DNA into protected bacterial populations.",

We compared immune responses elicited by mosaic-8 (SARS-CoV-2 and seven animal sarbecoviruses) and homotypic (only SARS-CoV-2) RBD-nanoparticles in mice and macaques, observing stronger responses elicited by mosaic-8 to mismatched (not on nanoparticles) strains including SARS-CoV and animal sarbecoviruses. Mosaic-8 immunization showed equivalent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron and protected from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV challenges, whereas homotypic SARS-CoV-2 immunization protected only from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Epitope mapping demonstrated increased targeting of conserved epitopes after mosaic-8 immunization.

    "abstract": "Contaminated chicken meat is a major source of human Campylobacteriosis and rates of infection remain high, despite efforts to limit the colonisation of broiler (meat) chicken flocks on farms. Using conventional testing methods of culture or qPCR, Campylobacter is typically detected amongst broiler flocks from 3 weeks of age, leading to the assumption that infection is introduced horizontally into chicken rearing houses at this time. In this study, we use parallel sequencing of a fragment of the Campylobacter outer membrane protein, encoded by the porA gene, to test for presence of Campylobacter DNA amongst fresh faecal samples collected from broiler flocks aged 23-28 days. Campylobacter DNA was detected in all of the 290 samples tested using the porA target, and in 48% of samples using 16S bacterial profiling, irrespective of whether or not Campylobacter could be detected using conventional qPCR thresholds. A single porAf2 variant was predominant amongst flocks that would be determined to be Campylobacter  positive by conventional means, but a diverse pattern was seen amongst flocks that were Campylobacter  negative. The ability to routinely detect low levels of Campylobacter amongst broiler flocks at a much earlier age than would conventionally be identified requires a re-examination of how and when biosecurity measures are best applied for live birds. In addition, it may be useful to investigate why single Campylobacter variants proliferate in some broiler flocks and not others.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs have emerged as an important factor in regulating cell cycle and various other cellular processes. Aberration in microRNAs has been linked with development of several cancers and other diseases but still very little is known about the mechanism behind their function in regulating cellular processes. 99% of cervical cancer is caused by the infection of high-risk HPVs (HR HPVs) which suppresses multiple tumor suppressors and checkpoint factors of the host cell. It also stabilizes oncogenic proteins, one of them is Cdt2/DTL which promotes cell transformation and proliferation. In this study, we have reported that in cervical cancer cell lines miR-34a by targeting HPV E6 protein, regulates Cdt2/DTL protein level and leads to its destabilization. Destabilization of Cdt2 stabilizes onco-suppressor proteins like p21 and Set8 in these cell lines. We have also shown that the overexpression of miR-34a suppresses cell proliferation, invasion and migration capabilities of HPV positive cervical cancer cells which was reverted by overexpression of either HPV E6 or Cdt2 genes. This is the first-ever report to show that miR-34a regulates cell cycle factor Cdt2 by suppressing viral E6 protein level, which opens up the scope of exploring miR-34a as a specific therapy for cervical cancer treatment.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/486030v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@723381org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1937614org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d1ce1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c31bc5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The multiple copies of rRNA genes are thought to have low sequence diversity within one species.

We show that rDNA copies in this yeast are far from homogeneous, both among and within isolates, and that many variants avoided fixation or elimination over evolutionary time. The sequence diversity landscape across the rDNA shows clear functional stratification, suggesting different copy-number thresholds for selection that shape rDNA diversity. Notably, nucleotide variants in the most conserved rDNA regions are sufficiently deleterious to exhibit signatures of purifying selection even when present in only a small fraction of rRNA gene copies. Our results portray a complex evolutionary landscape that shapes rDNA sequence diversity within a single species and reveal unexpectedly deep purifying selection of multi-copy genes.",

    "abstract": "Transporters mediate the uptake of solutes, metabolites and drugs across the cell membrane. The eukaryotic FurE nucleobase/H+ symporter of Aspergillus nidulans has been used as a model protein to address structure-function relationships in the APC transporter superfamily, members of which are characterized by the LeuT-fold and seem to operate by the so-called  rocking-bundle mechanism. In this study, we reveal the binding mode, translocation and release pathway of uracil/H+ by FurE, using path collective variable, funnel metadynamics and rationally designed mutational analysis. Our study reveals a step-wise, induced-fit, mechanism of ordered sequential transport of proton and uracil, which in turn suggests that the FurE symporter, and probably structurally similar transporters, functions as a multi-step gated pore, rather than employing  rocking of compact domains, as generally proposed for APC transporters. In addition, our work further supports the emerging concept that specific elements of cytosolic terminal regions of transporters might be functionally important.",

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanisation has highlighted problems in the urban ecological environment and stimulated research on the evaluation of urban environments. In previous studies, key factors such as greenness, wetness, and temperature were extracted from satellite images to assess the urban ecological environment. Although air pollution has become increasingly serious as urbanisation proceeds, information on air pollution is not included in existing models. The Sentinel-5P satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 2017 is a reliable data source for monitoring air quality. By making full use of images from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-5P, this work attempts to construct a new remote sensing monitoring index for urban ecology by adding air quality information to the existing remote sensing ecological index. The proposed index was tested in the Beijing metropolitan area using satellite data from 2020. The results obtained using the proposed index differ greatly in the central urban region and near large bodies of water from those obtained using the existing remote sensing monitoring model, indicating that air quality plays a significant role in evaluating the urban ecological environment. Because the model constructed in this study integrates information on vegetation, soil, humidity, heat, and air quality, it can comprehensively and objectively reflect the quality of the urban ecological environment. Consequently, the proposed remote sensing index provides a new approach to effectively monitoring the urban ecological environment.",

    "abstract": "Despite early studies linking calcium-calmodulin protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) to prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, the role of CAMKK2 in metastasis in vivo remains unclear. Moreover, while CAMKK2 is known to regulate systemic metabolism, whether CAMKK2s effects on whole body metabolism would impact prostate cancer progression and/or related comorbidities is not known. Here, we demonstrate that germline ablation of Camkk2 slows, but does not stop, primary prostate tumorigenesis in the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) genetic mouse model. Consistent with prior epidemiological reports supporting a link between obesity and prostate cancer aggressiveness, TRAMP mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited a pronounced increase in the colonization of lung metastases. We demonstrated that this effect on metastatic spread was dependent on CAMKK2. Notably, diet-induced lung metastases exhibited a highly aggressive neuroendocrine phenotype. Concurrently, Camkk2 deletion improved insulin sensitivity in the same mice. Histological analyses revealed that cancer cells were smaller in the TRAMP;Camkk2-/- mice compared to TRAMP;Camkk2+/+ controls. Given the differences in circulating insulin levels, a known regulator of cell growth, we hypothesized that systemic CAMKK2 could promote prostate cancer cell growth and disease progression in part through cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Accordingly, host deletion of Camkk2 impaired the growth of syngeneic murine prostate tumors in vivo, confirming nonautonomous roles for CAMKK2 in prostate cancer. Cancer cell size and mTOR signaling was diminished in tumors propagated in Camkk2-null mice. Together, these data indicate that, in addition to cancer cell-intrinsic roles, CAMKK2 promotes prostate cancer progression via tumor-extrinsic mechanisms. Further, we propose that CAMKK2 inhibition may also help combat common metabolic comorbidities in men with advanced prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "The recently discovered insecticidal protein Mpp75Aa1.1 from Brevibacillus laterosporus is one member of the ETX_MTX family of beta-pore forming proteins ({beta}-PFPs) expressed in genetically modified (GM) maize to control western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte). In this paper, bioinformatic analysis establishes that although Mpp75Aa1.1 shares varying degrees of similarity to members of the ETX_MTX2 protein family, it is unlikely to contribute to any allergenic, toxic, or otherwise adverse biological effects. The safety of Mpp75Aa1.1 is further supported by a weight of evidence including evaluation of history of safe use (HOSU) of ETX_MTX2 proteins. Assessments using either purified Mpp75Aa1.1 protein or a poly-histidine-tagged (His-tagged) variant of the Mpp75Aa1.1 protein demonstrate that both forms of the protein are heat labile at temperatures at or above 55 {degrees}C, degraded by gastrointestinal proteases within 0.5 min, and have no adverse effects in acute mouse oral toxicity studies at a dose level of 1920 or 2120 mg/kg body weight. Results also indicate that the domain-based protein characterization should be considered as part of the weight of evidence for the safe consumption of food or feed. Furthermore, these results support the use of His-tagged proteins as suitable surrogates for assessing the safety of their non-tagged parent proteins.",
