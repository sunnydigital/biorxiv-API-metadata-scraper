    "abstract": "The tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases is well known for its roles in antiviral restriction and innate immunity regulation, in addition to many other cellular pathways. In particular, TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination affects both carcinogenesis and antiviral response. While individual substrates have been identified for TRIM25, it remains unclear how it regulates diverse processes. Here we characterized a mutation, R54P, critical for TRIM25 catalytic activity, which we successfully utilized to \"trap\" substrates. We demonstrated that TRIM25 targets proteins implicated in stress granule formation (G3BP1/2), nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (UPF1), and nucleoside synthesis (NME1). R54P abolishes TRIM25 inhibition of alphaviruses independently of the host interferon response, suggesting that this antiviral effect is a direct consequence of ubiquitination. Consistent with that, we observed diminished antiviral activity upon knockdown of several TRIM25-R54P specific interactors including NME1. Our findings highlight that multiple substrates mediate the cellular and antiviral activities of TRIM25, illustrating the multi-faceted role of this ubiquitination network in diverse biological processes.",

    "abstract": "The mouse digit tip is a complex tissue that is capable of regeneration after amputation. How the regenerated digit tip is patterned is unknown, but a long-standing hypothesis in the field of regeneration proposes that developmental patterning mechanisms are re-used during regeneration. The digit tip bone exhibits strong dorsal-ventral (DV) polarity, so we focus on Engrailed 1 (En1) and LIM homeobox transcription factor 1B (Lmx1b), two well-studied transcription factors necessary for DV patterning during limb development. We investigate if En1 and Lmx1b are re-expressed during regeneration in a developmental-like spatially restricted pattern, and if they direct DV morphology of the regenerated digit tip. We find that both En1 and Lmx1b are expressed in the regenerating mouse digit tip epithelium and mesenchyme, respectively, but without DV polarity. We use conditional genetics and quantitative analysis of digit tip bone morphology to determine that genetic deletion of En1 or Lmx1b in adult digit tip regeneration modestly reduces bone regeneration but does not affect DV patterning of the regenerate. Collectively, our data suggest that while En1 and Lmx1b are re-expressed during mouse digit tip regeneration, they do not define the DV axis during regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Canonical Wnt (cWnt) signaling is involved in a plethora of basic developmental processes such as endomesoderm specification, gastrulation and patterning the main body axis. To activate the signal, Wnt ligands form complexes with LRP5/6 and Frizzled receptors, which leads to nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin and transcriptional response. In Bilateria, the expression of different Frizzled genes is often partially overlapping, and their functions are known to be redundant in several developmental contexts. Here we demonstrate that all four Frizzled receptors take part in the cWnt-mediated oral-aboral axis patterning in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis but show partially redundant functions. However, we do not see evidence for their involvement in the specification of the endoderm - an earlier event likely relying on maternal, intracellular {beta}-catenin signaling components. Finally, we demonstrate that the main Wnt ligands crucial for the early oral-aboral patterning are Wnt3 and Wnt4. Comparison of our data to the knowledge from other models suggests that distinct but overlapping expression domains and partial functional redundancy of cnidarian and bilaterian Frizzled genes may represent a shared ancestral trait.",

    "abstract": "The known molecular heterogeneity among pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in culture may be maladaptive or a beneficial determinant of normal biology. In other systems such as hair and intestine, normal and dynamic heterogeneity among stem cells is necessary for balancing stem cell division and quiescence in order to maintain the stem cell pool. In ESCs, Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog (the SON genes) critically regulate pluripotency but their role in stem cell heterogeneity or pool maintenance is not clear. We previously reported an additional level of gene expression, the unexpected differential expression of mRNA coding region (CDS) and cognate 3'untranslated region (3UTR) components, often revealing novel developmental patterns. Here we show dramatic, patterned, concentric, differential expression of pluripotent gene 3UTR and CDS mRNA components in both undifferentiated ESCs in culture and in developing human and mouse embryos. This differential expression reveals robust pluripotent ESC heterogeneity that provides the underpinnings of a previously unrecognized ESC cell niche structure. A hallmark of the niche is the presence of cells expressing high levels of Nanog 3UTR but only low or no Nanog CDS at structure perimeters, We used a novel bioinformatic approach combining the 3UTR to CDS ratio and gene expression, and identified unique ESC clusters. High Nanog 3UTR cells have lower cell cycle activity and higher quiescence than other ESCs and express a distinct complement of cellular histone marks. These quiescent perimeter cells exchange with interior domains, opening the possibility that they act as cell replenishment reservoirs in the niche or the embryo. Functionally, the Nanog 3UTR, independent of its CDS, is critical, as its selective deletion decreases ESC cell division while increasing trophectoderm markers. Lastly, self-organization of ESCs according to pluripotent gene differential 3UTR and CDS expression is modified by activin signaling, indicating extrinsic modulation of the niche structure. Pluripotent embryonic stem cells, actively display regulated, dynamic differential expression of SON gene mRNA components, allowing the formation of a heterogenous, ordered, stem cell niche bordered by quiescent hub stem cells, thus illuminating the role of SON genes in pluripotent embryonic stem cell pool maintenance. More generally this suggests that differential mRNA component expression may widely define cell types that exist in non-permanent, different states in either development or disease.",

Little is known about how the highly crowded conditions prevalent within living cells influence the dynamic structures proteins on the molecular level. To address this outstanding question, we characterize here the dynamic behavior of the periplasmic model protein MBP from Escherichia coli in situ, confined in the native lumen of bacterial outer membrane vesicles. To this end we determine the dynamics of side-chain methyl groups of MBP across several timescales and compare them to purified in vitro MBP. We find that the inherent dynamics of MBP are surprisingly insensitive to the native cellular environment and that the molecular motion of the protein is mainly impacted on a global level.",

    "abstract": "Complex interactions between microbial populations can greatly affect the overall properties of a microbial community, sometimes leading to cooperation and mutually beneficial coexistence, or to competition and the death or displacement of particular organisms or sub-populations. Interactions between different biofilm populations are highly relevant in diverse scientific areas, from antimicrobial resistance to microbial ecology. The utilization of modern microscopic techniques has provided new and interesting insight into how bacteria interact at the cellular level to form and maintain microbial biofilms. However, our ability to follow complex intra- and inter-species interactions in vivo at the microscopic level has remained somewhat limited. Here, we detail BacLive, a novel non-invasive method for tracking bacterial growth and biofilm dynamics using high resolution fluorescence microscopy and an associated ImageJ processing macro (https://github.com/BacLive) for easier data handling and image analysis. Finally, we provide examples of how BacLive can be used in the analysis of complex bacterial communities.\n\nImportanceCommunication and interactions between single cells are continuously defining the structure and composition of microbial communities timely and spatially. Methods routinely used to the study of these communities at cellular level rely on sample manipulation what deprives from microscopic time lapse experiments on a given sample. BacLive is conceived as a method for the non-invasive study of the formation and development of bacterial communities, such as biofilms, and the dynamics of formation of specialized subpopulations in time-lapse experiments. In addition we prove that BacLive largely simplifies the analysis of the data generated.",

MglA-GTP localizes to the leading cell pole and stimulates assembly of the two motility machineries.

RomR/RomX and MglB localize similarly with low and high concentrations at the leading and lagging poles, respectively. Yet, GEF activity dominates at the leading and GAP activity at the lagging pole by unknown mechanisms. Here, we identify RomY as a co-GAP that stimulates MglB GAP activity. The MglB/RomY interaction is low affinity, restricting complex formation to the lagging pole with the high MglB concentration. Our data support a model wherein RomY, by forming a low-affinity complex with MglB, ensures that MglB GAP activity is spatially precisely confined to the lagging pole, thereby constraining MglA-GTP to the leading pole establishing front-rear polarity.",

    "abstract": "Primary and recurrent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections frequently cause CMV colitis in immunocompromised as well as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Additionally, colitis occasionally occurs upon primary CMV infection in patients who are apparently immunocompetent. In both cases, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are largely elusive - in part due to the lack of adequate access to specimens. We employed the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) model to probe into the association between CMV and colitis. During acute primary MCMV infection of immunocompetent mice, the gut microbial composition was affected within the first 5 days post-infection as manifested by an altered ratio of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. Interestingly, these microbial changes incited with high-titer MCMV replication in the colon, mild crypt necrosis and increased colonic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Further analyses revealed that murine and human intestinal epithelial cell line as well as primary intestinal crypt cells/ organoids represent direct targets of CMV accompanied by increased cell mortality upon infection. Accordingly, in vivo MCMV infection disrupted the intestinal epithelial barrier and increased apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. In summary, our data show that CMV induces colitis in immunocompetent hosts by altering the intestinal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Stress exposure contributes to the development of drug and alcohol use disorders. In animal models, stress exacerbates escalations in alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent animals. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a critical brainstem region for integrating and relaying peripheral signals to regulate stress responses. To define the molecular adaptions within this brain region that may contribute to stress-induced alcohol drinking, we exposed animals to chronic intermittent bouts of ethanol vapor (CIE), forced swim stress (FSS), or both (CIE + FSS) and then transcriptionally profiled the NTS at three different timepoints after the last vapor exposure (0-hr, 72-hr, and 186-hr). We identified interferon (IFN) signaling as a critical gene network correlated with alcohol consumption levels. Using a likelihood ratio test, we identified genes that were differentially expressed across time and between groups. Clustering analysis of these genes to identify unique expression patterns identified a subset of genes that fail to normalize in the CIE + FSS group, but not the others. These genes were enriched for cell-to-cell interaction and cellular movement pointing to long-term structural and functional changes in this brain region caused by the unique interaction of alcohol dependence and stress. Specific genes of interest identified in this group include Aqp4, Il16, Reln, Grm4, Gabrd, and Gabra6. We also compared gene expression changes in the NTS to the PFC and found a significant overlap of genes between the two brain regions. Overlapping NTS/PFC genes in the CIE + FSS group were enriched for type I IFN signaling. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that activation of type I IFN signaling increases alcohol consumption based on the three lines of evidence identifying type I IFN signaling as critical for escalations in alcohol intake. Mice treated with recombinant IFN{beta} showed significantly elevated levels of alcohol intake in a two-bottle choice procedure compared to saline-treated controls. Overall, these results define the transcriptomic changes across time in the NTS that may be critical to the development of stress-induced increases in alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence.",

Here, we report arginine 65 methylation of NGN3 is absolutely required for the pancreatic lineage development of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro. First, we found inducible protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1)-knockout (P-iKO) hESCs did not differentiate from EPs to endocrine cells (ECs) in the presence of doxycycline. Loss of PRMT1 caused an accumulation of NGN3 in the cytoplasm of EPs and blocked NGN3s transcriptional activity in PRMT1-KO EPs. We also found that PRMT1 specifically methylates NGN3 arginine 65, and this modification is a prerequisite for ubiquitin-mediated NGN3 degradation.

In particular, protein abundance QTLs (pQTLs) and gene expression QTLs (eQTLs) are the most commonly used for this purpose. However, questions remain on how to best consolidate results from pQTLs and eQTLs for target validation.\n\nIn this study, we combined blood cell-derived eQTLs and plasma-derived pQTLs to form QTL pairs representing each gene and its product. We performed a series of enrichment analyses to identify features of QTL pairs that provide consistent evidence for drug targets based on the concordance of the direction of effect of the pQTL and eQTL. We repeated these analyses using eQTLs derived in 49 tissues.\n\nWe found that 25-30% of blood-cell derived QTL pairs have discordant effects. The difference in tissues of origin for molecular markers contributes to, but is not likely a major source of, this observed discordance. Finally, druggable genes were as likely to have discordant QTL pairs as concordant.\n\nOur analyses suggest combining and consolidating evidence from pQTLs and eQTLs for drug target validation is crucial and should be done whenever possible, as many potential drug targets show discordance between the two molecular phenotypes that could be misleading if only one is considered. We also encourage investigating QTL tissue-specificity in target validation applications to help identify reasons for discordance and emphasise that concordance and discordance of QTL pairs across tissues are both informative in target validation.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most prevelant malignancy in Europe and diet is an important modifiable risk factor. Processed meat consumption, including meats with preservative salts such as sodium nitrite, have been implicated in CRC pathogenesis. This study investigated how the CRC pathology and metabolic status of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) multiple intestinal neoplasia (min) mice was perturbed following 8 weeks of pork meat consumption. Dietary inclusions (15%) of either nitrite-free pork, nitrite-free sausage or nitrite-containing sausage (frankfurter) were compared against a parallel control group (100% chow). Comprehensive studies investigated: gastrointestinal tract histology (tumours, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and mucin deplin foci (MDF), lipid peroxidation (urine and serum), faecal microbiota and serum metabolomics (599 metabolites). After 8 weeks mice consuming the frankfurter diet had 53% more (P=0.014) gastrointestinal tumours than control, although ACF and MDF did not differ. Urine and serum lipid peroxidation markers were 59% (P=0.001) and 108% (P=0.001) higher, respectively in the frankfurter group. Gut dysbiosis was evident in these mice with comparably fewer Bacteriodes and more Firmicutes. Fasting serum levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and numerous triglycerides were elevated. Various serum phosphotidylcholine species were decreased. These results demonstrate that nitrite-containing sausages may exaccerbate the development of CRC pathology in APCMin mice to a greater extent than nitrite-free sausages, and this is associated with greater lipid peroxidation, wide-ranging metabolic alternation and gut dysbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Human Rad52 protein binds to ssDNA and promotes the annealing of complementary strands. This activity is central to multiple DNA repair pathways and Rad52 is a target for cancer therapeutics. Previous crystal structures of the DNA binding domain of Rad52 revealed an 11-mer ring that binds to ssDNA in an extended conformation with the bases exposed for homology recognition. While this complex is likely involved in the early stages of annealing, there is no structure of Rad52 with two strands of DNA bound simultaneously, and its mechanism of annealing is poorly understood. To approach this problem, we have turned to the RecT/Red{beta} family of annealing proteins from bacteriophage, which are distant homologs of Rad52 that form stable complexes with a duplex intermediate of annealing. We have used single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a 3.4 [A] structure of a RecT homolog from a prophage of Listeria innocua (LiRecT) in complex with two complementary 83-mer oligonucleotides that were added to the protein sequentially. The structure reveals a left-handed helical filament of the protein bound to a novel conformation of DNA duplex that is highly extended and under-wound. The duplex is bound at a stoichiometry of 5 bp/monomer to a deep, narrow, positively-charged groove that runs along the outer surface of the filament. Data from native mass spectrometry confirm that the filament complex seen by cryo-EM also exists in solution. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the mechanism of annealing by LiRecT and by homologous proteins including human Rad52.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the sources, structure and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater is paramount for protection and sustainable use of this vital resource. On its passage through the Critical Zone, DOM is subject to biogeochemical conversions. Therefore, it carries valuable cross-habitat information for monitoring and predicting the stability of groundwater ecosystem services and assessing these ecosystems response to fluctuations caused by external impacts such as climatic extremes. Challenges arise from insufficient knowledge on groundwater metabolite composition and dynamics due to a lack of consistent analytical approaches for long-term monitoring. Our study establishes groundwater metabolomics to decipher the complex biogeochemical transport and conversion of DOM. We explore fractured sedimentary bedrock along a hillslope recharge area by a 5-year untargeted metabolomics monitoring of oxic perched and anoxic phreatic groundwater. A summer with extremely high temperatures and low precipitation was included in the monitoring. Water was accessed by a sampling well-transect and regularly collected for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) investigation. Dimension reduction of the resulting complex data set by principal component analysis revealed that metabolome dissimilarities between distant wells coincide with transient cross-stratal flow indicated by groundwater levels. Time series of the groundwater metabolome data provides detailed insights into subsurface responses to recharge dynamics. We demonstrate that dissimilarity variability between groundwater bodies with contrasting aquifer properties coincides with recharge dynamics. This includes groundwater high- and lowstands as well as recharge and recession phases. Our monitoring approach allows to survey groundwater ecosystems even under extreme conditions. The metabolome was otherwise highly variable lacking seasonal patterns and did not segregate by geographic location of sampling wells, thus ruling out vegetation or (agricultural) land use as primary driving factor. Patterns that emerge from metabolomics monitoring give insight into subsurface ecosystem functioning and water quality evolution, essential for sustainable groundwater use and climate change-adapted management.",

Here, we identified a metastable excited state in the isolated HSP90 ATP binding domain. We used solution NMR and mutagenesis to characterize structures of both ground and excited states. We demonstrated that in solution the HSP90 ATP binding domain transiently samples a functionally relevant ATP-lid closed state, distant by more than 30 [A] from the ground state. NMR relaxation and molecular dynamics were combined to characterize the energy landscape corresponding to the transition between these interconverting states.

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found in 15-30% of all non-small cell lung carcinomas. The term exon 19 deletion (ex19del) is collectively used to refer to more than 20 distinct genomic alterations within exon 19 that comprise the most common EGFR mutation subtype in lung cancer. Despite this heterogeneity, clinical treatment decisions are made irrespective of which EGFR ex19del variant is present within the tumor, and there is a paucity of information regarding how individual ex19del variants influence protein structure and function. Herein, we identify allele-specific functional differences among ex19del variants attributable to recurring sequence and structure motifs. We build all-atom structural models of 60 ex19del variants identified in patients and combine ~400 s of molecular dynamics simulations with biochemical and biophysical experiments to analyze three ex19del mutations (E746_A750, E746_S752>V, and L747_A750>P). We demonstrate that sequence variation in ex19del alters oncogenic cell growth, dimerization propensity, and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sensitivity. We show that in contrast to E746_A750 and E746_S752>V, the L747_A750>P variant forms highly active ligand-independent dimers. E746_S752>V displays the least TKI sensitivity among the variants tested, which enzyme kinetic analysis and TKI inhibition experiments suggest is due to increased ATP Km relative to the common E746_A750 variant. Through these analyses, we propose an expanded framework for interpreting ex19del variants and new considerations for therapeutic intervention.\n\nSignificanceEGFR mutations are detected in approximately 30% of all lung adenocarcinomas, and the most common EGFR mutation occurring in ~50% of patients is termed \"exon 19 deletion\" (ex19del). Despite the existence of dozens of different genomic variants comprising what is generically referred to clinically as ex19del, clinicians currently do not distinguish between ex19del variants in considering treatment options, and the differences between ex19del variants are largely unstudied in the broader scientific community. Herein, we describe functional differences between distinct EGFR ex19del variants attributable to the structural features of each variant. These findings suggest a possible explanation for observed differences in patient outcomes stratified by ex19del subtype and reinforce the need for allele-specific considerations in clinical treatment decision making.",

    "abstract": "Few therapeutic options have been made available for treating central nervous system tumors, especially upon recurrence. Recurrent medulloblastoma is uniformly lethal with no approved therapies. Recent preclinical studies have shown promising results for eradicating various solid tumors by targeting the overexpressed immune checkpoint molecule, B7-H3. However, due to several therapy-related toxicities and reports of tumor escape, the full potential of targeting this pan-cancer antigen has yet to be realized. Here, we designed and characterized bispecific chemically self-assembling nanorings (CSANs) that target the T cell receptor, CD3{varepsilon}, and tumor associated antigen, B7-H3, derived from the humanized 8H9 single chain variable fragment (scFv). We show that the B7-H3-CD3 CSANs increase T cell infiltration and facilitate selective cytotoxicity of B7-H3+ medulloblastoma spheroids and that activity is independent of target cell MHC class I expression. Importantly, non-specific T cell activation against the ONS 2303 medulloblastoma cell line can be reduced by tuning the valency of the CD3 targeted monomer in the oligomerized CSAN. Intraperitoneal injections of B7-H3-CD3 bispecific CSANs were found to effectively cross the blood-tumor barrier into the brain and elicit significant anti-tumor T cell activity intracranially as well as systemically in an orthotopic medulloblastoma model. Moreover, following treatment with B7-H3-CD3 CSANs, intratumoral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to primarily have a central memory phenotype that displayed significant levels of characteristic activation markers. Collectively, these results demonstrate the ability of our multi-valent, bispecific CSANs to direct potent anti-tumor T cell responses and indicate its potential utility as an alternative or complementary therapy for immune cell targeting of B7-H3+ brain tumors.\n\nSignificanceThis study presents B7-H3-CD3 bispecific CSANs as a promising, new immunotherapeutic option for patients with established B7-H3+ medulloblastomas.",

The effects of targeting were miRNA-specific; miRNA-21 caused strong inhibition of translation whereas miRNA-24 or Let-7 caused no change or an increase in global reporter Renilla luciferase synthesis, and the mRNA-protein complexes formed by reporter transcripts in both cell types differed as shown by sucrose gradient sedimentation. In both cell types the presence of miRNA targets on Renilla transcripts affected expression of the co-transfected non-targeted Firefly luciferase, and Renilla and Firefly transcripts were found in the same sucrose gradient fractions. We also observed that specific anti-miRNA oligoribonucleotides influenced expression of the Firefly as well as of the Renilla gene, suggesting modulation of non-targeted transcript expression by miRNAs.

    "abstract": "Aspergillus niger is a robust microbial cell factory for organic acids production. However, the regulation of many industrially important pathways is still poorly understood. Recently the regulation of glucose oxidase (GOx) expression system involved in the biosynthesis of gluconic acid has been uncovered. Hydrogen peroxide, a by-product of the enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconate, has a pivotal role as a signaling molecule in the induction of this system. In this study, facilitated diffusion of hydrogen peroxide via aquaporin water channels (AQPs) was studied. AQPs are transmembrane proteins of the major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) superfamily. In addition to water and glycerol, they may also transport small solutes such as hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, the genome sequence of A. niger N402 was screened for putative AQPs. Seven were found which could be classified in three main groups. Their ability to facilitate diffusion of hydrogen peroxide was identified using yeast phenotypic growth assays and by studying AQP gene knock-outs in A. niger. Complementing from both yeast and A. niger experiments, the X-intrinsic protein AQPF plays apparent roles in facilitating hydrogen peroxide transport across cellular membrane.\n\nIMPORTANCEAquaporins (AQP) are integral membrane proteins that facilitate transfer of water, small solutes and hydrogen peroxide across the plasma membrane. As they have conserved structural features, it is not difficult to detect their presence in fungal genomes. Their specific roles in fungi are however less understood. Previously we have elucidated the role of the hydrogen peroxide as a second messenger in the induction and regulation of the expression of glucose oxidase involved in the extracellular conversion of glucose in gluconate (1). Here we identified the involvement of AQPF, a member of the X-intrinsic protein class in facilitating transport of the hydrogen peroxide signal across the cell membrane.",

    "abstract": "The chromosome axis plays a crucial role in meiotic recombination. Here, we study the function of ASY1, the Arabidopsis homolog of the yeast chromosome axis associated component Hop1. Specifically, we characterized cross-over (CO) distribution in female and male meiosis by deep sequencing of the progeny of an allelic series of asy1 mutants. Combining data from nearly 1000 individual plants, we find that reduced ASY1 activity leads to genomic instability and sometimes drastic genomic rearrangements. We further observed that COs are less frequent and appear in more distal chromosomal regions in plants with no or reduced ASY1 activity, consistent with previous analyses. However, our sequencing approach revealed that the reduction in CO number is not as dramatic as suggested by cytological analyses. Analysis of double mutants of asy1 with mutants with three other CO factors, MUS81, MSH4 and MSH5 as well as the determination of foci number of the CO regulator MLH1 demonstrates that the majority of the COs in asy1, similar to the situation in the wildtype, largely belong to the class I, which are subject to interference. However, these COs are redistributed in asy1 mutants and typically appear much closer than in the wildtype. Hence, ASY1 plays a key role in CO interference that spaces COs along a chromosome. Conversely, since a large proportion of chromosomes do not receive any CO, we conclude that CO assurance, the process that ensures the obligatory assignment of one CO per chromosome, is also affected in asy1 mutants.\n\nSignificant statementThe regulation of the number and placement of cross-overs (COs) during meiosis is critical to ensure meiotic fidelity and promote new genetic combinations. Here, we investigated the function of one of the proteins of the chromosome axis, which plays a key role in CO formation: ASY1. Our results show that COs in asy1 mutants are positioned closer to each other than in the wildtype and that, despite a roughly similar number of COs, not every chromosome receives a CO. With this, our results shed light on the mechanisms regulating two important but still poorly understood aspects of meiosis: CO assurance, which safeguards at least one CO per chromosome pair, and CO interference, which prevents two COs from occurring close to each other.",

    "abstract": "Camera traps have revolutionized how ecologists monitor wildlife, but their full potential is realized only when the hundreds of thousands of collected images can be readily classified with minimal human intervention. Deep-learning classification models have allowed extraordinary progress towards this end, but trained models remain rare and are only now emerging for European fauna. We report on the first milestone of the DeepFaune initiative (https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr), a large-scale collaboration between more than 50 partners involved in wildlife research, conservation and management in France. We developed a classification model trained to recognize 26 species or higher-level taxa. The classification model achieved 0.97 validation accuracy and often >0.95 precision and recall for many classes. These performances were generally higher than 0.90 when tested on independent out-of-sample datasets for which we used image redundancy contained in sequence of images. We implemented our model in a software to classify images stored locally on a personal computer, so as to provide a free, user-friendly and high-performance tool for wildlife practitioners to automatically classify camera-trap images.",

Here, we describe clampFISH 2.0, a method that uses an inverted padlock design to efficiently detect and exponentially amplify signals from many RNA species at once, while also reducing time and cost compared to the prior clampFISH method. We leverage the increased throughput afforded by multiplexed signal amplification and sequential detection by demonstrating the ability to detect 10 different RNA species in over 1 million cells. We also show that clampFISH 2.0 works in tissue sections. We expect the advantages offered by clampFISH 2.0 will enable many applications in spatial transcriptomics.",

    "abstract": "Gene perturbation approaches have evolved as powerful tools for understanding the function of genes and curing inherited diseases. Here, we develop a method that combines the merits of RNAi and CRISPR technology by rational design of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with a \"gRNA-shRNA\" component. The RNP, termed Cas9-RNAi, has a gRNA containing a 3 extension that can be processed to a functional siRNA via dorsha/dicer enzyme mediated cleavage within cells. We prepared the Cas9-RNAi RNPs by streamline co-expression of Cas9 enzymes and the \"gRNA-shRNA\" ribonucleotides in Escherichia coli strain HT115(DE)3. Transferring the Cas9-RNAi RNPs into mammalian cells achieves multidimensional genome manipulation, e.g., simultaneously knock out and knock down the target genes. Moreover, by introduction of a shRNA against the gene of human DNA ligase 4 (LIG4), significantly improved homology-directed repair was attained. Together, we develop a simple-to-use CRISPR RNP tool that has great potentials in precise genome editing, gene function analysis and gene therapy.",

TidyMass was designed based on the following strategies to address the limitations of current tools: 1) Cross-platform utility. TidyMass can be installed on all platforms; 2) Uniformity, shareability, traceability, and reproducibility. A uniform data format has been developed, specifically designed to store and manage processed metabolomics data and processing parameters, making it possible to trace the prior analysis steps and parameters; 3) Flexibility and extensibility. The modular architecture makes tidyMass a highly flexible and extensible tool, so other users can improve it and integrate it with their own pipeline easily.",

    "abstract": "The one-carbon recursive ketoacid elongation pathway is responsible for making various branched-chain amino acids, aldehydes, alcohols, and acetate esters in living cells. Controlling selective microbial biosynthesis of these target molecules at high efficiency is challenging due to enzyme promiscuity, regulation, and metabolic burden. In this study, we present a systematic modular design approach to control proteome reallocation for selective microbial biosynthesis of branched-chain acetate esters. Through pathway modularization, we partitioned the branched-chain ester pathways into four submodules including keto-isovalerate submodule for converting pyruvate to keto-isovalerate, ketoacid elongation submodule for producing longer carbon-chain keto-acids, ketoacid decarboxylase submodule for converting ketoacids to alcohols, and alcohol acyltransferase submodule for producing branched-chain acetate esters by condensing alcohols and acetyl-CoA. By systematic manipulation of pathway gene replication and transcription, enzyme specificity of the first committed steps of these submodules, and downstream competing pathways, we demonstrated selective microbial production of isoamyl acetate over isobutyl acetate. We found that the optimized isoamyl acetate pathway globally redistributed the amino acid fractions in the proteomes and required up to 23-31% proteome reallocation at the expense of other cellular resources, such as those required to generate precursor metabolites and energy for growth and amino acid biosynthesis. The engineered strains produced isoamyl acetate at a titer of 8.8 g/L (> 0.25 g/L toxicity limit), a yield of 0.17 g/g (47% of maximal theoretical value), and 86% selectivity, achieving the highest titers, yields and selectivity of isoamyl acetate reported to date.",

There is currently limited structural information on how the resulting complex interacts with microtubules and how adaptors are recruited. Here, we develop a cryo-EM processing pipeline to solve the high-resolution structure of dynein-dynactin and the adaptor BICDR1 bound to microtubules. This reveals the asymmetric interactions between neighbouring dynein motor domains and how it relates to their motile behaviour. We find unexpectedly that two adaptors occupy the complex. Both adaptors make similar interactions with the dyneins but diverge in their contacts with each other and dynactin. Our structure has implications for the stability and stoichiometry of motor recruitment by cargos.",

    "abstract": "Age-related changes in the human brain can be investigated from either structural or functional perspectives. Analysis of structural and functional age-related changes throughout the lifespan may help to understand the normal brain development process and monitor the structural and functional pathology of the brain. This study, combining dedicated electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches in adults (20-78 years), highlights the complex relationship between micro/macrostructural properties and the functional responses to visual stimuli. Here, we aimed to relate age-related changes of the latency of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to micro/macrostructural indexes and find any correlation between micro/macrostructural features, as well. We studied age-related structural changes in the brain, by using the MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as preferred imaging methods for extracting brain macrostructural parameters such as the cortical thickness, surface area, folding and curvature index, gray matter volume, and microstructural parameters such as mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD). All the mentioned features were significantly correlated with age in V1 and V2 regions of the visual cortex. Furthermore, we highlighted, negative correlations between structural features extracted from T1-weighted images and DWI. The latency and amplitude of the three dominants peaks (C1, P1, N1) of the VEP were considered as the brain functional features to be examined for correlation with age and structural features of the corresponding age. We observed significant correlations between mean C1 latency and GM volume averaged in V1 and V2. In hierarchical models, the structural index did not contributed to significant additional variance in the C1 latency after accounting for the variance associated with age. However, the age explained significant additional variance in the model after accounting for the variance associated with the structural feature.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesEnriched environment (EE) is a promising strategy to protect the intestinal mucosal barrier and regulate brain-gut peptide expression. However, the optimal enriched environment intervention duration is unknown. Here, different EE intervention durations were applied to assess the optimal intervention duration in rats with colorectal cancer.\n\nMethodsWe used a rat model of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colorectal cancer. Rats were housed in an EE for 0, 2, 4 or 8 weeks. The intestinal mucosa and serum TNF-, IL-6, IL-10, DAO, ATP, CRF, and occludin levels and bacterial translocation (BT) were measured, and the intestinal mucosa morphology was evaluated.\n\nResultsEight-week EE intervention was more beneficial to the intestinal mucosal mechanical barrier than 2-week or 4-week intervention (P<0.05). There was a significant different between the 4-week and 8-week groups on BT (P=0.049). However, which intervention duration had the greatest advantages in intestinal mucosa and serum inflammatory factor regulation was not determined. There were no significant differences in the effects of different EE intervention durations on BT or brain intestinal peptide levels among the other groups (P>0.05).\n\nConclusionsThe effect of an 8-week environmental intervention duration on the intestinal mucosal barrier was better than that of 2-week and 4-week durations overall, but the effect of different environmental intervention durations on brain-gut peptide levels was not obvious. In the future, we can further explore the molecular biological mechanism of the effect of different EE intervention durations on the intestinal mucosal barrier and analyze the effect of an EE on other brain-gut peptides.",
