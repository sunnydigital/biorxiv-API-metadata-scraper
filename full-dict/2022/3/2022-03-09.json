    "abstract": "Homeostatic synaptic depression (HSD) in excitatory neurons is a cell autonomous mechanism which protects excitatory neurons from over-excitation as a consequence of chronic increases in network activity. In this process, excitatory synapses are weakened and eventually eliminated, as evidenced by a reduction in synaptic AMPA receptor expression and dendritic spine loss. Originally considered a global, cell-wide mechanism, local forms of regulation, such as the local control of mRNA translation in dendrites, are being increasingly recognized in HSD. Yet, identification of excitatory proteins whose local regulation is required for HSD is still limited. Here, we show that Proline-rich protein 7/Transmembrane Adapter Protein 3 (Prr7) downregulation in dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons is necessary for HSD induced by chronic increase in network activity resulting from a blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission by picrotoxin (PTX). We further identify two activity-regulated miRNAs, miR-329-3p and miR-495-3p, which inhibit Prr7 mRNA translation and are required for HSD. Moreover, we found that Prr7 knockdown reduces expression of the synaptic scaffolding protein SPAR, which is rescued by pharmacological inhibition of CDK5, indicating a role of Prr7 protein in the maintenance of excitatory synapses via protection of SPAR from degradation. Together, our findings highlight a novel HSD mechanism in which chronic activity leads to miR-329 and miR-495-mediated local Prr7 reduction upstream of the CDK5-SPAR pathway.",

    "abstract": "Targeted DNA sequencing approaches will improve how the size of short tandem repeats is measured for diagnostic tests and pre-clinical studies. The expansion of these sequences causes dozens of disorders, with longer tracts generally leading to a more severe disease. Interrupted alleles are sometimes present within repeats and can alter disease manifestation. Determining repeat size mosaicism and identifying interruptions in targeted sequencing datasets remains a major challenge. This is in part because standard alignment tools are ill-suited for repetitive and unstable sequences. To address this, we have developed Repeat Detector (RD), a deterministic profile weighting algorithm for counting repeats in targeted sequencing data. We tested RD using blood-derived DNA samples from Huntingtons disease and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy patients sequenced using either Illumina MiSeq or Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real-time sequencing platforms. RD was highly accurate in determining repeat sizes of 609 blood-derived samples from Huntingtons disease individuals and did not require prior knowledge of the flanking sequences. Furthermore, RD can be used to identify alleles with interruptions and provide a measure of repeat instability within an individual. RD is therefore highly versatile and may find applications in the diagnosis of expanded repeat disorders and the development of novel therapies.",

    "abstract": "The brain represents the world through the activity of neural populations. Correlated variability across simultaneously recorded neurons (noise correlations) has been observed across cortical areas and experimental paradigms. Many studies have shown that correlated variability improves stimulus coding compared to a null model with no correlations. However, such results do not shed light on whether neural populations correlated variability achieves optimal coding. Here, we assess optimality of noise correlations in diverse datasets by developing two novel null models each with a unique biological interpretation: a uniform correlations null model and a factor analysis null model. We show that across datasets, the correlated variability in neural populations leads to highly suboptimal coding performance according to these null models. We demonstrate that biological constraints prevent many subsets of the neural populations from achieving optimality according to these null models, and that subselecting based on biological criteria leaves coding performance suboptimal. Finally, we show that the optimal subpopulation is exponentially small as a function of neural dimensionality. Together, these results show that the geometry of correlated variability leads to highly suboptimal sensory coding.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampus-neocortex interactions during sleep are critical for memory processes: hippocampally-initiated replay contributes to memory consolidation in the neocortex and hippocampal sharp wave/ripples are linked to generalized increases in neocortical cell activity and DOWN-UP state transitions. Yet, the spatial and temporal patterns of this exchange are unknown. With voltage imaging, electrocorticography, and laminarly-resolved hippocampal potentials, we characterized cortico-hippocampal interactions during anesthesia and NREM sleep. We observed neocortical activation transients spanning multiple spatial scales hinting at a quasi-critical regime. Transients were organized in a small number of functional networks matching known anatomical connectivity. A network overlapping with the default mode network and centered on retrosplenial cortex was the most associated with the hippocampus. Interestingly, hippocampal slow gamma was the oscillation that best correlated with this neocortical network, outpacing ripples. In fact, neocortical activity predicted hippocampal slow gamma and followed ripples, suggesting that consolidation processes rely on bi-directional exchanges between hippocampus and neocortex.",

    "abstract": "The specific granule glycoprotein olfactomedin-4 (Olfm4) marks a constitutive subset of neutrophils in humans, where 1-70% of peripheral blood neutrophils produce Olfm4. The proportion of Olfm4-high (Olfm4-H) neutrophils correlates with the severity of paediatric septic shock and could predict mortality in adult septic shock in previous studies, but it is not known whether and how the Olfm4-H neutrophils contribute to sepsis pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to decipher proteomic differences between the Olfm4-H and Olfm4-low (Olfm4-L) human neutrophil subsets at baseline and in the context of septic shock, hypothesizing that Olfm4 marks a neutrophil subset with a distinct proteomic profile, predisposing it for detrimental processes in sepsis. A novel protocol for the preparation of fixed, antibody-stained and sorted neutrophils for LC-MS/MS analysis of proteome was developed. In neutrophil subsets from healthy blood donors, 47 proteins had significantly higher abundance in the Olfm4-H population, and 62 proteins in the Olfm4-L population. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the differences concerned proteins related to neutrophil degranulation, with e.g. Rab3d and a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump being more abundant in the Olfm4-H neutrophils, and the alarmin S100-A7, the major neutrophil chemotactic receptor CXCR1 and the antimicrobial peptide defensin alpha-4 being more abundant in the Olfm4-L neutrophils. The data suggest different preparedness to infection in the subsets. In the limited material analysed here, there was no significant correlation between the severity of sepsis and the proportion of Olfm4-H neutrophils, but an increased concentration of Olfm4 in plasma from septic shock patients as compared to healthy blood donors was observed. Furthermore, in neutrophil subsets isolated from septic shock patients, 28 proteins had significantly higher abundance in the Olfm4-H subset and 38 in the Olfm4-L subset, the latter including e.g. Fc receptor proteins and MHC class I molecules, suggesting distinct immunological responses. This is the first report pointing towards differential functions of the Olfm4-defined neutrophil subpopulations in humans and the data are consistent with the idea of distinct responses in the subsets during infection and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) is an essential trace element for plants. When suffering from Fe deficiency, plants modulate the expression of Fe deficiency responsive genes. POPEYE (PYE) is a key bHLH transcription factor involved in Fe homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanism of PYE regulating the Fe deficiency response remains elusive. We found that the over-expression of PYE attenuates the expression of Fe deficiency responsive genes. PYE directly represses the transcription of bHLH Ib genes (bHLH38, bHLH39, bHLH100, and bHLH101) by associating with their promoters. Although PYE contains an Ethylene response factor-associated Amphiphilic Repression (EAR) motif, it does not interact with the transcriptional corepressors TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPRs). Subcellular localization analysis indicated that PYE localizes in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. PYE contains a Nuclear Export Signal (NES) which is required for the cytoplasmic localization of PYE. The mutation of NES amplifies the repression function of PYE, resulting in downregulation of Fe deficiency responsive genes. Co-expression assays indicated that bHLH IVc members (bHLH104, bHLH105/ILR3, and bHLH115) facilitate the nuclear accumulation of PYE. Conversely, PYE indirectly represses transcription activation ability of bHLH IVc. Additionally, PYE directly negatively regulates its own transcription. This study provides insights into the complicated Fe deficiency response signaling pathway and enhances the understanding of PYE functions.\n\nShort summaryPYE is a negative regulator of Fe homeostasis; however, it was still unclear how PYE integrates the Fe deficiency response signaling. Our study shows that conditional nuclear localization of PYE is crucial for Fe homeostasis. PYE not only negatively regulates FIT-dependent Fe uptake genes by directly targeting bHLH Ib genes, but also negatively regulates its own expression.",

However, therapeutic advances, especially in regenerative medicine, are currently hampered by the lack of knowledge concerning human hepatic cell development. Here, we addressed this limitation by describing the developmental trajectories of different cell types comprising the human fetal liver at single-cell resolution. These transcriptomic analyses revealed that sequential cell-to-cell interactions direct functional maturation of hepatocytes, with non-parenchymal cells playing critical, supportive roles during organogenesis. We utilised this information to derive bipotential hepatoblast organoids and then exploited this novel model system to validate the importance of key signalling pathways and developmental cues. Furthermore, these insights into hepatic maturation enabled the identification of stage-specific transcription factors to improve the functionality of hepatocyte-like cells generated from human pluripotent stem cells. Thus, our study establishes a new platform to investigate the basic mechanisms of human liver development and to produce cell types for clinical applications.",

However, surveillance efforts in the central U.S., specifically Texas, have been minimal. The threatened and rare Brazos water snake (Nerodia harteri harteri) is one of the most range restricted snakes in the U.S. and is sympatric with two wide-ranging congeners, N. erythrogaster transversa and N. rhombifer, in north central Texas; thus, providing an opportunity to test comparative host-pathogen dynamics in this system. To accomplish this, we surveyed a portion of the Brazos river drainage (~400 river km) over 29 months and tested 150 Nerodia spp. for the presence of Oo via quantitative PCR and recorded any potential signs of Oo infection. We found Oo was distributed across the entire range of N. h. harteri, Oo prevalence was 46 % overall, and there was a significant association between Oo occurrence and signs of infection in our sample. Models indicated adults had a higher probability of Oo infection than juveniles and subadults, and adult N. h. harteri had a higher probability of infection than adult N. rhombifer but not higher than adult N. e. transversa. High Oo prevalence estimates (94.4%) in adult N. h. harteri has implications for their conservation and management owing to their patchy distribution, comparatively low genetic diversity, and threats from anthropogenic habitat modification.",

    "abstract": "Organisms inhabiting extreme thermal environments, such as desert birds, have evolved spectacular adaptations to thermoregulate during hot and cold conditions. However, our knowledge if and how selection acts on thermoregulation and the potential for evolutionary responses is limited, particularly for large organisms experiencing extreme temperature fluctuations. Here we use thermal imaging to quantify selection and genetic variation in thermoregulation in ostriches (Struthio camelus), the worlds largest bird species that is regularly exposed to increasingly volatile temperatures. We found that females that are better at regulating their head temperatures had higher egg-laying rates under hotter conditions. Thermoregulatory capacity was both heritable and showed signatures of local adaptation. Females originating from populations exposed to more unpredictable climates were better at regulating their head temperatures in response to temperature fluctuations. Together these results reveal that past and present evolutionary processes have shaped genetic variation in thermoregulatory capacity, which appears to protect critical organs, such as the brain, from extreme temperatures during reproduction.\n\nImpact SummaryLarge animals inhabiting extreme thermal environments, such as deserts, are predicted to be particularly vulnerable to the sustained heat waves expected in their future climate. However, previous research on the evolution of thermoregulation has focused on the effect of increasing temperatures on survival in ectotherms. Here we study the ostrich (Struthio camelus), the worlds largest bird, that inhabits some of the hottest and driest regions on Earth. We show that the ability of females to reproduce during hot conditions is associated with their thermoregulatory capacity. Furthermore, variation in thermoregulation is heritable and related to past climatic conditions: Females from populations originating from parts of Africa with more extreme temperature fluctuations were better able to thermoregulate, indicating local adaptation to different climatic conditions. Together, these results suggest that thermoregulation in this large desert bird has evolved in response to past climatic conditions, remains genetically variable and is currently under selection due to its effect on reproduction.",

Exploiting two large panels of untreated non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and patients, we identify the similarities between cell lines and tumors and show the conservation of key mitotic and immune-related pathways. Employing our approach on a large in-vitro perturbation screen, we show that processes captured by our method faithfully recapitulate the known modes of action of clinically approved drugs and allow investigation into the mode of action of an uncharacterized drug.",

    "abstract": "The {beta}-myosin heavy chain expressed in ventricular myocardium and the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in slow-twitch skeletal soleus muscle type-I fibers are both encoded by MYH7. Thus, these myosin molecules are deemed equivalent. However, some reports suggested variations in the light chain composition between soleus and ventricular myosin, which could influence functional parameters such as maximum velocity of shortening. To test for functional differences of the actin gliding velocity on immobilized myosin molecules we made use of the in vitro motility assay.\n\nWe found that ventricular myosin moved actin filaments with approx. 0.9 m/s significantly faster than soleus myosin (0.3 m/s). Unregulated actin filaments are not the native interaction partner of myosin and are believed to slow down movement. Yet, using native thin filaments purified from soleus or ventricular tissue, the gliding velocity of soleus and ventricular myosin remained significantly different. When comparing the light chain composition of ventricular and soleus {beta}-myosin a difference became evident. Soleus myosin contains not only the \"ventricular\" essential light chain (ELC) MLC1sb/v, but also an additional longer and more positively charged MLC1sa. Moreover, we revealed that on a single muscle fiber level, a higher relative content of MLC1sa was associated with significantly slower actin gliding.\n\nWe conclude that the ELC MLC1sa decelerates gliding velocity presumably by a decreased dissociation rate from actin associated with a higher actin affinity compared to MLC1sb/v. Such ELC/actin interactions might also be relevant in vivo as differences between soleus and ventricular myosin persisted when native thin filaments were used.\n\nSummaryCompared to the \"ventricular\" essential myosin light chain MLC1sb/v, the longer and more positively charged MLC1sa present in slow-twitch soleus muscle fibers decelerates actin filament gliding on {beta}-myosin molecules presumably by a decreased dissociation rate from actin filaments.",

Chemicals are routinely used to control major pathogens, including the causal agents of grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) and lettuce drop (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum). With increasing prevalence of pathogen resistance to fungicides and environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to identify sources of genetic resistance to B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum in lettuce. We demonstrated genetic variation for quantitative resistance to B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum in a set of 97 diverse lettuce and wild relative accessions, and between the parents of lettuce mapping populations. Transcriptome profiling across multiple lettuce accessions enabled us to identify genes with expression correlated with resistance, predicting the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in the lettuce defence response. We identified five genetic loci influencing quantitative resistance in a F10 mapping population derived from a Lactuca serriola (wild relative) x lettuce cross, which each explained 5-10% of the variation. Differential gene expression analysis between the parent lines, and integration of data on correlation of gene expression and resistance in the diversity set, highlighted potential causal genes underlying the quantitative trait loci.\n\nKey MessageWe demonstrate genetic variation for quantitative resistance against important fungal pathogens in lettuce and its wild relatives, map loci conferring resistance and predict key molecular mechanisms using transcriptome profiling.",

PRAD is often characterized by DNA methylation variability and a high rate of large genomic rearrangements. To elucidate the reasons behind such high variance, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis for integration RNA-seq, DNA methylation and copy number alterations data from The Cancer Genome Atlas PRAD. Our results show that only a single cluster of co-expressed genes is associated with genomic and epigenomic instability. Within this cluster, TP63 and TRIM29 are key transcription regulators. We revealed that TP63 regulates the level of enhancer methylation in prostate basal epithelium cells. TRIM29 forms a complex with TP63 and together regulate the expression of genes specific to the prostate basal epithelium. Moreover, TRIM29 binds DNA repair proteins and prevents formation of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion typically observed in PRAD. Therefore, the study shows that TRIM29 and TP63 are important regulators maintaining the identity of the basal epithelium under physiological conditions. Finally, we uncover the role of TRIM29 in PRAD development.",

    "abstract": "Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a powerful tool to study genome-scale models of the cellular metabolism, based on finding the optimal flux distributions over the network. While the objective function is crucial for the outcome, its choice, even though motivated by evolutionary arguments, has not been directly connected to related measures. Here, we used an available multi-scale mathematical model of yeast replicative ageing, integrating cellular metabolism, nutrient sensing and damage accumulation, to systematically test the effect of commonly used objective functions on features of replicative ageing in budding yeast, such as the number of cell divisions and the corresponding time between divisions. The simulations confirmed that assuming maximal growth is essential for reaching realistic lifespans. The usage of the parsimonious solution or the additional maximisation of a growth-independent energy cost can improve lifespan predictions, explained by either increased respiratory activity using resources otherwise allocated to cellular growth or by enhancing antioxidative activity, specifically in early life. Our work provides a new perspective on choosing the objective function in FBA by connecting it to replicative ageing.",

The mutations in this strain in the S protein Receptor Binding domain (RBD) enable it to be more transmissible as well as escape neutralizing activity by antibodies in response to vaccine. Thus, Omicron specific strategies are need to counter infection by this strain.\n\nWe investigated a collection of approved drugs shown to antagonize the binding of native strain RBD to human ACE2, for their ability to antagonize binding to Omicron strain RBD.\n\nWhile most of the drugs the drugs that antagonize binding to native RBD are also active for Omicron RBD but some were inactive, namely drugs that contain iodine are completely inactive against Omicron RBD. Our data strongly indicate that presence of a single iodine molecule in the drug renders it inactive against Omicron strain. Thus, there is molecular specificity of drugs for antagonizing Omicron strain RBD versus native strain RBD of this virus. Such information will pave way for specific drugs for Omicron. A pragmatic message from our data is that the often-used iodine containing mouth wash and rises may be ineffective in antagonizing receptor binding of Omicron strain.",

Interestingly, mice that received nucleocapsid-specific sera exhibited enhanced control of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings provide the first demonstration that humoral responses specific to an internal coronavirus protein can help clear infection, warranting the inclusion of other viral antigens in next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and providing a rationale for the clinical evaluation of nucleocapsid-specific monoclonals to treat COVID-19.\n\nHighlightsA SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid vaccine elicits robust nucleocapsid-specific antibody responses.\n\nThis nucleocapsid vaccine generates memory B cells (MBC).\n\nNucleocapsid-specific humoral responses do not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nNucleocapsid-specific humoral responses help control a SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Here, we developed a within-host and aerosol mathematical model and used it to determine the relationship between viral kinetics in the upper respiratory track, viral kinetics in the aerosols, and new transmissions in golden hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. We determined that infectious virus shedding early in infection correlates with transmission events, shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection, and high viral RNA levels late in the infection is a poor indicator of transmission. We further showed that viral infectiousness increases in a density dependent manner with viral RNA and that their relative ratio is time-dependent.

Here, we developed a mechanistic model of viral transmission in golden hamsters and used data in upper respiratory tract and aerosols to evaluate key within-host and environment based viral parameters.

    "abstract": "Marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in the ocean, a feature likely related to their extensive genetic diversity. Amongst the major lineages, clades I and IV preferentially thrive in temperate and cold, nutrient-rich waters, whilst clades II and III prefer warm, nitrogen or phosphorus-depleted waters. The existence of such cold (I/IV) and warm (II/III) thermotypes is corroborated by physiological characterization of representative strains. A fifth clade, CRD1, was recently shown to dominate the Synechococcus community in iron-depleted areas of the world ocean and to encompass three distinct ecologically significant taxonomic units (ESTUs CRD1A-C) occupying different thermal niches, suggesting that distinct thermotypes could also occur within this clade.\n\nHere, using comparative thermophysiology of strains representative of these three CRD1 ESTUs we show that the CRD1A strain MITS9220 is a warm thermotype, the CRD1B strain BIOS-U3-1 a cold temperate thermotype, and the CRD1C strain BIOS-E4-1 a warm temperate stenotherm. Curiously, the CRD1B thermotype lacks traits and/or genomic features typical of cold thermotypes. In contrast, we found specific physiological traits of the CRD1 strains compared to their clade I, II, III and IV counterparts, including a lower growth rate and photosystem II maximal quantum yield at most temperatures and a higher turnover rate of the D1 protein. Together, our data suggests that the CRD1 clade prioritizes adaptation to low-iron conditions over temperature adaptation, even though the occurrence of several CRD1 thermotypes likely explains why the CRD1 clade as a whole occupies most iron-limited waters.",

Precision and reproducibility were excellent, with standard deviation below 0.15 log10 copies/mL and coefficients of variation below 5% throughout the linear range. The presence of HBV DNA had minimal (<0.3 log10 copies/mL) impact on HBV RNA quantification at DNA:RNA ratios of up to approximately one million. In a panel of 36 untreated patient samples, cirB-RNA concentrations were approximately 200-fold lower than HBV DNA. cirB-RNA was detected in all 13 HBeAg-positive patients (mean 6.0 log10 copies/mL), and in 20 of 23 HBeAg-negative patients (mean of quantifiable samples 2.2 log10 copies/mL).

We reconstructed 136 genomes from 11 bacterial phyla and found gene clusters implicated in lanthanide-based metabolism of methanol (primarily XoxF3 and XoxF5) are surprisingly common in microbial communities in moderately weathered granite where lanthanide phosphate minerals are dissolving. Notably, XoxF3 systems were found in Verrucomicrobia for the first time, and in Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Alphaproteobacteria. The XoxF-containing gene clusters are shared by diverse Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes, and include conserved hypothetical proteins and transporters not associated with the few well studied XoxF systems. Given that siderophore-like molecules that strongly bind lanthanides may be required to solubilize lanthanide phosphates, it is notable that candidate siderophore biosynthesis systems were most prevalent in bacteria in moderately weathered rock, especially in Acidobacteria with lanthanide-based systems. We conclude that the confluence in the zone of moderate weathering of phosphate mineral dissolution, lanthanide utilisation, and methanol oxidation (thus carbonic acid production) may be important during the conversion of granitic rock to soil.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of Gram-negative bacteremia, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Gram-negative bacteremia requires three major steps: primary site infection, dissemination to the blood, and bloodstream survival. Since K. pneumoniae is a leading cause of healthcare-associated pneumonia, the lung is a common primary infection site leading to secondary bacteremia. K. pneumoniae factors essential for lung fitness have been characterized, but those required for subsequent bloodstream infection are unclear. To identify K. pneumoniae genes associated with dissemination and bloodstream survival, we performed insertion site sequencing (InSeq) using a pool of >25,000 transposon mutants in a murine model of bacteremic pneumonia. This analysis revealed the gene gmhB as important for either dissemination from the lung or bloodstream survival. In Escherichia coli, GmhB is a partially redundant enzyme in the synthesis of ADP-heptose for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core. To characterize its function in K. pneumoniae, an isogenic knockout strain ({Delta}gmhB) and complemented mutant were generated. During pneumonia, GmhB did not contribute to lung fitness and did not alter normal immune responses. However, GmhB enhanced bloodstream survival in a manner independent of serum susceptibility, specifically conveying resistance to spleen-mediated killing. In a tail-vein injection of murine bacteremia, GmhB was also required by K. pneumoniae, E. coli and Citrobacter freundii for optimal bloodstream survival. Together, this study identifies GmhB as a conserved Gram-negative bacteremia fitness factor that acts through LPS-mediated mechanisms to enhance bloodstream survival.\n\nIMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae frequently causes healthcare-associated infections including pneumonia and bacteremia. This is particularly concerning due to emerging antimicrobial resistance and the propensity for bacteremia to initiate sepsis, which has high mortality and is the most expensive hospital-treated condition. Defining mechanisms of bloodstream survival is critical to understanding the pathology of bacteremia and identifying novel targets for future therapies. In this study, we identified the K. pneumoniae enzyme GmhB as a bloodstream-specific fitness factor that enables the bacteria to survive in the spleen but is dispensable in the lung. Furthermore, GmhB is also needed by the related bacterial pathogens Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii to cause bacteremia. Conserved bacteremia fitness factors such a GmhB could be the basis for future therapeutics that would alleviate significant disease caused by from multiple diverse pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic lung fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease characterized by chronic epithelial injury and exhausted repair capacity of the alveolar compartment, associated with the expansion of cells with intermediate alveolar epithelial cell (AT2) characteristics. Using SftpcCreERT2/+: tdTomatoflox/flox mice, we previously identified a lung population of quiescent injury activated alveolar epithelial progenitors (IAAPs) marked by low expression of the AT2 lineage trace marker tdTomato (Tomlow), and characterized by high levels of Pd-l1 (Cd274) expression. This led us to hypothesize that a population with similar properties exists in the human lung. To that end, we used flow cytometry to characterize the CD274 cell surface expression in lung epithelial cells isolated from donor and end-stage IPF lungs. The identity and functional behavior of these cells were further characterized by qPCR analysis, in vitro organoid formation, and ex vivo precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Our analysis led to the identification of a population of CD274pos cells expressing intermediate levels of SFTPC, which was expanded in IPF lungs. While donor CD274pos cells initiated clone formation, they did not expand significantly in 3D organoids in AT2-supportive conditions. However, an increased number of CD274pos cells was found in cultured PCLS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, similar to the IAAPs in the mouse lung, a population of CD274 expressing cells exists in the normal human lung and this population is expanded in the IPF lung and in an ex vivo PCLS assay, suggestive of progenitor cell behavior.",

    "abstract": "The reproductive castes of eusocial insects are often characterised by extreme lifespans and reproductive output, indicating an absence of the fecundity/longevity trade-off. The role of DNA methylation in the regulation of caste- and age-specific gene expression in eusocial insects is controversial. While some studies find a clear link to caste formation in honeybees and ants, others find no correlation when replication is increased across independent colonies. Although recent studies have identified transcription patterns involved in the maintenance of high reproduction throughout the long lives of queens, the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of these genes is unknown. We carried out a comparative analysis of DNA methylation in the regulation of caste-specific transcription and its importance for the regulation of fertility and longevity in queens of the higher termite, Macrotermes natalensis. We found evidence for significant, well-regulated changes in DNA methylation in mature compared to young queens, especially in several genes related to ageing and fecundity in mature queens. We also found a strong link between methylation and caste-specific alternative splicing. This study reveals a complex regulatory role of fat body DNA methylation both in the division of labour in termites, and during the reproductive maturation of queens.",

    "abstract": "mTOR is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein kinase that coordinates cell growth and metabolism and plays a critical role in cancer, immunity, and aging. It remains unclear how mTOR signaling in individual tissues contributes to whole-organism processes because mTOR inhibitors, like the natural product Rapamycin, are administered systemically and target multiple tissues simultaneously. We developed a chemical-genetic system, termed selecTOR, that restricts the activity of a Rapamycin analog to specific cell populations through targeted expression of a mutant FKBP12 protein. This analog has reduced affinity for its obligate binding partner FKBP12, which reduces its ability to inhibit mTOR in wild-type cells and tissues. Expression of the mutant FKBP12, which contains an expanded binding pocket, rescues the activity of this Rapamycin analog. Using this system, we show that selective mTOR inhibition can be achieved in S. cerevisiae and human cells, and we validate the utility of our system in an intact metazoan model organism by identifying the tissues responsible for a Rapamycin-induced developmental delay in Drosophila.\n\nSignificance StatementmTOR plays a number of critical organismal roles, including in cell growth, development, immunity and aging, but dissecting the tissue-specific influences of mTOR has proven challenging. This work describes a simple system for identifying the specific tissues and cells responsible for the diverse functions of mTOR, and we show that our system can be used in organisms ranging from yeast to humans.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacodynamic profile of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their in vivo synergy are two factors that are thought to restrict resistance evolution and ensure their conservation. The frog Rana temporaria secretes a family of closely related AMPs, temporins A-L, as an effective chemical dermal defence. The antibacterial potency of temporin L has been shown to increase synergistically in combination with both temporins B and A but this is modest. Here we show that the less potent temporin B enhances the cooperativity of the in vitro antibacterial activity of the more potent temporin L against EMRSA-15 and that this may be associated with an altered interaction with the bacterial plasma membrane, a feature critical for the antibacterial activity of most AMPs. Addition of buforin II, a histone H2A fragment, can further increase the cooperativity. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate temporins B and L readily form hetero-oligomers in models of Gram-positive bacterial plasma membranes. Patch-clamp studies show transmembrane ion conductance is triggered with lower amounts of both peptides and more quickly, when used in combination, but conductance is of a lower amplitude and pores are smaller. Temporin B may therefore act by forming temporin L/B hetero-oligomers that are more effective than temporin L homo-oligomers at bacterial killing and/or by reducing the probability of the latter forming until a threshold concentration is reached. Exploration of the mechanism of synergy between AMPs isolated from the same organism may therefore yield antibiotic combinations with advantageous pharmacodynamic properties.",

Using urinary tract infection (UTI) as a model, we show how heterologous effector phage therapeutics (HEPTs) suppress resistance and improve uropathogen killing by dual phage- and effector-mediated targeting. Moreover, we designed HEPTs to control polymicrobial uropathogen communities through production of effectors with cross-genus activity. Using a phage-based companion diagnostic (3), we identified potential HEPT responder patients and treated their urine ex vivo. Compared to wildtype phage, a colicin E7-producing HEPT demonstrated superior control of patient E. coli bacteriuria.

Efficacy of IRAK4 inhibition was evaluated in pre-clinical models of MDS/AML\n\nResultsRNA-seq splicing analysis of innate immune mediators in SF3B1 mutant MDS samples revealed retention of full-length exon 6 of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), a critical downstream mediator that links the Myddosome to inflammatory NF-kB activation. Exon 6 retention leads to a longer isoform, encoding a protein (IRAK4-Long) that contains the entire death domain and kinase domain, leading to maximal activation of NF-kB. Cells with wild-type SF3B1 contain smaller IRAK4 isoforms that are targeted for proteosomal degradation. Expression of IRAK4-Long in SF3B1 mutant cells induces TRAF6 activation leading to K63-linked ubiquitination of CDK2, associated with a block in hematopoietic differentiation.

    "abstract": "Antibiotics can kill or stop the growth of bacteria, and their effectiveness depends on many factors. It is important to understand the relation between bacterial physiology, the environment and antibiotic action. While many of the mechanistic details of antibiotic action are known, the connection between death rate and bacterial physiology is poorly understood. Death rate in antibiotics has often been shown to rise linearly with growth rate; however, it remains unclear how environmental factors, in concert with whole-cell physiological properties, affect bactericidal activity. To address this, we developed a high-throughput assay to precisely measure antibiotic-mediated bacterial death. We found that death rate is linear in growth rate, but the slope depends on environmental conditions. Specifically, stressors lower the death rate compared to a non-stressed environment with the same growth rate. To understand the role of stress, we developed a mathematical model of bacterial death based on resource allocation that takes into account a newly defined stress-response sector; we identify this sector using RNA-seq. Our model accurately predicts the death rate and minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics across a wide range of conditions, including a previously unknown increase in the stress response and protection from death at very low levels of cAMP. The present death-growth model suggests conditions that may improve antibiotic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Early-life exposure to anesthesia in infant humans and monkeys increases the risk for cognitive and socioemotional impairments. However, the long-term effects of neonatal anesthesia on synaptic ultrastructure have not been thoroughly investigated in primates. We used electron microscopy with unbiased stereological sampling to assess synaptic ultrastructure in the CA1 of the hippocampus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of female and male rhesus macaques four years after three 4-hour exposures to sevoflurane during the first five postnatal weeks. We counted synapses and measured synapse areas for all synapses and those classified as perforated or nonperforated with spine or dendritic shaft targets. We measured numbers and shapes of mitochondria within presynaptic boutons and calculated vesicle docking rates. In monkeys exposed to anesthesia as infants, synapse areas were reduced in the largest 20% of synapses in CA1 and the largest 5% of synapses in dlPFC, with differential sex effects for the largest 10% of synapses in CA1. Synapse areas were reduced by 7.6% for perforated spinous synapses in CA1, and by 10.4% for nonperforated spinous synapses in dlPFC. Perforated and nonperforated dendritic synapse numbers in CA1 increased by 180% and 63% respectively. Curved mitochondria decreased 25% in CA1 after anesthesia exposure, and dlPFC boutons with 0 mitochondria showed an interaction of anesthesia and sex. These results demonstrate that exposure to anesthesia in infancy can cause long-term structural deficits in primates. These structural changes may be substrates for long-term alterations in the strength and efficiency of synaptic transmission in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.\n\nKey pointsO_LIExposure to anesthesia in early life causes lasting cognitive and socioemotional impairments in human and nonhuman primates, but the extent to which early-life exposure to anesthesia alters synaptic ultrastructure in later life has not been known.\nC_LIO_LIFour years after rhesus monkeys were given multiple exposures to anesthesia in infancy, the area of spinous synapses was reduced in CA1 and dlPFC, dendritic synapse numbers were elevated in CA1, there were fewer curved presynaptic mitochondria in CA1, and numbers of presynaptic boutons without mitochondria were altered in dlPFC.\nC_LIO_LIThe long-term ultrastructural changes to synapses and presynaptic mitochondria of rhesus monkeys that were exposed to anesthesia as infants could help explain their behavioral deficits later in life.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) emerged early in evolution. It is generally assumed that structurally homologous proteins in distinct species will operate via similar mechanisms. We tested this prediction through the study of interferon responses to self-DNA by the enzymatic PRR cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Contrary to expectations, we identified three functional classes of this PRR in mammals. Class 1 proteins (including human) contained a catalytic domain that was intrinsically self-DNA reactive and stimulated interferon responses in diverse cell types. This reactivity was prevented by an upstream N-terminal domain. Class 2 and 3 proteins were either not self-DNA reactive (including chimpanzee) or included proteins whose N-terminal domain promoted self-DNA reactivity (mouse). While self-DNA reactivity of Class 1 cGAS was linked to an ability to access intra-mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial localization was not associated with other classes. These studies reveal unexpected diversity in the mechanisms of self-DNA reactivity of a PRR.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe regulation of self-DNA reactivity of cGAS is evolutionarily diverse in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasmas are minimal bacteria that infect humans, wildlife, and most economically important livestock species. Mycoplasma infections cause a large range of chronic inflammatory diseases, eventually leading to death in some animals. Due to the lack of efficient recombination and genome engineering tools, the production of mutant strains for the identification of virulence factors and the development of improved vaccine strains is still a bottleneck for many mycoplasma species. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of a CRISPR-derived genetic tool to introduce targeted mutations in three major pathogenic species that span the phylogenetic diversity of these bacteria: the avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the two most important bovine mycoplasmas, Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides. As a proof of concept, we successfully used an inducible dCas9-cytidine deaminase system to disrupt several major virulence factors in these pathogens. Various induction times and inducer concentrations were evaluated to optimize editing efficiency. The optimized system was sufficiently powerful to disrupt 54 of 55 insertion sequence transposases in a single step. Whole genome sequencing showed that off-target mutations were limited and suggest that most variations detected in the edited genomes are Cas9-independent. This effective, rapid, and easy-to-use genetic tool opens a new avenue for the study of these important animal pathogens and, most likely, the entire class Mollicutes.\n\nSignificanceMycoplasmas are minimal wall-less pathogenic bacteria that infect a wide range of hosts, including humans, livestock, and wild animals. Major pathogenic species cause acute to chronic infections involving still poorly characterized virulence factors. The lack of precise genome editing tools has hampered functional studies for many species, leaving multiple questions about the molecular basis of their pathogenicity unanswered. We developed a CRISPR-derived base editor for three major pathogenic species, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma bovis, and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides. Several virulence factors were successfully targeted and we were able to edit up to 54 target sites in a single step. The availability of this efficient and easy-to-use genetic tool will greatly facilitate functional studies in these economically important bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Some Escherichia coli strains belonging mainly to the B2 phylogroup harbour the pks island, a 54 kb genomic island encoding the biosynthesis genes for a genotoxic compound named colibactin. In eukaryotic cells, colibactin can induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and chromosomal instability. Moreover, production of colibactin has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the inhibitory effect of D-Serine on the expression of the pks island in two colibactin-producing strains, CFT073 and Nissle 1917, and determine the implications for cytopathic effects on host cells. To investigate the specificity of the inhibitory effect of D-Serine, we also tested a comprehensive panel of proteinogenic L-amino acids and corresponding D-enantiomers for their ability to modulate clbB transcription using RT-qPCR. Several D-amino acids exhibited the ability to inhibit expression of clbB, with D-Serine exerting the strongest repressing activity (3.81-fold in CFT073; 3.80-fold in Nissle 1917) and thus, we focussed additional experiments on D-Serine. To investigate the cellular effect, we investigated if repression of colibactin by D-Serine could reduce the cytopathic responses normally observed during infection of HeLa cells with pks+ strains. Levels of {gamma}-H2AX (a marker of DNA double strand breaks) were reduced 2.75-fold in cells infected with D-Serine treatment. Moreover, exposure of pks+ E. coli to D-Serine during infection caused a reduction in cellular senescence that was observable at 72 h post infection. The recent finding of an association between pks-carrying commensal E. coli and CRC, highlights the necessity for the development of colibactin targeting therapeutics. Here we show that D-Serine can reduce expression of colibactin, and inhibit downstream cellular cytopathy, illuminating its therapeutic potential to prevent colibactin-associated disease.",

    "abstract": "New antibiotics are needed as bacterial infections continue to be a leading cause of death. Notorious among antibiotic-resistant bacteria is the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), which infects cystic fibrosis patients, causing lung function decline. We recently discovered a novel ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP), ubonodin, with potent activity against several Burkholderia pathogens. Ubonodin inhibits RNA polymerase, but only select Bcc strains were susceptible, indicating that having a conserved cellular target does not guarantee activity. Given the cytoplasmic target, we speculate that cellular uptake of ubonodin determines susceptibility. Here, we report a new outer membrane siderophore receptor, PupB, that is required for ubonodin uptake in B. cepacia. Loss of PupB renders B. cepacia resistant to ubonodin, whereas expressing PupB sensitizes a resistant strain. Thus, outer membrane transport is the major determinant of ubonodins spectrum of activity. We also show that PupB is activated by a TonB protein and examine a transcriptional pathway that further regulates PupB. Finally, we elucidate the complete cellular uptake pathway for ubonodin by also identifying its inner membrane transporter in B. cepacia. Our work unravels central steps in the mechanism of action of ubonodin and establishes a general framework for dissecting RiPP function.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is an essential process in bacterial drug resistance evolution. Fluoroquinolones, an important class of antibiotics, are known to stimulate recombination in Escherichia coli. On the other hand, when bacteria are exposed to sublethal concentrations of different antibiotic families, including strong inducers of the SOS system, which upregulates recombination pathways, there is no detectable change in the recombination rate. Here we explore why fluoroquinolones, but not any other tested antimicrobials, increase recombination rates. One feature that makes the fluoroquinolones different from other antibiotics is the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We tested whether other antimicrobials known for their ability to cause double-strand breaks, such as mitomycin C and bleomycin, are also affecting bacterial recombination rate. We found that both drugs indeed affected recombination rates in E. coli. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the number of DNA double-strand breaks and the recombination frequency. The manipulation of the level of DSBs directly impacted the recombination frequency. These results imply that recombination, at least in Gram-negative bacteria, is conservative, and even if multiple copies of a DNA sequence are available, the basal recombination rate is low. Our results highlight that homologous recombination is intended more for DNA damage repair than generating diversity, or at least that they occur at a very different scale. We also show that only antibiotics that cause DNA double-strand breaks can increase genetic diversity via recombination. The stimulation of recombination by DSBs-causing antimicrobials is an additional factor leading to the risk of antibiotic resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the rise of extremely threatening healthcare-associated multidrug resistant non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, Candida auris. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of antifungal resistance has emerged as the single most important goal amongst the research community. Since besides target alterations, efflux mechanisms contribute maximally to antifungal resistance, it is imperative to investigate their contributions in this pathogen. Of note, within the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of efflux pumps, Drug/H+ antiporter family 1 (DHA1) has been established as a predominant contributor towards xenobiotic efflux. Our study provides a complete landscape of DHA1 transporters encoded in the genome of C. auris. This study identifies 14 DHA1 transporters encoded in the genome of the pathogen. We also construct deletion and heterologous overexpression strains for the most important DHA1 drug transporter, viz., CauMdr1 to map the spectrum of its substrates. While the knockout strain did not show any significant changes in the resistance patterns against the majority of the tested substrates, the ortholog when overexpressed in a minimal background S. cerevisiae strain, AD1-8u-, showed significant enhancement in the Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against a large panel of antifungal molecules. Altogether, the present study provides a comprehensive template for investigating the role of DHA1 members of C. auris in antifungal resistance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Electromethanogenesis is the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) with microorganisms as catalysts, and it is a promising approach for biogas upgrading. Many studies have shown increased methane production by electrochemical stimulation, allegedly due to the enhancement of direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between electrogenic bacteria and methanogens. However, these studies were done with mixed cultures where the interspecies interactions were undefined, so the impact of an electrochemical stimulus on these interactions remains unresolved. Here we report that an electrochemical stimulus diminished the survival and activity of a defined DIET consortium. We investigated the impact of electrochemical stimulation on a co-culture of Geobacter metallireducens and Methanosarcina barkeri, where the two partners interact syntrophically via DIET. The electrochemical stimulus was a cathode poised at - 700 mV (versus the standard hydrogen electrode, SHE). Electrochemical stimulation was provided either continuously or intermittently, and so was the food substrate. Compared to the untreated DIET co-culture, all treatment strategies relying on cathodic current additions resulted in acetate accumulation, lower methane production and lower cell numbers for both partners, indicating a detrimental impact of electrochemical stimulation to a DIET consortium. These findings suggest that future bioelectrochemical technologies must guarantee the survival of the syntrophic partners during current additions.",

Profiling of 129,986 cells identified a shared proinflammatory state in epithelial cells and an early activation state of fibroblasts. Moreover, IPF basal cells initiated awry repair mechanisms and primed the airway mucosa for TGF-{beta} activation. Treatment with nintedanib, pirfenidone, both established antifibrotic drugs, and saracatinib, an Src kinase inhibitor that can limit IPF progression, only significantly affected certain IPF signatures.

Lrig3, a transmembrane protein, is expressed in colonic crypt epithelial cells, including the stem, progenitor, and differentiated cell types. Mice missing Lrig3 have a disruption in their cellular census: using a novel Lrig3-/- mouse we demonstrate that Lrig3-/- mice have more cells per crypt, a greater mucosal area, and longer colons compared to wildtype mice, suggesting the expression of Lrig3 is required for both the total number of epithelial cells in the mouse colon, as well as colon length. In addition, we show Lrig3-/- mice have significantly more stem, progenitor, and deep crypt secretory cells, yet harbor a normal complement of enteroendocrine, Tuft, and absorptive cells. Lrig3-/- mice also have a concomitant decrease in phosphorylated Extracellular signal-related kinases, indicating the loss of Lrig3 leads to an expansion of the colonic stem cell compartment, in an Erk-dependent manner.

While structural studies have identified residues that mediate MtrA binding to hemes and to other cytochromes that facilitate extracellular electron transfer (EET), the relative importance of these interactions for EET is not known. To better understand EET, we evaluated how insertion of an octapeptide across all MtrA backbone locations affects Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 respiration on Fe(III). EET efficiency was found to be inversely correlated with insertion proximity to the heme prosthetic groups. Mutants with decreased EET also arose from insertions in a subset of the regions that make residue-residue contacts with the porin MtrB, while all sites contacting the extracellular MtrC presented high peptide insertion tolerance. MtrA variants having peptide insertions within the CXXCH motifs that coordinate heme cofactors retained some ability to support respiration on Fe(III), although these variants presented significantly decreased EET. Furthermore, the fitness of cells expressing different MtrA variants under Fe(III)-respiring conditions correlated with anode reduction. The peptide-insertion profile, which represents the first comprehensive sequence-structure-function map for a multiheme cytochrome, implicates MtrA as a strategic protein engineering target for regulating EET.",

    "abstract": "While protein translocation in Gram-negative bacteria is well understood, our knowledge about the translocation of other high-molecular-weight substances is limited. Nozzle-like structures that secrete exopolymeric substances during gliding motility have previously been observed in the outer membranes of cyanobacteria and myxobacteria. Here, we show that these nozzles are composed of the secretins PilQ/GspD, the outer membrane component of the type II and III secretion systems, the type IV pilus apparatus, and filamentous phage extrusion machinery. Our results show for the first time that secretins may be used for secretion of non-proteinaceous polymers in some bacteria, considerably expanding the repertoire of substrates of these multifunctional outer membrane gates. Moreover, we show that gspD is an essential gene in Myxococcus xanthus, which, when depleted, renders this bacterium defective in slime secretion and gliding motility.\n\nSignificanceMany bacteria exhibit gliding motility, movement across surfaces. This motility has been correlated with the deposit of slime trails in their wake. To date, the mechanism of slime secretion has not been understood, and no cell envelope-structures have been identified that are involved in slime secretion during gliding motility. Here, we show that cyanobacteria and myxobacteria use the secretins PilQ/GspD, the outer membrane channels of the T2SS, for slime secretion, which demonstrates a novel cargo transport capacity of these multifunctional outer membrane gates.",

    "abstract": "The global burden of sepsis, with an estimated 49 million cases and 11 million deaths in 2017, often passes unnoticed to the general public even though it is the direct cause of nearly 20% of all deaths worldwide. This unawareness is perhaps due to misconceptions, or miscoding in the reporting of the ultimate causes of death, as in many diseases it is not the actual infectious agent that causes the biggest harm. Rather, it is the uncontrolled inflammation leading to septic shock that is the most menacing manifestation associated with many infections, and becomes deadly serious once it has passed the stage where anti-microbial drugs no longer have any effect to inactivate or destroy the pathogen. Here we show that the combined anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) protein CD5L contribute to a remarkable therapeutic effect of the protein to fight sepsis, such that when exogenously administered in C57BL/6 mice with induced lethal-grade sepsis, it can be a very effective curative agent to treat this condition. The resistance conferred by CD5L to polybacterial-induced sepsis using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model is consistent with the reported observations that CD5L physically binds and inactivates diverse species and strains of bacteria. Accordingly, our CD5L-knockout mice are significantly more susceptible to experimentally-induced mid-grade CLP than wild-type animals. We show that CD5L is centered on promoting neutrophil recruitment and activation, overall contributing to reducing the bacteria burden of the animals. However, the dramatic susceptibility of CD5L-deficient animals is not necessarily correlated only with pathogen load, as these mice are also extremely susceptible to sterile sepsis induced by nonlethal doses of LPS. Notwithstanding the observed capacity of CD5L to directly bind to a broad range of pathogens, typical of many PRRs, our evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of the protein are at least as important as its pathogen-binding potential, and can, and should, be explored to treat the deadly inflammation storm that is sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Parental age at conception often influences offsprings longevity, a phenomenon referred as the \"Lansing effect\" described in large variety of organisms. But, the majority of the results refer to the survival of juveniles, mainly explained by an inadequate parental care by the elderly parents, mostly the mothers. Studies on the effect of parental age on offsprings longevity in adulthood remain few, excepted in humans for whom effects of parental age are variable according to statistical models or socioeconomic environments. In a small primate which the longevity reaches up to 12 years, we investigated the effects of parental age at conception on the longevity of offspring (N = 278) issued from parents with known longevity. None of the postnatal parameters, including body mass, influenced offsprings longevity. Mothers age at conception significantly affected offsprings longevity in males but not females. By contrast, fathers age at conception did not influence offsprings longevity. When considering the age of the breeding pairs at conception, the older the mother, the lower the longevity of male offspring with a minimum when the father was aged. No such correlation was observed for female offspring. Lastly, the longevity of female offspring was significantly positively related to the longevity of both parents. Compared with current studies, the surprisingly minor effect of fathers  age and the major impact of mothers age on male offspring survival, despite favourable conditions, were discussed in relation with the highly seasonal reproduction in mouse lemurs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how endogenous and exogenous factors such as annual seasonal rhythm and photoperiodism affect the toxicity of pesticides can help design integrated pest management strategies. The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), a worldwide phytophagous pest species distributed in areas with different time zones, is a good model to explore how the photoperiodism and seasonality affect the pesticide toxicity. In this study, we conducted a laboratory experiment from March 2017 to November 2018 where spider mites were reared at three photoperiod regimes in environmentally controlled incubators. The toxicities of two acaricides, propargite and diafenthiruon, were measured on T. urticae every month. To determine potential mechanisms underlying the changes in the acaricide toxicity, we measured body size and total GSTs activity with the toxicity measurements in 2018. Our results showed that the toxicities of the two acaricides were not significantly different among the three photoperiod regimes. However, both had a consistent trend along the season which increased in the spring and summer and decreased in the winter in all photoperiod regimes for two consecutive years, suggesting seasonality be an endogenous factor affecting the susceptibility of the spider mites to pesticide. Pearsons correlation analyses showed only the body size had a weak negative correlation with the acaricide toxicities, suggesting a minor contribution to the higher toxicity from the smaller size of T. urticae. Our study is the first to show that seasonality can have an endogenous effect on the pesticide toxicity, and the results can inform practical insights into the pest management strategies.",
