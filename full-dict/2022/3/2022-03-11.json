    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAphids are major pests of most of the crops worldwide. Such a success is largely explained by the remarkable plasticity of their reproductive mode. They reproduce efficiently by viviparous parthenogenesis during spring and summer generating important damage on crops. At the end of the summer, viviparous parthenogenetic females perceive the photoperiod shortening and transduce this signal to their embryos that change their reproductive fate to produce sexual individuals: oviparous females and males. After mating, those females lay cold-resistant eggs. Earlier studies showed that some transcripts coding for key components of dopamine pathway were regulated between long days and short days conditions suggesting that dopamine might be involved in the transduction of seasonal cues prior to reproductive mode switch. In this study, we aimed at going deeper into the characterization of the expression dynamics of this pathway but also in the analysis of its functional role in this context in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. We first analysed the level of expression of ten genes of this pathway in embryos and larval heads of aphids reared under long days (asexual producers) or short days (sexual producers) conditions. We then performed in situ hybridization experiments to localize in embryos the ddc and pale transcripts that are coding for two key enzymes in dopamine synthesis. Finally, Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in eggs produced after the mating of sexual individuals, we targeted the ddc gene. We could observe strong melanization defaults in ddc mutated eggs, which confidently mimicked the Drosophila ddc phenotype. Nevertheless, such a lethal phenotype did not allow us to validate the involvement of dopamine as a signaling pathway necessary to trigger the reproductive mode switch in embryos.",

    "abstract": "Forces produced by motor proteins and microtubule dynamics within the mitotic spindle are crucial for proper chromosome segregation. In addition to linear forces, rotational forces or torques are present in the spindle, reflected in the left-handed twisted shapes of microtubule bundles that make the spindle chiral. However, the biological role and molecular origins of spindle chirality are unknown. By developing methods for measuring spindle twist, we show that spindles are most chiral near the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. To assess the role of chirality in maintaining spindle robustness under force, we compressed the spindles along their axis. This resulted in stronger left-handed twist, suggesting that the twisted shape allows for a mechanical response to forces. Inhibition or depletion of motor proteins that perform chiral stepping, Eg5/kinesin-5, Kif18A/kinesin-8, MKLP1/kinesin-6, and dynein, decreased the left-handed twist or led to right-handed twist, implying that these motors regulate the twist by rotating microtubules within their antiparallel overlaps or at the spindle pole. Right-handed twist was also observed after the depletion of the microtubule nucleator augmin, indicating its contribution to the twist through the nucleation of antiparallel bridging microtubules. The uncovered switch from left-handed to right-handed twist reveals the existence of competing mechanisms that promote twisting in opposite directions. As round spindles were more twisted than elongated ones, we infer that bending and twisting moments are generated by similar molecular mechanisms and propose a physiological role for spindle chirality in allowing the spindle to absorb mechanical load.",

    "abstract": "Nascent RNA sequencing protocols, such as PRO-seq and NET-seq, are now widely used in the study of eukaryotic transcription, and these experimental techniques have given rise to a variety of statistical and machine-learning methods for data analysis. These computational methods, however, are generally designed to address specialized signal-processing or prediction tasks, rather than directly describing the dynamics of RNA polymerases as they move along the DNA template. Here, I introduce a general probabilistic model that describes the kinetics of transcription initiation, elongation, pause release, and termination, as well as the generation of sequencing read counts. I show that this generative model enables estimation of separate pause-release rates, termination rates, and the initiation/elongation rate ratio up to a proportionality constant. Furthermore, if applied to time-course data in a nonequilibrium setting, the model can be used to estimate elongation rates. This model leads naturally to likelihood ratio tests for differences between genes, conditions, or species in various rates of interest. If read counts are assumed to be Poisson-distributed, convenient, closed-form solutions are available for both parameter estimates and likelihood-ratio-test statistics. Straightforward extensions of the model accommodate variability in the pause site and steric hindrance of initiation by paused polymerases. Additional extensions address Bayesian inference under the Poisson model and a generalized linear model that can be used to discover genomic features associated with rates of elongation. Finally, I address technicalities concerning estimation of library size, normalization and sequencing replicates. Altogether, this modeling framework enables a unified treatment of many common tasks in the analysis of nascent RNA sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "The cellular milieu is teeming with biochemical nano-machines whose activity is a strong source of correlated non-thermal fluctuations termed active noise. Essential elements of this circuitry are enzymes, catalysts that speed up the rate of metabolic reactions by orders of magnitude, thereby making life possible. Here, we examine the possibility that active noise in the cell, or in vitro, affects enzymatic catalytic rate by accelerating or decelerating the crossing rate of energy barriers during the reaction. Considering hydrodynamic perturbations induced by biochemical activity as a source of active noise, we evaluate their impact on the enzymatic cycle using a combination of analytic and numerical methods. Our estimates show that the fast component of the active noise spectrum enhances the rate of enzymes, while reactions remain practically unaffected by the slow noise spectrum. Revisiting the physics of barrier crossing under the influence of active hydrodynamic fluctuations suggests that the biochemical activity of macromolecules such as enzymes is coupled to active noise. Thus, we propose that enzymatic catalysis is a collective, many-body process in which enzymes may affect each others activity via long-range hydrodynamic interaction, with potential impact on biochemical networks in living and artificial systems alike.",

    "abstract": "Environmental oxidative stress threatens cellular integrity and should therefore be avoided by living organisms. Yet, relatively little is known about environmental oxidative stress perception. Here, using microfluidics, we showed that like I2 pharyngeal neurons, the tail phasmid PHA neurons function as oxidative stress sensing neurons in C. elegans, but display different responses to H2O2 and light. We uncovered that different but related receptors, GUR-3 and LITE-1, mediate H2O2 signaling in I2 and PHA neurons. Still, the peroxiredoxin PRDX-2 is essential for both, and might promote H2O2-mediated receptor activation. Our work demonstrates that C. elegans can sense a broad range of oxidative stressors using partially distinct H2O2 signaling pathways in head and tail sensillae, and paves the way for further understanding of how the integration of these inputs translates into the appropriate behavior.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/451501v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130c30eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55fbeeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10edcfforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf0ab7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Standard methods for multivariate GWAS operate marker-by-marker and are computationally intensive. We present a penalized regression algorithm for multivariate GWAS based on iterative hard thresholding (IHT) and implement it in a convenient Julia package MendelIHT.jl (https://github.com/OpenMendel/MendelIHT.jl). In simulation studies with up to 100 traits, IHT exhibits similar true positive rates, smaller false positive rates, and faster execution times than GEMMAs linear mixed models and mv-PLINKs canonical correlation analysis. On UK Biobank data, our IHT software completed a 3-trait joint analysis in 20 hours and an 18-trait joint analysis in 53 hours, requiring up to 80GB of computer memory. In short, our software enables geneticists to fit a single regression model that simultaneously considers the effect of all SNPs and dozens of traits.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to affect functional connectivity (FC) across many brain regions. Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the reconstruction of a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. Cross-bispectrum detects cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD cases in{delta} -{theta} coupling. Overall, increased strength of low-frequency coupling and decreased level of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD cases in comparison to healthy controls (HC). We demonstrate that a graph-theoretic analysis of cross-frequency brain networks is crucial to obtain a more detailed insight into their structure and function. Vulnerability analysis reveals that the integration and segregation properties of networks are enabled by different frequency couplings in AD networks compared to HCs. Finally, we use the reconstructed networks for classification. The extra cross-frequency coupling information can improve the classification performance significantly, suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus (HPC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are two cortical areas of the primate brain deemed essential to cognition. Here we hypothesize that the codes mediating neuronal communication in HPC and LPFC microcircuits have distinctively evolved to serve plasticity and memory function at different spatiotemporal scales. We used a virtual reality task in which animals navigated through a maze using a joystick and selected one of two targets in the arms of the maze according to a learned context-color rule. We found that neurons and neuronal populations in both regions encode similar information about the task. Moreover, we demonstrate that many HPC neurons concentrate spikes into bursts, whereas most layer II/III LPFC neurons sparsely distribute spikes over time. As the animals learned the task HPC neurons, but not LPFC neurons, increased their burst rate as a function of performance. When integrating spike rates over short intervals, HPC neuronal ensembles reached maximum decoded information with fewer neurons than LPFC ensembles. Our results show that during associative learning HPC principal cells concentrate spikes in bursts enabling temporal summation and fast synaptic plasticity in small populations of neurons and ultimately facilitating rapid encoding of associative memories. On the other hand, layers II/III LPFC pyramidal cells fire spikes more sparsely distributed in time and over a larger number of neurons. The latter would facilitate broadcasting of signals loaded in short term memory across neuronal populations without necessarily triggering fast synaptic plasticity.",

Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are a genetically and metabolically heterogeneous cancer. Although MPC expression and activity differed between DLBCL subgroups, mitochondrial pyruvate was uniformly consumed by glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) to support -ketoglutarate production as part of glutaminolysis. This led us to discover that glutamine exceeds pyruvate as a carbon source for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in DLBCLs. Furthermore, we found that MPC inhibition unexpectedly leads to decreased glutaminolysis, which is contrary to previous observations in other cell types. We also discovered that MPC inhibition and depletion only decreased DLBCL proliferation in an extracellular matrix (ECM) environment and in vivo xenografts, but not in the typical DLBCL suspension environment. We also have found that the metabolic profile of DLBCL cells in ECM is markedly different from cells in suspension environment. Thus, we report that besides the canonical glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)-mediated glutaminolysis, the non-canonical GPT2 mediated consumption and assimilation of glutamine and pyruvate in DLBCLs enables their proliferation in an extracellular environment-dependent manner.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIGlutamine, but not glucose, is a major carbon source for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial pyruvate supports glutaminolysis in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas by supplying pyruvate for glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2-mediated  -ketoglutarate production.\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition leads to decreased glutaminolysis in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.\nC_LIO_LI -ketoglutarate production is important for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma proliferation in a solid extracellular matrix environment.\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial pyruvate carrier activity supports diffuse large B-cell lymphoma proliferation in a solid extracellular matrix environment and in mouse xenografts.\nC_LI",

These maintenance periods, such as those experienced in stationary phase, can include upregulation of secondary metabolism and release of exometabolites into the local environment. As resource limitation is common of many environmental microbial habitats, we hypothesized that neighboring bacterial populations employ exometabolites to compete or cooperate during maintenance, and that these exometabolite-facilitated interactions can drive community outcomes. Here, we evaluated the consequences of exometabolite interactions over stationary phase among three environmental strains: Burkholderia thailandensis E264, Chromobacterium subtsugae, and Pseudomonas syringae pv.tomato DC3000. We assembled them into synthetic communities that only permitted chemical interactions. We compared the responses (transcripts) and outputs (exometabolites) of each member with and without neighbors. We found that transcriptional dynamics were changed with different neighbors, and that some of these changes were coordinated between members. The dominant competitor B. thailandensis consistently upregulated biosynthetic gene clusters to produce bioactive exometabolites for both exploitative and interference competition. These results demonstrate that competition strategies during maintenance can contribute to community-level outcomes. It also suggests that the traditional concept of defining competitiveness by growth outcomes may be narrow, and that maintenance competition could be an additional or alternative measure.",

Here in this study, we conducted targeted sequencings of CUX2, a paralog CUX1 and its short isoform CASP harboring a unique C-terminus on 271 Japanese patients with a variety of epilepsies, and found that multiple CUX2 missense variants, other than the p.E590K, and some CASP variants including a deletion, predominantly appeared in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The CUX2 variants showed abnormal localization in human cell culture analysis. While wild-type CUX2 enhances dendritic arborization in fly neurons, the effect was compromised by some of the variants. Cux2- and Casp-specific knockout mice both showed high susceptibility to kainate, increased excitatory cell number in the entorhinal cortex, and significant enhancement in glutamatergic synaptic transmission to the hippocampus. CASP and CUX2 proteins physiologically bound to each other and co-expressed in excitatory neurons in brain regions including the entorhinal cortex.

Patch clamp technique was used for electrophysiological and pharmacological characterization of isolated mouse intracardiac neurons.\n\nResultsWe have identified the expression of seven distinct neuronal markers within mouse ICNS, thus proving the neurochemical diversity of this network. Of note, it was the first time that the existence of neurons expressing the calcium binding protein calbindin, the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the cocain and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptide, was described in the mouse. Electrophysiological studies also revealed the existence of four different neuronal populations based on their electrical behavior. Finally, we showed that these neurons can be modulated by several neuromodulators.\n\nConclusionThis study showed that mouse ICNS presents a molecular and functional complexity similar to other species, and is therefore a suitable model to decipher the role of individual neuronal subtypes regarding the modulation of cardiac function and the initiation of cardiac arrhythmias.",

Previous work has reported such spatially-global effects for low-level features such as color and orientation, as well as for faces. Here, using fMRI, we provide evidence for spatially-global attentional modulation for human bodies. Participants were cued to search for one of six object categories in two vertically-aligned images. Two additional, horizontally-aligned, images were simultaneously presented but were never task-relevant across three experimental sessions. Analyses time-locked to the objects presented in these task-irrelevant images revealed that responses evoked by body silhouettes were modulated by the participants top-down attentional set, becoming more body-selective when participants searched for bodies in the task-relevant images. These effects were observed both in univariate analyses of the body-selective cortex and in multivariate analyses of the object-selective visual cortex. Additional analyses showed that this modulation reflected response gain rather than a bias induced by the cues, and that it reflected enhancement of body responses rather than suppression of non-body responses. These findings provide evidence for a spatially-global attention mechanism for body shapes, supporting the rapid and parallel detection of conspecifics in our environment.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal somatostatin (SOM) cells are dendrite-projecting inhibitory interneurons. CA1 SOM cells receive major excitatory inputs from pyramidal cells (PC-SOM synapses) which show mGluR1a- and mTORC1-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP). PC-SOM synapse LTP contributes to CA1 network metaplasticity and memory consolidation, but whether it is sufficient to regulate these processes remains unknown. Here we used optogenetic stimulation of CA1 pyramidal cells and whole cell recordings in slices to show that optogenetic theta burst stimulation (TBSopto) produces LTP at PC-SOM synapses. At the network level, we found that TBSopto differentially regulates metaplasticity of pyramidal cell inputs: enhancing LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses and depressing LTP at temporo-ammonic synapses. At the behavioral level, we uncovered that in vivo TBSopto regulates learning-induced LTP at PC-SOM synapses, as well as contextual fear memory. Thus, LTP of PC-SOM synapses is a long-term feedback mechanism controlling pyramidal cell synaptic plasticity, sufficient to regulate memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe human primary sensory (S1) and primary motor (M1) hand areas feature high-frequency neuronal responses. Electrical nerve stimulation evokes high-frequency oscillations (HFO) at around 650 Hz in the contralateral S1. Likewise, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 can evoke a series of descending volleys in the corticospinal pathway that can be detected non-invasively with a paired-pulse TMS protocol, called short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF). SICF features several peaks of facilitation of motor evoked potentials in contralateral hand muscles, which are separated by inter-peak intervals resembling HFO rhythmicity.\n\nHypothesisIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that the individual expressions of HFO and SICF are tightly related to each other and to the regional myelin content in the sensorimotor cortex.\n\nMethodsIn 24 healthy volunteers, we recorded HFO and SICF, and, in a subgroup of 20 participants, we mapped the cortical myelin content using the ratio between the T1- and T2-weighted MRI signal as read-out.\n\nResultsThe individual frequencies and magnitudes of HFO and SICF curves were tightly correlated: the intervals between the first and second peak of cortical HFO and SICF showed a positive linear relationship (r= 0.703, p< 0.001), while their amplitudes were inversely related (r= -0.613, p= 0.001). The rhythmicity, but not the magnitude of the high-frequency responses, was related to the cortical myelin content: the higher the cortical myelin content, the shorter the inter-peak intervals of HFO and SICF.\n\nConclusionThe results confirm a tight functional relationship between high-frequency responses in S1 (i.e., HFO) and M1 (i.e., as measured with SICF). They also establish a link between the degree of regional cortical myelination and the expression of high-frequency responses in the human sensorimotor cortex, giving further the opportunity to infer their generators.",

    "abstract": "For many human cancers and tumor-associated diseases, mutations in the RAS isoforms (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS) are the most common oncogenic alterations, making these proteins high-priority therapeutic targets. Effectively targeting the RAS isoforms requires an exact understanding of their active, inactive, and druggable conformations. However, there is no structure-guided catalogue of RAS conformations to guide therapeutic targeting or examining the structural impact of RAS mutations. We present an expanded classification of RAS conformations based on analyzing their catalytic switch 1 (SW1) and switch 2 (SW2) loops. From all 721 available human KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (206 RAS-protein complexes, 190 inhibitor-bound, and 325 unbound, including 204 WT and 517 mutated structures), we created a broad conformational classification based on the spatial positions of residue Y32 in SW1 and residue Y71 in SW2. Subsequently, we defined additional conformational subsets (some previously undescribed) by clustering all well modeled SW1 and SW2 loops using a density-based machine learning algorithm with a backbone dihedral-based distance metric. In all, we identified three SW1 conformations and nine SW2 conformations, each which are associated with different nucleotide states (GTP-bound, nucleotide-free, and GDP-bound) and specific bound proteins or inhibitor sites. The GTP-bound SW1 conformation can be further subdivided based on the hydrogen (H)-bond type made between residue Y32 and the GTP {gamma}-phosphate: water-mediated, direct, or no H-bond. Further analyzing these structures clarified the catalytic impact of the G12D and G12V RAS mutations, and the inhibitor chemistries that bind to each druggable RAS conformation. To facilitate future RAS structural analyses, we have created a web database, called Rascore, presenting an updated and searchable dataset of human KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS structures in the PDB, and which includes a page for analyzing user uploaded RAS structures by our algorithm (http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/rascore/).\n\nSignificanceAnalyzing >700 experimentally determined RAS structures helped define an expanded landscape of active, inactive and druggable RAS conformations, the structural impact of common RAS mutations, and previously uncharacterized RAS-inhibitor binding modes.",

Yet, the disease patho-mechanism remains unsolved. Here we investigated the functional consequences of SHFM3-associated rearrangements on chromatin conformation and gene expression in vivo in transgenic mice. We show that the Lbx1/Fgf8 locus consists of two separate, but interacting, regulatory domains. Re-engineering of a SHFM3-associated duplication and a newly reported inversion in mice resulted in restructuring of the chromatin architecture. This led to an ectopic activation of the Lbx1 and Btrc genes in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) in an Fgf8-like pattern. Artificial repositioning of the AER-specific enhancers of Fgf8 was sufficient to induce misexpression of Lbx1 and Btrc. We provide evidence that the SHFM3 phenotype is the result of a combinatorial effect on gene misexpression and dosage in the developing limb. Our results reveal new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying SHFM3 and provide novel conceptual framework for how genomic rearrangements can cause gene misexpression and disease.",

    "abstract": "Interoception, or an awareness of the internal body state, guides agents in adaptive behavior by informing them of ongoing bodily signals, such as heart rate or energy status. However, it is still unclear whether the human brain represents the differences in the subjective experience of interoception differently. Hence, we directly compared the neural activation for cardiac (awareness related to heartbeats) and gastric (awareness related to the stomach) interoception in the same population (healthy human, N = 31). Participants were asked to focus on their heart and stomach sensations to be aware of interoception in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The results indicated that neural activation underlying gastric interoception encompassed larger brain regions, including the occipitotemporal visual cortices, bilateral primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral hippocampal regions. Cardiac interoception, however, selectively activated the right anterior insula extending to the frontal operculum more compared to gastric interoception. Moreover, our detailed analyses focusing on the insula, the most relevant region for interoception, revealed that the left dorsal middle insula encoded cardiac and gastric interoception in different activation patterns but not the posterior insula. Our results demonstrate that cardiac and gastric interoception have distinct neural substrates; in particular, the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.\n\nSignificance statementInteroception, subjective senses that arise from within the body, plays a critical role in maintaining adaptive behavior by informing of the ongoing bodily states, such as heart rate and energy status. Although interoception has various characteristics depending on its source signals, previous neuroimaging studies have extensively used cardiac interoception (senses related to heartbeats), making it unclear whether the brain differently encodes diverse experiences of interoception. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac interoception and gastric interoception (senses related to the stomach) have distinct neural substrates by combining mass-univariate analysis with multivoxel pattern analysis for fMRI data. Our findings suggest that the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.",

While assessing peptides for MHC binding is an important component of probing these interactions, traditional assays for testing peptides of interest for MHC binding are limited in throughput. Here we present a yeast display-based platform for assessing the binding of tens of thousands of user-defined peptides in a high throughput manner. We apply this approach to assess a tiled library covering the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and four dengue virus serotypes for binding to human class II MHCs, including HLA-DR401, -DR402, and -DR404. This approach identifies binders missed by computational prediction, highlighting the potential for systemic computational errors given even state-of-the-art training data, and underlines design considerations for epitope identification experiments. This platform serves as a framework for examining relationships between viral conservation and MHC binding, and can be used to identify potentially high-interest peptide binders from viral proteins.

We developed a straightforward mathematical approach to integrating multi-modal data to quantify obesityinduced changes to WAT organization. We aligned ATM phenotypes with crown-like structures (CLS) in early obesity and used spatial network analysis to uncover signalling mechanisms implicated in CLS formation.\n\nResultsWe identified novel diversity of the lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) phenotype, whose transcriptional profile, signaling mechanisms, and spatial context serve as indicators of CLS formation in early obesity. We demonstrated that dysregulation of lipid-metabolic signalling is a critical turning point in the monocyte-LAM lineage and identified novel ligand-receptor mechanisms including Apoe, Lrp1, Lpl and App that serve as hallmarks of nascent CLS in WAT.\n\nConclusionsMulti-modal spatio-temporal profiling demonstrates that LAMs disproportionately accumulate in CLS and are preceded by a transition-state macrophage phenotype with monocytic origins.

    "abstract": "Double emulsion droplets (DEs) are water/oil/water droplets that can be sorted via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), allowing for new opportunities in high-throughput cellular analysis, enzymatic screening, and synthetic biology. These applications require stable, uniform droplets with predictable microreactor volumes. However, predicting DE droplet size, shell thickness, and stability as a function of flow rate has remained challenging for monodisperse single core droplets and those containing biologically-relevant buffers, which influence bulk and interfacial properties. As a result, developing novel DE-based bioassays has typically required extensive initial optimization of flow rates to find conditions that produce stable droplets of the desired size and shell thickness. To address this challenge, we conducted systematic size parameterization quantifying how differences in flow rates and buffer properties (viscosity and interfacial tension at water/oil interfaces) alter droplet size and stability, across 6 inner aqueous buffers used across applications such as cellular lysis, microbial growth, and drug delivery, quantifying the size and shell thickness of >22,000 droplets overall. We restricted our study to stable single core droplets generated in a 2-step dripping-dripping formation regime in a straightforward PDMS device. Using data from 138 unique conditions (flow rates and buffer composition), we also demonstrated that a recent physically-derived size law of Wang et al1 can accurately predict double emulsion shell thickness for >95% of observations. Finally, we validated the utility of this size law by using it to accurately predict droplet sizes for a novel bioassay that requires encapsulating growth media for bacteria in droplets. This work has the potential to enable new screening-based biological applications by simplifying novel DE bioassay development.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a tightly coordinated response against bacterial and viral infections, triggered by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COVID-19 disease, characterized by an inflammatory response mediated through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which results in the production of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 along with pyroptotic cell death. The NLRP3 inflammasome could be also triggered by sterile danger signals such as extracellular ATP triggering the purinergic P2X7 receptor. Severe inflammation in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is associated with pneumonia, hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, these being the causes of death associated with COVID-19. Both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3 have been considered as potential pharmacological targets for treating inflammation in COVID-19. However, there is no experimental evidence of the involvement of the P2X7 receptor during COVID-19 disease. In the present study we determined the concentration of different cytokines and the P2X7 receptor in the plasma of COVID-19 patients and found that along with the increase in IL-6, IL-18 and the IL-1 receptor antagonist in the plasma of COVID-19 patients, there was also an increase in the purinergic P2X7 receptor. Increase in COVID-19 severity and C-reactive protein concentration positively correlated with increased concentration of the P2X7 receptor in the plasma, but not with IL-18 cytokine. The P2X7 receptor was found in the supernatant of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells after inflammasome activation. Therefore, our data suggest that determining levels of the P2X7 receptor in the plasma could be a novel biomarker of COVID-19 severity.",

Lrig3, a transmembrane protein, is expressed in colonic crypt epithelial cells, including the stem, progenitor, and differentiated cell types. Mice missing Lrig3 have a disruption in their cellular census: using a novel Lrig3-/- mouse we demonstrate that Lrig3-/- mice have more cells per crypt, a greater mucosal area, and longer colons compared to wildtype mice, suggesting the expression of Lrig3 is required for both the total number of epithelial cells in the mouse colon, as well as colon length. In addition, we show Lrig3-/- mice have significantly more stem, progenitor, and deep crypt secretory cells, yet harbor a normal complement of enteroendocrine, Tuft, and absorptive cells. Lrig3-/- mice also have a concomitant decrease in phosphorylated Extracellular signal-related kinases, indicating the loss of Lrig3 leads to an expansion of the colonic stem cell compartment, in an Erk-dependent manner. Our study describes the expression of Lrig3 within the colon, defines perturbations in mice lacking Lrig3, and supports a role for Lrig3 in the establishment of both colonic crypt structure and cellular census, defined as the epithelial cell type and number in colon crypts.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483523v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@244c29org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1045457org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d4134org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@83db4e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genomic DNA is continually exposed to endogenous and exogenous factors that promote DNA damage. Eukaryotic genomic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, which present a barrier to accessing and effectively repairing DNA damage. The mechanisms by which DNA repair proteins overcome this barrier to repair DNA damage in the nucleosome and protect genomic stability is unknown. Here, we determine how the base excision repair (BER) endonuclease AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) recognizes and cleaves DNA damage in the nucleosome. Kinetic assays determined that APE1 cleaves solvent-exposed AP sites in the nucleosome with 3 - 6 orders of magnitude higher efficiency than occluded AP sites. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of APE1 bound to a nucleosome containing a solvent-exposed AP site identified that APE1 uses a DNA sculpting mechanism for AP site recognition, where APE1 bends the nucleosomal DNA to access the AP site. Notably, additional biochemical and structural characterization of occluded AP sites identified contacts between the nucleosomal DNA and histone octamer that prevent efficient processing of the AP site by APE1. These findings provide a rationale for the position-dependent activity of BER proteins in the nucleosome and suggests the ability of BER proteins to sculpt nucleosomal DNA drives efficient BER in chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is thought to originate from neural stem cells (NSCs) of the subventricular zone that acquire genetic alterations. In the adult brain, NSCs are largely quiescent, suggesting that deregulation of quiescence maintenance may be a pre-requisite for tumour initiation. Although inactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 is a frequent event in gliomagenesis, whether, or how, it affects quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) remains unclear. Here we show that p53 maintains quiescence by inducing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and that acute p53 deletion in qNSCs results in their premature activation to a proliferative state. Mechanistically, this occurs through direct transcriptional induction of PPARGC1a, which in turn activates PPAR to upregulate FAO genes. Strikingly, dietary supplementation with fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids, natural PPAR ligands, fully restores quiescence of p53-deficient NSCs and delays tumour initiation in a glioblastoma mouse model. Thus, diet can silence glioblastoma driver mutations, with important implications for cancer prevention.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTemozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent active against gliomas with a favorable toxicity profile. It is part of the standard of care in the management of glioblastoma, and is commonly used in low-grade gliomas. In-silico mathematical models can potentially be used to personalize treatments and to accelerate the discovery of optimal drug delivery schemes.\n\nMethodsAgent-based mathematical models fed with either mouse or patient data were developed for the in-silico studies. The experimental test beds used to confirm the results were: mouse glioma models obtained by retroviral expression of EGFR wt or EGFR vIII in primary progenitors from p16/p19 ko mice and grown in vitro and in vivo in orthotopic allografts, and human glioblastoma U251 cells immobilized in alginate microfibers. The patient data used to parametrize the model were obtained from the TCGA/TCIA databases and the TOG clinical study.\n\nResultsSlow growth  virtual murine gliomas benefited from increasing TMZ dose separation in silico. In line with the simulation results, improved survival, reduced toxicity, lower expression of resistance factors and reduction of the tumor mesenchymal component were observed in experimental models subject to long-cycle treatment, particularly in slowly-growing tumors. Tissue analysis after long-cycle TMZ treatments revealed epigenetically-driven changes in tumor phenotype, which could explain the reduction in glioma growth speed. In-silico trials provided support for methods of implementation in human patients.\n\nConclusionsIn-silico simulations, and in-vitro and in-vivo studies show that TMZ administration schedules with increased time between doses may reduce toxicity, delay the appearance of resistances and lead to survival benefits mediated by changes in the tumor phenotype in gliomas.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE STUDYIn-vivo evidence is provided of improvements in survival, resistance, and toxicity from TMZ schemes with long rest periods between doses in slowly-growing GBM mouse models. The results match hypotheses generated in silico using a mathematical model incorporating the main biological features and fed with real patient data. An epigenetically-driven change in tumor phenotype was also revealed experimentally, which could explain the reduction in glioma growth speed under the  long cycle scheme. To determine the extent to which our results hold for human patients, large sets of simulations were performed on virtual patients. These in-silico trials suggest different ways to bring the benefits observed in experimental models into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Adherens junctions are cadherin-based structures critical for cellular architecture. E-cadherin junctions in mature epithelial cell monolayers tether to an apical actomyosin ring to form the zonula adherens (ZA). We have previously shown that the adherens junction protein PLEKHA7 associates with and regulates the function of the core RNA interference (RNAi) component Ago2, specifically at the ZA. However, the mechanism mediating Ago2 recruitment to the ZA remained unexplored. Here, we reveal that this ZA-specific recruitment of Ago2 depends on both the structural and tensile integrity of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. We found that depletion of not only PLEKHA7, but also either of three PLEKHA7-interacting, LIM-domain family proteins, namely LMO7, LIMCH1, and PDLIM1, results in disruption of actomyosin organization and tension, as well as loss of Ago2 junctional localization. These results demonstrate that recruitment of Ago2 to the ZA is sensitive to actomyosin perturbations, introducing the idea of a mechanosensitive RNAi machinery, with potential implications in tissue remodeling and in disease.\n\nSummaryE-cadherin junctions at the zonula adherens recruit the key RNAi component Ago2 through a still unexplored mechanism. The present work shows that junctional recruitment of Ago2 depends on the integrity and tension of the actin cytoskeleton, revealing a mechanosensitive aspect of RNAi.",

Lamin A/C is known to hinder cell migration by limiting nuclear deformation and passage through confining channels, but its role in nuclear deformation and passage through fibrous environments is less clear. We studied cell and nuclear migration through discrete, closely spaced, slender obstacles which mimic the mechanical properties of collagen fibers. Nuclei bypassed slender obstacles while preserving their overall morphology by deforming around them with deep local invaginations of little resisting force. The obstacles did not impede the nuclear trajectory or cause a rupture of the nuclear envelope. Nuclei likewise deformed around single collagen fibers in cells migrating in 3D collagen gels. In contrast to its limiting role in nuclear passage through confining channels, lamin A/C facilitated nuclear deformation and passage through fibrous environments; nuclei in lamin-null (Lmna-/-) cells lost their overall morphology and became entangled on the obstacles. Analogous to surface tension-mediated deformation of a liquid drop, lamin A/C imparts a surface tension on the nucleus that allows nuclear invaginations with little mechanical resistance, preventing nuclear entanglement and allowing nuclear passage through fibrous environments.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) are widely distributed throughout the brain and are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although in recent years, a considerable amount of evidence supports 5-HT2CRs facilitating effect on anxiety behavior, the involvement in learned fear responses and fear extinction is rather unexplored. Here we used a 5-HT2CR knock-out mouse line (2CKO) to gain new insights into the involvement of 5-HT2CRs in the neuronal fear circuitry. Using a cued fear conditioning paradigm, our results revealed that global loss of 5-HT2CRs exclusively accelerates fear extinction, without affecting fear acquisition and fear expression. To investigate the neuronal substrates underlying the extinction enhancing effect, we mapped the immediate-early gene product cFos, a marker for neuronal activity, in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Surprisingly, besides extinction-associated changes, our results revealed alterations in neuronal activity even under basal home cage conditions in specific subregions of the DRN and the BNST in 2CKO mice. Neuronal activity in the dorsal BNST was shifted in an extinction-supporting direction due to 5-HT2CR knock-out. Finally, the assessment of DRN-BNST connectivity using antero- and retrograde tracing techniques uncovered a discrete serotonergic DRC-BNSTad pathway showing increased activity in 2CKO mice. Thus, our results provide new insights for the fear extinction network by revealing a specific serotonergic DRC-BNSTad pathway underlying a 5-HT2CR-sensitive mechanism with high significance in the treatment of PTSD.",

    "abstract": "While the lung bears significant regenerative capacity, severe viral pneumonia can chronically impair lung function by triggering dysplastic remodeling. The connection between these enduring changes and chronic disease remains poorly understood. We recently described the emergence of tuft cells within Krt5+ dysplastic regions after influenza injury. Using bulk and single cell transcriptomics, we characterized and delineated multiple distinct tuft cell populations that arise following influenza clearance. Distinct from intestinal tuft cells which rely on Type 2 immune signals for their expansion, neither IL-25 nor IL-4R signaling are required to drive tuft cell development in dysplastic/injured lungs. Furthermore, tuft cells were also observed upon bleomycin injury, suggesting that their development may be a general response to severe lung injury. While intestinal tuft cells promote growth and differentiation of surrounding epithelial cells, in the lungs of tuft cell deficient mice, Krt5+ dysplasia still occurs, goblet cell production is unchanged, and there remains no appreciable contribution of Krt5+ cells into more regionally appropriate alveolar Type 2 cells. Together, these findings highlight unexpected differences in signals necessary for lung tuft cell amplification and establish a framework for future elucidation of tuft cell functions in pulmonary health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Potentially pre-malignant lesions (PPOLs) are composed of keratinocytes that are either mortal (MPPOL) or immortal (IPPOL) in vitro. We report here that MPPOL, but not generally IPPOL keratinocytes upregulate various extracellular tumor promoting cytokines (interleukins 6 and 8) and prostaglandins E1 (ePGE1) and E2 (ePGE2) relative to normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs). ePGE upregulation in MPPOL was independent of PGE receptor status, associated with some but not all markers of cellular senescence. Nevertheless, ePGE upregulation was dependent on the senescence program, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and partially regulated by hydrocortisone. Following senescence in the absence of p16INK4A ePGEs accumulated in parallel with a subset of tumor promoting cytokine and metalloproteinase (MMP) transcripts all of which were ablated by ectopic telomerase. Surprisingly, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) function was not required for ePGE upregulation and actually increased in expression in IPPOL keratinocytes in line with its recently reported role in telomerase function. Only ePGE1 was dependent on p53 function suggesting that ePGEs 1 and 2 are regulated differently in oral keratinocytes. We show here that ePGE2 stimulates IPPOL keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. Therefore, we propose that MPPOL keratinocytes promote the progression of IPPOL to oral SCC in a pre-cancerous field by supplying PGEs, interleukins and MMPs in a paracrine manner. Our results suggest that the therapeutic targeting of COX-2 might be enhanced by strategies that target keratinocyte senescence.\n\nSimple SummaryThe early treatment of oral cancer is a high priority, as improvements in this area could lead to greater cure rates and reduced disability due to extensive surgery. Oral cancer is very difficult to detect in over 70% of cases as it develops unseen until quite advanced, sometimes rapidly. It has become apparent that there are at least two types of epithelial cells (keratinocytes) found in oral tissue on the road to cancer (premalignant). One type secretes molecules called prostaglandins but the other does not and the former may stimulate the latter to progress to malignancy, either by stimulating their proliferation or encouraging the influx of blood vessels to feed them. Additionally, we have identified regulators of prostaglandin secretion in premalignant oral cells that could be targeted in future therapies such as inducers of cellular senescence, drugs which kill senescent cells (senolytics), steroid metabolism, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.",

    "abstract": "Self-renewing tissues require that a constant number of proliferating cells is maintained over time. This maintenance can be ensured at the single-cell level or the population level. Maintenance at the population level leads to fluctuations in the number of proliferating cells over time. Often, it is assumed that those fluctuations can be reduced by increasing the number of asymmetric divisions, i.e. divisions where only one of the daughter cells remains proliferative. Here, we study a model of cell proliferation that incorporates a stem cell niche of fixed size, and explicitly model the cells inside and outside the niche. We find that in this model fluctuations are minimized when the difference in growth rate between the niche and the rest of the tissue is maximized and all divisions are symmetric divisions, producing either two proliferating or two non-proliferating daughters. We show that this optimal state leaves visible signatures in clone size distributions and could thus be detected experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure is a major source of mortality in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD arises from mutations that ablate expression of the protein dystrophin, which render the plasma membrane unusually fragile and prone to disruption. In DMD patients, repeated mechanical stress leads to membrane damage and cardiomyocyte loss. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) offer the opportunity to study specific mutations in the context of a human cell, but these models can be improved by adding physiologic stressors. We modeled the primary defect underlying DMD by applying equibiaxial mechanical strain to DMD iPSC-CMs. DMD iPSC-CMs demonstrated an increased susceptibility to equibiaxial strain after 2 hours at 10% strain relative to healthy control cells, measured as increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. After 24 hours, both DMD and healthy control iPSC-CMs showed evidence of injury with release of LDH and cardiac troponin T. We exposed iPSC-CMs to recombinant annexin A6, a protein resealing agent, and found reduced LDH and troponin release in DMD and control iPSC-CMs that had been subjected to 24 hour strain at 10%. We used aptamer protein profiling of media collected from DMD and control iPSC-CMs and compared these results to serum protein profiling from DMD patients. We found a strong correlation between the proteins in DMD patient serum and media from DMD iPSC-CMs subjected to mechanical stress. By developing an injury assay that specifically targets an underlying mechanism of injury seen in DMD-related cardiomyopathy, we demonstrated the potential therapeutic efficacy of the protein membrane resealer, recombinant annexin A6, for the treatment of DMD-related cardiomyopathy and general cardiac injury.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is the deadliest bacterial disease globally, threatening the lives of millions every year. New antibiotic therapies that can shorten the duration of treatment, improve cure rates, and impede the development of drug resistance are desperately needed. Here, we used polymeric micelles to encapsulate four second-generation derivatives of the antitubercular drug pretomanid that had previously displayed much better in vivo activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis than pretomanid itself. Because these compounds were relatively hydrophobic, we expected that such micellar formulations would increase drug bioavailability, reduce toxicities, and improve therapeutic outcomes. The polymeric micelles were based on polypept(o)ides (PeptoMicelles) and were stabilized in their hydrophobic core by {pi}-{pi} interactions, allowing the efficient encapsulation of aromatic pretomanid derivatives. The stability of these {pi}-{pi}-stabilized PeptoMicelles was demonstrated in water, blood plasma, and lung surfactant by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and was further supported by prolonged circulation times of several days in the vasculature of zebrafish larvae. The pretomanid derivative with the best in vitro potency against Mycobacterium marinum (\"drug D\") was also the most efficacious PeptoMicelle formulation tested in the zebrafish larvae infection model, almost completely eradicating the bacteria at non-toxic doses. This lead formulation was further assessed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mouse model, which develops human-like necrotic granulomas. Following intravenous administration, the drug D micellar formulation significantly reduced bacterial burden and inflammatory responses in the lungs and spleens of infected mice.",

A common administration route used in clinical trials consists of local injections leading to uncontrolled/sub-optimal delivery. This study reports a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation program on the mechanism of action, efficacy and safety of an easy-to-use patch that concentrates Adipose-derived Stem Cells (ASCs) in a clinical-grade sponge of porcine crosslinked-gelatin. ASCs were prepared from the fat of ischemic patients. Transcriptome and proteome of ASC-patches and ASC monolayers were assessed by microarrays, bio-arrays and mass spectrometry. Tumorigenesis was investigated in immunosuppressed mice according to the European Pharmacopeia. Angiogenesis was assessed in vivo in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model. Efficacy of the ASC-patch was tested in a rat model of ischemic full-thickness skin defect. Cell stability was assessed by luminescence using ASC-patches generated from ASCs stably transduced with firefly luciferase. ASCs from ischemic patients upregulated the transcription of multiple genes involved in skin wound healing when cultured within the ASC-patch formulation. The patch was not only a concentrator, but also a reservoir of both ASC-derived regenerative factors and sponge-derived soluble fragments having healing capacity. The secretome of the ASC-patch promoted dermal fibroblast survival and epidermal epithelialization. No tumor formation was observed in immunodeficient Nude mice subcutaneously transplanted with the ASC-patch. Transplanted patches were early invaded by new vessels in vivo, and a marked angiogenesis was confirmed in two independent animal models. Finally, ASC-patches prepared from syngeneic rats promoted faster healing and re-vascularization of full-thickness skin defects in a rat animal model. Of note, ASCs were viable and locally stable for at least two weeks in vivo. We provide here compelling pre-clinical evidence that patches concentrating ASCs within crosslinked gelatin may represent a convenient and effective tool for the management of chronic wounds.",

    "abstract": "Transcription and DNA damage repair act in a coordinated manner. The scaffolding protein Sin3B serves as a transcriptional corepressor of hundreds of cell-cycle-related genes. However, the role of Sin3B during the DNA damage response still remains unknown. Here, we show that Sin3B depletion delays the resolution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and sensitizes cells to diverse DNA-damaging agents, including cisplatin and doxorubicin. Furthermore, Sin3B is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites and interacts with other DDR proteins. Mechanistically, Sin3B promotes non-homologous end joining DNA repair by directing the accumulation of MDC1 at DBSs. Altogether, our findings impute an unexpected function for the transcriptional co-repressor Sin3B as a gatekeeper of genomic integrity, and point to the inhibition of the Sin3B chromatin modifying complex as a novel therapeutic vulnerability in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "The evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are prompting severe health and environmental issues. While environmental processes are key barriers preventing the spread of ARGs, they are often sources of ARGs at the same time, as ARGs may be required and accumulate in the biological treatment units. An upgrading of environmental biotechnology is imperative and urgent. ARGs confer antibiotic resistance based on the DNA sequences rather than the chemistry of DNA molecules. An ARG can be considered degraded if its sequence was disrupted. Therefore, we present here that CRISPR-Cas immunity, an archaeal and bacterial immune system for eliminating invading foreign DNAs, can be repurposed and tailored for the degradation of ARGs. By deploying an artificial IncP machinery, the designed system, namely VADER, can be successfully delivered via bacterial conjugation. Then, we propose a new sector for ARG degradation to be implemented as a complement to the biological units in the framework of environmental processes. In this endeavor, a prototype conjugation reactor at a 10-mL-scale was devised, and 100% of the target ARG were eliminated in the transconjugated microbes receiving VADER in the reactor. By generating a nexus of synthetic biology and environmental biotechnology, we believe that our work is not only an enterprise for tackling ARG problems but also a potential solution for managing undesired genetic materials in general in the future.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance has been causing severe health problems and leading to millions of deaths in recent years. Environmental processes, especially the wastewater treatment sector, are important to barrier the spread of antibiotic resistance from the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, or civil sewage. However, they have been identified as the source of antibiotic resistance at the same time, as antibiotic resistance with its main cause antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) may be required and accumulate in the biological treatment units, leading to the dissemination of ARGs. Here, we transplanted the CRISPR-Cas system, an immune system via programmable DNA cleavage, to environmental biotechnology for tackling the antibiotic resistance dilemma thereof, and we propose a new sector in environmental processes specialized in ARG removal with a reactor inhabiting the CRISPR-Cas system per se. Our study provides a new angle to resolve public health issues via the implementation of synthetic biology at the process level.",

    "abstract": "Humans and non-human primates can flexibly switch between different arbitrary mappings from sensation to action to solve a cognitive task. It has remained unknown how the brain implements such flexible sensory-motor mapping rules. Here, we uncovered a dynamic reconfiguration of task-specific correlated variability between sensory and motor brain regions. Human participants switched between two rules for reporting visual orientation judgments during fMRI recordings. Rule switches were either signaled explicitly or inferred by the participants from ambiguous cues. We used behavioral modeling to reconstruct the time course of their belief about the active rule. In both contexts, the patterns of correlations between ongoing fluctuations in stimulus- and action-selective activity across visual and action-related brain regions tracked participants belief about the active rule. The rule-specific correlation patterns broke down around the time of behavioral errors. We conclude that internal beliefs about task state are instantiated in brain-wide, selective patterns of correlated variability.",

    "abstract": "Organ- and body-scale cell atlases have the potential to transform our understanding of human biology. To capture the variability present in the population, these atlases must include diverse demographics such as age and ethnicity from both healthy and diseased individuals. The growth in both size and number of single-cell datasets, combined with recent advances in computational techniques, for the first time makes it possible to generate such comprehensive large-scale atlases through integration of multiple datasets. Here, we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) combining 46 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.2 million cells from 444 individuals across health and disease. The HLCA contains a consensus re-annotation of published and newly generated datasets, resolving under- or misannotation of 59% of cells in the original datasets. The HLCA enables recovery of rare cell types, provides consensus marker genes for each cell type, and uncovers gene modules associated with demographic covariates and anatomical location within the respiratory system. To facilitate the use of the HLCA as a reference for single-cell lung research and allow rapid analysis of new data, we provide an interactive web portal to project datasets onto the HLCA. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the HLCA reference for interpreting disease-associated changes. Thus, the HLCA outlines a roadmap for the development and use of organ-scale cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.",

    "abstract": "Nanostructured materials provide an outstanding opportunity to both stimulate and measure cellular processes. In the context of tight junctions, it was previously reported that transient application of a nanotopographic surface over the apical brush border membrane of epithelial monolayers triggers redistribution of ZO-1, claudins, and F-actin that increases paracellular macromolecular flux. In excitable tissues, nanomaterials have been used to apply and measure electrical signals, such action potentials. As a first step towards translating these technologies for use in analysis of epithelial function, we sought to culture monolayers composed of transporting epithelia over nanopillar arrays without perturbing cellular structure or function. Madin-Darby Canine kidney I (MDCK I) cells were cultured on collagen-coated silicon chips with [~]1 m diameter nanopillar arrays. Fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy were used to assess the impact of height on nanopillar-epithelial interactions. Monolayers formed over and were largely unaffected by short nanopillars. These nanopillars were located beneath basal epithelial surfaces and were not preferentially located within lateral intercellular spaces or beneath ZO-1-containing junctions. In contrast, tall nanopillars that exceeded cell height disrupted MDCK I monolayer growth. Cells interacted with, encircled, and extended cytoplasm over the top of tall nanopillars, and dense ZO-1 and F-actin accumulations occasionally surrounded apical membranes adjacent to nanopillars. Finally, when grown over arrays composed of nanopillars 1 - 2 m shorter than cells, MDCK I frequently grew between nanopillars. As a result, nanopillars were more commonly present within lateral intercellular spaces beneath junctions. Apical complex structure was intact, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-2, F-actin, and E-cadherin. Apical microvilli were also unaffected. We therefore show that conditions can be defined to allow growth of mature, correctly assembled epithelial monolayers with nanopillars localized to lateral intercellular spaces. This sets the stage for application of nanotechnologies for perturbation and analysis of epithelial biology.",

    "abstract": "Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in craniofacial abnormalities account for approximately 1/3 of birth defects. The regulatory programs that build and shape the face require precisely controlled spatiotemporal gene expression, achieved through tissue-specific enhancers. Large regions with coactivation of enhancer elements and co-regulation of multiple genes, referred to as superenhancers, are important in determining cell identity and perturbation could result in developmental defects. Building upon a previously published epigenomic atlas of human embryonic craniofacial tissue in which we identified over 75,000 putative embryonic craniofacial enhancer regions, we have identified 531 superenhancer regions unique to embryonic craniofacial tissue, including 37 which fall in completely noncoding regions. To demonstrate the utility of this data for the understanding of craniofacial development and the etiology of craniofacial abnormalities, we focused on a craniofacial-specific superenhancer in a [~]600kb noncoding region located between NPVF and NFE2L3. This region harbors over 100 individual putative craniofacial enhancer segments and 7 in vivo validated craniofacial enhancers from primary craniofacial tissue as well as strong enhancer activation signatures in a culture model of cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) development. However, none of the directly adjacent genes have been implicated in neural crest specification, craniofacial development, or abnormalities. To identify potential regulatory targets of this superenhancer region, we characterized three-dimensional chromatin structure of this region in CNCCs and mouse embryonic craniofacial tissues using multiple techniques (4C-Seq, HiC). We identified long range interactions that exclude most intervening genes and specifically target the anterior portion of the HOXA gene cluster located 1.2 to 1.8 Mb away. We demonstrate the specificity of the enhancer region for regulation of anterior HOXA genes through CRISPR/Cas9 editing of human embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for deletion of the superenhancer confirm the specificity of the enhancer region and demonstrate that the region is essential for viability. At fetal stages homozygotes develop at the same rate as heterozygous and wild type littermates but die at P0-P1 and have high penetrance of orofacial clefts that phenocopy previously described Hoxa2-/- mice. Moreover, we identified a de novo deletion partially overlapping the superenhancer in a human fetus with severe craniofacial abnormalities. This evidence suggests we have identified a critical noncoding locus control region that specifically regulates anterior HOXA genes and whose deletion is likely pathogenic in human patients.",

    "abstract": "Clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) proteins act as cell-surface recognition barcodes for neural circuit formation. Neurites expressing the same barcode repel each other, but this mechanism is deployed in two different ways. For instance, convergence of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) projections requires stochastic expression of distinct Pcdh isoforms in individual cells, while tiling of neural arbors of serotonergic neurons (5-HTs) requires expression of the same isoform, Pcdhc2. Despite their essential role, however, the molecular mechanisms of cell-type specific Pcdh barcoding remain a mystery. Here, we uncover a new role of cohesin: that of regulating distance-independent enhancer-promoter interactions to enable random Pcdh isoform choice via DNA loop extrusion in OSNs. Remarkably, this step mediates DNA demethylation of Pcdh promoters and their CTCF binding sites, thus directing CTCF to the chosen promoter. In contrast, the uniform pattern of Pcdh expression in 5-HTs is achieved through conventional cohesin-independent, distance-dependent enhancer/promoter interactions, that favor choice of the nearest isoform. Thus, cell-type specific cohesin deployment converts a distance-dependent and deterministic regulatory logic into a distance-independent and stochastic one. We propose that this mechanism provides an elegant strategy to achieve distinct patterns of Pcdh expression that generate wiring instructions to meet the connectivity requirements of different neural classes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTerpenoids form a large pool of highly diverse organic compounds possessing several economically important properties, including nutritional, aromatic, and pharmacological properties. The DXP pathways end enzyme, nuclear distribution protein (NudF), interacting with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), is critical for the synthesis of isoprenol/prenol/downstream compounds. The enzyme is yet to be thoroughly investigated to increase the overall yield of terpenoids in the Bacillus subtilis, which is widely used in industry and is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) bacterium. The study aims to analyze the evolutionary conservation across the active site, and map the key residues for mutagenesis studies. The study would allow us customize the metabolic load towards the synthesis of prenol or isoprenol or any of the downstream molecules.\n\nResultsThe 37-sequence dataset, extracted from 103 Bacillus subtilis entries, show a high phylogenetic divergence, and only six one-motif sequences ASB92783.1, ASB69297.1, ASB56714.1, AOR97677.1, AOL97023.1, and OAZ71765.1 show monophyly relationship, unlike a complete polyphyly relationship between the other 31 three-motif sequences. Further, only 47 of 179 residues of the representative sequence CUB50584.1 are observed to be significantly conserved. Docking analysis shows a preferential bias of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase towards IPP, and a nearly 3-fold energetic difference is observed between IPP and DMAPP. Computational saturation mutagenesis of the seven hotspot residues identifies two key positions LYS78 and PHE116, encoded within loop1 and loop7, majorly interact with the ligands DMAPP and IPP, and their mutants K78I/K78L and PHE116D/PHE116E are found to stabilize the overall conformation. The loops are hereby shown to play a regulatory role in guiding the promiscuity of NudF towards a specific ligand.\n\nConclusionThe study map the phylogenetic relationship between the 37 representative B.subtiis NudF sequences, and through sequence conservation, structural contact map, topological flexibility, and saturation mutagenesis of the active site residues, the essential residues regulating the interaction of NudF with IPP/DMAPP are deciphered. The study robustly screens its mutational landscape and localizes the two crucial residues LYS78 and PHE116 for directing the mutagenesis studies. The preliminary docking and simulation results also suggest a preferential bias of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase towards IPP over DMAPP. The findings would pave the way for the development of novel enzyme variants with highly improved catalytic ability for the large-scale bioproduction of specific terpenoids with significant neutraceutical or commercial value.",

    "abstract": "Acquired brain injuries due to trauma damage cortical vasculature, which in turn impairs blood flow to injured tissues. There are reports of vascular morphological recovery following traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the remodeling process has not been examined longitudinally in detail after injury in vivo. Understanding the dynamic processes that influence recovery is thus critically important. We evaluated the longitudinal and dynamic microvascular recovery and remodeling up to 2 months post injury using live brain miniscope and 2-photon microscopic imaging. The new imaging approaches captured dynamic morphological and functional recovery processes at high spatial and temporal resolution in vivo. Vessel painting documented the initial loss and subsequent temporal morphological vascular recovery at the injury site. Miniscopes were used to longitudinally image the temporal dynamics of vascular repair in vivo after brain injury in individual mice across each cohort. We observe near-immediate nascent growth of new vessels in and adjacent to the injury site that peaks between 14-21 days post injury. 2-photon microscopy confirms new vascular growth and further demonstrates differences between cortical layers after cortical injury: large vessels persist in deeper cortical layers (>200 m), while superficial layers exhibit a dense plexus of fine (and often non-perfused) vessels displaying regrowth. Functionally, blood flow increases mirror increasing vascular density. Filopodia development and endothelial sprouting is measurable within 3 days post injury that rapidly transforms regions devoid of vessels to dense vascular plexus in which new vessels become increasingly perfused. Within 7 days post injury, blood flow is observed in these nascent vessels. Behavioral analysis reveals improved vascular modulation after 9 days post injury, consistent with vascular regrowth. We conclude that morphological recovery events are closely linked to functional recovery of blood flow to the compromised tissues, which subsequently leads to improved behavioral outcomes.",

Additionally, we explored the existence of cytotype-specific root anatomical traits, which could influence fungal recruitment and establishment. Salicornia spp. were identified based on their ploidy level. The root-associated fungal microbiome of Salicornia was analyzed using high throughput amplicon sequencing (ITS1 of rDNA) in spring and summer. The following root anatomical traits were investigated: maximum root diameter, periderma thickness, parenchyma thickness, diameter of the vascular cylinder and maximum diameter of parenchyma cells. Our results showed that Shannon diversity and evenness indices were higher in samples of Salicornia procumbens (4x) compared to those of S. europaea (2x), and in summer the root-associated fungal community of S. procumbens (4x) was significantly different from that of S. europaea (2x). The orders Xylariales, Malasseziales and Pleosporales were the most frequent root colonizers in both cytotypes and most of the taxa associated with Salicornia were functionally classified as saprophytes or plant pathogens. Finally, we observed larger periderma and parenchyma layers in S. procumbens (4x) than S. europaea (2x) that may contribute to the observed differences in community composition between the two cytotypes. Our results suggest that differences in ploidy may modulate plant interaction with fungi by affecting species recruitment and microbiome structure. In addition, cytotype-specific root traits may also have the potential to affect differently community assembly in the two cytotypes.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis holds great promises as an efficient and noninvasive method to monitor not only the presence and biomass of organisms but also their spawning activity. In eDNA analysis-based monitoring of spawning activity, the detection of sperm-derived eDNA is a key point; however, its characteristics and dynamics are completely unknown. The present study focuses on the persistence and particle size distribution (PSD) of eDNA derived from the sperm of Japanese jack mackerel. First, we investigated the time-dependent degradation and the PSD of sperm-derived eDNA by artificially adding sperm to fish eDNA-free seawater. Next, we kept fish in tanks and examined the changes in DNA concentration and PSD before and after spawning. The data obtained from the two experiments showed that the degradation of sperm-derived eDNA proceeded rapidly, with PSD shifting to a smaller size, regardless of the DNA region (Cyt b or ITS1). Additionally, it was shown that the nuclei and mitochondria released from sperm through degradation had a size distribution that was not simply dependent on each organelle size. The results of this study will contribute to elucidating the characteristics and dynamics of eDNA specifically during the spawning season and to further developing eDNA analysis as a powerful tool for the monitoring of spawning activity.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483695v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15a91e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1212566org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e5e95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d39a36_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The development of multiple high-quality reference genome sequences in many taxonomic groups has yielded a high-resolution view of the patterns and processes of molecular evolution. Nonetheless, leveraging information across multiple reference haplotypes remains a significant challenge in nearly all eukaryotic systems. These challenges range from studying the evolution of chromosome structure, to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, to testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation in nature. Here, we address these challenges through the concept of a pan-genome annotation, where conserved gene order is used to restrict gene families and define the expected physical position of all genes that share a common ancestor among multiple genome annotations. By leveraging pan-genome annotations and exploring the underlying syntenic relationships among genomes, we dissect presence-absence and structural variation at four levels of biological organization: among three tetraploid cotton species, across 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic pan-genome annotations in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred and other complex genomes.",

Yet, when congregating into large mating swarms, these fireflies transition into predictability, synchronizing with their neighbors with a rhythmic periodicity. Here we propose a mechanism for emergence of synchrony and periodicity, and formulate the principle in a mathematical framework. Remarkably, with no fitting parameters, analytic predictions from this simple principle and framework agree strikingly well with data. Next, we add further sophistication to the framework using a computational approach featuring groups of random oscillators via integrate-and-fire interactions controlled by a tunable parameter. This agent-based framework of P. carolinus fireflies interacting in swarms of increasing density also shows quantitatively similar phenomenology and reduces to the analytic framework in the appropriate limit of the tunable coupling strength. We discuss our findings and note that the resulting dynamics follow the style of a decentralized follow-the-leader synchronization, where any of the randomly flashing individuals may take the role of the leader of any subsequent synchronized flash burst.",

In the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, MRCK1 is required for the activation of myosin, leading to the development of cortical tension, apical constriction and early gastrulation. Here, we present the structure, conformation, and membrane-binding properties of C. elegans MRCK1. MRCK1 forms an obligate homodimer with N-terminal kinase domains, a parallel coiled-coil of 55 nm, and a C-terminal tripartite module of C1, PH and CNH domains. High-throughput liposome binding assays indicate binding to specific phosphoinositides, while the C-terminal Cdc42-binding (CRIB) motif binds specifically to activated Cdc42. The length of the coiled-coil domain of MRCK, as well as those of the related DMPK kinases ROCK, CRIK and DMPK, is remarkably conserved over millions of years of evolution, suggesting that they may function as molecular rulers to precisely position kinase activity at a fixed distance from the membrane.",

    "abstract": "Myofibroblasts are a highly secretory and contractile phenotype most commonly identified by the de novo expression and assembly of alpha-smooth muscle actin stress fibers. Traditionally, this activation process has been thought of as a binary process, with cells being labeled as \"activated\" or \"quiescent (non-activated)\". More recently, this view has been expanded to consider activation on a continuous spectrum. However, there is no established method to quantify a cells position on this spectrum, and as a result, the binary labeling system is still widely used. While transcriptomic analyses provide a continuous measure of myofibroblast markers, a faster and more facile screening method is needed. To this end, we utilized optical microscopy and machine learning methods to quantify myofibroblast activation on a spectrum. We first measured size and shape features of over 1,000 individual cardiac fibroblasts and found that these features provide enough information to predict activation state, on the binary scale, with 94% accuracy as compared to manual classification. We next performed dimensionality reduction techniques on these features to create a continuous scale of activation. Importantly, this new classification system captures a range of fibroblast activation states, but still possesses inherent bias due to choice of morphological features. Thus, we next used self-supervised machine learning to create a second continuous labeling system free from biases associated with the manually measured features. Lastly, we compared our findings for mechanically activated cardiac fibroblasts to a distribution of cell phenotypes generated from transcriptomic data using single-cell RNA sequencing. Altogether, these results demonstrate a continuous spectrum of activation from fibroblast to myofibroblast and provide a strategy to quantify a cells position on that spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is a highly stereotyped phenomenon, requiring robust spatial and temporal coordination of neural activity. How the brain coordinates neural activity with sleep onset can provide insight into the physiological functions subserved by sleep and pathologic phenomena associated with sleep onset. We quantified whole-brain network changes in synchrony and information flow during the transition from wake to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep using magnetoencephalography imaging in healthy subjects. In addition, we performed computational modeling to infer excitatory and inhibitory properties of local neural activity. The sleep transition was identified to be encoded in spatially and temporally specific patterns of local and long-range neural synchrony. Patterns of information flow revealed that mesial frontal regions receive hierarchically organized inputs from broad cortical regions upon sleep onset. Finally, biophysical neural mass modeling demonstrated spatially heterogeneous properties of cortical excitation-to-inhibition from wake to NREM. Together, these findings reveal whole-brain corticocortical structure in the sleep-wake transition and demonstrate the orchestration of local and long-range, frequency-specific cortical interactions that are fundamental to sleep onset.",

    "abstract": "Bioinformatics pipelines designed for paired analysis of tumour and matched normal samples use germline variants detected from normal tissue samples to identify bona fide tumour somatic mutations. Unexpected contamination of normal samples with tumour cells can lead to the subtraction of genuine somatic variants, reducing variant detection sensitivity and compromising downstream analyses. Leveraging the power of whole-genome sequencing data available from the 100,000 Genomes Project at Genomics England, we developed the Tumour in Normal Contamination (TINC) tool for TIN contamination assessment. TINC was validated in silico using patient-derived whole-genome samples (R2 = 0.95; p < 2.2 x 10-16 and R2 = 0.85; p < 3. 3 x 10-13 for expected versus observed contamination in two tumour types), and against orthogonal minimal residual disease (MRD) testing with 70 leukaemia samples. From a systematic review of whole-genome data available for 771 patients with haematological malignancies and sarcomas, we found TIN contamination (>1%) across a range of cancer clinical indications and DNA sources. The highest prevalence was among saliva samples from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients (43/114 samples, 38%), and sorted CD3+ T cells from myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) patients (22/24 samples, 91%). Further exploration of genomic data for AML and MPN patients has revealed 108 hotspot mutations in genes with high prevalence of somatic alterations in haematological cancers (JAK2, FLT3, DNMT3A, TP53, KIT, NRAS and IDH2), 27 of which supported by at least 5% of reads in the normal sample and therefore at risk of being subtracted by standard pipeline for somatic variant calling. Our work highlights the importance of contamination assessment for accurate detection of somatic variants in both research and clinical settings. TINC allows accurate and highly sensitive quantification of contamination levels, giving confidence in the validity of the whole genome assessment of the tumour. We propose this to become an essential metric in clinic practice alongside other routine quality control measures, especially as large-scale pan-cancer sequencing projects are adopted to deliver accurate data from which to make clinical decisions for patient care.",

Specifically, we adopted a recently proposed dynamic extension of graph curvature to extract features of the non-Euclidean, multiscale structure of genomic networks. We propose a hierarchical clustering approach to reveal preferential gene clustering according to their geometric cooperation which captured the characteristic EWSR1-FLI1 fusion in Ewing sarcoma. We also performed in silico edge perturbations to assess systemic response to simulated interventions quantified by changes in curvature. These results demonstrate that geometric network-based features can be useful for identifying non-trivial gene associations in an agnostic manner.",

However, the current physical understanding of the mechanical responses of TGTs remains limited, which restricts the range of information that can be extracted from experimental observations. In order to provide quantitative in-depth understanding and interpretation of experimental observations, in this work, we quantified the tension-dependent lifetime of TGTs from which the mechanical stability of TGTs under various physiologically relevant stretching conditions can be derived.

    "abstract": "The von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder, caused by defects of the von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a large extracellular protein in charge of adhering platelets at sites of vascular lesion. vWF carries out this essential homeostatic task, via the specific protein-protein interaction between the vWF A1 domain and the platelet receptor, the glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIB). Upon the vWF activation triggered by the shear of the flowing blood. The two naturally occurring mutations G1324A and G1324S at the A1 domain, near the GPIB binding site, result in a dramatic decrease of platelets adhesion, a bleeding disorder classified as type 2M vWD. However, it remained unclear how these two supposedly minor modifications lead to this drastic phenotypic response. We addressed this question using a combination of equilibrium-molecular dynamics (MD) and non-equilibrium MD-based free energy simulations. Our data confirm that both mutations maintain the highly stable Rossmann fold of the vWF A1 domain. These mutations locally diminished the flexibility of the binding site to GPIB and induced a conformational change that affected the nearby secondary structure elements. Furthermore, we observed two significant changes in the vWF A1 domain upon mutation, the global redistribution of the internal mechanical stress and the increased thermodynamic stability of the A1 domain. These observations are consistent with previously-reported mutation-augmented melting temperatures. Overall, our results support the idea of thermodynamic conformational restriction of A1-- before the binding to GPIB--as a crucial factor determining the loss-of-function of the G1324A(S) vWD mutants.",

    "abstract": "Amatoxins are a group of highly toxic peptides, which include - and {beta}-amanitin, found in several species of mushrooms (e.g. Amanita phalloides). Due to their high hepatotoxicity, they account for most deaths occurring after mushrooms ingestion. The determination of - and {beta}- amanitin content in wild mushrooms is invaluable for treating cases involving poisoning. In the present study, we have developed and validated an analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography, with in-line ultraviolet and electrochemical detection (HPLC-UV-EC), for the rapid quantification of - and {beta}-amanitin in wild mushroom samples collected from the Inner Center of Portugal. A reproducible and simple solid-phase extraction (SPE) using OASIS(R) PRIME HLB cartridges was used for sample pre-treatment, followed by chromatographic separation based on the RP-C18 column. The UV and EC chromatograms of - and {beta}-amanitin were recorded at 305 nm and +0.600 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The linear quantification for both amanitins was in the range of 0.5-20.0 g{middle dot}mL-1 (R2 > 0.999). The LOD, calculated based on the calibration curve, was similar for UV and EC detection (0.12-0.33 g ml.-1). Intra-day and inter-day precision were less than 13%, and the recovery ratios ranged from 89% to 117%. Nine Amanita species and five edible mushrooms were analysed by HPLC-UV-EC, and HPLC-DAD-MS confirmed the identification of amatoxins. We find high - and {beta}-amanitin content in A. phalloides and not in the other species analysed. In sum, the developed and validated method provides a simple and fast analysis of - and {beta}-amanitins contents in wild mushrooms and is suitable for screening and routine assessment of mushroom intoxication.\n\nHighlightsO_LINew validated method using HPLC-UV-EC to determine - and {beta}-amanitin in wild mushrooms.\nC_LIO_LIReproducible and fast SPE procedure for small samples.\nC_LIO_LIEffective sample pre-treatment with the OASIS(R) PRIME HLB SPE cartridge.\nC_LIO_LIIdentification and quantification of - and {beta}-amanitin in wild mushroom samples from Portugal.\nC_LIO_LIHPLC-DAD-MS confirmation of amatoxins present in mushroom samples.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483521v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@734f7aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66d9fforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@720f39org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@458e64_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Mutational studies in several model species, including barley, have resolved multiple loci regulating cuticular metabolism and development. Of particular importance are the eceriferum (cer) mutants characterized by visual alterations in cuticular wax. In barley, some cer mutants, such as cer-x lines, show defects in the distinctive {beta}-diketone-enriched wax bloom on reproductive stage leaf sheaths, stems and spikes. In our study we exploited extensive allelic populations, near-isogenic lines and powerful genotyping platforms to identify variation in the HvWAX INDUCER1 (HvWIN1) gene as causal for cer-x mutants. We show that HvWIN1 function reduces cuticular permeability, promotes the accumulation of {beta}-diketones, and regulates cuticular metabolic gene expression. Analyses across the barley pangenome and hundreds of exome-capture datasets revealed high sequence conservation of HvWIN1 but also two non-synonymous variants exclusive to cultivated germplasm. Taken together, we suggest that variation in HvWIN1 controls multiple cuticular features in barley by controlling the expression of genes involved in cuticle development.",

We aimed to develop a QSP framework to evaluate the effects of metformin-associated autophagy-induction in combination with antibiotics.\n\nMethodsA QSP framework for autophagy was developed by extending a model for host-immune response to include AMPK-mTOR-autophagy signalling. This model was combined with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models for metformin and antibiotics against Mtb. We compared the model predictions to mice infection experiments, and derived predictions for pathogen and host-associated dynamics in humans treated with metformin in combination with antibiotics.\n\nResultsThe model adequately captured the observed bacterial load dynamics in mice Mtb infection models treated with metformin. Simulations for adjunctive metformin therapy in newly diagnosed patients suggested a limited yet dose-dependent effect of metformin on reducing the intracellular bacterial load and selected pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our predictions suggest that metformin may provide beneficiary effects when overall bacterial load, or extracellular-to-intracellular bacterial ratio is low, either early after infection or late during antibiotic treatment.\n\nConclusionsWe present the first QSP framework for HDTs against Mtb, linking cellular-level autophagy effects to disease progression. This framework may be extended to guide design of HDTs against Mtb.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play a central role in Alzheimers Disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the mechanism by which these processes lead to neurodegeneration is still not fully understood. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is an antioxidant protein that can be cleaved into a peptide known as Thioredoxin-80 (Trx80), which modulates monocyte function in the periphery and shows anti-amyloidogenic properties in the brain. In this study we aimed to further clarify the biological function of this peptide and its regulation in the brain. We show that neurons are the main producers of Trx80 in the brain. Trx80 levels increase in vivo both in normal aging and in young APPNL-G-F mouse model of amyloid pathology. Trx80 levels were increased in neurons in primary culture treated with either rotenone or 27-hydroxycholesterol, what suggests that Trx80 production is stimulated upon oxidative stress. RNA-sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis revealed that Trx80 induces microglia activation into a phenotype compatible with interferon response microglia. Finally, we determine that the induction of this microglia phenotype by Trx80 is Trem2-dependent. This study identifies Trx80 as a novel neuron-derived signaling mechanism that modulates microglia function under stress conditions. Strategies to regulate Trx80 levels could be beneficial against AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The choroid plexus (ChP) of the cerebral ventricles is a source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and also plays a key role in immune surveillance at the level of blood-to-CSF-barrier (BCSFB). In this study, we quantify ChP blood perfusion and BCSFB mediated water exchange from arterial blood into ventricular CSF using non-invasive continuous arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging (CASL-MRI). Systemic administration of anti-diuretic hormone (vasopressin) was used to validate BCSFB mediated water exchange as a metric of choroidal CSF secretory function. To further investigate the coupling between ChP perfusion and CSF secretory function, we characterized the effects of two anesthetic regimens known to have large-scale differential effects on cerebral blood flow. For quantification of ChP blood perfusion a multi-compartment perfusion model was employed, and we discovered that partial volume correction improved measurement accuracy. Vasopressin significantly reduced both ChP blood perfusion and CSF secretory function. ChP perfusion was significantly higher with pure isoflurane anesthesia (2-2.5%) when compared to a balanced anesthesia with dexmedetomidine and low-dose isoflurane (1.0 %), however there was no significant difference in BCSFB water secretory function. In summary, here we introduce a non-invasive, robust, and spatially resolved in vivo imaging platform to quantify ChP perfusion as well as BCSFB water secretory function which can be applied to study coupling of these two key parameters in future clinical translational studies.",

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering generates an atlas containing 113 clusters. While the male and female neurons overlap in UMAP space, more than half the UMAP clusters have sex-differences in neuron number, and nearly all clusters display sex-differential expression. Based on an examination of enriched marker genes, we annotate clusters as circadian clock neurons, mushroom body Kenyon cell neurons, neurotransmitter- and/or neuropeptide-producing, and those that express doublesex. Enriched marker gene analyses also shows that genes that encode members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, transcription factors, neuropeptides, neuropeptide receptors, and Wnts have unique patterns of enriched expression across the clusters. In vivo spatial gene-expression links to the UMAP clusters are provided. A functional analysis of fru P1 circadian neurons shows they have dimorphic roles in sleep/activity and period length. Given that most clusters are comprised of male and female neurons indicates that the sexes have fru P1 neurons with common gene expression programs. Sex-specific expression is overlaid on this program, to build the potential for vastly different sex-specific behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Our reactions to the sensory world depend on context. For instance, explicit directions to search for a particular object or feature will induce a different treatment of the sensory world than exploration without a fixed goal. To understand how we navigate the sensory world, it is necessary to understand how both directed search and undirected exploration are produced by the brain. The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) in the posterior parietal cortex has an established role in visual stimulus selection. However, most studies of LIPs role in stimulus selection focus primarily on highly trained, directed tasks, in which animals are given explicit cues as to which stimulus they should select. Here, we compare neural activity in LIP across two tasks. In one task, the animal is given an explicit direction to select one of two natural images from an array; in the other, the animal is allowed to choose an image freely based on their innate preferences. We find that LIP reliably encodes the eye movement prior to its execution only in the directed task, while the eye movement encoding in the undirected task emerges significantly later. Further, LIPs encoding of the images behavioral relevance emerges after the decision in both tasks. These results indicate that LIP preferentially supports stimulus selection in highly trained and directed behaviors, as opposed to free behavior.",

Strikingly, we also detect pervasive neuronal ambient RNA contamination in all glial cell types unless glia and neurons are physically separated prior to sequencing. We demonstrate that this contamination can be removed in silico. We also show that previous annotations of immature oligodendrocytes are likely glial cells contaminated with ambient RNAs. After ambient RNA removal, we detect extremely rare, committed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which were infrequently annotated in previous adult human brain datasets.

Contrasting with this role, retina and terminally differentiated photoreceptor cells express high levels of MSI1 and MSI2, indicating that the two proteins have a role unrelated to maintaining undifferentiated cell state. Here we show that the Musashi proteins are essential in mature photoreceptors. Combined knockout of Msi1 and Msi2 lead to loss of the retina response to light and progressive photoreceptor cell death. The two proteins are fully redundant as individual deletion of Msi1 or Msi2 did not produce a phenotype. To define the molecular functions underlying the requirement for Musashi in photoreceptors, we delineated their RNA targets and analyzed the effect of the combined Msi1/Msi2 knockout on transcript levels, pre-mRNA splicing, and protein expressions. We show distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic functions for the Musashi proteins in photoreceptor cells. In the nucleus, Musashi binding to the downstream proximal intron promotes splicing of alternative exons. Surprisingly, four conserved photoreceptor-specific alternative exons in genes critical for vision proved to be dispensable, leaving open questions about the selective pressures that lead to the conservation of these exons and the contribution of alternative splicing to the phenotype of the Musashi knockout. In the photoreceptor cell cytoplasm MSI1 and MSI2 act as activators of protein expression. The combined knockout of Msi1 and Msi2 reduced the levels of multiple proteins including proteins required for vision and photoreceptor survival.",

    "abstract": "During deliberation, as the brain considers its options, the neural activity representing the goodness of each option rises toward a threshold, and the choice is often dictated by the option for which the rise is fastest. Here we report a surprising correlate of these activities: saccade vigor. We engaged human subjects in a decision-making task in which they considered effortful options, each requiring walking various durations and inclines. As they deliberated, they made saccades between the symbolic representations of those options. These saccades had no bearing on the effort that they would later expend, yet as they deliberated, saccade velocities increased. The rate of rise in vigor was faster for saccades toward the option that they later indicated as their choice, and encoded the difference in the subjective value of the two effortful options. Once deliberation ended, following a brief delay the subjects indicated their choice by making another saccade. Remarkably, vigor for this saccade dropped to baseline and no longer encoded subjective value. These results are consistent with an urgency model of decision-making in which a global signal in the brain drives both the neural circuits that make decisions, and the neural circuits that make movements. Paradoxically, this common drive is shared between the oculomotor circuits and the decision-making circuits, even when the decision involves effortful expenditure during a future event.\n\nSignificanceThere is a link between the decisions we make and the movements that follow. Not only do we prefer options of greater value, but we also move faster to acquire them. When deliberating between options, neural activity rises to a threshold and the option that wins this race is the one chosen. We report a potential correlate of this in the motor control circuits; during deliberation, saccade vigor to both options rise, but faster for the option ultimately chosen. Thus, our movements appear to mirror the neural activity conducting the decision-making process. Paradoxically, this is true even when the movements have no direct bearing on the decision at hand.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the directed connectivity that underlie networked activity between different cortical areas is critical for understanding the neural mechanisms behind sensory processing. Granger causality (GC) is widely used for this purpose in functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis, but there the temporal resolution is low, making it difficult to capture the millisecond-scale interactions underlying sensory processing. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has millisecond resolution, but only provides low-dimensional sensor-level linear mixtures of neural sources, which makes GC inference challenging. Conventional methods proceed in two stages: First, cortical sources are estimated from MEG using a source localization technique, followed by GC inference among the estimated sources. However, the spatiotemporal biases in estimating sources propagate into the subsequent GC analysis stage, may result in both false alarms and missing true GC links. Here, we introduce the Network Localized Granger Causality (NLGC) inference paradigm, which models the source dynamics as latent sparse multivariate autoregressive processes and estimates their parameters directly from the MEG measurements, integrated with source localization, and employs the resulting parameter estimates to produce a precise statistical characterization of the detected GC links. We offer several theoretical and algorithmic innovations within NLGC and further examine its utility via comprehensive simulations and application to MEG data from an auditory task involving tone processing from both younger and older participants. Our simulation studies reveal that NLGC is markedly robust with respect to model mismatch, network size, and low signal-to-noise ratio, whereas the conventional two-stage methods result in high false alarms and mis-detections. We also demonstrate the advantages of NLGC in revealing the cortical network-level characterization of neural activity during tone processing and resting state by delineating task- and age-related connectivity changes.",

    "abstract": "Morreton virus (MORV) is a novel oncolytic Vesiculovirus, genetically distinct from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). we report that MORV induced potent cytopathic effects in a panel of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. In addition, high intranasal doses of MORV were not associated with significant adverse effects and were well tolerated in mice bearing liver tumor xenografts and syngeneic liver cancers. Furthermore, single intratumoral treatments with MORV (1 x 107 TCID50) triggered a robust antitumor immune response leading to substantial tumor regression and disease control in a syngeneic CCA model, using 10-fold lower dose compared to VSV (1 x 108 TCID50). In addition, MORV and VSV both induced prominent tumor growth delay in immunodeficient mice bearing Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but not in mice bearing HuCCT-1 CCA xenografts. Our findings indicate that wild-type MORV is safe and can induce potent tumor regression in HCC and CCA animal models without adverse events via immune-mediated and immune-independent mechanisms. Further development and clinical translation of MORV as virotherapy for liver cancers are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Patients with mutations in HOIL1 experience a complex immune disorder including intestinal inflammation. To investigate the role of HOIL1 in regulating intestinal inflammation, we employed a mouse model of HOIL1 deficiency. The ileum of Hoil1-/- mice displayed features of type 2 inflammation including tuft cell and goblet cell hyperplasia, and elevated expression of Il13, Il5 and Il25 mRNA. Inflammation persisted in the absence of T and B cells, and bone marrow chimeric mice revealed a requirement for HOIL1 expression in radiation-resistant cells to regulate inflammation. Although disruption of IL-4 receptor alpha (IL4R) signaling on intestinal epithelial cells ameliorated tuft and goblet cell hyperplasia, expression of Il5 and Il13 mRNA remained elevated. KLRG1hi CD90lo group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) were increased independent of IL4R signaling, tuft cell hyperplasia and IL-25 induction. Antibiotic treatment dampened intestinal inflammation indicating commensal microbes as a contributing factor. We have identified a key role for HOIL1, a component of the Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex, in regulating type 2 inflammation in the small intestine. Understanding the mechanism by which HOIL1 regulates type 2 inflammation will advance our understanding of intestinal homeostasis and inflammatory disorders and may lead to the identification of new targets for treatment.",

Convalescent sera as well as sera obtained from participants who received two or three doses of mRNA vaccines (Moderna-mRNA-1273(R) or Pfizer-BNT162b2(R)) were used for comparison in this study. Our data demonstrate that both the Delta as well as Omicron variants exhibit higher affinity for the receptor ACE2, facilitating infection and causing antibody escape by receptor affinity (affinity escape), due to reduced ability of antibodies to compete with RBD-receptor interaction and virus neutralization. In contrast, only Omicron but not Delta variant escaped antibody recognition, most likely because only Omicron exhibit the mutation at position E484 associated with reduced recognition, resulting in further reduced neutralization (specificity escape). Nevertheless, the immunizations with RNA based vaccines resulted in marked viral neutralization in vitro for all strains, compatible with the fact that Omicron is still largely susceptible to vaccination-induced antibodies, despite affinity- and specificity escape.",

    "abstract": "Previous transcriptional profiling of the enteropathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis during persistent stages of colonisation of mouse cecal lymphoid follicles indicated the possible involvement of biofilm in infection maintenance. Not much is known about the mechanisms responsible for biofilm formation by this pathogen, and most current knowledge is based on results of experiments conducted using the related Y. pestis pathogen that forms biofilm in the flea gut. In this study, we performed transcriptional profiling of Y. pseudotuberculosis in biofilms from different biofilm-inducing conditions, bile exposure, amino acid deprivation and in vivo mimicking conditions with and without oxygen. The comparison of differential expression of genes in biofilm versus planktonic bacteria showed a set of 54 core genes that were similarly regulated, independent of inducing condition. This set included many genes that were previously shown to be associated with biofilms, such as hutG, hsmF, hmsT and cpxP that were upreg-ulated and other genes such as hmsP and rfaH that were downregulated. There were also novel biofilm-associated genes, including genes encoding hypothetical proteins. To identify the genes involved in inducing biofilm formation, the gene expression of bacteria during an early initial phase when biofilm starts to form after induction by bile or amino acid depletion was determined. Comparisons of the resulting gene expression profiles with the profiles of non-induced bacteria incubated for the same period of time showed a set of core genes associated with early biofilm formation. This set included genes involved in quorum sensing, pili biogenesis and genes indicative of a potential metabolic shift involving nitrogen utilisation. Genes encoding components of sugar phosphotransferase systems were also up-regulated during biofilm induction. Assays of biofilm formation by bacteria deleted of some of these core genes showed that strains lacking hpr and luxS, which are known to be important for functional sugar phosphotransferase systems and quorum sensing, as well as glnL encoding a sensory histidine kinase were most negatively affected. Most of the deletion mutant strains tested were affected, but the effect was less severe, suggesting high levels of redundancy in the pathways involved in biofilm formation by this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Wood-ageing of conventionally fermented beers is gaining increased attention in the production of sour beers with a noteworthy balance between sourness, wood aroma and flavour complexity. Besides the extraction of wood-derived compounds into the beer, wood-aged sours owe their layered flavour profile to the activity of a variety of  wild microorganisms that reside in the barrels or that emerge from the brewing or maturation environment. However, until now wood-ageing of craft beers largely remains a process of trial and error that often generates unexpected or undesirable results. Therefore, to better understand the process and develop control strategies to improve the consistency, predictability and overall quality of the resulting beer, more insight is needed into the interactions between the wood, the microorganisms and the maturing beer. Nevertheless, as studying these interactions on an industrial scale is highly challenging, the objective of this study was to develop a reproducible and easy-to-manipulate experimentally tractable system that can be used to study wood-ageing of beer on a lab scale. Barrel-ageing was mimicked in a 0.5 liter glass jar filled with beer and closed off by a wooden disk. Furthermore, the system was equipped with a synthetic community composed of four bacterial species (Acetobacter malorum, Gluconobacter oxydans, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus) and four fungal species (Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Candida friedrichii, Pichia membranifaciens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that represented key microbes previously identified in wood-ageing experiments with 225-liter barrels. In order to test the hypothesis that the barrel-ageing process of beer can be replicated in the simplified in-vitro system, the system was subjected to 60 days of ageing and microbial community dynamics and beer chemistry were compared with a 38-week industrial barrel-ageing experiment using the same beer. Beer samples were collected at regular time points and subjected to both qPCR assays targeting the eight selected species and chemical analysis. Results revealed that in vitro ageing showed similar trends in the temporal dynamics of the microbial populations and beer chemistry as those observed during 38-weeks of barrel-ageing in 225-liter barrels. Furthermore, results were found to be highly reproducible. Altogether, the in-vitro system was found to be a robust and reproducible system that has great potential to perform more in-depth research about the intricate interactions between microbes, wood and maturing beer and to develop control strategies to improve the consistency, predictability and overall quality of the resulting beer.",

    "abstract": "The mucus layer is critical to gastrointestinal health and ecology. Dietary phytochemicals are well documented to stimulate mucus production and secretion, but the underlying mechanism and effects on gut health are poorly understood. We fed germ-free and conventional mice diets containing approximately 0.4% of polyphenols per gram to determine if the phytochemical-induced accumulation of mucin in the gastrointestinal lumen is dependent on the microbiota. In addition, we assess how increased mucin shapes microbial communities in conventional mice. Germ-free mice receiving a pea (Pisum sativuum) seed coat proanthocyanidin-containing diet (PA) had greater levels of fecal mucin compared to the non-proanthocyanidin-containing (NPA) pea seed coat diet control (P < 0.05), confirming that fecal mucin accumulation is independent of the gut microbiota. Conventional mice fed the PA diet and a red osier dogwood (ROD; Cornus sericea) extract diet (DW) had higher mucin levels compared to a control diet without phytochemicals (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). The increase in luminal mucin was associated with consistent increases in bacterial taxa belonging to Lachnospiraceae and [Clostridium] leptum species and a decrease in Romboutsia species. We conclude that phytochemicals have the ability to alter gut microbial ecology by increasing the amount of mucin in the gastrointestinal lumen.",

    "abstract": "Bartonella spp. are Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogens that infect diverse mammals and cause a long-lasting intra-erythrocytic bacteremia in their natural host. These bacteria translocate Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) into host cells via their VirB/VirD4 type 4 secretion system (T4SS) in order to subvert host cellular functions, thereby leading to the downregulation of innate immune responses. Most studies on the functional analysis of the VirB/VirD4 T4SS and the Beps were performed with the major zoonotic pathogen Bartonella henselae for which efficient in vitro infection protocols have been established. However, its natural host, the cat, is unsuitable as an experimental infection model. In vivo studies were mostly confined to rodent models using rodent-specific Bartonella species, while the in vitro infection protocols devised for B. henselae are not transferable for those pathogens. The disparities of in vitro and in vivo studies in different species has hampered progress in our understanding of Bartonella pathogenesis. Here we describe the murine-specific strain B. taylorii IBS296 as a new model organism facilitating the study of bacterial pathogenesis both in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in laboratory mice. We implemented the split NanoLuc luciferase-based translocation assay to study BepD translocation through the VirB/VirD4 T4SS. We found increased effector-translocation into host cells if the bacteria were grown on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and experienced a temperature shift immediately before infection. The improved infectivity in vitro could be correlated to an upregulation of the VirB/VirD4 T4SS. Using our adapted infection protocols, we showed BepD-dependent immunomodulatory phenotypes in vitro. In mice, the implemented growth conditions enabled infection by a massively reduced inoculum without having an impact on the course of the intra-erythrocytic bacteremia. The established model opens new avenues to study the role of the VirB/VirD4 T4SS and the translocated Bep effectors in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Historically, ribosomes have been viewed as unchanged homogeneous macromolecular machines with no intrinsic regulatory capacity for mRNA translation. However, an emerging concept is that heterogeneity of ribosomal composition exists, which can exert a regulatory function or specificity in translational control. This is supported by recent discoveries identifying compositionally distinct  specialised ribosomes that actively regulate mRNA translation. Viruses lack their own translational machinery and impose a high translational demand on the host cell during replication. Here we explore the possibility that Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) can manipulate host ribosome biogenesis during infection to produce specialised ribosomes which preferentially translate viral transcripts. Quantitative proteomic analysis has identified changes in the stoichiometry and composition of precursor ribosomal complexes during the switch from latent to lytic KSHV replication. Intriguingly, we demonstrate the enhanced association of ribosomal biogenesis factors BUD23 and NOC4L, and a previously uncharacterised KSHV lytic protein, ORF11, with small ribosomal subunit precursor complexes during lytic KSHV infection. Notably, BUD23 depletion resulted in significantly reduced viral gene expression and progression through the lytic cascade, culminating in a dramatic reduction of infectious virion production. Importantly, ribosome profiling demonstrated that BUD23 is essential for the reduced association of ribosomes with KSHV uORFs in late lytic genes, required for the efficient translation of the main open reading frame. Together our results provide new mechanistic insights into KSHV-mediated manipulation of cellular ribosome composition inducing a population of specialised ribosomes to facilitate efficient translation of viral mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing has become the gold standard for transcriptome analysis but has an inherent limitation of challenging quantification of low-abundant transcripts. In contrast to microarray technology, RNA sequencing reads are proportionally divided in function of transcript abundance. Therefore, low-abundant RNAs compete against highly abundant - and sometimes non-informative - RNA species. We developed an easy-to-use strategy based on high-affinity RNA-binding oligonucleotides to block reverse transcription and PCR amplification of specific RNA transcripts, thereby substantially reducing their abundance in the final sequencing library. To demonstrate the broad application potential of our method, we applied it to different transcripts and library preparation strategies, including YRNAs in small RNA sequencing of human blood plasma, mitochondrial rRNAs in both 3 end sequencing and long-read sequencing, and MALAT1 in single-cell 3 end sequencing. We demonstrate that the blocking strategy is highly efficient, reproducible, specific, and generally results in better transcriptome coverage and complexity. Furthermore, our method does not require modifications of the library preparation procedure apart from simply adding blocking oligonucleotides to the RT reaction and can thus be easily integrated into virtually any RNA sequencing library preparation protocol.",

CETS genes encode phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins (PEBPs) that have a central role in flowering time control as florigenic and anti-florigenic signals. The great expansion of CETS genes in many species suggests that the functions of this family go beyond flowering. Here, we characterize the tomato SELF PRUNING 3C (SP3C) gene, and show that besides acting as a flowering repressor it also regulates seed germination and modulates root architecture. We show that loss of SP3C function in CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutant lines accelerates seed germination and increases root length with lower root side branching. Higher SP3C expression in transgenic lines promotes the opposite effects and also improves tolerance to water stress in seedlings. These discoveries provide insights into the role of SP paralogs in agronomically relevant traits and support future exploration of the involvement of CETS genes in abiotic stress responses.\n\nHighlightThe SELF PRUNING 3C (SP3C) gene is a repressor of flowering in tomato and exhibits additional functions, acting as a repressor of seed germination and modulating root architecture.",

Two main distinct developmental states of ESCs have been stabilized in vitro, a naive pre-implantation stage and a primed post-implantation stage. Based on two recently published CRISPR-Cas9 knockout functional screens, we show here that the exit of the naive state is impaired upon heme biosynthesis pathway blockade, linked to the incapacity to activate MAPK- and TGF{beta}-dependent signaling pathways. In addition, heme synthesis inhibition promotes the acquisition of 2 cell-like cells in a heme-independent manner caused by a mitochondrial succinate accumulation and leakage out of the cell. We further demonstrate that extra-cellular succinate acts as a paracrine/autocrine signal, able to trigger the 2C-like reprogramming through the activation of its plasma membrane receptor, SUCNR1. Overall, this study unveils a new mechanism underlying the maintenance of pluripotency under the control of heme synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The thymus is a conserved organ among vertebrates, derived from the endoderm of distinct pharyngeal pouches (PP), whose location and number vary across species. Together with reports of sporadic ectopic thymus locations in mice and humans, this suggests that the potential to make a thymus resides in a broader region of the PP endoderm than previously ascribed.\n\nUsing the chick-quail chimera system, we explore this hypothesis and test the capacity of non-canonical pouches to participate in thymus formation. We further ask if the local mesenchyme of pharyngeal arches (PA) could also play a role in the regulation of thymus formation. After testing several embryonic tissue associations, we mapped the pharyngeal endoderm regions with thymus potential to the second and third/fourth pharyngeal pouches (2PP and 3/4PP). We further identified mesenchyme regions that regulate this potential to the 3/4 pharyngeal arches and to the dorsal region of the second arch, with positive and negative influences, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis of these tissues helped us revealing a common genetic program in the PP endoderm linked to thymus potential in addition to finding distinct signalling pathways involved in the cellular interactions with the mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arches that result in modulating this potential.\n\nTogether, these results provide new information about the initial specification of thymus primordia in the embryo that may contribute to improving the development of thymus organoid systems.\n\nGO_SCPLOWRAPHICALC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWABSTRACTC_SCPLOW\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483697v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a12a67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e6d49eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@90d7b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140672e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Estimating the heritable genetic variation in fitness-related traits is key to projecting the adaptive evolution of organisms in response to a changing environment. While heritability studies on reef-building corals to date support adaptive capacity, little is known about the dynamics of trait heritability across life stages in which distinct selective pressures can have long-lasting effects both within and across generations. In this study, we obtained heritability estimates for energetic and thermal stress response traits in larval, recruit, and adult Porites astreoides from two populations in the Lower Florida Keys. To induce bleaching phenotypes among individual families, larvae were exposed to a 4-day thermal stress at 32 {degrees}C, whereas adults and recruits received the same treatment for 22 days. Origin-dependent tolerance was observed in two life stages where offshore recruits lost more symbiont cells under heat than inshore recruits compared to their respective controls and heat-treated offshore adults suffered a greater loss in total protein content. Surprisingly, larvae appeared to be largely insensitive to heat regardless of origin. Broad sense heritability (H2) estimates varied greatly among traits and life stages, which may reflect changes in the relative importance of genetic and environmental variation throughout development. Notably, more than 80% of the variation in larval chlorophyll a concentration was attributed to genetic factors. The overall moderate to high H2 estimates measured here suggest these corals have considerable potential to adapt to environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Studies at a local community () level have shown that biodiversity positively affects ecosystem functioning due to niche-based deterministic processes like resource partitioning. Extending to a metacommunity ({beta}) level, we hypothesize that {beta} diversity also positively affects metacommunity functioning. We further hypothesize that the {beta} diversity effect is stronger (more positive) when {beta} diversity is increased by deterministic/non-random assembly processes. To test the hypotheses, we collected bacterioplankton along a transect of 6 stations in the southern East China Sea in 14 cruises. All 6 stations within a cruise were regarded as a metacommunity. For any pairs of the 6 stations, the Bray-Curtis index and summed bacterial biomass were calculated to represent {beta} diversity and metacommunity functioning, respectively. We also calculated deviation of observed mean pairwise phylogenetic similarities among species from random to represent the deterministic influences of assembly processes. We found that bacterial {beta} diversity generally positively affects metacommunity functioning; however, the {beta} diversity effect varied among cruises. Cross-cruise comparison indicates that the {beta} diversity effect increased with the deterministic assembly processes selecting for phylogenetically dissimilar species. This study extends the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research to a metacommunity level, complementing the current framework by considering community assembly in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTaenia solium is a parasite that hampers human health, causing taeniasis and cysticercosis. The genetic variability in its mitochondrial genome is related to the geographical origin of the specimen. Two main genotypes have been identified: The Asian and the African-American. The geographic genetic variability is expected to cause different clinical manifestations. Thus, characterizing differences between and within genotypes is crucial for completing the epidemiology of T. solium diseases.\n\nMethods/Principal FindingsHere, two Peruvian (one complete and one partial; 7,811X and 42X of coverage, respectively) and one Mexican (complete, 3,395X) T. solium mitochondrial genomes were assembled using the Chinese reference. Variant calling with respect to the reference was performed. Thirteen SNPs that involved a change in the amino acid physicochemical nature were identified. Those were present in all the assembled genomes and might be linked to differences in aerobic respiration efficiency between Latin American (African-American) and Asian genotypes. Then, phylogeographic studies were conducted using Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I and cytochrome B from these genomes and other isolates. The analysis showed that Indonesian samples are the most ancient and related to the modern T. solium ancestor of the Asian genotype. Finally, a consistent subdivision of the African-American genotype into two subgroups was found. One subgroup relates to East African countries, while the other is West Africa. The East African linage suggests a previously unnoticed influence of the Indian Ocean trade in the genetic structure of Latin America T. solium.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOverall, this study reports novel mitochondrial genomes valuable for further studies. New Latin American SNPs were identified and suggest metabolic differences between parasites of the Asian and African-American genotypes. Moreover, the phylogeographic analysis revealed differences within each genotype that shed light on T. soliums historical spread. Overall, the results represent an important step in completing T. solium genetic epidemiology.\n\nAuthor SummaryTaenia solium is a human parasite that causes taeniasis and cysticercosis. Eradicated from developed countries, they are still a public health problem in developing nations. T. solium differences in the mitochondrial genetic material depend on its geographical origin. This is expected to cause different clinical manifestations. Despite the importance of genetics to the epidemiology of T. solium diseases, few efforts have been made to assemble and compare their genomes. We aimed to help fill this knowledge gap by assembling three mitochondrial genomes from Latin America and comparing them to the Chinese reference. Additionally, two genes from the Latin American genomes and from other isolates were employed to assess T. solium genetic distribution. We found thirteen mutations with respect to the Chinese genome present in all Latin American samples, which involved a change in the amino acid physicochemical nature. Those might be causing metabolic differences between Asian and Latin American parasites that could change their affinity to specific human tissues. Moreover, we determined that Indonesian samples are the most ancient and related to the modern T. solium ancestor. Finally, we identified a previously unnoticed influence of East African countries in T. solium phylogeny, with which our assembled genomes are closely related.",

    "abstract": "Uveal Melanoma (UM) is a rare cancer resulting from transformation of melanocytes residing in the uveal tract. Integrative analysis has identified four molecular and clinical subsets in UM. To improve our molecular understanding of UM we performed extensive multi-omics characterization comparing two aggressive UM patient-derived xenograft models with normal choroidal melanocytes, including DNA optical mapping, specific histone modifications, and DNA topology analysis by Hi-C. Our gene expression and cytogenetic analyses suggest that genomic instability is a hallmark of UM. We also identified a recurrent deletion in the BAP1 promoter resulting in loss of expression and associated with high risk of metastases in UM patients. Hi-C revealed chromatin topology changes associated with up-regulation of PRAME, an independent prognostic biomarker in UM and potential therapeutic target. Our findings illustrate how multi-omics approaches can improve the understanding of tumorigenesis and reveals two novel mechanisms of gene expression dysregulation in UM.",

    "abstract": "The manufacturing of 3D cell scaffoldings provides advantages for modeling diseases and injuries by physiologically relevant platforms. A triple-flow microfluidic device was developed to rapidly fabricate alginate/graphene hollow microfibers based on the gelation of alginate induced with CaCl2. This five-channel pattern actualized continuous mild fabrication of hollow fibers under an optimized flowing rate ratio of 300: 200: 100 L.min-1. The polymer solution was 2.5% alginate in 0.1% graphene, and a 30% polyethylene glycol solution was used as the sheath and core solutions. The morphology and physical properties of microstructures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical, and surface area analyzers. Subsequently, these conductive microfibers biocompatibility was studied by encapsulating mouse astrocyte cells within these scaffolds. The cells could successfully survive both the manufacturing process and prolonged encapsulation for up to 8 days. These unique 3D hollow scaffolds could significantly enhance the available surface area for nutrient transport to the cells. In addition, these conductive hollow scaffolds illustrated unique advantages such as 0.728 cm3.gr-1 porosity and twice more electrical conductivity in comparison to alginate scaffolds. The results confirm the potential of these scaffolds as a microenvironment that supports cell growth.",

    "abstract": "A limitation of pooled CRISPR-Cas9 viability screens is the high false-positive rate in detecting essential genes arising from copy number-amplified (CNA) regions of the genome. To solve this issue, we developed CRISPRcleanR: a computational method implemented as R/python package and in a dockerized version. CRISPRcleanR detects and corrects biased responses to CRISPR-Cas9 targeting in an unsupervised fashion, accurately reducing false-positive signals, while maintaining sensitivity in identifying relevant genetic dependencies. Here, we present CRISPRcleanRWebApp, a web-based application enabling access to CRISPRcleanR through an intuitive graphical web-interface. CRISPRcleanRWebApp removes the complexity of low-level R/python-language user interactions; it provides a user-friendly access to a complete analytical pipeline, not requiring any data pre-processing, and generating gene-level summaries of essentiality with associated statistical scores; it offers a range of interactively explorable plots, while supporting a wider range of CRISPR guide RNAs libraries with respect to the original package.

    "abstract": "The myosin II motors are ATP-powered, force-generating machines driving cardiac and muscle contraction. Myosin II heavy chain isoform-beta ({beta}-MyHC) is primarily expressed in the ventricular myocardium and slow-twitch muscle fibers, such as in M. soleus. M. soleus-derived myosin II (SolM-II) is often used as an alternative to the ventricular {beta}-cardiac myosin ({beta}M-II); however, the direct assessment of detailed biochemical and mechanical features of the native myosins is limited. By employing the optical trapping method, we examined the mechanochemical properties of the native myosins isolated from rabbit heart ventricle and M. soleus muscles at the single-molecule level. Contrary to previous reports, the purified motors from the two tissue sources, despite the same MyHC isoform, displayed distinct motile and ATPase kinetic properties. {beta}M-II was [~]threefold faster in the actin filament-gliding assay than SolM-II. The maximum acto-myosin (AM) detachment rate derived in single-molecule assays was [~]threefold higher in {beta}M-II. The stroke size for both myosins was comparable. The stiffness of the  AM rigor cross-bridge was also similar for both the motor forms. The stiffness of {beta}M-II was found to be determined by the nucleotide state of the actin-bound myosin. Our analysis revealed distinct kinetic differences, i.e., a higher AM detachment rate for the {beta}M-II, corresponding to the ADP release rates from the cross-bridge, thus elucidating the observed differences in the motility driven by {beta}M-II and SolM-II. These studies have important implications for the future choice of tissue sources to gain insights into cardiomyopathies",
