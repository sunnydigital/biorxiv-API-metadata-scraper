    "abstract": "Decorin binding protein A (DbpA) is a surface adhesin expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. While DbpA is one of the most immunogenic B. burgdorferi antigens in Lyme disease patients, the B cell epitopes recognized over the course of infection have not been defined. In this report we profiled [~]300 human serum samples from early, mid, and late-stage Lyme disease for IgM and IgG reactivity with DbpA and a tiled DbpA 18-mer peptide array derived from B.b. strains B31 and 297. Using ELISA and multiplex immunoassays (MIA), we identified 12 DbpA-derived peptides whose reactivity was elevated in Lyme disease patients as compared to healthy controls. The most reactive peptide (\"A7\") corresponds to the flexible loop between DbpAB31 -helix 1 and -helix 2, implicated in influencing DbpA binding to heparin and dermatan sulfate. An A7-like peptide is also reportedly a target of antibodies in Lyme neuroborreliosis patients. The remaining peptides, while highly reactive in serum samples across disease stages, likely represent non-native epitopes, as antibody reactivity to a subset of peptides in competition assays was unaffected by the addition of soluble DbpA. Moreover, peptide reactivity of any given patient sample rarely correlated with overall DbpA antibody levels, suggesting the antibodies were raised against DbpA degradation products. Insights into B cell epitopes on DbpA elicited during Lyme disease have important implications for understanding how B.burgdorferi persists in the face of an overwhelming antibody response.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the most reported tick-borne illness in the United States. In humans, clinical manifestations of Lyme disease are complex and can persist for months, even in the face of a robust antibody response directed against numerous B. burgdorferi surface proteins, including decorin binding protein A (DbpA), which is involved in early stages of infection. In this study we employed [~]300 serum samples from Lyme disease patients to better understand antibody reactivity with specific regions (\"epitopes\") of DbpA. We identified one epitope on DbpA recognized by antibodies from almost half of the serum samples tested and that, theoretically, should block DbpAs ability to function in promoting B. burgdorferi colonization of human hosts.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy works through the interplay between immune and cancer cells. Particularly, interactions between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and cancer cells, such as PDCD1 (PD-1) and CD274 (PD-L1), are crucial for removing cancer cells. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting these interactions are effective only to a subset of patients, requiring the development of novel immunotherapy drugs with novel targets.\n\nGenome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening in either cancer or immune cells has been used to discover regulators of immune cell function as immunotherapeutic targets. However, the method has two main limitations. First, performing CRISPR screens in one cell type alone makes it difficult to identify essential intercellular interactions due to the focus on single genes instead of interactions. Second, pooled screening is associated with high noise levels. Therefore, we propose intercellular CRISPR screens, which perform genome-wide CRISPR screening in every interacting cell type to discover intercellular interactions as immunotherapeutic targets.\n\nIntercellular CRISPR screens use two individual genome-wide CRISPR screens one each in immune and cancer cells to evaluate intercellular interactions that are crucial for killing cancer cells. We used two publicly available genome-wide CRISPR screening datasets obtained while triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and CTLs were interacting. We analyzed 4825 interactions between 1391 ligands and receptors on TNBC cells and CTLs to assess the effects of intercellular interactions on CTL function by incorporating both CRISPR datasets and the expression levels of ligands and receptors.\n\nOur results showed that intercellular CRISPR screens discovered targets of approved drugs, a few of which were not identifiable using single datasets. To quantitatively evaluate the methods performance, we used data for cytokines and costimulatory molecules because they constitute the majority of immunotherapeutic targets. Combining both CRISPR datasets improved the F1 score of discovering these genes relative to using single CRISPR datasets by more than twice.\n\nOur results indicate that intercellular CRISPR screens can identify novel immune-oncology targets that were not obtained using individual CRISPR screens. The pipeline can be extended to other cancer and immune cell types, such as natural killer cells, to identify important intercellular interactions as potential immunotherapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. This pathogen possesses a two-stage life cycle consisting of an environmentally stable cyst and a pathogenic amoeboid trophozoite. Since infection is acquired by ingestion of cysts from contaminated food and water, this parasite is prevalent in underdeveloped countries. A reptilian pathogen, Entamoeba invadens, which can encyst in culture, has long-served as a surrogate to study stage conversion. In the host, the Entamoebae must manage stress including nutrient deprivation and host immune pressure. In many systems, the stress response is characterized by down-regulation of translation, which is initiated by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2). In mammalian cells, this phosphorylation is carried out by a family of eIF2 kinases. A canonical eIF2 translational control system exists in the Entamoebae; however, no eIF2 kinases have been characterized. In this study, we identified two eIF2 kinases in E. invadens, EiIF2K-A and EiIF2K-B. Their identity as eIF2 kinases was validated using a heterologous yeast system. We used an RNAi Trigger-mediated silencing system to reduce expression of EiIF2K-A, which also reduced expression of EiIF2K-B. Parasites with decreased kinase expression exhibited decreased phosphorylation of eIF2 and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Diminished kinase expression also correlates with an increased rate of encystation, a decreased the rate of excystation, and an increase in several virulence functions, erythrophagocytosis and adhesion to host cells. Taken together, these data suggest that EiIF2K-A and EiIF2K-B are authentic eIF2 kinases that may regulate the Entamoeba stress response.\n\nImportanceEntamoeba histolytica is a human pathogen that causes dysentery and affects millions of people worldwide. This parasite possesses a two-stage life cycle: an environmentally stable cyst and the pathogenic trophozoite. Cysts are ingested from contaminated food and water; thus, this parasite in prevalent in underdeveloped countries. Current therapies commonly cause adverse side effects; therefore, new treatments are needed. In the host, Entamoeba experiences stress brought on, in part, by the host immune system. Understanding stage conversion and the stress response of this pathogen may lead to new drug therapies. Using the model organism, E. invadens, we identified two kinases, similar to those involved in stress and stage conversion in other systems. We determined that these kinases may regulate the oxidative stress response, stage conversion, and virulence. This work is significant as it will inform future studies on the life cycle and pathogenicity of the Entamoeba species.",

Here we propose two new Rhizobiales species isolated from root nodules of common sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), as shown by core-gene phylogeny, overall genome relatedness indices and pan-genome analysis.\n\nMesorhizobium onobrychidis sp. nov., actively induces nodules, and achieves atmospheric nitrogen and carbon dioxide fixation. This species appears to be depleted in motility genes, and is enriched in genes for direct effects on plant growth performance. Its genome reveals functional and plant growth-promoting signatures like a large unique chromosomal genomic island with high density of symbiotic genetic traits. Onobrychidicola muellerharveyae gen. nov. sp. nov., is described as type species of the new genus Onobrychidicola in Rhizobiaceae. This species comprises unique genetic features and plant growth-promoting traits (PGPTs), which strongly indicate its function in biotic stress reduction and motility. We applied a newly developed bioinformatics approach for in silico prediction of PGPTs (PGPT-Pred), which supports the different lifestyles of the two new species and the plant growth-promoting performance of M. onobrychidis in the greenhouse trial.",

However, due to the nearly exclusive expression of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in the central nervous system, the role of the EMC in their biogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the EMC positively regulates the surface trafficking and thus function of endogenous {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, the primary inhibitory ion channels in the mammalian brain. Further, among ten EMC subunits, EMC3 and EMC6 have the most prominent effects, indicating a subunit-specific contribution. EMC3 and EMC6 show endogenous interactions with major neuroreceptors, which depends on their transmembrane domains. Overexpression of EMC3 and EMC6 is sufficient to restore the function of epilepsy-associated GABAA receptor variants, suggesting that operating EMC has the potential to ameliorate neurological diseases associated with protein conformational defects.\n\nIn briefThe multi-subunit EMC serves as an insertase for a subset of membrane proteins and enables their biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum.

    "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster the anterior-posterior body axis is maternally established and governed by differential localization of partitioning defective (Par) proteins within the oocyte. At mid-oogenesis, Par-1 accumulates at the posterior end of the oocyte while Par-3/Bazooka is excluded there but maintains its localization along the remaining oocyte cortex. This mutual exclusion leads to a polarized microtubule network and accumulation of posterior determinant oskar later in oogenesis. Reciprocal biochemical interactions between Par proteins can explain their cortical exclusion and domain formation - for example, Par-1 excludes Par-3 by phosphorylation. However, past studies have proposed the need for somatic cells at the posterior end to initiate oocyte polarization by providing a trigger signal. To date, despite modern screening approaches and genetic manipulation, neither the molecular identity nor the nature of the signal is known. Here, we provide the first evidence that mechanical contact of posterior follicle cells (PFCs) with the oocyte cortex causes the posterior exclusion of Bazooka and maintains oocyte polarity. We show that Bazooka prematurely accumulates exclusively where posterior follicle cells have been mechanically detached or ablated. This occurs before Par-1 is removed suggesting that phosphorylation of Bazooka by Par-1 is not sufficient to maintain Bazooka exclusion in the absence of PFC contact. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PFC contact maintains Par-1 and oskar localization and microtubule cytoskeleton polarity in the oocyte. Our observations suggest that cell-cell contact mechanics modulates Par protein binding sites at the oocyte cortex.",

    "abstract": "The international wildlife trade presents severe conservation and environmental security risks. However, no international regulatory framework exists to monitor the trade of species not listed in the appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). We explored the composition and dynamics of internationally regulated versus non-regulated trade, focussing on importations of wild-caught terrestrial vertebrates entering the United States of America (US) from 2009-2018. The prominence of the US in global wildlife imports and its detailed data collection conventions allows a unique opportunity to formally assess this substantial but often overlooked and understudied component of the legal wildlife trade. We found 3.6 times the number of unlisted species in US imports compared with CITES-listed species (1,366 versus 378). CITES-listed species were more likely to face reported conservation threats relative to the unlisted species (71.7% vs 27.5%). Yet, we found 376 unlisted species facing conversation threats, 297 species with unknown population trends and 139 species without an evaluation by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Unlisted species appeared novelly in imports at 5.5 times higher rates relative to CITES-listed species, where unlisted reptiles saw the largest rate of entry, averaging 53 unique species appearing in imports for the first time per year. Overall trade volumes were substantially larger for unlisted imports with approximately 11 times the number of animals relative to CITES-listed imports, however, import volumes were similar when compared at a species-by-species level. We found that the countries that were top exporters for CITES-listed shipments were mostly different from exporters of unlisted species. In highlighting the vulnerabilities of the wild-caught unlisted vertebrate trade entering the US and in the face of increasing global demand, we recommend governments adapt policies to monitor the trade of all wildlife.",

Thus, when the goal is to estimate the realized niche of the species, both methods may overestimate the niche.\nC_LIO_LIWe present a methodology that combines both the convex hull and the elliptical envelope methods producing an n-dimensional hypervolume that better fits the observed density of species presences, making it a better candidate to model the realized niche. Our method, called the CHE approach, allows defining regions of iso-suitability as a function of the significance levels inherited from the method (Mahalanobis distance model, minimum covariance determinant, or minimum volume ellipsoid) used to fit an initial elliptical envelope from which we then discard regions not relevant for the species by calculating a convex hull.\nC_LIO_LIWe applied the CHE approach to a case study of twenty-five species of bats present in the Iberian Peninsula, fitting a hypervolume for each species and comparing them to both the convex hulls and elliptical envelopes obtained with the same data and different values of n. We show that as the number of variables used to define the niche space increases, both the convex hull and elliptical envelope models produce overly large hypervolumes, while the size of the hypervolume fitted with the CHE approach remains stable. As a consequence, similarity measures that account for the niche overlap among different species may be inflated when using convex hulls or elliptical envelopes to model the niche; something that does not occur under the CHE approach.\nC_LI",

However, the interaction between two species may be fundamentally changed by the presence of others. Although interactions among three or more species, called higher-order interactions, have the potential to modify our theoretical understanding of coexistence, ecologists lack clear expectations for how these interactions shape community structure. Here, we analytically predict and numerically confirm how the variability and strength of higher-order interactions affect species coexistence. We found that, as higher-order interaction strengths become more variable across species, fewer species coexist, echoing the behavior of pairwise models. If inter-specific higher-order interactions become too harmful relative to self-regulation, coexistence was destabilized, but coexistence was also lost when these interactions were too weak and mutualistic effects became prevalent. Last, we showed that more species rich communities structured by higher-order interactions lose species more readily than their species poor counterparts, generalizing classic results for community stability. Our work provides needed theoretical expectation for how higher-order interactions impact species coexistence in diverse communities.",

Combining Raman spectroscopy with deep-learning-aided RCM has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of Raman without requiring additional input from the clinician.\n\nAimWe seek to improve the specificity of Raman for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) by integrating information from RCM images using an Artificial Neural Network.\n\nApproachA Raman biophysical model was used in prior work to classify BCC tumors from surrounding normal tissue structures. 191 RCM images were collected from the same site as the Raman data and served as inputs to train two ResNet50 networks. The networks selected the hair structure images and epidermis images respectively within all the images corresponding to the positive predictions of the Raman Biophysical Model.\n\nResultsDeep learning on RCM images removes 54% of false positive predictions from the Raman Biophysical Model result and keeps the sensitivity as 100%. The specificity was improved from 84.8% by using Raman spectra alone to 93.0% by integrating Raman spectra with RCM images\n\nConclusionsCombining Raman spectroscopy with deep-learning-aided RCM imaging is a promising tool to guide tumor resection surgery.",

    "abstract": "Biological environments typically contain high concentrations (300-400 mg/mL) of different macromolecules at volume fractions as large as 30%-40%. Biomolecular processes, especially ubiquitous recognition phenomena, occurring in such crowded heterogeneous media would differ significantly compared to the dilute buffer solutions. Here we quantify the impact of inert crowders on prototypical host-guest recognition process by explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in atomic resolution. We demonstrate that the crowders, especially when smaller in size, would facilitate the binding process of guest molecule by decreasing the free energy barrier for binding via excluded volume effect and desolvation of the host receptor. However, the extent of crowder-induced stabilization of host-guest complex is found to be significantly higher when the guest molecule is sterically constricted to approach the host along a centrosymmetric direction, contrary to its unrestricted, freely diffusive movement. A kinetic analysis of the recognition process reveals that the origin of relatively stronger crowder impact, during constricted movement of guest molecule, lies in significantly enhanced residence time of the guest inside the host by crowders, compared to freely diffusive ligand movement. Together our results suggest that the extent of im-pact of crowding on recognition processes would be contingent upon presence or absence of constriction on ligand movement.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482924v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130e57dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12aa364org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d23ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6da639_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TOC graphic\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Protein Phosphatase Enzymes (PPE) and protein kinases simultaneously control phosphorylation mechanisms that tightly regulate intracellular signaling pathways and stimulate cellular responses. In human malignancies, PPE and protein kinases are frequently mutated resulting in uncontrolled kinase activity and PPE suppression, leading to cell proliferation, migration and resistance to anti-cancer therapies. Cancer associated DNA hypermethylation at PPE promoters gives rise to transcriptional silencing (epimutations) and is a hallmark of cancer. Despite recent advances in sequencing technologies, data availability and computational capabilities, only a fraction of PPE have been reported as transcriptionally inactive as a consequence of epimutations. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, we compared DNA methylation profiles from 705 cancer patients across 5 major tissues and 3 cancer cell models against a cohort of healthy controls. Here, we report epimutations in PPE (and their interacting proteins or PPEIP) are a frequent occurrence in the cancer genome and manifest independent of transcriptional activity. We observed that different tumors have varying susceptibility to epimutations and identify specific cellular signalling networks that are primarily affected by epimutations. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis showed the negative impact of epimutations on most (not all) Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase transcription. Finally, we detected novel clinical biomarkers that inform on patient mortality and anti-cancer treatment sensitivity. We propose that DNA hypermethylation marks at PPEIP frequently contribute to the pathogenesis of malignancies and within the precision medicine space, hold promise as biomarkers to inform on clinical features such as patient survival and therapeutic response.",

    "abstract": "In a majority of ants, a newly mated queen independently founds a colony and claustrally raises her first brood without foraging outside the nest. During claustral independent colony foundation (ICF) in several ants, the esophagus of the founding queen expands and develops into a thoracic crop, which is then filled with a liquid substrate for larval feeding. It has been suggested that these substrates are converted from her body reserves (e.g., histolyzed flight muscles) or redistributed from a gastral crop. Here, we examined thoracic crop development in Lasius japonicus during claustral ICF. The foundresses claustrally fed their larvae from week 2 to 5 after ICF onset, and the first worker emerged at week 6. The development proceeded as follows: in week 0, foundress dorsal esophagus wall was pleated and thickened. Then, from week 2 to 5, the esophagus expanded dorsally toward where flight muscles had been present, following flight muscle histolysis. Gastral crop expansion followed esophagus expansion. Thus, thoracic crop formation may be spatiotemporally coordinated with flight muscle histolysis in Lasius japonicus queens, and similar developmental regulations might be common in other claustral ICF ants.",

    "abstract": "The ability to sense Earths gravitational pull is essential for orientation, navigation, and proprioception in most organisms. We report here that C. elegans dauer larvae and adults exhibit pronounced negative gravitaxis. This behavior is antagonized by light and electromagnetic fields, suggesting that it is integrated with other sensory inputs. We found that the MEC-7 and MEC-12 microtubule components of the mechanosensory transduction system involved in gentle touch sensation are essential for negative gravitaxis. Further, TRPA-1, a channel protein associated with cold and mechanosensation in both mammals and invertebrates, is required for this behavior. However, the MEC-4/10 DEG/ENaC channels and other components that transduce gentle touch sensation are not required, suggesting that the sensory system for detecting and responding to gravity is separable from the touch sensation system. We found that the PVD neurons, which use TRPA-1 to detect harsh cold, but neither their quaternary processes nor the touch receptor neurons (TRNs), are essential for negative gravitaxis. These findings implicate an interconnected mechanism for gravity sensation involving an ion channel that is also present in the mammalian vestibular system, suggesting possible homology in gravity sensing across animal phylogeny.",

    "abstract": "Marine algae annually synthesize gigatons of glycans from carbon dioxide, exporting it within sinking particles into the deep-sea and underlying sea floor, unless those glycans are digested before by bacteria. Identifying algal glycans in the ocean remains challenging with the molecular resolution of conventional analytic techniques. Whether algal glycans are digested by heterotrophic bacteria during downward transport, before they can transfer carbon dioxide from the ocean surface into the deep-sea or the sea floor, remains unknown. In the Red Sea Shaban Deep, where at 1500 m water depth a brine basin acts as a natural sediment trap, we found its high salt and low oxygen concentration accumulated and preserved exported algal glycans for the past 2500 years. By using monoclonal antibodies specific for glycan structures, we detected fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharide, {beta}-glucan, {beta}-mannan and arabinogalactan glycans, synthesized by diatoms, coccolithophores, dinoflagellates and other algae living in the sunlit ocean. Their presence in deep-sea sediment demonstrates these algal glycans were not digested by bacteria. Instead they moved carbon dioxide from the surface ocean into the deep-sea, where it will be locked away from the atmosphere at least for the next 1000 years. Considering their global synthesis, quantity and stability against degradation during transport through the water column, algal glycans are agents for carbon sequestration.\n\nSignificance statementAlgae and plants use the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to synthesize polymeric carbohydrates, or glycans, for energy storage, structural support and as protection against invasion by microbes. Glycans provide protection, are carbon sinks and enable carbon sequestration for as long as they are not digested by bacteria or other organisms, which releases the carbon dioxide back in to the atmosphere. In this study, we show that non-digested algal glycans sink into the deep ocean and into marine sediment. Thus, glycans are more than food for animals and prebiotics for bacteria, they are also molecules that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and transfer it to the deep-sea, where it can be stored for 1000 years and longer.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant sparked concern due to its fast spread and the unprecedented number of mutations in the spike protein that enables it to partially evade spike-based COVID-19 vaccine-induced humoral immunity. In anticipation of a potential need for an Omicron spike-based vaccine, we generated an Ad26 vector encoding an Omicron (BA.1) spike protein (Ad26.COV2.S.529). Ad26.COV2.S.529 encodes for a prefusion stabilized spike protein, similar to the current COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein. We verified that spike expression by Ad26.COV2.S.529 was comparable to Ad26.COV2.S. Immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S.529 was then evaluated in naive mice and SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 spike pre-immunized hamsters. In naive mice, Ad26.COV2.S.529 elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.1) but not to SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2), while the opposite was observed for Ad26.COV2.S. In pre-immune hamsters, Ad26.COV2.S.529 vaccination resulted in robust increases in neutralizing antibody titers against both SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2), while Ad26.COV2.S vaccination only increased neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant. Our data imply that Ad26.COV2.S.529 can both expand and boost a Wuhan-Hu-1 spike-primed humoral immune response to protect against distant SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "As existing vaccines fail to completely prevent COVID-19 infections or community transmission, there is an unmet need for vaccines that can better combat SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). We have previously developed highly thermo-tolerant monomeric and trimeric receptor binding domain derivatives that can withstand 100{degrees}C for 90 minutes and 37{degrees}C for four weeks, and help eliminate cold chain requirements. We show that mice immunised with these vaccine formulations elicit high titres of antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants VIC31 (with Spike: D614G mutation), Delta and Omicron (BA.1.1) VOC. Compared to VIC31, there was an average 14.4-fold reduction in neutralisation against BA.1.1 for the three monomeric antigen-adjuvant combinations, and 16.5-fold reduction for the three trimeric antigen-adjuvant combinations; the corresponding values against Delta were 2.5 and 3.0. Our findings suggest that monomeric formulations are suitable for the upcoming Phase I human clinical trials, and that there is potential for increasing efficacy with vaccine matching to improve responses against emerging variants. These findings are consistent with in silico modelling and AlphaFold predictions which show that while oligomeric presentation can be generally beneficial, it can make important epitopes inaccessible, and also carries the risk of eliciting unwanted antibodies against the oligomerisation domain.",

Our work shows that C. jejuni differentially regulates intracellular and extracellular ROS production in human T84 and Caco-2 cells. C. jejuni downregulates the transcription and translation of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAPDH) oxidase (Nox1), a key ROS-generating enzyme in IECs and antioxidant defence genes cat and sod1. Furthermore, inhibition of Nox1 by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and siRNA reduced C. jejuni ability to interact, invade and intracellularly survive within T84 and Caco-2 cells.

    "abstract": "Animals form complex symbiotic associations with their gut microbes, whose evolution is determined by an intricate network of host and environmental factors. In many insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, the microbiome is flexible, environmentally determined and less diverse than in mammals. In contrast, mammals maintain complex multispecies consortia that are able to colonize and persist in the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of gut microbes in different hosts is challenging. This requires disentangling the ecological factors of selection, determining the timescales over which evolution occurs, and elucidating the architecture of such evolutionary patterns. Here, we employ experimental evolution to track the pace of the evolution of a common gut commensal, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, within invertebrate (Drosophila melanogaster) and vertebrate (Mus musculus) hosts and their respective diets. While the symbiosis between Drosophila and L. plantarum is mainly determined by host diet, with the host influencing the fitness of its gut microbes only over short timescales, bacterial evolution within the mammalian host follows a divergent evolutionary path. Here, the host and its intrinsic factors play a critical role in selection and influence both the phenotypic and genomic evolution of its gut microbes, as well as the outcome of their symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein contains a fusion peptide (FP) segment that mediates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Calcium ions are thought to position the FP optimally for membrane insertion by interacting with negatively charged residues in this segment (E801, D802, D812, E821, D825, and D830); however, which residues bind to calcium and in what combinations supportive of membrane insertion are unknown. Using biological assays and molecular dynamics studies, we have determined the functional configurations of FP-Ca+2 binding which promote membrane insertion. We first mutated the negatively charged residues in the SARS CoV-1 FP to assay their role in cell entry and syncytia formation, finding that charge loss in the D802A or D830A mutants reduced syncytia formation and pseudoparticle transduction. Interestingly, the D812A mutation led to increased pseudoparticle transduction, indicating the Ca2+ effect depends on binding at specific FP sites. To interpret mechanistically these results and learn how specific modes of FP-Ca2+ binding modulate membrane insertion, we performed molecular dynamics simulations. Preferred residue pairs for Ca2+ binding were identified (E801/D802; E801/D830; D812/E821) which promote FP membrane insertion. In contrast, binding to residues E821/D825 inhibited FP membrane insertion, which is also supported by our biological assays. Our findings show that Ca2+ binding to SARS-CoV-1 FP residue pairs E801/D802 and D812/E821 facilitates membrane insertion, whereas binding to the E801/D802 and D821/D825 pairs is detrimental. These conclusions provide an improved and nuanced mechanistic understanding of calcium binding modes to FP residues and their dynamic effects on host cell entry.",

We observe that the top 100 most abundant proteins from the ECM fractions of all tissues are generally present in all tissues, indicating that tissue matrices are principally composed of a shared set of ECM proteins. However, these proteins vary up to 4,000-fold between tissues, resulting in highly unique matrix profiles even with the same primary set of proteins. A data reduction approach was used to reveal related networks of expressed ECM proteins across varying tissues, including basement membrane and collagen subtypes.",

    "abstract": "DNA supercoiling has emerged as a major contributor to gene regulation in bacteria. The impact of DNA supercoiling on transcription dynamics in eukaryotes is less clear. Here, using single-molecule dual-color RNA imaging in budding yeast, we show that transcriptional bursting of the divergent and tandem GAL genes is coupled. Upon topoisomerase degradation, supercoils that buildup from transcription inhibit subsequent transcription at neighboring genes, thereby reducing their simultaneous bursting. GAL gene transcription is inhibited more by negative than by positive supercoiling accumulation. Unlike bacteria, wildtype yeast has sufficient topoisomerase levels to minimize inhibition from supercoils at adjacent genes. Overall, we discover fundamental differences in supercoiling-mediated gene regulation between bacteria and yeast and show that rapid supercoiling release in eukaryotes ensures proper gene expression of neighboring genes.\n\nOne sentence summaryTranscription causes twisting of the DNA double helix, which can inhibit transcription of adjacent genes.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive aging in females often occurs early in life, resulting in a substantial post-reproductive lifespan. Despite the medical importance of age-related infertility, relatively little is known about mechanisms that control this age-related decline. C. elegans is a leading system for aging biology due to its short lifespan and powerful experimental tools, and detailed descriptions of molecular and cellular changes in the gonad during reproductive aging were recently reported. Here we show that reproductive aging occurs early in life in multiple species in the genus Caenorhabditis, indicating this is a feature of both female/male and hermaphrodite/male species. In mutants previously established to display delayed reproductive aging (daf-2, eat-2, phm-2), we observed correlations between changes in the distal germline and changes in egg-laying, consistent with the model that distal germline changes are a cause of reproductive aging. By screening for additional mutants that delay reproductive aging, we identified an allele of che-3 with impaired sensory perception that displayed increased progeny production in mid-life, a pattern of reproductive aging distinct from previous mutants. To directly test the role of Notch signaling in the distal germline, we analyzed the effect of ectopic expression of the Notch effector gene SYGL-1. Ectopic expression of SYGL-1 was sufficient to delay reproductive aging, suggesting that an age-related decline in Notch signaling in the distal germline is a root cause of reproductive aging.",

    "abstract": "Most colonial marine invertebrates are capable of allorecognition, the ability to distinguish between themselves and conspecifics. One long-standing question is whether invertebrate allorecognition genes are homologous to vertebrate histocompatibility genes. In the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, allorecognition is controlled by at least two genes, Allorecognition 1 (Alr1) and Allorecognition 2 (Alr2), which encode highly polymorphic cell surface proteins that serve as markers of self. Here, we show that Alr1 and Alr2 are part of a family of 41 Alr genes, all of which reside a single genomic interval called the Allorecognition Complex (ARC). Using sensitive homology searches and highly accurate structural predictions, we demonstrate that the Alr proteins are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) with V-set and I-set Ig domains unlike any previously identified in animals. Specifically, their primary amino acid sequences lack many of the motifs considered diagnostic for V-set and I-set domains, yet they adopt secondary and tertiary structures nearly identical to canonical Ig domains. Thus, the V-set domain, which played a central role in the evolution of vertebrate adaptive immunity, was present in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians. Unexpectedly, several Alr proteins also have immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic tails, suggesting they could participate in pathways homologous to those that regulate immunity in humans and flies. This work expands our definition of the IgSF with the addition of a family of unusual members, several of which play a role in invertebrate histocompatibility.\n\nSignificance StatementThe immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) is one of the largest and most functionally versatile domain families in animal genomes. Although their amino acid sequences can vary considerably, IgSF domains have been traditionally defined by conserved residues at several key positions in their fold. Here, we sequenced an invertebrate histocompatibility complex and discovered a family of IgSF genes with amino acid sequences that lack most of these residues yet are predicted to adopt folds virtually identical to canonical V-set and I-set IgSF domains. This work broadens the definition of the IgSF and shows that the V-set domain was present earlier in animal evolution than previously appreciated.",

Zinc compounds are widely known for their antiviral properties. Therefore, we have prepared a library of zinc complexes with pyrithione (1-hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridinethione) and its analogues, all of which showed promising in vitro inhibition of cathepsin L, an enzyme involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, and PLPro, an enzyme involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication both in (sub)micromolar range.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to sporadic PD and loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and protein kinase, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), that regulate mitophagy, are causal for familial and juvenile PD1-3. Among several therapeutic approaches being explored to treat or improve PD patients prognosis, the use of small molecules able to reinstate or boost Parkin activity represents a potential pharmacological treatment strategy4. A major barrier is the lack of high throughput platforms based on robust and accurate quantification of Parkin activity in vitro. Here we present two different and complementary Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) based approaches for the quantification of Parkin E3 ligase activity in vitro. These methods recapitulate distinct aspects of ubiquitin conjugation: Parkin auto-ubiquitylation and Parkin-catalysed discharge on lysine residues.

In spite of an enormous amount of organic and inorganic NIR-II fluorophores developed, there is no NIR-II fluorescent protein reported. Here, we present the first NIR-II fluorescent protein, IRFP1032 which exhibits strong exciton absorption and emission in the NIR-II region, with exciton extinction coefficient about 4.1 x106 M-1cm-1 at the excitation maximum 1008 nm, emission maximum of 1032 nm, and emission quantum yield about 0.84%. The IRFP1032 is found to be the brightest NIR-II fluorophore ever reported (brightness of 3.4 x 104 M-1cm-1 in PBS) which is thousands-fold brighter than IR26 in DCM. Taking the advantage of the excellent photo-properties of the NIR-II fluorescent proteins, a collection of high-quality in vivo imaging research was realized, for instance, real time observation of blood flow dynamics, dual-channel imaging of the lymphatic/blood vessel network and the trajectories of single bacterial cell travelling in blood vessels. Moreover, a mammalian expression vector was constructed for the IRFP1032, and the corresponding NIR-II fluorescence was able to be recorded unambiguously. The promising NIR-II in vivo imaging properties of IRPF1032 demonstrated here would open a new scene in fluorescent protein-based imaging.",

Retromer has been implicated in other cellular events, including mitochondrial homeostasis, nutrient sensing, autophagy, and fission events. Mechanisms for mammalian retromer assembly remain undefined, and retromer engages multiple sorting nexin proteins to sort cargoes to different destinations. Published structures demonstrate mammalian retromer forms oligomers in vitro, but several structures were poorly resolved. We report here improved retromer oligomer structures using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) by combining data collected from tilted specimens with multiple improvements in data processing, including using a three-dimensional (3D) starting model for improved automated particle picking in RELION. A retromer mutant (3KE retromer) that breaks VPS35-mediated interfaces was used to determine a structure of a new assembly interface formed by the VPS26A and VPS35 N-termini. The interface reveals how an N-terminal VPS26A arrestin saddle can link retromer chains by engaging a neighboring VPS35 N-terminus, on the opposite side from the well-characterized C-VPS26/N-VPS35 interaction observed within heterotrimers. The new interaction interface exhibits substantial buried surface area ([~]7,000 [A]2) and further suggests metazoan retromer may serve as an adaptable scaffold.",

    "abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a class of highly negatively charged membrane associated and extracellular matrix polysaccharides involved in the regulation of myriad biological functions, including cell adhesion, migration, signaling and differentiation, among others. GAGs are typically attached to core proteins, termed proteoglycans (PGs), and can engage >500 binding proteins, making them prominent relays for sensing external stimuli and transducing cellular responses. However, their unique substructural protein-recognition domains that confer their binding specificity remain elusive. While the emergence of glycan arrays has rapidly enabled the profiling of ligand specificities of a range of glycan-binding proteins, their adaptation for the analysis of GAG-binding proteins has been considerably more challenging. Current GAG-microarrays primarily employ synthetically defined oligosaccharides, which capture only a fraction of the structural diversity of native GAG polysaccharides. Augmenting existing array platforms to include GAG structures purified from tissues or produced in cells with engineered glycan biosynthetic pathways may significantly advance the understanding of structure-activity relationships in GAG-protein interactions. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and tunable strategy to mimic cellular proteoglycan architectures by conjugating biologically-derived GAG chains to a protein scaffold, defined as neoproteoglycans (neoPGs). The use of a reactive fluorogenic linker enabled real-time monitoring of the conjugation reaction efficiency and tuning of the neoPG valency. Immobilization of the reagents on a 96-well array platform allowed for efficient probing of ligand binding and enzyme substrate specificity, including growth factors and the human sulfatase 1. The neoPGs can also be used directly as soluble probes to evaluate GAG-dependent growth factor signaling in cells.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482917v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a51f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f99e16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f9c5b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@242d9a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "High salt stress continually challenges growth and survival of many plants, but the underlying molecular basis is not fully explored. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) produces mRNAs with different 3'UTRs (alternative 3'UTRs) to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. However, the roles of such process in response to salt stress remain elusive. Here, we reported that alternative 3'UTRs responded to high salt stress in the halophyte-Spartina alterniflora, which tolerant to hash salt environment. High salt stress induced the global APA and increased the prevalence of APA events. Strikingly, high salt stress significantly led to 3' UTR lengthening of 207 transcripts through increasing the usage of distal poly(A) sites. Transcripts with alternative 3' UTRs were mainly enriched in salt stress related ion transporters. Alternative 3' UTRs of SaHKT1 increased RNA stability and protein synthesis in vivo. Regulatory AU-rich elements were identified in the alternative 3' UTRs and alternative 3' UTRs increased protein level of SaHKT1 in an AU-rich element dependent manner. Finally, 3' UTR lengthening might result from variations in poly(A) signals and poly(A) factors. Overall, these results suggest that APA is a potential novel high salt stress responsive mechanism by modulating mRNA 3' UTR length. These results also reveal complex regulator roles of alternative 3' UTRs coupling alternative polyadenylation and regulatory elements at post-transcriptional level in plants.\n\nOne sentence summaryAlternative 3' UTRs acts as a potential novel mechanism in gene expression regulation of high salt tolerant genes",

However, under all ambient storage conditions, DNA undergoes a slow chemical decay process resulting in nicked (broken) DNA strands, and the information stored in these strands is no longer readable. In this work we design an enzymatic repair procedure, which is applicable to the DNA pool prior to readout and can partially reverse the damage. Through a chemical understanding of the decay process, an overhang at the 3 end of the damaged site is identified as obstructive to repair via the base excision-repair (BER) mechanism. The obstruction can be removed via the enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease I (APE1), thereby enabling repair of hydrolytically damaged DNA via Bst polymerase and Taq ligase. Simulations of damage and repair reveal the benefit of the enzymatic repair step for DNA data storage, especially when data is stored in DNA at high storage densities (= low physical redundancy) and for long time durations.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the central portal for macromolecular exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In all eukaryotes, NPCs assemble into an intact nuclear envelope (NE) during interphase, but the process of NPC biogenesis remains poorly characterized. Furthermore, little is known about how NPC assembly leads to the fusion of the outer and inner NE, and no factors have been identified that could trigger this event. Here we characterize the transmembrane protein Brl1 as an NPC assembly factor required for NE fusion in budding yeast. Brl1 preferentially associates with NPC assembly intermediates and its depletion halts NPC biogenesis, leading to NE herniations that contain inner and outer ring nucleoporins but lack the cytoplasmic export platform. Furthermore, we identify an essential amphipathic helix in the luminal domain of Brl1 that mediates interactions with lipid bilayers. Mutations in this amphipathic helix lead to NPC assembly defects, and cryo-ET analyses reveal multi-layered herniations of the inner nuclear membrane with NPC-like structures at the neck, indicating a failure in NE fusion. Taken together, our results identify a role for Brl1 in NPC assembly and suggest a function of its amphipathic helix in mediating the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes.",

In vertebrates the role of thyroid hormones (TH) in triggering this transition is well known, but how the morphological and physiological changes are integrated in a coherent way with the ecological transition remains poorly explored. To gain insight into this question, we performed an integrative analysis of metamorphosis of a marine teleost, the clownfish Amphiprion ocellaris. We reveal how TH coordinate a change in color vision as well as a major metabolic shift in energy production, hence highlighting its central integrative role in regulating this transformation. By manipulating the activity of LXR, a major regulator of metabolism, we also reveal a tight link between metabolic changes and metamorphosis progression. Strikingly, we observed that these regulations are at play in the wild revealing how hormones coordinate energy needs with available resources during life cycle.",

However, the approaches for precise control over the genome editing and regulatory events are still desirable. Here, we reported a spatiotemporal and efficient CRISPR/Cas9 and Cpf1-mediated editing with photo-sensitive circular gRNAs. This approach relies on only two or three pre-installed photolabile substituents followed by a simple covalent cyclization, which provides a robust synthesize approach in comparison to heavily modified gRNAs. In established cells stably expressing Cas9, the circular gRNA in coordination with light irradiation could direct a precise cleavage of GFP and VEGFA within a pre-defined cutting region. We have also achieved light-mediated MSTN gene editing in embryos, whereas a new bow-knot-type gRNA showed no background editing in the absence of light irradiation. Together, our work provides a significantly improved method to precisely manipulate where and when genes are edited.",

Here, we assemble micron-length DNA nanotubes and assess their performance as pipes for controlled ion transport. DNA nanotubes grow via assembly of DNA tiles from a seed pore, a 12-helix DNA origami cylinder functionalized with cholesterol, to form a DNA nanotube channel. The central channel of a nanotube can be obstructed via Watson-Crick hybridization of a channel cap, a second DNA origami structure, to the end of a nanotube channel or a nanotube seed pore. Single-channel electrophysiological characterization shows that both nanotube seed pores and nanotube channels display ohmic ion conductance consistent with their central channels diameters. Binding of the channel cap reduces the conductances of both DNA nanotube channels and seed pores, demonstrating control of ion-transport through these micron-length channels. Because these channels could be assembled into branched architectures or routed between specific molecular terminals, these results suggest a route to self-assembling nanofluidic devices and circuits in which transport can be controlled using dynamic biomolecular interactions.",

We found that type III, but not type I, interferons serve a central role in the restitution process. Type III interferons induce the upregulation of ZBP1, caspase activation, and cleavage of gasdermin C, and drive epithelial cell death by pyroptosis, thus delaying tissue restitution. We also found that this pathway is transcriptionally regulated in IBD patients. Our findings highlight a new molecular signaling cascade initiated by the immune system that affects the outcome of the immune response by delaying tissue repair and that may have important implications for human inflammatory disorders.",

    "abstract": "1.Comparative morphology fundamentally relies on the orientation and alignment of specimens. In the era of geometric morphometrics, point-based homologies are commonly deployed to register specimens and their landmarks in a shared coordinate system. However, the number of point-based homologies commonly diminishes with increasing phylogenetic breadth. These situations invite alternative, often conflicting, approaches to alignment. The bivalve shell (Mollusca: Bivalvia) exemplifies a homologous structure with few universally homologous points--only one can be identified across the Class, the shell  beak. Here, we develop an axis-based framework, grounded in the homology of shell features, to orient shells for landmark-based, comparative morphology. As the choice of homologous points for alignment can affect shape differences among specimens, so can the choice of orientation axes. Analysis of forty-five possible alignment schemes finds general conformity among the shape differences of  typical equilateral shells, but the shape differences among atypical shells can change considerably, particularly those with distinctive modes of growth. Each alignment implies a hypothesis about the ecological, developmental, or evolutionary basis of morphological differences, but we recognize one alignment in particular as a continuation of the historical approaches to morphometrics of shell form: orientation via the hinge line. Beyond bivalves, this axis-based approach to aligning specimens facilitates the comparison of continuous differences in shape among many other phylogenetically broad and morphologically disparate samples.",

We present a multi-population framework for adjusting DNA methylation beta values on the Illumina 450/850K platform using generic purity estimates to account for non-tumor signal. Our approach also provides an indirect estimate of the aggregate methylation state of the surrounding normal tissue.

How cells control filopodia initiation on the plasma membrane remains elusive. We performed experiments in cellulo, in vitro and in silico to unravel the mechanism of filopodia initiation driven by the membrane curvature sensor IRSp53. We showed that full-length IRSp53 self-assembles into clusters on membranes depending on PIP2. Using well-controlled in vitro reconstitution systems, we demonstrated that IRSp53 clusters recruit the actin polymerase VASP to assemble actin filaments locally on membranes, leading to the generation of actin-filled membrane protrusions reminiscent of filopodia. By pulling membrane nanotubes from live cells, we observed that IRSp53 can only be enriched and trigger actin assembly in nanotubes at highly dynamic membrane regions. Our work supports a regulation mechanism of IRSp53 in its attributes of curvature sensation and partner recruitment to ensure a precise spatial-temporal control of filopodia initiation.",

    "abstract": "Stereopsis is traditionally measured with noise-based stereo tests while the observer views the test in primary gaze. We investigated the effect of stimulus sparseness and axial variations of interocular disparity induced via head rotations.\n\nFirst, we measured stereoacuity using a 4-Alternative-Forced-Choice (4-AFC) task with three uncrossed and one crossed disparity bandpass-filtered circles on a passive-3-D-monitor. Ten binocularly-normal adults fixated a central cross and clicked on the circle withcrossed disparity for forty trials/condition. Observers adopted head tilts of 0{degrees} or {+/-}20{degrees} pitch, roll, or yaw, enforced with an innertial measurement unit and fixation enforced with an eye tracker. Next, we measured stereoacuity in 8 adults while either the head (H), monitor (M), or both (B) were tilted 0{degrees}, {+/-}22.5{degrees}, or {+/-}45{degrees} roll in random order (eighty trials/condition) using a 4-AFC task and random-dot stimuli. Head tilts did not signifcantly alter stereoacuity using narrow-band stimuli(p>0.05), despite that IPDs and the axis of disparity were differentially affected by the tilts. However, for random dot stimuli, stereoacuity decreased with increasing orientation difference between the head and monitor (H and M: p<0.05; B: p>0.05].\n\nHead tilt decreases IPD and rotates the axis of interocular disparity, however, these manipulations affect stereoacuity when measured with noise stimuli but not with sparse stimuli. The results are consistent with a vestibular input to stereoscopic disparity processing that can be detected by sparse stimuli but is masked by dense stimuli. The results have implications for natural vision and for clinical screening in patients with abnormal head posture.\n\nSignificance statementDepth perception is a critical feature of human vision and it is thought that the ability to perceive stereoscopic depth is bound to an essentially eye-fixed, horizontal disparity of each image that rapidly deteriorates away from that limited horizontal axis. In a set of head tilt experiments, we varied the orientations of stereoscopic images and demonstrate that stereoacuity remains constant when deploying sparse narrow-band stimuli, and only worsens when using fine-detailed noise stimuli that mask off-axis disparities. These results shine new light upon the debate of neuroplasticity of stereo vision. Moreover, the results are consequential for diagnosis and treatment in people with atypical head- and eye alignment, such as for patients with torticollis or strabismus.",

As sputum sampling is challenging in children and cachexic patients, the development of diagnostic tests using saliva appears promising but has been discouraged due to low bacterial load and the poor sensitivity. We present a novel and rapid method to enrich Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) from saliva, which may serve as a basis for a diagnostic saliva test.\n\nMethodsLipobiotin-functionalized magnetic beads (LMBs) were incubated with Mtb-spiked PBS and saliva from healthy donors as well as with saliva from TB patients. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the capacity of the beads to bind Mtb, while real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was utilized to detect Mtb and estimate the amount of mycobacterial DNA in different sample types.\n\nResultsWe found that LMBs bind Mtb efficiently when compared to non-functionalized beads. The development of an qPCR assay based on the use of LMBs (LMB assay) allowed us to enrich mycobacterial DNA in spiked sample types, including PBS and saliva from healthy donors (enrichment of up to 8.7 fold). In Mtb-spiked saliva samples, we found that the LMB assay improved the detection rate of 102 bacteria in a volume of 5 ml from 0 out of 15 (0%) to 6 out of 15 (40%). Consistent with that, the LMB assay increased the rate of correctly identified saliva samples from TB patients in two independent cohorts.\n\nConclusionsImplementation of the principle of the LMB-based assay may improve the sensitivity of existing diagnostic techniques, e.g. by functionalizing materials that facilitate Mtb sampling from the oral cavity.",

Such infections are particularly dangerous for risk group patients, for whom they represent a life-threatening disease. To invent novel strategies to control contamination and disease, it is important to identify those cellular processes that maintain pathogen growth in- and outside the host. We here have applied transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) to L. monocytogenes for the identification of such processes on a genome-wide scale. Our approach classified 394 open reading frames as essential for growth under standard laboratory conditions and identified 42 further genes, which become additionally essential during intracellular growth in macrophages. Most essential genes encode components of the translation machinery, act in chromosome-related processes, cell division and biosynthesis of the cellular envelope. Several cofactor biosynthesis pathways and 29 genes with unknown functions were also essential, opening novel options for the development of anti- listerial drugs. Among the genes specifically required during intracellular growth were known virulence factors, genes compensating intracellular auxotrophies and several cell division genes. Our experiments also highlight the importance of PASTA kinase signalling, glycine metabolism and chromosome segregation for efficient intracellular growth of L. monocytogenes.",

To probe the molecular basis for how biology designs the protein fold to achieve balance between sequence, function and structure contributing to AATD in the population, we measured the intracellular monomer and polymer, secreted monomer and polymer and NE inhibitory activity of 75 alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) variants. To address the complex folding dynamics affecting the form and function of the protein fold that is differentially impacted by variants in the population, we applied a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning approach termed variation spatial profiling (VSP). By using a sparse collection of extant variants to link genotype to phenotype, VSP maps spatial covariance (SCV) relationships that quantitate the functional value of every residue in the wild-type (WT) AAT sequence with defined uncertainty in the context of its protein fold design. The SCV-based uncertainty allows us to pinpoint critical short- and long-range residue interactions involving 3 regions-the N-terminal (N1), middle (M2) and carboxyl-terminal (C3) of AAT polypeptide sequence that differentially contribute to the balance between function and misfolding of AAT, thus providing an unanticipated platform for precision therapeutic development for liver and lung disease. By understanding mechanistically the complex fold design of the metastable WT AAT fold, we posit that GPR-based SCV provides a foundation for understanding the evolutionary design of the fold from the ensemble of structures found in the population driving biology for precision management of AATD in the individual.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsFarnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile acid metabolism and FXR null (Fxr-/-) mice have elevated bile acid levels and progressive liver injury. The inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway is a protective pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is activated in response to ER stress. In this study we sought to determine the role of the UPR in Fxr-/- mice.\n\nApproach & ResultsWe examined hepatic UPR gene and protein expression in 10- and 24-week-old wild type (WT) and Fxr-/- mice. Hepatic XBP1 and other UPR pathways were activated in 24-week-old Fxr-/- mice, but not WT mice. To further determine the role of the liver UPR activation in Fxr-/- mice, we generated mice with FXR and liver-specific XBP1 double knockout (DKO, Fxr-/-Xbp1LKO) and Fxr-/- Xbp1fl/fl single knockout (SKO) mice and characterized their phenotypes at different ages. DKO mice demonstrated enhanced liver injury, apoptosis and fibrosis compared with SKO mice. RNA-seq revealed increased gene expression in apoptosis, inflammation and cell proliferation pathways in DKO mice. The proapoptotic C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) pathway was activated in DKO mice. At age 60 weeks, all DKO mice and no SKO mice spontaneously developed liver tumors.\n\nConclusionsThe hepatic XBP1 pathway is activated in older Fxr-/- mice and has a protective role. The potential interaction between XBP1 and FXR signaling may be important in modulating the hepatocellular cholestatic stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide composition is suggested to infer gene functionality and ecological adaptation of species to distinct environments. However, the underlying biological function of nucleotide composition dictating environmental adaptations is largely unknown. Here, we systematically analyzed the nucleotide compositions of transcriptomes across 1000 plants (1KP) and their corresponding habitats. Intriguingly, we found that plants growing in cold climates have guanine (G)-enriched transcriptomes, which are prone to forming RNA G-quadruplex structures. Both immunofluorescence detection and in vivo structure profiling revealed that RNA G-quadruplex formation in plants was globally enhanced in response to cold. Cold-responsive RNA G-quadruplexes strongly enhanced mRNA stability, rather than affecting translation. Disruption of individual RNA G-quadruplex promoted mRNA decay in the cold, leading to impaired plant cold response. Therefore, we propose that plants adopted RNA G-quadruplex structure as a molecular marker to facilitate their adaptation to the cold during evolution.",

    "abstract": "The lungs have a remarkable capacity to repair. However, repetitive injury can lead to progressive fibrosis and end-stage organ failure. Whether tissue-resident mesenchymal cell populations retain epigenetic memory of prior injuries that contribute to this pathological process is unknown. Here we used a genetic lineage labeling approach to mark the lung mesenchyme prior to injury, then performed multi-modal analyses on isolated lung mesenchyme during the initiation, progression and resolution of the fibrotic response. Our results demonstrate the remarkable epigenetic and transcriptional plasticity of the lung mesenchyme during fibrogenic activation and de-activation. Despite this plasticity, we also find that the lung mesenchyme retains specific epigenetic traits (memory) of prior activation, resulting in amplified induction of a fibrogenic program upon re-injury. We identify Runx1 as a critical driver of both fibrogenic activation and epigenetic memory. Comparison of fresh isolated and cultured lung mesenchyme demonstrates that Runx1 is spontaneously activated in standard culture conditions, previously masking these roles of Runx1. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of Runx1 dampens fibrogenic mesenchymal cell activation in cell and tissue models, confirming its functional importance. Finally, publicly available scRNAseq data reveal selective expression of Runx1 in the fibrogenic cell subpopulations that emerge in mouse and human fibrotic lung tissue. Collectively, our findings implicate Runx1 in both the initiation and memory of fibrogenic mesenchymal cell activation that together prime amplified mesenchymal cell responses upon repeated injury.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is fundamental for understanding biochemical processes. Many methods have been established to identify and study direct PPIs; however, the screening and investigation of PPIs involving large or poorly soluble proteins remain challenging. As a result, we developed ReLo, a simple, rapid, and versatile cell culture-based method for detecting and investigating interactions in a cellular context. Importantly, our data strongly suggest that with ReLo specifically direct binary PPIs are detected. By applying additional bridging experiments ReLo can also be used to determine the binding topology of subunits within multiprotein complexes. Moreover, ReLo has the potential to identify protein domains that mediate complex formation, screen for interfering point mutations, study interactions that depend on conformation or protein arginine methylation, and it is sensitive to drugs that mediate or interfere with an interaction. Taken together, ReLo is a simple and quick alternative for the study of PPIs particularly when established methods fail.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of cell physiology. EGFR is activated by ligand binding, triggering receptor dimerization, activation of kinase activity, and intracellular signaling. EGFR is transiently confined within various plasma membrane nanodomains, yet how this may contribute to regulation of EGFR ligand binding is poorly understood. To resolve how EGFR nanoscale compartmentalization gates ligand binding, we developed single-particle tracking methods to track the mobility of ligand-bound and total EGFR, in combination with modeling of EGFR ligand binding. In comparison to unliganded EGFR, ligand-bound EGFR was more confined and distinctly regulated by clathrin and tetraspanin nanodomains. Ligand binding to unliganded EGFR occurred preferentially in tetraspanin nanodomains, and disruption of tetraspanin nanodomains impaired EGFR ligand binding and altered the conformation of the receptors ectodomain. We thus reveal a novel mechanism by which EGFR confinement within tetraspanin nanodomains regulates receptor signaling at the level of ligand binding.",

    "abstract": "How interphase chromatin compacts into mitotic chromosomes has eluded researchers for over a century. Here we show that PHF13, a tightly regulated H3K4me epigenetic reader, and cohesin, a mediator of chromatin architecture, cooperate to drive polymer-polymer-phase-separation (PPPS) and higher order compaction of chromatin into chromosomes. PHF13 interacts with cohesin, shows similar dynamics during mitosis, and their co-depletion dramatically impairs mitotic condensation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PHF13 stabilizes cohesin chromatin interactions and that itself oligomerizes, resulting in a polymer with increased chromatin avidity and the ability to bridge neighboring and distant nucleosomes. Consistently, molecular dynamic simulations modelling the ability of PHF13 and cohesin to drive chromatin phase separations recapitulated our in vivo observations and are in line with 2-step condensation models.",

    "abstract": "TORC1 is a critical controller of cell growth in eukaryotes. In yeast, the presence of nutrients is signaled to TORC1 by several upstream regulatory sensors that together coordinate TORC1 activity. TORC1 localizes to both vacuolar and endosomal membranes, where differential signaling occurs. This localization is mimicked by Pib2, a key upstream TORC1 regulator that is essential for TORC1 reactivation after nutrient starvation or pharmacological inhibition. Pib2 has both positive and negative effects on TORC1 activity, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we pinpoint the Pib2 inhibitory function on TORC1 to residues within short, conserved N-terminal regions. We also show that Pib2 C-terminal regions, helical region E and tail, are essential for TORC1 reactivation. Further, the Pib2 FYVE domain is essential for vacuolar localization, however, it is surprisingly unnecessary for recovery from rapamycin exposure. Using chimeric Pib2 targeting constructs, we show that endosomal localization is not necessary for TORC1 reactivation and cell growth after rapamycin treatment. Thus, a comprehensive molecular dissection of Pib2 demonstrates that each of its conserved regions differentially contribute to Pib2 regulation of TORC1 activity.",
