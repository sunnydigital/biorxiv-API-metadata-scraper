    "abstract": "While the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in both animals and plants depends on the RNase III Dicer, its partner proteins are considered distinct for each kingdom. Nevertheless, recent discovery of homologs of Hyponastic Leaves1 (HYL1), a \"plant-specific\" Dicer partner, in the metazoan phylum Cnidaria, challenges the view that miRNAs evolved convergently in animals and plants. Here we show that the HYL1 homolog Hyl1-like a (Hyl1La) is crucial for development and miRNA biogenesis in the cnidarian model Nematostella vectensis. Inhibition of Hyl1La by morpholinos resulted in metamorphosis arrest in Nematostella embryos and a significant reduction in levels of most miRNAs. Further, meta-analysis of morphants of miRNA biogenesis components, like Dicer1, shows clustering of their miRNA profiles with Hyl1La morphants. Strikingly, immunoprecipitation of Hyl1La followed by quantitative PCR revealed that in contrast to the plant HYL1, Hyl1La interacts only with precursor miRNAs and not with primary miRNAs. This was complemented by an in vitro binding assay of Hyl1La to synthetic precursor miRNA. Altogether, these results suggest that the last common ancestor of animals and plants carried a HYL1 homolog that took essential part in miRNA biogenesis and indicate early emergence of the miRNA system before plants and animals separated.\n\nImpact statementPresence of a functional homolog of HYL1 in Nematostella vectensis, a basal animal model, indicates divergent evolution of miRNA biogenesis pathway in plants and animals from an ancestral miRNA system",

    "abstract": "Though dividing ones attention between two input streams typically impairs performance, detecting a behaviorally relevant stimulus can sometimes enhance the encoding of unrelated information presented at the same time. Previous research has shown that selection of this kind boosts visual cortical activity and memory for concurrent items. An important unanswered question is whether such effects are reflected in processing quality and functional connectivity in visual regions and in the hippocampus. In this fMRI study, participants were asked to memorize a stream of naturalistic images and press a button only when they heard a predefined target tone (400 or 1200 Hz, counterbalanced). Images could be presented with a target tone, with a distractor tone, or without a tone. Auditory target detection increased activity throughout the ventral visual cortex but lowered it in the hippocampus. Enhancements in functional connectivity between the ventral visual cortex and the hippocampus were also observed following auditory targets. Multi-voxel pattern classification of image category was more accurate on target tone trials than on distractor and no tone trials in the fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. This effect was stronger in visual cortical clusters whose activity was more correlated with the hippocampus on target tone than on distractor tone trials. In agreement with accounts suggesting that subcortical noradrenergic influences play a role in the attentional boost effect, auditory target detection also caused an increase in locus coeruleus activity and phasic pupil responses. These findings outline a network of cortical and subcortical regions that are involved in the selection and processing of information presented at behaviorally relevant moments.",

    "abstract": "Co-transcriptional splicing coordinates the processes of transcription and splicing and is driven by transcription factors (TFs) and diverse RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Yet the mechanisms by which specific TFs and RBPs function together in context-specific ways to drive precise co-transcriptional splicing at each of thousands of genomic loci remains unknown. Therefore, we have used sex-specific splicing in Drosophila as a model to understand how the function of TFs and RBPs is coordinated to transcribe and process specific RNA transcripts at the correct genomic locations. We show widespread sex-specific transcript diversity occurs much earlier than previously thought and present a new pipeline called time2splice to quantify splicing changes over time. We define several mechanisms by which the essential and functionally-conserved CLAMP TF functions with specific RBPs to precisely regulate co-transcriptional splicing: 1) CLAMP links the DNA of gene bodies of sex-specifically spliced genes directly to the RNA of target genes and physically interacts with snRNA and protein components of the splicing machinery; 2) In males, CLAMP regulates the distribution of the highly conserved RBP Maleless (MLE) (RNA Helicase A) to prevent aberrant sex-specific splicing; 3) In females, CLAMP modulates alternative splicing by directly binding to target DNA and RNA and indirectly through regulating the splicing of sex lethal, the master regulator of sex determination. Overall, we provide new insight into how TFs function specifically with RBPs to drive alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "RNA-Seq data analysis of non-model organisms is often difficult because of the lack of a well-annotated genome. In model organisms, after short reads are mapped to the genome, it is possible to focus on the analysis of regions well-annotated regions. However, in non-model organisms, contigs can be generated by de novo assembling. This can result in a large number of transcripts, making it difficult to easily remove redundancy. A large number of transcripts can also lead to difficulty in the recognition of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between more than two experimental conditions, because P-values must be corrected by considering multiple comparison corrections whose effect is enhanced as the number of transcripts increases. Heavily corrected P-values often fail to take sufficiently small P-values as significant. In this study, we applied a recently proposed tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to the RNA-seq data obtained for a non-model organism, Planarian; we successfully obtained a limited number of transcripts whose expression was altered between normal and defective samples as well as during time development. TD-based unsupervised FE is expected to be an effective tool that can identify a limited number of DETs, even when a poorly annotated genome is available.",

    "abstract": "A cardinal feature of the auditory pathway is frequency selectivity, represented in a tonotopic map from the cochlea to the cortex. The molecular determinants of the auditory frequency map are unknown. Here, we discovered that the transcription factor ISL1 regulates the molecular and cellular features of auditory neurons, including the formation of the spiral ganglion and peripheral and central processes that shape the tonotopic representation of the auditory map. We selectively knocked out Isl1 in auditory neurons using Neurod1Cre strategies. In the absence of Isl1, spiral ganglion neurons migrate into the central cochlea and beyond, and the cochlear wiring is profoundly reduced and disrupted. The central axons of Isl1 mutants lose their topographic projections and segregation at the cochlear nucleus. Transcriptome analysis of spiral ganglion neurons shows that Isl1 regulates neurogenesis, axonogenesis, migration, neurotransmission-related machinery, and synaptic communication patterns. We show that peripheral disorganization in the cochlea affects the physiological properties of hearing in the midbrain and auditory behavior. Surprisingly, auditory processing features are preserved despite the significant hearing impairment, revealing central auditory pathway resilience and plasticity in Isl1 mutant mice. Mutant mice have a reduced acoustic startle reflex, altered prepulse inhibition, and characteristics of compensatory neural hyperactivity centrally. Our findings show that ISL1 is one of the obligatory factors required to sculpt auditory structural and functional tonotopic maps. Still, upon Isl1 deletion, the ensuing central compensatory plasticity of the auditory pathway does not suffice to overcome developmentally induced peripheral dysfunction of the cochlea.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state called anhydrobiosis and resume their animation upon rehydration. Dehydrated tardigrades are exceptionally stable and withstand various physical extremes. Although trehalose and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins have been extensively studied as potent protectants against dehydration in other anhydrobiotic organisms, tardigrades produce high amounts of tardigrade-unique protective proteins. Cytoplasmic-abundant heat-soluble (CAHS) proteins are uniquely invented in the lineage of eutardigrades, a major class of the phylum Tardigrada and are essential for their anhydrobiotic survival. However, the precise mechanisms of their action in this protective role are not fully understood. In the present study, we first postulated the presence of tolerance proteins that form protective condensates via phase separation in a stress-dependent manner and searched for tardigrade proteins that reversibly form condensates upon dehydration-like stress. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified 336 such proteins, collectively dubbed \"Desolvataion-induced ReversiblY condensing Proteins (DRYPs)\". Unexpectedly, we rediscovered CAHS proteins as highly enriched in DRYPs, 3 of which were major components of DRYPs. We revealed that these CAHS proteins reversibly polymerize into many cytoskeleton-like filaments depending on hyperosmotic stress in cultured cells and undergo reversible gel-transition in vitro. CAHS filamentation increases cell stiffness to resist deformation and improves resistance to dehydration-like stress. The conserved putative helical C-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for filament formation by CAHS proteins, and mutations disrupting the secondary structure of this region impaired both the filament formation and the gel transition. On the basis of these results, we propose that CAHS proteins are novel cytoskeletal proteins that form filamentous networks and undergo gel-transition in a stress-dependent manner to provide on-demand physical stabilization of cell integrity against deformative forces during dehydration and also contribute to the exceptional physical stability in a dehydrated state.",

    "abstract": "Backgrounds: Intrahepatic infiltration of neutrophils is a character of alcoholic acute-on-chronic liver failure (AACLF) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an important strategy for neutrophils to fix and kill invading microorganisms. Intestinal bacteria and the gut-liver axis have been thought to play a key role in many liver diseases also including AACLF. However, whether NETs appear in AACLF and play a role in AACLF is still unsure. Methods: WT, NE KO, and TLR4 KO mice were used to build the AACLF model, and the intestinal bacteria were eliminated at the same time and LPS was given. Then the formation of NETs and AACLF related markers were detected. Results: The serum MPO-DNA and LPS concentration was increased in AACLF patients and a correlation was revealed between these two indexes. More intrahepatic NETs formed in AACLF mice by testing MPO-DNA, Cit H3, and NE. These markers decreased with gut detergent and restored markers with gut detergent plus LPS supplement. While NETs formation failed to change with gut microbiome or combine LPS supplement in TLR4 KO mice. As we tested AACLF related characters, liver injury, intrahepatic fat deposition, inflammation, and fibrosis alleviated with depletion of NE. These related marks were also attenuated with gut sterilization by antibiotics and recovered with combined treatment with antibiotics plus LPS. But the liver injury, intrahepatic fat, fibro deposition, and liver inflammation-related markers did show a significant difference in TLR4 KO mice when they received the same treatment. Conclusion: Intestinal-derived LPS promotes NETs formation in AACLF through the TLR4 pathway and further accelerates the AACLF process by NETs.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionComputational models are often used to assess how functional connectivity (FC) patterns emerge from neuronal population dynamics and anatomical connections in the brain. However, group averaged data is often used in this context and it remains unclear whether individual predictions of FC patterns using this approach can be made. Here, we assess the value of using individualized structural data for simulation of individual whole-brain FC.\n\nMethodsThe Jansen and Rit neural mass model was employed, where masses were coupled using individual structural connectivity (SC) obtained from diffusion weighted imaging. Simulated FC was correlated to individual magnetoencephalography-derived empirical FC. FC was estimated using both phase-based (phase lag index (PLI), phase locking value (PLV)) and amplitude-based (amplitude envelope correlation (AEC)) metrics to analyze the goodness-of-fit of different metrics for individual predictions. Prediction of individual FC was compared against the prediction of group averaged FC. We further tested whether SC of a different participant could equally well predict a participants FC pattern.\n\nResultsThe AEC provided a significantly better match between individually simulated and empirical FC than phase-based metrics. Simulations with individual SC provided higher correlations between simulated and empirical FC compared to using the group-averaged SC. However, using SC from other participants resulted in similar correlations between simulated and empirical FC compared to using participants own SC.\n\nDiscussionThis work underlines the added value of FC simulations based on individual instead of group-averaged SC, and could aid in a better understanding of mechanisms underlying individual functional network trajectories in neurological disease.\n\nImpact statementIn this work, we investigated how well individual empirical functional connectivity can be simulated using the individuals structural connectivity matrix combined with neural mass modeling. Our research highlights the potential added value of using individual simulations of functional connectivity, and could aid in a better understanding of mechanisms underlying individual functional network trajectories in neurological disease. Moreover, individualized prediction of disease trajectories could enhance patient care and may provide better treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a dimorphic human fungal pathogen that can cause severe oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC, oral thrush) in susceptible hosts. During invasive infection, C. albicans hyphae invade oral epithelial cells (OECs) and secrete candidalysin, a pore-forming cytolytic peptide that is required for fungal pathogenesis at mucosal surfaces. Candidalysin induces cell damage and activates multiple MAPK-based innate signaling events that collectively drive the production of downstream inflammatory mediators. The activities of candidalysin are also dependent on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but how these signals are integrated is undefined. Here, we identified five essential adaptor proteins as key mediators of the epithelial response to C. albicans infection on cultured OECs, including growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2), Grb2-associated-binding protein 1 (Gab1), Src homology and collagen (Shc), SH2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) and casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl). All these signaling effectors were inducibly phosphorylated in response to C. albicans, in a candidalysin-dependent mechanism but additionally required EGFR phosphorylation, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cellular calcium flux. Of these, Gab1, Grb2 and Shp2 were the dominant drivers of ERK1/2 signaling and production of downstream cytokines. Together, these results identify the key adaptor proteins that drive EGFR signaling mechanisms, which determine oral epithelial responses to C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are used by scientists to serve a variety of purposes in clinical practice and laboratory research. To optimize proteins for greater function, a variety of techniques have been developed. For the development of reporter genes used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based on Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), these techniques have encountered a variety of challenges. Here we develop a mechanism of protein optimization using a computational approach known as \"genetic programming\". We developed an algorithm called Protein Optimization Evolving Tool (POET). Starting from a small library of literature values, use of this tool allowed us to develop proteins which produce four times more MRI contrast than what was previously state-of-the-art. Next, we used POET to evolve peptides that produced CEST-MRI contrast at large chemical shifts where no other known peptides have previously demonstrated contrast. This demonstrated the ability of POET to evolve new functions in proteins. Interestingly, many of the peptides produced using POET were dramatically different with respect to their sequence and chemical environment than existing CEST producing peptides, and challenge prior understandings of how those peptides function. This suggests that unlike existing algorithms for protein engineering that rely on divergent evolution, POET relies on convergent evolution.",

The liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) express scavenging receptors that recognize, bind, and internalize an enormous diversity of extracellular ligands. The Fc gamma receptor Fc{gamma}RIIB or CD32B on LSECs is responsible for the clearance of a large majority of IgG-bound immune complexes in the liver. Investigating the pharmacological effects of antibody clearance via human liver in vitro has been challenging due to the lack of reliable long-term LSEC culture protocols. Human LSECs downregulate the expression of CD32B rapidly in vitro in traditional 2D LSEC mono- and co-cultures. We describe a Liver-Chip model with a co-culture of primary human LSECs and hepatocytes to recreate the liver microenvironment and extend the viability and function of LSECs, including CD32B expression levels, for a duration that is relevant for assessing the pharmacokinetics (PK) of therapeutic antibodies. Our results show that the expression of CD32B can differ based on experimental variables such as the source of primary cells (donor), passage number or source of detection antibodies used to visualize CD32B and shear stress. The CD32B expression was maintained for 14 days on the Liver-Chip in a donor-dependent but passage number independent manner. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging showed the presence of fenestrae structures - one of the hallmarks of LSEC function. Key LSEC markers, including CD32B expression, were validated through flow cytometry.",

    "abstract": "Cell omics such as single-cell genomics, proteomics and microbiomics allow the characterisation of tissue and microbial community composition, which can be compared between conditions to identify biological drivers. This strategy has been critical to unveiling markers of disease progression such as cancer and pathogen infection. For cell omic data, no method for differential variability analysis exists, and methods for differential composition analysis only take a few fundamental data properties into account. Here we introduce sccomp, a generalised method for differential composition and variability analyses able to jointly model data count distribution, compositionality, group-specific variability and proportion mean-variability association, with awareness against outliers. Sccomp is an extensive analysis framework that allows realistic data simulation and cross-study knowledge transfer. Here, we demonstrate that mean-variability association is ubiquitous across technologies showing the inadequacy of the very popular Dirichlet-multinomial modelling and provide mandatory principles for differential variability analysis. We show that sccomp accurately fits experimental data, with a 50% incremental improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms. Using sccomp, we identified novel differential constraints and composition in the microenvironment of primary breast cancer.\n\nSignificance statementDetermining the composition of cell populations is made possible by technologies like single-cell transcriptomics, CyTOF and microbiome sequencing. Such analyses are now widespread across fields (~800 publications/month, Scopus). However, existing methods for differential abundance do not model all data features, and cell-type/taxa specific differential variability is not yet possible. Increase in the variability of tissue composition and microbial communities is a well-known indicator of loss of homeostasis and disease. A suitable statistical method would enable new types of analyses to identify component-specific loss of homeostasis for the first time. This and other innovations are now possible through our discovery of the mean-variability association for compositional data. Based on this fundamental observation, we have developed a new statistical model, sccomp, that enables differential variability analysis for composition data, improved differential abundance analyses, with cross-sample information borrowing, outlier identification and exclusion, realistic data simulation, based on experimental datasets, cross-study knowledge transfer.",

    "abstract": "Deeper understanding T-cell mediated adaptive immune responses bears important implications in designing cancer immunotherapies and antiviral vaccines against pandemic outbreaks. T cells fire when they recognize foreign peptides that are presented on the cell surface by Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC), forming peptide:MHC (pMHC) complexes. 3D structure of pMHC complexes provides fundamental insight of T-cell recognition mechanism and aids immunotherapy design. High MHC and peptide diversities necessitate efficient computational modelling to enable whole proteome structural analysis.\n\nHere we present PANDORA, a robust pMHC structure modelling pipeline. Given a query, PANDORA searches for structural templates in its extensive database and then applies anchor restraints to the modelling process. This restrained energy minimization ensures one of the fastest pMHC modelling pipelines so far. On a set of 835 pMHC-I complexes over 78 MHC types, PANDORA generated models with a median RMSD of 0.68 [A] and achieved a 93% success rate in top 10 models. PANDORA performs competitively with three pMHC-I modelling state-of-the-art approaches and outperforms AlphaFold in terms of accuracy while being superior to it in speed. PANDORA is a modularized and user-configurable python package with easy installation. We envision PANDORA to fuel deep learning with large-scale high-quality 3D models to tackle long-standing immunology challenges.",

However, it is not known if and how animals regulate their arousal to respond to fluctuating behavioral demands. Here, we show results from mice performing an auditory feature-based sustained attention task with intermittently shifting task utility. We use pupil size to infer arousal across a wide range of states in a large behavioral cohort. We find that mice stabilize their arousal state near an intermediate and optimal level when task utility is high. In contrast, during epochs of low task utility they sample a broader and suboptimal range of arousal states. Using diffusion modeling, we further show that multiple computational elements of attention-based decisionmaking improve during high task utility and that arousal influences some, but not all, of them. Specifically, arousal influences the likelihood and timescale of sensory evidence accumulation, but not its quality. In sum, the results establish a specific attentional signature of adaptively self-regulated arousal and provide an experimental framework for understanding arousal self-regulation in brain disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",

Here, we used trait-based analysis to profile invasive species and quantify the community invasibility for >1,800 North American freshwater fish communities. We show that species with higher reproduction rates, longer life spans and larger sizes tend to be more invasive. Community invasibility peaked when the functional distance among native species was high, leaving unoccupied functional space for the establishment of potential invaders. Invasion success is therefore governed by both the functional traits of non-native species determining their invasiveness, and by the functional characteristics of the invaded community determining its invasibility. Considering those two determinants together will allow better predictions of invasions.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress causes cellular damage including DNA mutations, protein dysfunction and loss of membrane integrity. Here we discovered TrmB (transcription regulator of mal operon) family proteins (Pfam PF01978) composed of a single winged-helix DNA binding domain (InterPro IPR002831) can function as thiol-based transcriptional regulators of oxidative stress responses. Using the archaeon Haloferax volcanii as a model system, we demonstrate that the TrmB-like OxsR is important for recovery of cells from hypochlorite stress. OxsR is shown to bind specific regions of genomic DNA, particularly during hypochlorite stress. OxsR-bound intergenic regions were found proximal to oxidative stress operons including genes associated with thiol relay and low molecular weight thiol biosynthesis. Further analysis of a subset of these sites, revealed OxsR to function during hypochlorite stress as a transcriptional activator and repressor. OxsR was shown to require a conserved cysteine (C24) for function and to use a CG-rich motif upstream of conserved BRE/TATA box promoter elements for transcriptional activation. Protein modeling suggested the C24 is located at a homodimer interface formed by antiparallel  helices, and that oxidation of this cysteine would result in the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond. This covalent linkage may promote stabilization of an OxsR homodimer with the enhanced DNA binding properties observed in the presence of hypochlorite stress. The phylogenetic distribution TrmB family proteins, like OxsR, that have a single winged-helix DNA binding domain and conserved cysteine residue suggests this type of redox signaling mechanism is widespread in Archaea.\n\nImportanceTrmB-like proteins, while not yet correlated with redox stress, are found in bacteria and widespread in archaea. Here we expand annotation of a large group of TrmB-like single winged-helix DNA binding domain proteins from diverse archaea to function as thiol-based transcriptional regulators of oxidative stress response. Using Haloferax volcanii as a model, we reveal the TrmB-like OxsR functions during hypochlorite stress as a transcriptional activator and repressor of an extensive gene co-expression network associated with thiol relay and other related activities. A conserved cysteine residue of OxxR serves as the thiol-based sensor for this function and likely forms an intersubunit disulfide bond during hypochlorite stress that stabilizes a homodimeric configuration with enhanced DNA binding properties. A CG-rich DNA motif in the promoter region of a subset of sites identified to be OxsR-bound is required for regulation; however, not all sites have this motif suggesting added complexity to the regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "During chemotherapy, structural and mechanical changes in malignant cells have been observed in several cancers, including leukaemia and pancreatic and prostate cancer. Such cellular changes may act as physical biomarkers for chemoresistance and cancer recurrence. This study aimed to determine how exposure to paclitaxel affects the intracellular stiffness of human oesophageal cancer of South African origin in vitro. A human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line WHCO1 was cultured on glass substrates (2D) and in collagen gels (3D) and exposed to paclitaxel for up to 48 hours. Cellular morphology and stiffness were assessed with confocal microscopy, visually aided morpho-phenotyping image recognition, and mitochondrial particle tracking microrheology at 24 and 48 hours. In the 2D environment, the intracellular stiffness was higher for the paclitaxel-treated than for untreated cells at 24 and 48 hours. In the 3D environment, the paclitaxel-treated cells were stiffer than the untreated cells at 24 hours, but no statistically significant differences in stiffness were observed at 48 hours. In 2D, paclitaxel-treated cells were significantly larger at 24 and 48 hours and more circular at 24 but not at 48 hours than the untreated controls. In 3D, there were no significant morphological differences between treated and untreated cells. The distribution of cell shapes was not statistically significant different across the different treatment conditions in 2D and 3D environments. Future studies with patient-derived primary cancer cells and prolonged drug exposure will help identify physical cellular biomarkers to detect chemoresistance onset and assess therapy effectiveness in oesophageal cancer patients.\n\nInsightMechanical changes in cancer cells by chemotherapeutic drugs exposure offer possible physical biomarkers for chemoresistance and cancer recurrence. This study on human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma indicated that in vitro paclitaxel treatment induced stiffening and enlarging of malignant cells in two-dimensional environments at 24 and 48 hours. In physiologically more relevant three-dimensional collagen matrices the paclitaxel treatment led to cellular stiffening at 24 hours but softening thereafter, without significant changes in cellular size at any time. The outcomes need to be confirmed in future studies with prolonged drug exposure and patient-derived primary cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Plants possess cytoplasmic immune receptors called nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) that recognize the presence of a pathogen through a range of mechanisms: direct binding of effectors or indirect recognition of effector actions. The direct binding of effectors has been shown to be mediated through the NLRs leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Accurate prediction of amino acids involved in these direct interactions can greatly enhance understanding of effector recognition and inform efforts to engineer new resistance. In this study, we utilized two homologous NLR resistance genes from wheat, Sr33 and Sr50, that recognize distinct effectors by directly binding to them through their LRR domain. While the effector recognized by Sr50 is known and described as AvrSr50, the effector recognized by Sr33 remains unknown. Through a combination of phylogenetics, allele diversity analysis in the LRR and structural modeling, we identified the amino acids in Sr50 likely to physically interact with its effector. Mutation of these sites helped identify 12 amino acids we hypothesized to be sufficient to mediate effector binding in Sr50. Changing these 12 corresponding amino acids in Sr33, we showed AvrSr50-dependent initiation of cell death in wheat protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana. Furthermore, we were able to pinpoint and change amino acid residues that govern autoactivity of Sr50 in the wheat protoplast cell death assay. These findings are a major advance towards the successful engineering of new effector recognition specificities in direct binder NLRs.",

In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates recovered from river water to fully characterize the genetic contexts of blaCTX-M genes. Among the 14 isolates with completed genomes, blaCTX-M genes were detected on the chromosome in nine isolates. All but one chromosomal blaCTX-M genes were associated with ISEcp1 and were carried on different transposition units ranging in size from 2,855 bp to 11,093 bp; the exception, blaCTX-M-2, was associated with ISCR1. The remaining five isolates carried blaCTX-M genes on epidemic IncI1 plasmids of different sequence types (STs) (ST3, ST16, ST113, and ST167) (n = 4) or on an IncB/O/K/Z plasmid (n = 1).

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a major cause of an intestinal pathology called cryptosporidiosis which affects humans and other vertebrates. Despite being declared as a public health problem by World Health Organization (WHO) since 2006, pathogenesis caused by this parasite remains poorly understood. More recently, C. parvum has been linked with oncogenesis. In particular, the mechanisms involved in the processes of gene expression regulation are completely unexplored in Cryptosporidium. In the current study, we took the opportunity to investigate a dynamic epigenetic modification called histone lysine methylation during the life cycle of the parasite. We successfully identified putative SET-domain containing proteins, lysine methyltransferases (KMTs), which catalyze the methylation of different lysine residues. Phylogenetic analysis classified them into distinct subfamilies namely CpSET1, CpSET2, CpSET8, CpKMTox and CpAKMT. Structural analysis further characterized CpSET1, CpSET2 and CpSET8 to be histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs). Their functional significance was predicted by using site-specific methyl-lysine antibodies during development of the parasite (CpSET1:H3K4; CpSET2:H3K36; CpSET8:H4K20). In particular, the SET domain of CpSET8 showcased methyltransferase activity confirming the existence of functional HKMTs in Cryptosporidium. Moreover, the consequence of C. parvum infection on the host lysine methylation events highlights the inherit potential of the parasite to exploit the host epigenetic regulation to its advantage. Thus, this study is the first one to provide insights on epigenetics mechanisms occurring throughout the parasites life cycle and during the interaction with its host. As Cryptosporidium is a protozoan that significantly affects the health of both humans and animals, a better understanding of its developmental processes within the definitive host may highlight novel infection control strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryCryptosporidium species have a very compact genome (~9.2 Mb) unlike its apicomplexan homologs such as Toxoplasma (~63 Mb). Moreover, the lack of large families of transcriptional factors requires them to heavily rely on chromatin remodeling components for its gene regulation. Thus, study and identification of novel elements which contribute to chromatin dynamics could assist a better understanding of the biology of this parasite. In the current study we investigated histone lysine methylation, a dynamic epigenetic modification which regulates gene activation as well as repression. More importantly, characterizing the enzymes which bring about this regulation, provides potential new druggable targets to attack the parasite.",

Thus, we set out to disclose the role of the secreted protein with an altered thrombospondin repeat (SPATR), which is highly expressed in sporozoites. Previous studies showed an essential function in blood stages, while no role was detected in sporozoites despite high expression. To achieve downregulation of expression in sporozoites while maintaining blood stage expression, a promoter swap approach was used to generate a mutant where the Plasmodium berghei spatr gene was placed under transcriptional control of the hado gene promoter. Downregulation of expression in oocysts and sporozoites resulted in formation of sporozoites with impaired motility, strongly reduced capacity to invade salivary glands, and decreased infectivity to mice.

    "abstract": "Brevibacillus texasporus peptide (BT peptide) is immunomodulatory in poultry as a feed additive to substitute antibiotics. In the present study we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare development of the cecal microbial communities in Clostridium perfringens-challenged broilers fed basal diet only or with either BT peptide (48 ppm) or antibiotics mixture (20 ppm bacitracin zinc and 40 ppm colistin sulfate). 240 chicks were randomly assigned into each treatment and a total of 65 cecal samples were collected at the beginning, during seven challenge days and one week post challenge. The composition of microbial communities was clearly distinguishable over time. Treatments with challenge and the antibiotics mixture were associated with increased diversity and with higher relative abundances of Alistipes sp. CHKCI003 and Faecalibacterium and lower abundance of Escherichia coli (all p < 0.05). At the termination of the trial, the cecal microbiota in broilers supplemented with BT peptide was dominated by members of Bacteroidaceae. Predicted function analysis reveals significant enrichment of genes involved in ion-coupled transporters and sugar and biotin metabolism in the BT peptide treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that BT peptide and commonly used antibiotics have different influences on modulating the composition of cecal microbiota in broilers.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe current molecular classification of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) based on expression of four lineage transcription factors still leaves its major subtype SCLC-A as a heterogeneous group, necessitating more precise characterization of lineage subclasses.\n\nObjectivesTo refine the current SCLC classification with epigenomic profiles and to identify features of the re-defined SCLC subtypes.\n\nMethodsWe performed unsupervised clustering of epigenomic profiles on 25 SCLC cell lines. Functional significance was evaluated by cell growth, apoptosis and xenograft using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion. The specific cistromic profiles by ChIP-seq and its functional transcriptional partners using co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry were determined. Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/fl and Rb1fl/flNkx2-1fl/fl mouse models were engineered to explore the function of Nkx2-1 in tumor initiation and differentiation. H3K27ac profiles were analyzed to reveal 6 human SCLC specimen and 20 mice tumors epigenomic landscapes.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsWe identified an epigenomic subclusters of the major SCLC-A subtype, named SCLC-A and SCLC-A{sigma}. SCLC-A was characterized by the presence of a super-enhancer at the NKX2-1 locus, which was observed in human SCLC specimens and a murine SCLC model. We found NKX2-1, a dual lung and neural lineage factor, is uniquely relevant in SCLC-A. We further found maintenance of this neural identity in SCLC-A is mediated by collaborative transcriptional activity with another neuronal transcriptional factor SOX1.\n\nConclusionsWe comprehensively describe an additional epigenomic heterogeneity of the major SCLC-A subtype, and define SCLC-A subtype by the core regulatory circuitry representing NKX2-1 and SOX1 super-enhancers and their functional collaborations to maintain neuronal linage state.",

    "abstract": "Supramolecular cup-shaped lipoprotein structures called porosomes embedded in the cell plasma membrane mediate fractional release of intra-vesicular contents from cells during secretion. The presence of porosomes, have been documented in many cell types including neurons, acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas, growth hormone secreting cells of the pituitary, and mouse insulin-secreting beta cell insulinomas called Min6. Electron micrographs of the nerve terminal in rat brain and of Min6 cells, suggest that besides the docking, fusion and content release of neurotransmitter containing synaptic vesicles and insulin containing granules, multi-vesicular bodies and exosome-like vesicles are released at the porosome complex. To test this hypothesis, the porosome-associated calcium transporting ATPase 1 [SPCA1] encoded by the ATP2C1 gene, was knocked-out in Min6 cells using CRISPR, to study glucose-stimulated insulin and exosome release. In agreement with electron micrographs, results from the study demonstrate a loss of both glucose-stimulated insulin and exosome release in the ATP2C1 knockout Min6 cells. These results further confirm the role of the porosome complex in insulin secretion and establishes a new paradigm in porosome-mediated exosome release in beta cells of the endocrine pancreas.",

    "abstract": "Lysyl-oxidase like-2 (LOXL2) regulates extracellular matrix remodeling and promotes tumor invasion and metastasis. Altered metabolism is a core hallmark of cancer, however, it remains unclear whether and how LOXL2 contributes to tumor metabolism. Here, we found that LOXL2 and its catalytically inactive L2{Delta}13 splice variant also function as novel deacetylases that trigger metabolic reprogramming during malignant transformation. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that L2{Delta}13-overexpressing transgenic mice displayed perturbed glucose and lipid metabolism, which was associated with increased hepatic fibrosis and enhanced formation of precancerous lesions induced by chemical carcinogens, such as carbon tetrachloride and N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine. Furthermore, both LOXL2 and L2{Delta}13 boosted glucose metabolism of esophageal tumor cells, thereby facilitating tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LOXL2 and L2{Delta}13 interacted physically with several glycolic proteins including aldolase A to enhance their enzymatic activities and mobilization from the actin cytoskeleton. Using SILAC followed by proteomic analysis, we identified LOXL2 as a deacetylase targeting metabolic proteins in esophageal cancer. Importantly, both LOXL2 and L2{Delta}13 directly catalyzed the deacetylation of aldolase A at K13, resulting in enhanced glycolysis which subsequently reprogramed tumor metabolism and promoted tumor progression. High level expression of LOXL2/L2{Delta}13 combined with decreased acetylation of aldolase-K13 predicted poor clinical outcome in patients with esophageal cancer. In summary, we have characterized a novel molecular mechanism that mediates the pro-tumorigenic activity of LOXL2 independently of its classical amine oxidase activity. These findings may enable the future development of therapeutic agents targeting the metabolic machinery via LOXL2 or L2{Delta}13.",

In this study, we report the discovery and characterization of distinct cell populations coexisting with epiblast-like cells in 5iLAF naive human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) cultures. Noteworthily these populations closely resemble different cell types of the human embryo at early developmental stages. While epiblast-like cells represented the main cell population, interestingly we detected a cell population with gene and transposable element expression profile closely resembling the totipotent 8-Cell (8C) stage human embryo, and three cell populations analogous to trophectoderm (TE) cells at different stages of their maturation process: transition, early and mature stage. Thus, 5iLAF naive hiPSCs cultures provide an excellent opportunity to model the earliest events of human embryogenesis, from the 8C stage to the peri-implantation period.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482812v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b680eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c7e0forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e84568org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@24ee65_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "How the diverse neural cell types emerge from multipotent neural progenitor cells during central nervous system development remains poorly understood. Recent scRNA-seq studies have delineated the developmental trajectories of individual neural cell types in many neural systems including the neural retina. Further understanding of the formation of neural cell diversity requires knowledge about how the epigenetic landscape shifts along individual cell lineages and how key transcription factors regulate these changes. In this study, we dissect the changes in the epigenetic landscape during early retinal cell differentiation by scATAC-seq and identify globally the enhancers, enriched motifs, and potential interacting transcription factors underlying the cell state/type specific gene expression in individual lineages. Using CUT&Tag, we further identify the enhancers bound directly by four key transcription factors, Otx2, Atoh7, Pou4f2, and Isl1, and uncover their roles in shaping the epigenetic landscape and controlling gene expression in a sequential and combinatorial fashion along individual retinal cell lineages such as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Our results reveal a general paradigm in which transcription factors collaborate and compete to regulate the emergence of distinct retinal cell types such as RGCs from multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs).",

    "abstract": "Cell size asymmetries are often linked to cell fate decisions, due to cell volumes and cell fate determinants being unequally partitioned during asymmetric cell divisions. A clear example is found in the sea urchin embryo, where a characteristic and obvious unequal 4th cleavage generates micromeres, which are necessary for mesendoderm cell fate specification. Unlike sea urchin development, sea star development is generally thought to have only equal cleavage. However, subtle cell size asymmetries can be observed in sea star embryos; whether those cell size asymmetries are consistently produced during sea star development and if they are involved in cell fate decisions remains unknown. Using confocal live imaging of early embryos we quantified cell size asymmetries in 16-cell stage embryos of two sea star species, Patiria miniata and Patiriella regularis. Using photoconversion to perform lineage tracing, we find that the position of the smallest cells of P. miniata embryos is biased toward anterior ventral tissues. However, both blastomere dissociation and mechanical removal of one small cell do not prevent dorsoventral (DV) axis formation, suggesting that embryos compensate for the loss of those cells and asymmetric partitioning of maternal determinants is not strictly necessary for DV patterning. Finally, we show that manipulating cell size to introduce artificial cell size asymmetries is not sufficient to direct the positioning of the future DV axis in P. miniata embryos. Our results show that although cell size asymmetries are consistently produced during sea star early cleavage and may be predictive of the DV axis, they are not necessary to instruct DV axis formation.",

    "abstract": "The endosymbiont Wolbachia can have major effects on the reproductive fitness, and vectorial capacity of host insects and may provide new avenues to control mosquito borne pathogens. Anopheles gambiae s.l is the major vector of malaria in Africa but the use of Wolbachia in this species has been limited by challenges in establishing stable transinfected lines and uncertainty around native infections. High frequencies of infection of Wolbachia have been previously reported in An. gambiae collected from the Valle du Kou region of Burkina Faso in 2011 and 2014. Here we re-evaluated the occurrence of Wolbachia in natural samples, collected from Valle du Kou over a 12-year time span, and in addition, expanded sampling to other sites in Burkina Faso. Our results showed that, in contrast to earlier reports, Wolbachia is present at an extremely low prevalence in natural population of An. gambiae. From 5,341 samples analysed only 29 were positive for Wolbachia by nested PCR representing 0.54% of prevalence. No positive samples were found with regular PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons clustered across supergroup B, with some having similarity to sequences previously found in Anopheles from Burkina Faso. However, we cannot discount the possibility that the amplicon positive samples we detected were due to environmental contamination or were false positives. Regardless, the lack of a prominent native infection in An. gambiae s.l. is encouraging for applications utilising Wolbachia traninsfected mosquitoes for malaria control.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE) indicate that variation in organismal traits cannot be explained by fixed effects of genetics or site-specific plastic responses alone. For tropical coral reefs experiencing dramatic environmental change, identifying the contributions of genotype, environment, and GxE on coral performance will be vital for both predicting persistence and developing restoration strategies. We quantified the impacts of G, E, and GxE on the morphology and survival of the endangered coral, A. cervicornis, through an in situ transplant experiment exposing common garden (nursery) raised clones of ten genotypes to nine reef sites in the Florida Keys. By fate-tracking outplants over one year with colony-level 3D photogrammetry, we uncovered significant GxE on coral size and survivorship indicating that no universal winner exists in terms of colony performance. Moreover, the presence of GxE also implies the existence of intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity. Rather than differences in mean trait values, we find that individual-level morphological plasticity is adaptive in that the most plastic individuals also exhibited the fastest growth and highest survival. This indicates that adaptive morphological plasticity may continue to evolve, influencing the success of A. cervicornis and resulting reef communities in a changing climate. As focal reefs are active restoration sites, the knowledge that variation in phenotype is an important predictor of performance can be directly applied to restoration planning. Taken together, these results establish A. cervicornis as a system for studying the eco-evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic plasticity that also can inform genetic- and environment-based strategies for coral restoration.",

    "abstract": "The current human reference genome, GRCh38, represents over 20 years of effort to generate a high-quality assembly, which has greatly benefited society1, 2. However, it still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological human genome since it is a blend of multiple individuals3, 4. Recently, a high-quality telomere-to-telomere reference genome, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a duplicate genome, and is thus nearly homozygous5. To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) recently formed with the goal of creating a collection of high-quality, cost-effective, diploid genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic diversity6. Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which combination of current genome sequencing and automated assembly approaches yields the most complete, accurate, and cost-effective diploid genome assemblies with minimal manual curation. Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent-child data to sort haplotypes during assembly outperformed those that did not. Developing a combination of all the top performing methods, we generated our first high- quality diploid reference assembly, containing only [~]4 gaps (range 0-12) per chromosome, most within + 1% of CHM13s length. Nearly 1/4th of protein coding genes have synonymous amino acid changes between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest density of variation. Our findings serve as a foundation for assembling near-complete diploid human genomes at the scale required for constructing a human pangenome reference that captures all genetic variation from single nucleotides to large structural rearrangements.",

The MTT assay was employed to determine cell viability and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Warburgia salutaris-treated in HepG2 cells (0-5mg/ml). Extracellular lactate dehydrogenase and ATP were also quantified as a measure of cell viability. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by quantifying lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage, and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in treated HepG2 cells. The cells response to free radicals was assessed by measuring GSH. Stress response antioxidant and apoptotic markers were detected using western blotting and /or qPCR. Cell death parameters assayed included annexin V, caspase activity and necrosis. Single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) was used to visualise DNA damage in the HepG2 cells and confirmed with DNA fragmentation assay. The Hoechst assay allowed the visualisation of the nucleus to assess cell growth and apoptosis. Decreased cell viability was associated with a decreased level of ATP. The presence of oxidative stress was suggested by increased HSP70 and Nrf2 protein expression and confirmed by increase ROS, RNS, GPx and catalase; and a corresponding decrease of SOD2 and glutathione. Caspase 8 showed no significant difference between treatment concentrations, caspase 9 was decreased and caspase 3/7 increased. A reduction in p53 correlated with chromatin changes, increase in comet lengths and DNA fragmentation. NF{kappa}B protein was significantly decreased at the IC50, along with decreased cMyc protein expression. Our findings shows that Warburgia salutaris promotes apoptosis by inducing oxidative stress in HepG2 cells and may be a potential anti-cancer agent that would serve as an alternative to conventional therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Double emulsion droplets (DEs) are water/oil/water droplets that can be sorted via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), allowing for new opportunities in high-throughput cellular analysis, enzymatic screening, and synthetic biology. These applications require stable, uniform droplets with predictable microreactor volumes. However, predicting DE droplet size, shell thickness, and stability as a function of flow rate has remained challenging for monodisperse single core droplets and those containing biologically-relevant buffers, which influence bulk and interfacial properties. As a result, developing novel DE-based bioassays has typically required extensive initial optimization of flow rates to find conditions that produce stable droplets of the desired size and shell thickness. To address this challenge, we conducted systematic size parameterization quantifying how differences in flow rates and buffer properties (viscosity and interfacial tension at water/oil interfaces) alter droplet size and stability, across 6 inner aqueous buffers used across applications such as cellular lysis, microbial growth, and drug delivery, quantifying the size and shell thickness of >22,000 droplets overall. We restricted our study to stable single core droplets generated in a 2-step dripping-dripping formation regime in a straightforward PDMS device. Using data from 138 unique conditions (flow rates and buffer composition), we also demonstrated that a recent physically-derived size law of Wang et al1 can accurately predict double emulsion shell thickness for >95% of observations. Finally, we validated the utility of this size law by using it to accurately predict droplet sizes for a novel bioassay that requires encapsulating growth media for bacteria in droplets. This work has the potential to enable new screening-based biological applications by simplifying novel DE bioassay development.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter with critical roles in the human brain and body, and abnormal dopamine levels underlie brain disorders such as Parkinsons Disease, Alzheimers Disease, and substance addiction. Herein, we present a novel high-throughput biosensor based on graphene multitransistor arrays (gMTAs) functionalized with a selective aptamer for robust ultrasensitive dopamine detection. The miniaturized biosensor integrates multiple electrolyte-gated graphene field-effect transistors (EG-gFETs) in an array configuration, fabricated by high-yield reproducible and scalable methodologies optimized at the wafer level. With these gMTA aptasensors, we reliably detected ultra-low dopamine concentrations in physiological buffers, including undiluted phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF), and high ionic strength complex biological samples. We report a record limit-of-detection (LOD) of 1 aM (10-18) for dopamine in both PBS, and dopamine-depleted brain homogenate samples spiked with dopamine. The gMTAs also display wide sensing ranges across all media, up to 100 M (10-8), with a 22 mV/decade peak sensitivity in aCSF. Furthermore, we show that the gMTAs can detect minimal changes in dopamine concentrations in small working volume biological CSF samples obtained from a mouse model of Parkinsons Disease.",

    "abstract": "Bessel beam has long been utilized in physics for its ability to maintain lateral confinement during propagation. When used for two-photon fluorescence microscopy, Bessel foci have enabled high-speed volumetric imaging of the brain. At high numeric aperture (NA), however, the substantial energy in the side rings of Bessel foci reduces image contrast. Therefore, a compromise between resolution and contrast has to be made, limiting Bessel foci in microscopy to low NA. Here, we describe a method of generating axially extended Bessel-droplet foci with much suppressed side rings. Shaping the excitation wavefront with novel phase patterns, we generated Bessel-droplet foci of variable NAs at high power throughput and scanned them interferometrically along the axial direction for continuous volume imaging. More resistant to optical aberrations than Bessel foci, Bessel-droplet foci enabled high-resolution and high-contrast volumetric imaging of synaptic anatomy and function as well as lymphatic circulation in the mouse brain in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion and transport of nanomaterials through mucus, is of critical importance to many basic and applied areas of research such as drug delivery and infectious disease. However, it is often challenging to interpret the dynamics of nanoparticles within the mucus gel due to its inherently heterogeneous microstructure and biochemistry. In this study, we measured the diffusion of densely PEGylated nanoparticles (NP) in human airway mucus ex vivo using multiple particle tracking and utilized machine learning to classify NP movement as either traditional Brownian motion (BM) or one of two different models of anomalous diffusion, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and continuous time random walk (CTRW). Specifically, we employed a physics-based neural network model to predict the modes of diffusion experienced by individual NP in human airway mucus. We observed rapidly diffusing NP primarily exhibit BM whereas CTRW and FBM exhibited lower diffusion rates. Given the use of muco-inert nanoparticles, the observed transition from diffusive (BM) to sub-diffusive (CTRW/FBM) motion is likely a result of patient-to-patient variation in mucus network pore size. Using mathematic models that account for the mode of NP diffusion, we predicted the percentage of nanoparticles that would cross the mucus barrier over time in human airway mucus with varied total solids concentration. We also applied this approach to explore the transport modes and predicted fate of influenza A virus within human mucus. These results provide new tools to evaluate the extent of synthetic and viral nanoparticle penetration through mucus in the lung and other tissues.",

    "abstract": "In normal activated B-cells, Activation Induced-cytidine deaminase (AID) is absolutely required for immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR) and IGHV somatic hypermutation (SHM). AID is also implicated in the Locus Suicide Recombination (LSR) of the Ig heavy (IgH) locus, resulting in the deletion of the IgH constant part. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an indolent non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma characterized by tumor CLL B-cells that weakly express a B cell receptor (BCR) on their surface. The great majority of CLL tumor B-cells are non class-switched. Searching for abnormalities of IgH locus recombination in CLL, we investigated CSR and LSR in samples from CLL patients (N=47) with high blood tumor cell infiltration (>98%) and in healthy volunteers (HV) as controls (N=9). LSR was detectable at comparable levels in both HV and CLL groups. CSR counts were decreased in CLL samples as expected. As distribution of LSR counts was bimodal, we separated CLL patients in two groups so called LSRHigh and LSRLow. LSRHigh CLLs exhibited very weak AID expression and low mutation rate of IgHV region and of the AID off-target PIM1 gene. LSR junction diversity, evaluated using the Shannon index, was increased in LSRHigh CLLs suggesting that LSR was on-going in these cells. Also, shorter telomeres were observed in LSRHigh CLLs suggesting an increased number of past mitosis. Consistently, increased levels of cMYC expression were detected in LSRHigh CLLs and treatment free survival of these cases was markedly decreased. We hypothesized that LSR in LSRHigh CLLs is AID independent and could be due to DNA lesion and inaccurate DSB repair within the IgH locus, which could be accessible to recombination machinery due to increased IgH locus transcription. Altogether, our results indicate the accessibility of IgH locus and the proliferation increase LSR rate in LSRHigh CLLs could be related to cMYC resulting in shorter treatment free survival of patients and point on an AID independent mechanism of IgH recombination.",

Here we describe a repository of 79 genomically and clinically annotated lung cancer PDXs available from The Jackson Laboratory that have been extensively characterized for histopathological features, mutational profiles, gene expression, and copy number aberrations. Most of the PDXs are models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including 37 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 33 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) models. Other lung cancer models in the repository include four small cell carcinomas, two large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, two adenosquamous carcinomas, and one pleomorphic carcinoma. Models with both de novo and acquired resistance to targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available in the collection. The genomic profiles of the LUAD and LUSC PDX models are consistent with those observed in patient tumors of the same tumor type from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and to previously characterized gene expression-based molecular subtypes. Clinically relevant mutations identified in the original patient tumors were confirmed in engrafted tumors. Treatment studies performed for a subset of the models recapitulated the responses expected based on the observed genomic profiles.\n\nSignificanceThe collection of lung cancer Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models maintained at The Jackson Laboratory retain both the histologic features and treatment-relevant genomic alterations observed in the originating patient tumors and show expected responses to treatment with standard-of-care agents.

Here, we developed scPAIR-seq, an approach to analyze both host and pathogen factors during infection by combining multiplex-tagged mutant bacterial library with scRNA-seq to identify mutant-specific changes in host transcriptomes. We applied scPAIR-seq to macrophages infected with a library of Salmonella Typhimurium secretion system effector mutants.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe bacteria-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) butyrate and propionate play important (distinct) roles in health and disease and understanding the ecology of respective bacteria on a community-wide level is a top priority in microbiome research. The aim of this study was to reveal members harboring main pathways for the production of those metabolites and assess the applicability of sequence data (metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene) to predict SCFAs production in vitro and in vivo.\n\nResultsA clear split between butyrate- and propionate-forming bacteria was detected with only very few taxa exhibiting pathways for the production of both SCFAs. After in vitro growth of fecal communities from distinct donors (n=8) on different substrates (n=7) abundances of bacteria exhibiting pathways correlated with respective SCFA concentrations, in particular in the case of butyrate. While final growth differed markedly between cultures, communities showed high functional redundancies with comparable yields, i.e., concentration of metabolite per grown bacterium exhibiting pathway(s), irrespective of the donor and substrate used. For propionate, correlations were weaker indicating that its production is less imprinted into the core metabolism compared with butyrate-forming bacteria. Longitudinal measurements in vivo (five samples derived from 20 subjects) also revealed a correlation between abundances of pathway-carrying bacteria and concentrations of the two SCFAs. Additionally, lower bacterial cell concentrations, together with higher stool moisture, promoted overall bacterial activity (measured by flow cytometry and coverage patterns of metagenome-assembled genomes) that led to elevated SCFAs concentrations with over-proportional levels of butyrate. Butyrate concentrations displayed lower temporal stability than propionate, however, abundances of bacteria exhibiting the butyrate-forming pathway were more stable than those carrying pathways for propionate production. Predictions on pathway abundances based on 16S rRNA gene data using our in-house database worked well yielding similar results as metagenomic-based analyses.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated that pathway abundances enable predictions on concentrations of SCFAs indicating that stimulating bacterial growth directly leads to more production of those compounds. The strong separation of gut microbiota into two functional communities facilitates the development of precision intervention strategies targeting either metabolite.",

Mutations in Fused/STK36 and ULK4 in mice resulted in hydrocephalus and other phenotypes consistent with ciliary defects. How either protein contributes to the assembly and function of motile cilia is not well understood. Here we studied the phenotypes of ULK4 and Fused gene knockout (KO) mutants in the flagellated protist Leishmania mexicana. Both KO mutants exhibited a variety of structural defects of the flagellum cytoskeleton. Biochemical approaches indicate spatial proximity of these proteins and indicates a direct interaction between the N-terminus of LmxULK4 and LmxFused. Both proteins display a dispersed localisation throughout the cell body and flagellum, with enrichment near the flagellar base and tip. Fused/STK36 was previously shown to localise to mammalian motile cilia and we demonstrate here that ULK4 also localises to the motile cilia in mouse ependymal cells. Taken together these data suggest a model where the pseudokinase ULK4 is a positive regulator of the kinase Fused/STK36 in a pathway required for stable assembly of motile cilia.\n\nSummary StatementKnockout phenotypes in Leishmania, and confirmation of ULK4 ciliary localisation in mouse, show ULK4 and Fused/STK36 interact in a conserved pathway for stable assembly of motile cilia.",

The mechanisms of meiotic recombination, such as synapsis, have been extensively investigated. However, it is still unclear whether signals from the cytoplasm or even outside of the cell can regulate the meiosis process. Cilia are microtubule-based structures that protrude from cell surface and function as signaling hubs to sense extracellular signals. Here, we reported an unexpected and critical role of cilia during meiotic recombination. During gametogenesis of zebrafish, cilia were specifically present in the prophase stages of both spermatocytes and primary oocytes. By developing a novel germ cell-specific CRISPR/Cas9 system, we demonstrated that germ cell-specific depletion of ciliary genes resulted in compromised double strand break repair, reduced crossover formation, and increased germ cell apoptosis. Our study reveals a previously undiscovered role for cilia during meiosis and suggests that extracellular signals may regulate meiotic recombination via this particular organelle.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing expands the transcriptome and proteome complexity and plays essential roles in tissue development and human diseases. However, how alternative splicing regulates spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, using germ cell-specific knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that the splicing factor Srsf10 is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. Depletion of Srsf10 in germ cells had little effect on the formation of SSCs but impeded the expansion of progenitor spermatogonia, leading to the failure of spermatogonia differentiation and meiosis initiation. This was further evidenced by the decreased expression of progenitor cell markers in bulk RNA-seq, and much less progenitor and differentiating spermatogonia in single-cell RNA-seq data. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in cell cycle was abnormal in all subtypes of spermatogonia identified in single-cell RNA-seq data. Notably, using isolated spermatogonia, we found that Srsf10 depletion disturbed the alternative splicing of hundreds of genes, which were preferentially associated with cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle checkpoint and germ cell development, including Dazl, Kit, Ret, Sycp1, Nasp and Bora. These data suggest that SRSF10 is critical for the expansion of progenitor spermatogonia by regulating alternative splicing, expanding our understanding of the mechanism underlying spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "A non-autonomous DNA transposon was identified in the DRF1 gene, belonging to the DREB gene family, the presence of this element was initially assessed in the Triticum durum DRF1 gene and subsequently it was also identified in Aegilops speltoides and Triticum urartu DRF1 genes. The DRF1 gene consists of four exons and three introns, the transposon carrying core element is inserted between the first and the third introns. Our studies identified inverted repeats, target site duplications and the presence of many internal reverse and direct short tandem and long tandem repeats, that all represent signals of a transposable element. Based on transposon specific sequence and position of the terminal inverted repeats, a possible transposition mechanism was inferred. As the identified transposable element does not possess a sequence coding for a transposase enzyme, it represents a non-autonomous element. The transposon encompasses a core element with two small, transcribed regions (Exon 2 and Exon 3) that are combined by alternative splicing during gene expression and an intron (intron2). A possible role of this non-autonomous DNA transposon in the alternative splicing regulation was investigated by a genomics approach. Divergence time analysis supported the relatively recent evolution of this transposon in Triticeae comparing to other tribes and further there is no footprints or highly disrupted footprints sequence such as TIR, TSD in other earlier evolved Poaceae member species were observed, which revealed the novelty and well-preserved nature of these signals in Triticeae. While other monocots (apart from Poaceae) and dicots, including Arabidopsis thaliana, neither showed this transposon insertion and nor revealed the existence of alternative spliced gene transcripts. In Poaceae members the core element is well preserved with disturbed transposon and transposon signals, while the tribe Triticeae especially wheat, its progenitors have intact DRF1 transposon and its signals.",

    "abstract": "Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM) is a recently developed technique that enables the increase of the spatial resolution within a cell or a tissue for microscopic imaging by physically expanding the sample. For the first time, I report a detailed protocol validating the use of U-ExM in Trypanosoma cruzi and quantifying the expansion factors of different subcellular compartments. I was able to determine the localization patterns of different tubulin isoforms, such as -tubulin and {beta}-tubulin. Also, I immunolocalized acetylated and tyrosinated -tubulin isotypes in epimastigotes and use mitochondrial cell-permeable dyes to identify this organelle. Finally, U-ExM was also performed in trypomastigotes and amastigotes validating this technique in all life cycle stages of T. cruzi.",

    "abstract": "Open-population spatial capture-recapture (OPSCR) models use the spatial information contained in individual detections collected over multiple consecutive occasions to estimate occasion-specific density, but also demographic parameters. OPSCR models can also estimate spatial variation in vital rates, but such models are neither widely used nor thoroughly tested. We developed a Bayesian OSPCR model that not only accounts for spatial variation in survival using spatial covariates, but also estimates local density-dependent effects on survival within a unified framework. Using simulations, we show that OPSCR models provide sound inferences on the effect of spatial covariates on survival, including multiple competing sources of mortality, each with potentially different spatial determinants. Estimation of local density-dependent survival was possible but required more data due to the greater complexity of the model. Not accounting for spatial heterogeneity in survival led to positive bias in abundance estimates (up to 10% relative bias). We provide a set of features in R package nimbleSCR that allow computationally efficient fitting of Bayesian OPSCR models with spatially varying survival. The ability to make population-level inferences of spatial variation in survival is an essential step towards a fully spatially-explicit OPSCR model that can disentangle the role of multiple spatial drivers on population dynamics.\n\nOpen Research statementcode to reproduce the analysis is available on github; https://github.com/Cyril-Milleret/Public/tree/master/SpatialSurvivalOPSCR",

    "abstract": "E-cadherin (Ecad) is an essential cell-cell adhesion protein with tumor suppression properties. The adhesive state of Ecad can be modified by the monoclonal antibody 19A11, which has potential applications in reducing cancer metastasis. Using x-ray crystallography, we determine the structure of 19A11 Fab bound to Ecad and show that the antibody binds to the first extracellular domain of Ecad near its primary adhesive motif - the strand-swap dimer interface. Molecular dynamics simulations and single molecule atomic force microscopy demonstrate that 19A11 interacts with Ecad in two distinct modes, one that strengthens the strand-swap dimer and one that does not alter adhesion. We show that adhesion is strengthened by the formation of a salt bridge between 19A11 and Ecad, which in turn stabilizes the swapped {beta}-strand and its complimentary binding pocket. Our results identify mechanistic principles for engineering antibodies to enhance Ecad adhesion.",
