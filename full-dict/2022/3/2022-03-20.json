    "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome (DS, Ts21), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, have smaller brains that reflect fewer neurons at pre- and post-natal stages, implicating impaired neurogenesis during development. Our stereological analysis of adult DS cortex indicates a reduction of calretinin expressing interneurons. Using Ts21 human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and isogenic controls, we find Ts21 progenitors generate fewer COUP-TFII+ progenitors with reduced proliferation. Single cell RNA-sequencing of Ts21 progenitors confirms the altered specification of progenitor subpopulations and identifies reduced WNT signaling. Activation of WNT signaling partially restores the COUP-TFII+ progenitor population in Ts21, suggesting that altered WNT signaling contributes to the defective development of cortical interneurons in DS.",

    "abstract": "People have higher preference for immediate over delayed rewards, and it is suggested that such an impulsive tendency is governed by ones ability to simulate future rewards. Consistent with this view, recent studies have shown that enforcing individuals to focus on episodic future thoughts reduces their impulsivity. Inspired by these successful reports, we hypothesized that administration of a simple cognitive task which is linked with future thinking might also function as an effective tool for modulating individuals preference for immediate (or delayed) rewards. Specifically, we used one associative memory task and one working memory task that each of which was administered to intervene acquired amount of information and individuals ability to construct a coherent future event, respectively. Among the set of cognitive tasks, we found that only the arithmetic working memory task had a significant effect of reducing individuals impulsivity. However, in our follow-up experiment, this result was not replicated. Across these two independent experiments, we observed a significant main effect of repetition in individuals impulsivity measure, such that participants showed more patient choices at the second compared to the first assessment task. In conclusion, there was no clear evidence supporting that our suggested intervention tasks effectively reduce individuals impulsivity, while the current results call attention to the importance of taking into account task repetition effects in studying the impacts of cognitive training and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Planarian flatworms are best known for their impressive regenerative capacity, yet this trait varies across species. In addition, planarians have other features that share morphology and function with the tissues of many other animals, including an outer mucociliary epithelium that drives planarian locomotion and is very similar to the epithelial linings of the human lung and oviduct. Planarians occupy a broad range of ecological habitats and are known to be sensitive to changes in their environment. Yet, despite their potential to provide valuable insight to many different fields, very few planarian species have been developed as laboratory models for mechanism-based research.\n\nHere we describe a previously undocumented planarian isolate, Girardia sp. (Guanajuato). After collecting this isolate from a freshwater habitat in central Mexico, we characterized it at the morphological, cellular, and molecular level. We show that Girardia sp. (Guanajuato) shares features with animals in the Girardia genus but also possesses traits that appear unique to this isolate. By thoroughly characterizing this new planarian isolate, our work facilitates future comparisons to other flatworms and further molecular dissection of the unique and physiologically-relevant traits observed in this Girardia sp.

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic stress-related illnesses, such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder share symptomatology, including anxiety, anhedonia, and helplessness. Across disorders, neurotoxic dysregulated glutamate (Glu) signaling may underlie symptom emergence. Current first-line antidepressant drugs, which do not directly target Glu signaling, fail to provide adequate benefit for many patients and are associated with high relapse rates. Riluzole modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission by increasing metabolic cycling and modulating signal transduction. Clinical studies exploring riluzoles efficacy in stress-related disorders have provided varied results. However, the utility of riluzole for treating specific symptom dimensions or as a prophylactic treatment has not been comprehensively assessed.\n\nMethodsWe investigated whether chronic prophylactic riluzole (~12-15mg/kg/day p.o.) could prevent the emergence of behavioral deficits induced by unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) in mice. We assessed: i) anxiety-like behavior using the elevated-plus maze, open field test, and novelty-suppressed feeding, ii) mixed anxiety/anhedonia-like behavior in the novelty-induced hypophagia test and, iii) anhedonia-like behavior using the sucrose consumption test. Z-scoring summarized changes across tests measuring similar dimensions. In a separate learned helplessness (LH) cohort, we investigated whether chronic prophylactic riluzole treatment could block the development of helplessness-like behavior.\n\nResultsUCMS induced an elevation in anhedonia-like behavior, and overall behavioral emotionality that was blocked by prophylactic riluzole. In the LH cohort, prophylactic riluzole blocked the development of helplessness-like behavior.\n\nConclusionThis study supports the utility of riluzole as a prophylactic medication for preventing anhedonia, and helplessness symptoms associated with stress-related disorders.",

These models are employed to de-risk drug development and guide precision medicine decisions. However, pharmacometric tools have not been designed to handle todays heterogeneous big data and complex models. We set out to design a platform that facilitates domain-specific modeling and its integration with modern analytics to foster innovation and readiness in healthcare.\n\nPumas demonstrates estimation methodologies with dramatic performance advances. New ODE solver algorithms, such as coeficient-optimized higher order integrators and new automatic stiffness detecting algorithms which are robust to frequent discontinuities, give rise to a median 4x performance improvement across a wide range of stiff and non-stiff systems seen in pharmacometric applications. These methods combine with JIT compiler techniques, such as statically-sized optimizations and discrete sensitivity analysis via forward-mode automatic differentiation, to further enhance the accuracy and performance of the solving and parameter estimation process. We demonstrate that when all of these techniques are combined with a validated clinical trial dosing mechanism and non-compartmental analysis (NCA) suite, real applications like NLME fitting see a median 81x acceleration while retaining the same accuracy. Meanwhile in areas with less prior software optimization, like optimal experimental design, we see orders of magnitude performance enhancements over competitors. Further, Pumas combines these technical advances with several workflows that are automated and designed to boost productivity of the day-to-day user activity.

    "abstract": "Defects in RNA splicing have been linked to numerous human disorders, but remain poorly explored in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we report that, in the gut epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the expression of the chromatin and alternative splicing regulator HP1{gamma} is strongly reduced. Accordingly, inactivation of the HP1{gamma} gene in the mouse gut triggered several IBD-like traits, including inflammation and dysbiosis. In parallel, we discovered that its loss of function broadly increased splicing noise, reducing requirement for canonical splicing consensus sequences, and favoring the usage of cryptic splice sites at numerous genes with key functions in gut biology. This notably resulted in the production of progerin, a noncanonical toxic splice variant of prelamin A mRNA, responsible for the Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) of premature aging. Likewise, production of progerin transcript was found to be a signature of colonic cells from UC patients. Thus, our study identifies HP1{gamma} as a regulator of RNA metabolism in vivo, providing a unique mechanism linking anti-inflammation and accuracy of RNA splicing in the gut epithelium. HP1 defect may confer a general disturbance in RNA splicing precision to scrutinize in IBD and more generally in accelerating aging diseases.",

Nevertheless, SNP data is desirable both for genotyping and to understand the DNA methylome in the context of the genetic background. The confounding effect of bisulfite conversion can be resolved by observing differences in allele counts on a per-strand basis, whereby artificial mutations are reflected by non-complementary base pairs. Herein, we present a computational pre-processing approach for adapting sequence alignment data, thus indirectly enabling downstream analysis in this manner using conventional variant calling software such as GATK or Freebayes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundUncontrolled proliferative diseases such as fibrosis or cancer can be fatal. We previously found that a compound containing a chromone scaffold, ONG41008, had potent anti-fibrotic effects in diseased human lung myofibroblasts but not normal human lung fibroblasts.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the effects of ONG41008 on tumor cells, and compared these effects with those in pathogenic myofibrotic cells and normal fibroblasts cells.\n\nFindingsStimulation of A549 lung carcinoma epithelial cells with ONG41008 resulted in cellular senescence, indicating that dysregulated cell proliferation is common to fibrotic cells and tumor cells. Replicative senescence of A549 cells resulted in multinucleation, which was followed by oncogene-induced senescence. There was significant upregulation of expression and nuclear translocation of p-TP53 and p16 in ONG41008-treated A549 cells, and all cells died after 72 hr. Similar effects occurred after ONG41008 treatment in several human aggressive cancer cell lines such as PANC1, MCF7, PC3, or primary non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. Unlike cisplatin, ONG41008 was not toxic to normal human lung fibroblasts or primary prostate epithelial cells, suggesting ONG41008 can distinguish the intracellular microenvironment between normal cells and aged or diseased cells. This effect might occur as a result of the increased NAD/NADH ratio or increased lactate dehydrogenase levels in aged or diseased cells.\n\nInterpretationTo our best knowledge, this is the first study to show that a small molecule can arrest uncontrolled proliferation during fibrogenesis or tumorigenesis in vitro. ONG41008 could be a potential drug for a broad range of fibrotic or tumorigenic diseases.\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe notion that aging is a disease and that diseases occur as a consequence of aging was first put forward by David Sinclair and colleagues (Aging Cell;14(4):497-510). There are biological systems that provide evidence for this notion; for example, somatic cells can revert to embryonic cells, producing younger somatic cells. This phenomenon underlies induced pluripotent stem cells. Another example is that some types of jellyfish can live forever. These examples suggest that a counter-aging program exists in animals. Human diseases are the manifestations of cell aging generated by the accumulation of somatic mutations. Aged and pathogenic cells are senescent, so a drug that specifically targeted senescent cells might initiate a cellular program that could ameliorate age-associated disease. Indeed, the kinase inhibitor dasatinib induces cellular senescence (Clin Ther 2007 29:2289-2308). In 2017, two drugs that target senescent cells were identified: quercetin and fisetin. These drugs selectively kill senescent cells, and are referred to as senolytic drugs or senotherapeutics (Aging 2017 8;9(3):955-963). Although it is established that senescent cells accumulate in cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Nat Commun 2017 23;8 :14532), the effect of senolytic drugs in these diseases is largely unknown.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study characterized a novel drug, termed ONG41008, which was found to have both senogenic and senolytic effects in cell-based assays. ONG41008 induced senescence in myofibroblasts and several cancer cell lines representative of aggressive human cancers, which was followed by cell death. Importantly, ONG41008 exhibited essentially no toxicity on normal human lung fibroblasts or primary prostate epithelial cells.\n\nImplication of all the evidenceBased on our results, we believe that ONG41008 is a potent inducer of cellular senescence (replicative senescence and oncogene-induced senescence) and causes arrest of uncontrolled, pathogenic proliferation of myofibroblasts or cancer cells.",

We created Portal, a unified framework of adversarial domain translation to learn harmonized representations of datasets. With innovation in model and algorithm designs, Portal achieves superior performance in preserving biological variation during integration, while achieving integration of millions of cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that Portal is widely applicable to integrating datasets across samples, platforms and data types (including scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). Finally, we demonstrate the power of Portal by applying it to the integration of cross-species datasets with limited shared information among them, elucidating biological insights into the similarities and divergences in the spermatogenesis process among mouse, macaque and human.",

    "abstract": "All organisms rely on complex metabolites such as amino acids, nucleotides, and cofactors for essential metabolic processes. Some microbes synthesize these fundamental ingredients of life de novo, while others rely on uptake to fulfill their metabolic needs. Although certain metabolic processes are inherently  leaky, the mechanisms enabling stable metabolite provisioning among microbes in the absence of a host remain largely unclear. In particular, how can metabolite provisioning among free-living bacteria be maintained under the evolutionary pressure to economize resources? Salvaging, the process of  recycling and reusing, can be a metabolically efficient route to obtain access to required resources. Here, we show experimentally how precursor salvaging in engineered Escherichia coli populations can lead to stable, long-term metabolite provisioning. We find that salvaged cobamides (vitamin B12 and related enzyme cofactors) are readily made available to non-productive population members, yet salvagers are strongly protected from overexploitation due to partial metabolite privatization. We also describe a previously unnoted benefit of precursor salvaging, namely the removal of the non-functional, proliferation-inhibiting precursor. As long as compatible precursors are present, any microbe possessing the terminal steps of a biosynthetic process can, in principle, forgo de novo biosynthesis in favor of salvaging. Consequently, precursor salvaging likely represents a potent, yet overlooked, alternative to de novo biosynthesis for the acquisition and provisioning of metabolites in free-living bacterial populations.",

    "abstract": "The human SLC22A6/OAT1 plays an important role in the elimination of a broad range of endogenous substances and xenobiotics thus attracting attention from the pharmacological community. Furthermore, OAT1 is also involved in key physiological events such as the remote inter-organ communication. Despite its significance, the knowledge about hOAT1 structure and the transport mechanism at the atomic level remains fragmented owing to the lack of resolved structures. By means of protein-threading modeling refined by s-scaled Molecular Dynamics simulations, the present study provides the first robust model of hOAT1 in outward-facing conformation. Taking advantage of the AlphaFold 2 predicted structure of hOAT1 in inward-facing conformation, we here provide the essential structural and functional features comparing both states. The intracellular motifs conserved among Major Facilitator Superfamily members create a so-called \"charge-relay system\" that works as molecular switches modulating the conformation. The principal element of the event points at interactions of charged residues that appear crucial for the transporter dynamics and function. Moreover, hOAT1 model was embedded in different lipid bilayer membranes highlighting the crucial structural dependence on lipid-protein interactions. MD simulations supported the pivotal role of phosphatidylethanolamine components to the protein conformation stability. The present model is made available to decipher the impact of any observed polymorphism and mutation on drug transport as well as to understand substrate binding modes.",

    "abstract": "To gain access to the intracellular cytoplasmic niche essential for their growth and replication, apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii rely on the timely secretion of two types of apical organelles named micronemes and rhoptries. Rhoptry proteins are key to host cell invasion and remodelling, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the thight control of rhoptry discharge are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of two novel T. gondii thrombospondin-related proteins implicated in rhoptry exocytosis. The two proteins, already annotated as MIC15 and MIC14, were renamed rhoptry discharge factor 1 (RDF1) and rhoptry discharge factor 2 (RDF2) and found to be exclusive of the Coccidia class of apicomplexan parasites. Furthermore, they were shown to have a paralogous relationship and share a C-terminal transmembrane domain followed by a short cytoplasmic tail. Immunofluorescence analysis of T. gondii tachyzoites revealed that RDF1 presents a diffuse cytoplasmic localization not reminiscent of any know subcellular compartment, whereas RDF2 was not detected. Using a conditional knockout approach, we demonstrated that RDF1 loss caused a marked growth defect. The lack of the protein did not affect parasite gliding motility, host cell attachment, replication and egress, whereas invasion was dramatically reduced. Notably, while RDF1 depletion did not result in altered microneme exocytosis, rhoptry discharge was found to be heavily impaired. Interestingly, rhoptry secretion was partially reversed by spontaneous upregulation of the RDF2 gene in knockdown parasites grown under constant RDF1 repression. Collectively, our results identify RDF1 and RDF2 as additional key players in the pathway controlling rhoptry discharge. Furthermore, this study unveils a new example of compensatory mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in T. gondii.",

    "abstract": "The mitophagic degradation of mitochondrial matrix proteins in S. cerevisiae was previously shown to be selective, reflecting a pre-engulfment sorting step within the mitochondrial network. This selectivity is regulated through phosphorylation of mitochondrial matrix proteins by the matrix kinases Pkp1 and Pkp2, which in turn appear to be regulated by the phosphatase Aup1/Ptc6. However, these same proteins also regulate the phosphorylation status and catalytic activity of the yeast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is critical for mitochondrial metabolism. To understand the relationship between these two functions, we evaluated the role of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in mitophagic selectivity. Surprisingly, we identified a novel function of the complex in regulating mitophagic selectivity, which is independent of its enzymatic activity. Our data support a model in which the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex directly regulates the activity of its associated kinases and phosphatases. This regulatory interaction then determines the phosphorylation state of mitochondrial matrix proteins and their mitophagic fates.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic computations have a central role in rodent neocortical circuit function, which are signaled into neuronal output by the initiation and propagation of regenerative dendritic spikes. However, it remains poorly explored whether these mechanisms are operational in the human neocortex. To directly examine the dendritic computational properties of the most numerous class of pyramidal neuron in the human and rat neocortex we made simultaneous electrical recordings from the soma and apical dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons maintained in acute brain slices of analogous cortical areas under identical experimental conditions. In both species correlated dendritic excitatory input led to the initiation of sodium channel-mediated dendritic spikes with conserved biophysical properties. Dendritic sodium spikes in human and rat layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons could be generated across a similar wide input range, exhibited a similar frequency range of activation, and forward propagated with high fidelity to drive neuronal output to implement stereotyped computations. Our findings therefore reveal that the dendritic computational properties of human layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons are phylogenetically conserved.",

To discover G0-like states and their regulators for glioblastoma (GBM), we analyzed G0 populations in an orthotopic model of GBM using single cell RNA-seq and performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in patient-derived GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) for genes that trap cells in G0 when inhibited.

KAT5 activity suppresses the emergence of non-dividing subpopulations with oligodendrocyte progenitor and radial glial cell characteristics both in vitro and in a human GSC brain tumor model.

This process can be ambiguous or inaccurate when proteins contain domains with non-contiguous residue ranges, and especially when insertional domains are hosted within them. Here we present DomainMapper, an algorithm that accurately assigns a unique domain structure annotation to any query sequence, including those with complex topologies. We validate our domain assignments using the AlphaFold database and confirm that non-contiguity is pervasive (6.5% of all domains in yeast and 2.5% in human). Using this resource, we find that certain folds have strong propensities to be non-contiguous or insertional across the Tree of Life, likely underlying evolutionary preferences for domain topology. DomainMapper is freely available and can be run as a single command line function.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSDomainMapper generates a unique domain structure annotation, including non-contiguous and insertional domains\n\nAutomated annotations of non-contiguous domains are validated against the AlphaFold database\n\nDomainMapper can be easily installed and used by non-experts\n\nCertain folds have strong preferences to be non-contiguous or insertional\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=188 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484986v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (89K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1900be8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fdae2borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5bd5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a31d56_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Current fragment-based drug design relies on the efficient exploration of chemical space though the use of structurally diverse libraries of small fragments. However, structurally dissimilar compounds can exploit the same interactions on a target, and thus be functionally similar. Using 3D structures of many fragments bound to multiple targets, we examined if there exists a better strategy for selecting fragments for screening libraries. We show that structurally diverse fragments can be described as functionally redundant, often making the same interactions. Ranking fragments by the number of novel interactions they made, we show that functionally diverse selections of fragments substantially increase the amount of information recovered for unseen targets compared to other methods of selection. Using these results, we design small functionally efficient libraries that are able to give significantly more information about new protein targets than similarly sized structurally diverse libraries. By covering more functional space (rather than chemical space), more diverse sets of drug leads can be generated, increasing the chances of fragment screens resulting in viable drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "Homo-oligomeric ligand-activated proteins are ubiquitous in biology. The functions of such molecules are commonly regulated by allosteric coupling between ligand binding sites. Understanding the basis for this regulation requires both quantifying the free energy {Delta}G transduced between sites, and the structural basis by which it is transduced. We consider allostery in three variants of the model ring-shaped homo-oligomeric trp RNA binding attenuation protein, TRAP. First, we developed nearest-neighbor statistical thermodynamic binding models comprising microscopic free energies for ligand binding to isolated sites {Delta}GN0, and for coupling between one or both adjacent sites, {Delta}GN1 and {Delta}GN2. Using the resulting partition function (PF) we explored the effects of these parameters on simulated population distributions for the 2N possible liganded states. We then experimentally monitored liganddependent population shifts using conventional spectroscopic and calorimetric methods, and using native mass spectrometry (MS). By resolving species with differing numbers of bound ligands by their mass, native MS revealed striking differences in their ligand-dependent population shifts. Fitting the populations to a binding polynomial derived from the PF yielded coupling free energy terms corresponding to orders of magnitude differences in cooperativity. Uniquely, this approach predicts which of the possible 2N liganded states are populated at different ligand concentrations, providing necessary insights into regulation. The combination of statistical thermodynamic modeling with native MS may provide the thermodynamic foundation for a meaningful understanding of the structure-thermodynamic linkage that drives cooperativity.\n\nTOC Figure (draft)\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=74 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484990v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ce1f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a6541borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dbd08aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58297e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOTOC Figure.C_FLOATNO Ligand (Trp) binding to multiple sites on homo-oligomeric ring-shaped proteins like TRAP alters their functional states.

    "abstract": "Understanding the pharmacogenomics of opioid metabolism and behavior is vital to therapeutic success as mutations can dramatically alter therapeutic efficacy and addiction liability. We found robust, sex-dependent BALB/c substrain differences in oxycodone behaviors and whole brain concentration of oxycodone metabolites. BALB/cJ females showed robust state-dependent oxycodone reward learning as measured via conditioned place preference when compared to the closely related BALB/cByJ substrain. Accordingly, BALB/cJ females also showed a robust increase in brain concentration of the inactive metabolite noroxycodone and the active metabolite oxymorphone compared to BALB/cByJ mice. Oxymorphone is a highly potent full agonist at the mu opioid receptor that could enhance drug-induced interoception and state-dependent oxycodone reward learning. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in a BALB/c F2 reduced complexity cross revealed one major QTL on chromosome 15 underlying brain oxymorphone concentration that explained 32% of the female variance. BALB/cJ and BALB/cByJ differ by fewer than 10,000 variants which can greatly facilitate candidate gene/variant identification. Hippocampal and striatal cis-expression QTL (eQTL) and exon-level eQTL analysis identified Zhx2, a candidate gene coding for a transcriptional repressor with a private BALB/cJ retroviral insertion that reduces Zhx2 expression and sex-dependent dysregulation of CYP enzymes. Whole brain proteomics corroborated the Zhx2 eQTL and identified upregulated CYP2D11 that could increase brain oxymorphone in BALB/cJ females. To summarize, Zhx2 is a highly promising candidate gene underlying brain oxycodone metabolite levels. Future studies will validate Zhx2 and its site of action using reciprocal gene editing and tissue-specific viral manipulations in BALB/c substrains.\n\nSignificance StatementOur findings show genetic variation can result in sex-specific alterations in whole brain concentrations of bioactive opioid metabolites following oxycodone administration, and reinforces the need for sex as a biological factor in pharmacogenomic studies. The co-occurrence of female-specific increased oxymorphone and state-dependent reward learning suggests that this minor yet potent and efficacious metabolite of oxycodone could increase opioid interoception and drug-cue associative learning of opioid reward which has implications for cue-induced relapse of drug-seeking behavior.",

    "abstract": "Proteins containing polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats are prone to aggregation and can lead to distinct human pathologies. For instance, Huntingtons disease is caused by an abnormal expansion of the polyQ stretch (> Q35) of Huntingtin (HTT) protein. However, plants express hundreds of proteins containing polyQ regions, but no pathologies arising from these factors have been reported to date. Here, we ask how plants maintain the proteostasis of polyQ-containing proteins, which are intrinsically enriched in the plant proteomes. To this end, we overexpressed an aggregation-prone fragment of human HTT (Q69) in plant cells. In contrast to invertebrate and mammalian transgenic models, we find that Arabidopsis thaliana plants suppress Q69 aggregation. This elevated proteostasis ability is mediated through the import and degradation of Q69 in chloroplasts. Conversely, inhibition of chloroplast protein import either genetically or pharmacologically reduces the capacity of plant cells to prevent Q69 aggregation. We find that Q69 interacts with the chloroplast stromal processing peptidase (SPP). Notably, expression of synthetic Arabidopsis SPP is sufficient to suppress aggregation of polyQ-expanded HTT in human cells. Beyond ectopically expressed Q69-HTT, endogenous polyQ-containing proteins also aggregate in Arabidopsis upon inhibition of chloroplast import. Among them, the plastid casein kinase 2 (pCK2), which contains a polyQ region next to the chloroplast targeting sequence motif, can also be localized into the nucleus. Upon inhibition of chloroplast import, pCK2 accumulates at higher levels in the nucleus and forms diamond-shaped amyloid-like fibrils surrounding the chloroplasts. These results indicate that the differential conformation and redistribution of pCK2 to the nucleus depends on chloroplast import efficiency, providing a role of polyQ repeats in chloroplast to nucleus communication (i.e. retrograde signaling). Together, our findings establish chloroplast protein import and proteases as determinants of polyQ proteostasis, with important implications for plant biology that can also lead to therapeutic approaches for human diseases that involve protein aggregation.",

As it monitors hemodynamic activity, the resulting images are a non-standard representation of local anatomy. This leads to difficulties when determining the exact anatomical location of the recorded image, which is necessary for correctly interpreting the data. Here we propose a convolutional neural network-based framework for accurately navigating the brain during functional ultrasound imaging solely based on vascular landmarks. Our approach uses an image classification task to identify a suitable set of reference positions, from which the anatomical position of an image can be inferred with a precision of 102 {+/-} 98 {micro}m. Further analysis revealed that the predictions are driven by deep brain areas. The robustness of our approach was validated using an ischemic stroke model. It confirms that functional ultrasound imaging information is sufficient for positioning even when local blood flow is disrupted, as observed in many brain pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Nematodes are the most abundant multi-cellular animals in soil, influencing key processes and functions in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, little is known about the drivers of nematode abundance and diversity in forest soils across climatic zones. This is despite forests cover approximately 30% of the earths land surface, provide many crucial ecosystem services but strongly vary in hydrothermal conditions and associated ecosystem properties across climatic zones.\n\nHere, we collected nematode samples from 13 forests across a latitudinal gradient. We divided this gradient in temperate, warm-temperate, and tropical climatic zones. Using boosted regression trees, we showed that across the gradient, nematode abundance and diversity were mainly influenced by soil organic carbon. However, within climatic zones, other factors were more important in driving nematode alpha-diversity, nematode biomass and the abundance of different trophic groups: mean annual temperature and total soil phosphorus in temperate zones, soil pH in warm-temperate zones, and mean annual precipitation in tropical zones. Additionally, nematode beta-diversity was higher in temperate than in warm-temperate and tropical zones, and we did not find significant differences among climatic zones in nematode gamma diversity.\n\nTogether, our findings indicate a latitudinal shift in the main climatic variables controlling soil nematode communities and demonstrate that the drivers of soil nematode diversity in forested ecosystems are affected by the spatial scale and climatic conditions considered. This implies that high resolution studies are needed to accurately predict how soil functions respond if climate conditions move beyond the coping range of soil organisms. Our results also emphasize the importance of studying the area-diversity relationship of soil organisms under different climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The ANOSPP amplicon panel is a genus-wide targeted sequencing panel to facilitate large-scale monitoring of Anopheles species diversity. Combining information from the 62 nuclear amplicons present in the ANOSPP panel allows for a more nuanced species assignment than single gene (e.g. COI) barcoding, which is desirable in the light of permeable species boundaries. Here, we present NNoVAE, a method using Nearest Neighbours (NN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), which we apply to k-mers resulting from the ANOSPP amplicon sequences in order to hierarchically assign species identity. The NN step assigns a sample to a species-group by comparing the k-mers arising from each haplotypes amplicon sequence to a reference database. The VAE step is required to distinguish between closely related species, and also has sufficient resolution to reveal population structure within species. In tests on independent samples with over 80% amplicon coverage, NNoVAE correctly classifies to species level 98% of samples within the An. gambiae complex and 89% of samples outside the complex. We apply NNoVAE to over two thousand new samples from Burkina Faso and Gabon, identifying unexpected species in Gabon. NNoVAE presents an approach that may be of value to other targeted sequencing panels, and is a method that will be used to survey Anopheles species diversity and Plasmodium transmission patterns through space and time on a large scale, with plans to analyse half a million mosquitoes in the next five years.",

    "abstract": "Abstract / SummaryFor the past half-century, structural biologists relied on the notion that similar protein sequences give rise to similar structures and functions. While this assumption has driven research to explore certain parts of the protein universe, it disregards spaces that dont rely on this assumption. Here we explore areas of the protein universe where similar protein functions can be achieved by different sequences and different structures. We predict [~]200,000 structures for diverse protein sequences from 1,003 representative genomes1 across the microbial tree of life, and annotate them functionally on a per-residue basis. Structure prediction is accomplished using the World Community Grid, a large-scale citizen science initiative. The resulting database of structural models is complementary to the AlphaFold database, with regards to domains of life as well as sequence diversity and sequence length. We identify 148 novel folds and describe examples where we map specific functions to structural motifs. We also show that the structural space is continuous and largely saturated, highlighting the need for shifting the focus from obtaining structures to putting them into context, to transform all branches of biology, including a shift from sequence-based to sequence-structure-function based meta-omics analyses.",

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of biological processes that underlie the development of cancer have been long recognized, yet, existing therapeutic treatments cannot prevent cancer from continuing to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This work was aimed at exploring the extent to which the cell-membrane proteins are implicated in triggering cancer hallmark processes, and assessing the ability to pinpoint novel therapeutic targets through a combined membrane proteome/cancer hallmark perspective. By using GO annotations, a database of human proteins associated broadly with ten cancer hallmarks was created. Cell-membrane cellular subfractions of SKBR3/HER2+ breast cancer cells used as a model system were analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry, and high-quality proteins (FDR<3 %) identified by at least two unique peptides were mapped to the cancer hallmark database. Over 1100 experimentally detected cell-membrane or cell-membrane associated proteins, representing ~8 % of the human cell-membrane proteome, were mapped to the hallmark database. Representative membrane constituents such as receptors, CDs, adhesion and transport proteins were distributed over the entire genome and present in every hallmark category. Sustained proliferative signaling/cell cycle, adhesion/tissue invasion, and evasion of immune destruction emerged as prevalent hallmarks represented by the membrane proteins. Construction of protein-protein interaction networks uncovered a high level of connectivity between the hallmark members, with some receptor (EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR, MTOR, CSF1R), antigen (CD44), and adhesion (MUC1) proteins being implicated in most hallmark categories. An illustrative subset of 116 hallmark proteins that included 44 oncogenes, 28 tumor suppressors, and 38 approved drug targets was subjected to a more in-depth analysis. The existing drug targets were implicated mainly in signaling processes. Network centrality analysis revealed that nodes with high degree, rather than betweenness, represent a good resource for informing the selection of putative novel drug targets. Through heavy involvement in supporting cancer hallmark processes, we show that the functionally diverse and networked landscape of cancer cell-membrane proteins fosters unique opportunities for guiding the development of novel therapeutic interventions, including multi-agent, immuno-oncology and precision medicine applications.",

    "abstract": "Brain atlases agglomerate structural and functional features of a population of individuals in a standard coordinate space. Here, we introduce for the first time a collection of atlases that charts postnatal development of the human brain in a spatio-temporally dense manner from two weeks to two years of age. Atlases capturing month-to-month changes of the human brain are essentially nonexistent for the first two years of life -- the critical developmental period during which the brain is evolving in virtually all facets at an exponential pace. This unmet need is compounded by the lack of atlases that provide a unified and holistic picture of the brain from both the perspectives of cortical surface convolutions and tissue volumetric characteristics. Existing surface and volumetric atlases are typically constructed independently in different coordinate spaces, causing discrepancies and complications in multifaceted analyses. Our month-specific conjoint surface and volumetric atlases chart normative patterns and capture key traits of early brain development and are therefore critical for identifying aberrations from normal developmental trajectories. Our atlases represent a major advance toward providing the neuroscience community an invaluable resource to facilitate the understanding of early structural and functional development by mapping multiple measurements of infant brains in a common reference frame for precise spatio-temporal quantification of cortical and subcortical changes.",

Using cortical organoids and single-cell transcriptomics, we modeled alterations in the formation of the forebrain between sons with idiopathic ASD and their unaffected fathers in thirteen families. Alterations in the transcriptome suggest that ASD pathogenesis in macrocephalic and normocephalic probands involves an opposite disruption of the balance between the excitatory neurons of the dorsal cortical plate and other lineages such as the early-generated neurons from the putative preplate. The imbalance stemmed from a divergent expression of transcription factors driving cell fate during early cortical development. While we did not find probands genomic variants explaining the observed transcriptomic alterations, a significant overlap between altered transcripts and reported ASD risk genes affected by rare variants suggests a degree of gene convergence between rare forms of ASD and developmental transcriptome in idiopathic ASD.",

    "abstract": "One hypothesis invoked to explain limits to species ranges is a mismatch in environmental conditions between the central and marginal areas of species ranges. Low population size at the margins causes genetic drift to outplay selection locally, and limits the accumulation of genetic variance, so that adaptation is hindered locally. Earlier theoretical work shows that, for a population expanding over a spatially heterogeneous environment without any geographical barriers, adaptation will fail abruptly and sharp range margins will establish only when the underlying environmental conditions change more and more severely across space, whereas an environment changing constantly will result either in infinite expansion or rapid global extinction. Here, we extend this \"steepening-gradient hypothesis\" to encompass situations when multiple (up to three) environmental factors impose selection on separate adaptive traits. We show that multiple selection gradients steepen each other and that it is sufficient that just one of the gradients steepen in space for sharp range margins to form. This is true even if this gradient is shallow throughout the realised range. Thus, despite its detrimental role in forming range margins, it could be overlooked in field studies. Finally, by decomposing an environmental gradient to selection on two (or three) adaptive traits, we show that a population can withstand harsher environmental conditions than when selection acts on one adaptive trait alone. This finding argues for the evolution of novel traits in harsh environments.",

    "abstract": "Volume estimations are crucial for many neuroscience studies, allowing the evaluation of changes in the size of brain areas that may have relevant functional consequences. Classical histological methods and modern human brain imaging techniques rely on obtaining physical or digital sections, with a known thickness, of the organ to be analyzed. This \"slicing\" strategy is associated with an ineludible loss of information about the three-dimensional organization of the analyzed structures, especially affecting the precision of volumetric measurements. To overcome this problem, several methods have been developed. One of the most commonly used approaches for volume estimation is the classical Cavalieris method.\n\nWithin this book chapter, we provide first an overview of Cavalieris method and propose a new one, named the Truncated Cone Shape (TCS) method, for the estimation of volumes from tissue sections. Second, we compare the accuracy of both methods using computer-generated objects of different shapes and sizes. We conclude that, more frequently, the TCS method provides a better estimate of real volumes than Cavalieris method. And third, we describe a protocol to estimate volumes using a self-developed and freely available tool for ImageJ: VolumestJ (https://github.com/Jorvalgl/VolumestJ). This new tool helps to implement both Cavalieris and TCS methods using digital images of tissue sections. We consider that VolumestJ will facilitate the labor of researchers interested in volume estimations.",

Although many spatial and memory functions develop in infancy, it is considered that neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC occurs prenatally. Here we show that the postnatal human temporal lobe contains a prominent stream with large chains of young migrating neurons and many individual neurons breaking away directed into the EC. The EC stream forms between the second and third trimesters of prenatal development when the lateral ventricle walls in the temporal lobe collapse, displacing the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dividing radial glia. At birth, the EC stream follows a path of radial glial [fi]bers in the site of the collapsed ventricle. Migratory chains persist up to 11 months postnatally; however, many individually migrating young neurons can still be detected in the EC at 2 years of age and a few isolated cells at 3 years of age. Within the EC at birth, immature neurons are a mixed population expressing markers of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), but postnatally rapidly become primarily CGE-derived. Using single-nuclei RNAseq we identified these lineages and found that the MGE-derived neurons matured at earlier postnatal ages compared to those derived from the CGE. The CGE interneurons arriving and maturing the latest included subtypes expressing calretinin (CR), reelin (RELN), and vasoactive intestinal protein (VIP) many of which settle in layer II of the entorhinal cortex. This study reveals that the human EC is still being constructed during the first years of life revealing the largest known postnatal stream of migratory neurons in humans. The protracted postnatal arrival of a diverse population of interneurons could contribute to plasticity8,9 and proper excitation-inhibition balance10,11 within these highly connected brain circuits.",

    "abstract": "The transmembrane protein integrin plays a crucial role in the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix. Integrin recruits many proteins intracellularly, including a four protein complex (Kindlin, Integrin linked kinase (ILK), PINCH, and parvin). C. elegans muscle provides an excellent model to study integrin adhesion complexes. In C. elegans, UNC-112 (Kindlin) binds to the cytoplasmic tail of PAT-3 ({beta}-integrin) and to PAT-4 (ILK). We previously reported that PAT-4 binding to UNC-112 is essential for the binding of UNC-112 to PAT-3. Although there are crystal structures for ILK and a kindlin, there is no co-crystal structure available. To understand the molecular interaction between PAT-4 (ILK) and UNC-112 (Kindlin), we took a genetic approach. First, we isolated mutant PAT-4 proteins that cannot bind to UNC-112. Then, we isolated suppressor mutant UNC-112 proteins that restore interaction with mutant PAT-4 proteins. Second, these mutant PAT-4 proteins cannot localize to attachment structures in nematode muscle, but upon co-expression of an UNC-112 suppressor mutant protein, the mutant PAT-4 protein could localize to attachment structures. Third, overexpression of a mutant PAT-4 protein results in disorganization of the adhesion plaques at muscle cell boundaries, and co-expression of the UNC-112 supressor mutant protein alleviates this defect. Thus, we demonstrate that UNC-112 binding to PAT-4 is required for the localization and function of PAT-4 in integrin adhesion complexes in vivo. The missense mutations were mapped onto homology models of PAT-4 and UNC-112, and taking into account previously isolated mutations, we suggest a surface of PAT-4 that binds to UNC-112.",

This has been demonstrated by numerous studies in simple model organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabdits elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. Because most genetic screens examine loss of function mutations or decreased expression of genes through reverse genetics, essential genes have often been overlooked as potential modulators of the aging process. By taking the approach of increasing the expression level of a subset of conserved essential genes, we found that 25% of these genes resulted in increased replicative lifespan in S. cerevisiae. This is greater than the [~]3.5% of genes found to affect lifespan upon deletion, suggesting that activation of essential genes may have a relatively disproportionate effect on increasing lifespan. The results of our experiments demonstrate that essential gene overexpression is a rich, relatively unexplored means of increasing eukaryotic lifespan.",

Here, we disentangle for the first time the contributions of three gustatory receptors (AmGr1-3) in sugar sensing of honeybees by combining CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic knock-out, electrophysiology and behaviour. AmGr1 responds to multiple sugars. Bees lacking this receptor have a reduced response to sucrose and glucose but not to fructose. AmGr2 acts as co-receptor of AmGr1 in a heterologous expression system, but honeybee knock-out mutants perform normally. Eliminating AmGr3 while preserving AmGr1 and AmGr2 abolishes the perception of fructose but not of sucrose. We thus dissociate the roles of AmGr1, AmGr2 and AmGr3 in honeybee taste perception.",

The situation is less clear when actions of the avatar satisfies the intention of the user despite distortions and noticeable differences between user and avatar movements. A within-subject experiment was here conducted to determine whether a finger swap helping users achieve a task would be more tolerated than one penalizing them. In particular, in a context of fast-paced finger movements and with clear correct or incorrect responses, we swapped the finger animation of the avatar (e.g. user moves the index finger, the avatar moves the middle one) to either automatically correct for spontaneous mistakes or to introduce incorrect responses. Subjects playing a VR game were asked to report when they noticed the introduction of a finger swap. Results based on 3256 trials (~24% of swaps noticed) show that swaps helping users have significantly fewer odds of being noticed (and with higher confidence) than the ones penalizing users. This demonstrates how the context and the intention for motor action are important factors for the SoA and for embodiment, opening new perspectives on how to design and study interactions in immersive VR.",

    "abstract": "Development of the male gametophyte is a tightly regulated process that requires precise control of cell division and gene expression. A relevant aspect to understand the events underlying pollen development regulation constitutes the identification and characterization of the genes required for this process. In this work we showed that the DC1 domain protein BINUCLEATE POLLEN (BNP) is essential for pollen development and germination. Pollen grains carrying the defective BNP allele failed to complete mitosis II and are impaired in pollen germination. By yeast two-hybrid analysis and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we identified a set of BNP-interacting proteins. Among confirmed interactors we found NAC family transcriptional regulators Vascular Plant One-Zinc Finger 1 (VOZ1) and VOZ2. VOZ1 localization changes during pollen development, moving to the vegetative nucleus at the tricellular stage. We observed that this relocalization requires BNP, as in the absence of BNP in pollen from bnp/BNP plants, VOZ1 nuclear localization is impaired. As voz1voz2 double mutants showed the same developmental defect observed in bnp pollen grains, we propose that BNP requirement to complete microgametogenesis could be linked to its interaction with VOZ1/2 proteins. BNP could have a role of scaffold protein, recruiting VOZ1/2 to the endosomal system into assemblies that are required for their further translocation to the nucleus, where they act as transcriptional regulators.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=180 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484815v3_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (67K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8680b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6ac6fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ddf1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193693c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO BNP codes for a DC1 domain containing protein.

    "abstract": "In the natural environment, we often form stable perceptual experiences from ambiguous and fleeting sensory inputs. Which neural activity underlies the content of perception and which neural activity supports perceptual stability remains an open question. We used a bistable perception paradigm involving ambiguous images to behaviorally dissociate perceptual content from perceptual stability, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure whole-brain neural dynamics in humans. Combining multivariate decoding and neural state-space analyses, we found frequency band-specific neural signatures that underlie the content of perception and promote perceptual stability, respectively. Across different types of images, non-oscillatory neural activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range supported the content of perception. By contrast, perceptual stability is influenced by the amplitude of alpha and beta oscillations. In addition, neural activity underlying perceptual memory, which supports perceptual stability when sensory input is temporally removed from view, also encodes elapsed time. Together, these results reveal distinct neural mechanisms that support the content vs. stability of visual perception.",

    "abstract": "Enteroendocrine cells are specialized sensory cells of the gut-brain axis that are sparsely distributed along the intestinal epithelium. The functions of enteroendocrine cells have classically been inferred by the gut hormones they release. However, individual enteroendocrine cells typically produce multiple, sometimes apparently opposing, gut hormones in combination, and some gut hormones are also produced elsewhere in the body. Here, we developed approaches involving intersectional genetics to enable selective access to enteroendocrine cells in vivo. We constructed Villin1-p2a-FlpO knock-in mice to restrict reporter expression to intestinal epithelium and through combined use of Cre and Flp alleles, effectively targeted major transcriptome-defined enteroendocrine cell lineages that produce serotonin, glucagon-like peptide 1, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, or glucose insulinotropic peptide. Chemogenetic activation of different enteroendocrine cell types variably impacted feeding behavior, nausea-associated behaviors (conditioned flavor avoidance), and gut motility. Defining the physiological roles of different enteroendocrine cell types provides an essential framework for understanding sensory biology of the intestine.",

Wellness Darts is a sport involving not only throwing darts but also walking to pull them out of the board, memorizing the score, and subtracting it from the total score, thus allowing the performance of two tasks simultaneously: exercise and calculation. It is expected to prevent dementia, and of great interest, whether the continual dart training affects brain function. Before conducting the longitudinal study revealing the Wellness Darts-intervention effect on brain function, here we aimed to cross-sectionally confirm the difference in hemispheric lateralization between expert and non-expert players.\n\nMethodsFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure brain activity for three groups: an expert older group who practiced darts continually, a non-expert older control group, and a non-expert younger control group. Their brain activity patterns were quantified by lateralization index (LI) and compared between groups.\n\nResultsThe results showed that the younger and the expert older groups had significantly higher LI values than the non-expert older group and that these values did not differ between the expert older and the younger groups.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that the Wellness Darts possibly promote hemispheric lateralization.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Omicron represents a major global health challenge. Here we present data from a study in non-human primates demonstrating durable protection against the Omicron BA.1 variant induced by a subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, consisting of RBD (receptor binding domain) on the I53-50 nanoparticle, adjuvanted with AS03, currently in Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05007951). Vaccination induced robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers that were maintained at high levels for at least one year after two doses (Pseudovirus nAb GMT: 2207, Live-virus nAb GMT: 1964) against the ancestral strain, but not against Omicron. However, a booster dose at 6-12 months with RBD-Wu or RBD-{beta} (RBD from the Beta variant) displayed on I53-50 elicited equivalent and remarkably high neutralizing titers against the ancestral as well as the Omicron variant. Furthermore, there were substantial and persistent memory T and B cell responses reactive to Beta and Omicron variants. Importantly, vaccination resulted in protection against Omicron infection in the lung (no detectable virus in any animal) and profound suppression of viral burden in the nares (median peak viral load of 7567 as opposed to 1.3x107 copies in unvaccinated animals) at 6 weeks post final booster. Even at 6 months post vaccination, there was significant protection in the lung (with 7 out of 11 animals showing no viral load, 3 out of 11 animals showing ~20-fold lower viral load than unvaccinated controls) and rapid control of virus in the nares. These results highlight the durable cross-protective immunity elicited by the AS03-adjuvanted RBD-I53-50 nanoparticle vaccine platform.",

    "abstract": "To provide a unique global view of the relative potential for evasion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by SARS-CoV-2 lineages as they evolve over time, we performed a comprehensive analysis of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II binding peptides in spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein sequences of all available SARS-CoV-2 genomes as provided by NIH NCBI at a bi-monthly interval between March and December of 2021. A data supplement of all B.1.1.529 (Omicron) genomes from GISAID in early December was also used to capture the rapidly spreading variant. A key finding is that throughout continued viral evolution and increasing rates of mutations occurring at T-cell epitope hotspots, protein instances with worst case binding loss did not become the most frequent for any Variant of Concern (VOC) or Variant of Interest (VOI) lineage; suggesting T-cell evasion is not likely to be a dominant evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2. We also determined that throughout the course of the pandemic in 2021, there remained a relatively steady ratio of viral variants that exhibit conservation of epitopes in the N protein, despite significant potential for epitope loss in S relative to other lineages. We further localized conserved regions in N with high epitope yield potential, and illustrated HLA-I binding heterogeneity across the S protein consistent with empirical observations. Although Omicrons high volume of mutations caused it to exhibit more epitope loss potential than most frequently observed versions of proteins in almost all other VOCs, epitope candidates across its most frequent N proteins were still largely conserved. This analysis adds to the body of evidence suggesting that N may have merit as an additional antigen to elicit immune responses to vaccination with increased potential to provide sustained protection against COVID-19 disease in the face of emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused a global economic and health crisis. Recently, plasma levels of galectin-9 (Gal-9), a {beta}-galactoside-binding lectin involved in immune regulation and viral immunopathogenesis, were reported to be elevated in the setting of severe COVID-19 disease. However, the impact of Gal-9 on SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunopathology remained to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Gal-9 treatment potently enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway epithelial cells (AECs), including primary AECs in air-liquid interface (ALI) culture. Gal-9-glycan interactions promote SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry into AECs in an ACE2-dependent manner, enhancing the binding affinity of the viral spike protein to ACE2. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Gal-9 and SARS-CoV-2 infection synergistically induce the expression of key pro-inflammatory programs in AECs including the IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, EIF2, and TNF signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that manipulation of Gal-9 should be explored as a therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nImportanceCOVID-19 continues to have a major global health and economic impact. Identifying host molecular determinants that modulate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and pathology is a key step in discovering novel therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. Several recent studies have revealed that plasma concentrations of the human {beta}-galactoside-binding protein galectin-9 (Gal-9) are highly elevated in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we investigated the impact of Gal-9 on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis ex vivo in airway epithelial cells (AECs), the critical initial targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings reveal that Gal-9 potently enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication in AECs, interacting with glycans to enhance the binding between viral particles and entry receptors on the target cell surface. Moreover, we determined that Gal-9 accelerates and exacerbates several virus-induced pro-inflammatory programs in AECs that are established signature characteristics of COVID-19 disease and SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our findings suggest that Gal-9 is a promising pharmacological target for COVID-19 therapies.",

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable cities depend on urban forests. City trees improve our health, clean the air, store CO2, and cool local temperatures. Comparatively less is known about urban forests as ecosystems, particularly their spatial composition, nativity statuses, biodiversity, and tree health. Here, we assembled and standardized a new dataset of N=5,132,890 trees from 63 of the largest US cities with detailed information on location, health, nativity status, and species. We further designed new tools to analyze the ecosystem structure of urban forests, including spatial clustering and abundance of native trees, and validate these tools in comparison to past methods. We show that city trees are significantly clustered by species in 93% of cities, potentially increasing pest vulnerability (even in cities with biodiverse urban forests). Further, non-native species significantly homogenize urban forests across cities, while native trees comprise 0.44%-85.6% (median=45.6%) of city tree populations. Native trees are less frequent in drier cities, and indeed climate significantly shapes both nativity and biodiversity in urban forests. Parks are more biodiverse than urban settings. Compared to past work which focused primarily on canopy cover and species richness, we show the importance of analyzing spatial composition and nativity statuses in urban forests (and we created new datasets and tools to do so). This dataset could be analyzed in combination with citizen-science datasets on bird, insect, or plant biodiversity; social and demographic data; or data on the physical environment.

    "abstract": "The insular cortex, or insula, is a large brain region involved in the detection of thirst and the control of water intake. However our understanding of the topographical, circuit and molecular mechanisms the controlling water intake within the insula remains parcellated. We found that type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) within the insular cortex participate to the regulation of water intake, and deconstructed circuit mechanisms of this control. Topographically, we revealed that the activity of excitatory neurons in both anterior (aIC) and posterior (pIC) insula increases in response to water intake, yet removal of CB1 receptors only in the pIC decreases water intake. Interestingly, we found that CB1 receptors are highly expressed in insula projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), while undetectable in the neighboring central part of the amygdala. Thus, we imaged the neurons of the anterior or posterior insula targeting the BLA (aIC-BLA and pIC-BLA), and found they oppositely respond to water intake, respectively decreasing and increasing their activity upon water drinking. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of pIC-BLA neurons decreased water intake. Finally, we uncovered CB1-dependent short term synaptic plasticity (depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, DSE) selectively in pIC-BLA, compared to aIC-BLA synapses. Altogether, our results support a model where CB1 signaling in the pIC-BLA pathway exerts a positive control on water intake.",

    "abstract": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling has been extensively studied in inflammatory diseases and cancer while its role in T cell responses to infection is unclear. Using Listeria monocytogenes strains engineered to induce different levels of c-di-AMP, we found that strong STING signals impaired T cell memory upon infection via increased Bim levels and apoptosis. Unexpectedly, reduction of TCR signal strength or T cell-STING expression decreased Bim expression, T cell apoptosis and recovered T cell memory. We found that TCR signal intensity coupled STING signal strength to the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and T cell survival. Under strong STING signaling, IDO inhibition also reduced apoptosis and led to a recovery of T cell memory in STING sufficient CD8 T cells. Thus, STING signaling regulates CD8 T cell memory fitness through both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. These studies provide insight into how IDO and STING therapies could improve long-term T cell protective immunity.\n\nSignificance StatementSTING signaling is an innate pathway that triggers host immunity against pathogens and cancer in response to cytosolic DNA. Additionally, STING signaling overactivation has been linked to autoimmunity. Yet, the interaction between antigenic and STING signaling and its impact in the development of protective immunity has remained unexplored. We found that strong levels of STING signaling impair CD8 T cell memory but only in response to high affinity TCR-pMHC interactions. Here, we provide evidence of how TCR signal strength controls STING signaling and IDO metabolism to regulate T cells survival as they mature to memory. These data have important implications for the design of STING and IDO combination immunotherapies",

    "abstract": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is essential for the type I interferon response against a variety of DNA pathogens1,2. Upon emergence of cytosolic DNA, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi where STING activates the downstream kinase TBK1, then to lysosome through recycling endosomes (REs) for its degradation3-6. Although the molecular machinery of STING activation is extensively studied and defined7, the one underlying STING degradation has not yet been fully elucidated. Here we show an unanticipated mechanism termed \"lysosomal vesiculophagy\" dictates STING degradation. Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and correlative light/electron microscopy show that a cluster of STING-positive vesicles of an RE origin are directly encapsulated into lysosome. Screening of mammalian Vps genes, the yeast homologues of which regulate Golgi-to-vacuole transport8, shows that the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) is essential for the STING encapsulation into lysosome. Knockdown of Tsg101 and Vps4, components of ESCRT9, results in the accumulation of STING vesicles in the cytosol, leading to the sustained type I interferon response. STING undergoes ubiquitination at REs and degradation of STING requires the ubiquitin-binding domain of Tsg101, ensuring the selective degradation of activated STING. Our results reveal a novel mode of autophagy that prevents hyperactivation of innate immune signalling and provide insights into the ER-Golgi-REs-lysosomes pathway for degradation of transmembrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Although ecological networks are typically constructed based on a single type of interaction, e.g. trophic interactions in a food web, a more complete picture of ecosystem composition and functioning arises from merging networks of multiple interaction types. In this work, we consider tripartite networks constructed by merging two bipartite networks, one mutualistic and one antagonistic. Taking the interactions within each sub-network to be distributed randomly, we consider the stability of the dynamics of the network based on the spectrum of its community matrix. In the asymptotic limit of a large number of species, we show that the spectrum undergoes an eigenvalue phase transition, which leads to an abrupt destabilisation of the network as the ratio of mutualists to antagonists is increased. We also derive results that show how this transition is manifest in networks of finite size, as well as when disorder is introduced in the segregation of the two interaction types. Our random-matrix results will serve as a baseline for understanding the behaviour of merged networks with more realistic structures and/or more detailed dynamics.",

We conducted the largest set of meta-analyses on human partner correlations to date, incorporating 480 partner correlations across 22 traits. We also calculated 133 trait correlations between up to 79,074 male-female couples in the UK Biobank (UKB). Estimates of the mean meta-analyzed correlations ranged from rmeta=.08 for extraversion to rmeta=.58 for political values. UKB correlations ranged from rUKB=-.18 for chronotype to rUKB=.87 for birth year. Overall, attitudes, education, and substance use traits mostly showed the highest correlations, while psychological and biological traits generally yielded lower but still positive correlations. We observed high between-study heterogeneity for most meta-analyzed traits, likely because of both systematic differences between samples and true differences in partner correlations across populations.",

Here, we reveal programmed L1 activation by SOX6, a transcription factor critical for parvalbumin (PV+) interneuron development7-9. PV+ neurons harbor unmethylated and euchromatic L1 promoters, express L1 mRNA, and permit L1 transgene mobilization in vivo. Elevated L1 expression in adult dentate gyrus PV+ neurons is however attenuated by environmental enrichment. Nanopore sequencing of PV+ neurons identifies unmethylated L1 loci providing alternative promoters to core PV+ neuron genes, such as CAPS2.

More than four decades of Legionella research has provided important insights into Legionella pathogenesis [1]. Although standard commercial microscopes have led to significant advances in understanding Legionella pathogenesis [2,3], great potential exists in the deployment of more advanced imaging techniques to provide additional insights. The Lattice Light Sheet Microscope (LLSM) is a recently developed microscope for 4D live cell imaging with high resolution and minimum photo-damage [4]. We built a LLSM with an improved version for the optical layout with two path-stretching mirror sets and a novel Reconfigurable Galvanometer Scanner (RGS) module to improve the reproducibility and reliability of the alignment and maintenance of the LLSM. We commissioned this LLSM to study Legionella pneumophila infection with a tailored workflow designed over instrumentation, experiments, and data processing methods. Our results indicate that Legionella pneumophila infection is correlated with a series of morphological signatures such as smoothness, migration pattern and polarity both statistically and dynamically. Our work demonstrates the benefits of using LLSM for studying long-term questions in bacterial infection. Our free-for-use modifications and workflow designs on the use of LLSM system contributes to the adoption and promotion of the state-of-the-art LLSM technology for both academic and commercial applications.",

We uncovered combinations of transcription factors whose expression patterns are predominantly associated with cell type specification or spatial position, enabling the deconvolution of cell fate and position identity. We demonstrate that the embryonic limb undergoes a complex multi-scale re-organization upon perturbation of one of its spatial organizing centers, including the loss of specific cell populations, specific alterations in the molecular identities of other pre-existing cell states and changes in their relative spatial distribution.

    "abstract": "The development of cortical neuronal wiring is precisely orchestrated and goes through several stages, some of which coincide with critical periods when sensory experience is most influential. In particular, although ascending excitatory and inhibitory projections from the deep layer 5 to upper layers are first strong, they recede by the end of the critical period of their targets cells located in upper layers. Alterations in these transient innervations impair the construction of the later circuits that remain at adulthood, but it is unknown whether they could lead to pathologies. Here, we address this question in a genetic model of Absence Epilepsy, a neuro-developmental disease, where epileptogenesis occurs during the postnatal maturation of barrel cortex, the seizure initiation site. Using functional mapping by laser scanning photostimulation with glutamate uncaging in slices, we investigated the pattern of projections onto layers 2/3 pyramidal cells from 2-week old rats. We found that its maturation skipped the key stage during which pyramidal cells received strong projections from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons located in deep layers. At the same age, neuronal activity recorded in vivo with two-photon functional imaging was organized in fewer clusters than in control rat pups during this transient hyper-innervation. Later, around the onset of typical absence seizures ([~]1 month old), over-excitability of cells was observed across layers. Using this genetic model of childhood epilepsy, we provide first evidence that failure to develop this transient hyper-innervation from deep cortical layers plays a role in pathological neural dysfunctions.\n\nSignificance StatementDuring development of cortex, innervation from deep to upper layers is thought to provide a temporary scaffold for the construction of the circuits that remain at adulthood. Whether an alteration in this sequence causes brain malfunctions in neuro-developmental diseases is unknown. Using functional approaches, we investigated in a genetic model of Absence Epilepsy and control rats the maturation of innervation onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of barrel cortex and the cell organization into neuronal assemblies. We found that development in this model lacks this early surge of connectivity with deep layers and the concomitant structuring into multiple assemblies. Later on, at seizure onset, neurons in all layers are hyper-excitable, suggesting this feature of epilepsy develops from prior connectivity defects.",

Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) was used to record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, three-dimensional (3D) gait kinematics and behavioral responses in the cognitive task, during sitting or walking on a treadmill. In a cohort of twenty-six (26) young adults, fourteen (14) participants improved in measures of cognitive task performance while walking compared to sitting. These participants exhibited walking-related EEG amplitude reductions over frontal brain scalp regions during key stages of inhibitory control (conflict monitoring, control implementation and pre-motor stages), accompanied by reduced stride-to-stride variability and faster responses to stimuli compared to those who did not improve. In contrast, the twelve (12) participants who did not improve exhibited no EEG amplitude differences across physical condition. The neural activity changes associated with performance improvement during dual tasking hold promise as cognitive flexibility markers that can potentially help assess cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration.",

In this study we investigate how tFUS modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical limb stimulation through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. We deliver ultrasound in a pulsed pattern to attempt to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that found following electrical stimulation. We show that neural firing in response to peripheral electrical stimulation is increased after ultrasound stimulation at all frequencies, showing tFUS induced excitation in individual neurons in vivo. We demonstrate tFUS frequency dependent pairwise correlation changes between neurons, with both potentiation and depression observed at different frequencies.

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging-based brain-age estimation via machine learning has emerged as an important new approach for studying brain aging. The difference between ones estimated brain age and chronological age, the brain age gap (BAG), has been proposed as an Alzheimers Disease (AD) biomarker. However, most past studies on the BAG have been cross-sectional. Identifying how an individuals BAG temporal pattern changes over time would enable improved prediction of clinical outcome based on neurophysiological changes and better understanding of AD progression. To fill this gap, our study conducted predictive modeling using large neuroimaging data with up to 8 years of follow-up to examine the temporal patterns of the BAGs trajectory and how it varies by subject-level characteristics and disease status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to take a longitudinal approach to investigate the pattern and rate of change in BAG over time in individuals who progress from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to clinical AD. Combining multimodal imaging data in a support vector regression model to estimate brain age yielded improved performance than single modality. Multilevel modeling results showed the BAG followed a linear increasing trajectory with a significantly faster rate in individuals with MCI who progressed to AD compared to cognitively normal or MCI individuals who did not progress. The dynamic changes in the BAG during AD progression were further moderated by gender and APO{varepsilon}4 carriership. Findings demonstrate the BAG as a potential biomarker for understanding individual specific temporal patterns related to AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Psilocybin is a psychedelic with therapeutic potential. While there is growing evidence that psilocybin exerts its beneficial effects through enhancing neural plasticity, the exact brain regions involved are not completely understood. Determining the impact of psilocybin on plasticity-related gene expression throughout the brain can broaden our understanding of the neural circuits involved in psychedelic-evoked neural plasticity. In this study, whole-brain serial two-photon microscopy and light sheet microscopy were employed to map the expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, in male and female mice. The drug-induced c-Fos expression following psilocybin administration was compared to that of subanesthetic ketamine and saline control. Psilocybin and ketamine produced acutely comparable elevations in c-Fos expression in numerous brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, locus coeruleus, primary visual cortex, central and basolateral amygdala, medial and lateral habenula, and claustrum. Select regions exhibited drug-preferential differences, such as dorsal raphe and insular cortex for psilocybin and the CA1 subfield of hippocampus for ketamine. To gain insights into the contributions of receptors and cell types, the c-Fos expression maps were related to brain-wide in situ hybridization data. The transcript analyses showed that the endogenous levels of Grin2a and Grin2b are predictive of whether a cortical region is sensitive to drug-evoked neural plasticity for both ketamine and psilocybin. Collectively, the systematic mapping approach produced an unbiased list of brain regions impacted by psilocybin and ketamine. The data are a resource that highlights previously underappreciated regions for future investigations. Furthermore, the robust relationships between drug-evoked c-Fos expression and endogenous transcript distributions suggest glutamatergic receptors as a potential convergent target for how psilocybin and ketamine produce their rapid-acting and long-lasting therapeutic effects.",

    "abstract": "Inflammaging has received considerable attention because aging is characterized by low-grade, chronic and asymptomatic inflammation, concomitant with increased blood levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). On the other hand, IL-27 is not categorized as SASP factors though it is known that IL-27 has pleiotropic roles in inflammation. Here, we evaluated the interaction between TNF-alpha and IL-27 in the context of low-grade inflammation by using in HaCaT cells. TNF-alpha induced significant upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8 through the experimental concentrations (~10 ng/ml) of TNF-alpha, while the mRNA expression levels of IL-1RA, IL-10 and IL-18BP were unchanged. After confirming the expression of IL-27 receptor in HaCaT cells, we examined the effects of IL-27 alone on the cytokine expression. IL-27 alone significantly enhanced mRNA expression levels of IL-10 and IL-18BP by 1.61-fold and 1.46-fold, respectively, and also enhanced mRNA expression levels of IL-6 by 2.32-fold. In the presence of 100 ng/ml IL-27, the expression levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1RA, IL-10 and IL-18BP, were significantly upregulated with the treatment of a physiological concentration (1 ng/ml) TNF-alpha. Taken together, a high concentration of IL-27 exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in the presence of a low concentration of TNF-alpha when keratinocytes are the recipient of IL-27 signaling, suggesting the anti-inflammatory roles of IL-27 in inflammaging may be regulated by TNF-alpha concentration.",

    "abstract": "Monogenic diseases can often manifest diverse clinical phenotypes and cause diagnostic dilemmas. While monoallelic loss-of-function variants in TNFAIP3 (Haploinsufficiency of A20; HA20) cause a highly penetrant autoinflammatory disease, the variable expressivity suggest a role for additional genetic and environmental disease modifiers. Here, we identify critically ill children who inherited a family-specific TNFAIP3 deletion from one of their otherwise healthy parents. Each of the probands also inherited in trans a subtle loss-of-function I207L TNFAIP3 variant that is common in Oceania, originally introgressed from Denisovans. Modelling this compound heterozgous state in mice under specific pathogen free conditions demonstrated a reduced threshold to break immune tolerance. Exaggerated immune responses were precipitated by inheriting the two genetic hits on the TNFAIP3 checkpoint coupled with increasing the microbial challenge to immune tolerance, either by co-housing with pet store mice carrying a wild microbial burden or by transient dietary exposure to a chemical that diminishes the intestinal mucin barrier separating gut microbes from immune sensing systems. These data illuminate second-hit genetic and environmental modifiers contributing to complex inflammatory and autoimmune disease. Increased mechanistic understanding of the presence and contribution of disease modifiers will aid diagnostic and prognostic patient stratification and potentially reveal novel therapeutic opportunities.",

    "abstract": "The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to adapt to its surrounding environment is critical for the bacterium to successfully colonize its host. Transcriptional changes are a vital mechanism by which Mtb responds to key environmental signals experienced, such as pH, chloride (Cl-), nitric oxide (NO), and hypoxia. However, much remains unknown regarding how Mtb coordinates its response to the disparate signals seen during infection. Utilizing a transcription factor (TF) overexpression plasmid library in combination with a pH/Cl--responsive luciferase reporter, we identified the essential TF, PrrA, part of the PrrAB two-component system, as a TF involved in modulation of Mtb response to pH and Cl-. Further studies revealed that PrrA also affected Mtb response to NO and hypoxia, with prrA overexpression dampening induction of NO and hypoxia- responsive genes. PrrA is phosphorylated not just by its cognate sensor histidine kinase PrrB, but also by serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) at a second distinct site. Strikingly, a STPK phosphoablative PrrA variant was significantly dampened in its response to NO versus wild type Mtb, disrupted in its ability to adaptively enter a non-replicative state upon extended NO exposure, and attenuated for in vivo colonization. Together, our results reveal PrrA as an important regulator of Mtb response to multiple environmental signals, and uncover a critical role of STPK regulation of PrrA in its function.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial insect queens have been suggested to be counter-examples to the standard evolutionary theory of ageing through lacking costs of reproduction. Using the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), we tested this hypothesis experimentally against the alternative that costs of reproduction exist in eusocial insect queens, but are latent, resulting in the positive fecundity-longevity relationship typically found in unmanipulated queens. We experimentally increased queens costs of reproduction by removing their eggs, which causes queens to increase their egg-laying rate. Treatment queens had significantly reduced longevity relative to control queens whose egg-laying rate was not increased. In addition, treatment and control queens differed in age-related gene expression based on mRNA-seq in both their overall expression profiles and the expression of ageing-related genes. Remarkably, this occurred principally with respect to relative age, not chronological age. These results provide the first simultaneously phenotypic and transcriptomic experimental evidence of costs of reproduction in queens of eusocial insects and suggest how the genetic pathways underpinning ageing might become remodelled during eusocial evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAsymmetric genitalia have repeatedly evolved in animals, yet the underlying causes for their evolution are mostly unknown. The fruitfly Drosophila pachea has asymmetric external genitalia and an asymmetric phallus with a right-sided gonopore. The complex of female and male genitalia is asymmetrically twisted during copulation and males adopt a right-sided copulation posture on top of the female. We wished to investigate if asymmetric male genital morphology and a twisted gentitalia complex may be associated with differential allocation of sperm into female sperm storage organs.\n\nMethodsWe examined the internal complex of female and male reproductive organs by micro-computed tomography using Synchrotron X-rays before, during and after copulation. In additon, we monitored sperm aggregation states and timing of sperm transfer during copulation by premature interruption of copulation at different time-points.\n\nResultsThe asymmetric phallus is located at the most caudal end of the female abdomen during copulation. The female reproductive tract, in particular the oviduct, re-arranges during copulation. It is narrow in virgin females and forms a broad vesicle at 20 min after the start of copulation. Sperm transfer into female sperm storage organs (spermathecae) was only in a minority of examined copulation trials (13 / 64). Also, we found that sperm was mainly transferred early, at 2 - 4 min after the start of copulation. We did not detect a particular pattern of sperm allocation in the left or right spermathecae. Sperm adopted a granular or filamentous aggregation state in the female uterus and spermathecae, respectively.\n\nDiscussionNo evidence for asymmetric sperm deposition was identified that could be associated with asymmetric genital morphology or twisted complexing of genitalia. Male genital asymmetry may potentially have evolved as a consequence of a complex internal alignment of reproductive organs during copulation in order to optimize low sperm transfer rates.",

    "abstract": "Rhizoctonia cerealis (Rce), which causes sharp eyespot, is one of the most destructive wheat pathogens. However, the genetic and molecular virulence mechanisms of Rce have not been elucidated. As a dikaryotic organism, the haplotype phasing of this fungus has not been completed so far. We applied a haplotype phasing algorithm to generate a high-quality near telomere-to-telomere nuclear-phased genome sequence of Rce strain R0301. Sixteen pairs of chromosomes were assigned to the A and B genomes with a total size of 83 Mb. Based on a dual-time course RNA-seq, 25308 genes were predicted. Genes for steroid biosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism were significantly enriched, together with many genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and secreted effector proteins, which should be involved in infection of wheat plants. Population genomic analysis of 31 isolates collected in China during the last forty years suggests that this population has not undergone substantial differentiation over time.\n\nImportanceThe finished genome reference is the basis of revealing pathogens biology base. Many efforts have been made to produce the chromosome-scale assembly of fungi. However, the reference of many pathogenic fungi is highly fragmented, which prevents the analysis of genome structure variation, evolution and import pathogenicity genes. Here, we assembly the only chromosome-scale haplotype-phased reference of dikaryotic fungus so far. This assembly achieves the gold standard based on many evaluation software, which indicates that the pipeline developed in this study can be applied to assemble references for other dikaryotic organisms. This work can also promote the research on the globes destructive wheat pathogens, sharp eyespot, caused by R. cerealis.",

Here, we attempt to apply functionalized lignin to confer antioxidation to the extracellular microenvironments of wounds and to deliver oxygen from the dissociation of calcium peroxide for enhanced vascularization and healing responses without eliciting inflammatory responses. Elemental analysis showed 17 times higher quantity of calcium in the oxygen releasing nanoparticles. Lignin composites including the oxygen releasing nanoparticles released around 500 ppm oxygen per day at least for 7 days. By modulating the concentration of the methacrylated gelatin, we were able to maintain the injectability of lignin composite precursors and the stiffness of lignin composites suitable for wound healing after photo-crosslinking. In situ formation of lignin composites with the oxygen releasing nanoparticles enhanced the rate of tissue granulation, the formation of blood vessels and the infiltration of -smooth muscle actin+ fibroblasts into the wounds over 7 days. At 30 days after surgery, the lignin composite with oxygen generating nanoparticles remodeled the collagen architecture resembling to the reticular pattern of unwounded collagen with minimal scar formation. Thus, our study shows the potential of functionalized lignin for wound healing applications requiring balanced antioxidation and controlled release of oxygen for enhanced tissue granulation, vascularization and maturation of collagens.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees based on copy number alterations (CNAs) for multi-region samples of a single cancer patient are helpful to understand the spatio-temporal evolution of cancers, especially in tumours driven by chromosomal instability. Due to the high cost of deep sequencing data, low-coverage data are more accessible in practice, which only allow the calling of (relative) total copy numbers due to the lower resolution. However, methods to reconstruct sample phylogenies from CNAs often use allele-specific copy numbers and those using total copy number are mostly distance matrix or maximum parsimony methods which do not handle temporal data or estimate mutation rates. In this work, we developed a new maximum likelihood method based on a novel evolutionary model of CNAs, CNETML, to infer phylogenies from spatio-temporal samples taken within a single patient. CNETML is the first program to jointly infer the tree topology, node ages, and mutation rates from total copy numbers when samples were taken at different time points. Our extensive simulations suggest CNETML performed well even on relative copy numbers with subclonal whole genome doubling events and under slight violation of model assumptions. The application of CNETML to real data from Barretts esophagus patients also generated consistent results with previous discoveries and novel early CNAs for further investigations.",

Exceptionally preserved fossils have provided hopeful information for resolving this lophotrochozoan problem. Here we identify that Conicula striata, a soft-bodied conical animal from the early Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstatte, has mosaic characteristics of different lophophorate phyla. C. striata possesses a phoronid-like vermiform trunk housing a U-shaped gut and a coiled lophophore comprising [&ge;]12 arms with numerous tentacles, but it also bears brachiopod-like features including an undivided mantle enclosing lophophore and a pedicle-like protrusion on annulated trunk. Phylogenetic analysis retrieves C. striata as a total-group lophophorate and as an intermediate taxon between Phoronida and Brachiopoda. This suggests that the bivalved architecture of brachiopods originated from an undivided mantle in a phoronid-like ancestor, and that the ancestral vermiform trunk became reduced during the origin of Brachiopoda, illuminating the origins of body plans in the lophophorate phyla.",

However, no consensus has been reached on the elaborate subdivisions of macaque insula. Until now, no neuroimaging study to our knowledge combining connectivity-based gradients and parcellation has been performed to investigate the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex. In this study, we used high-resolution ex vivo diffusion-weighted imaging data to explore the macaque insular cortexs global gradient organization and subdivisions. We found a rostrocaudal organization of the dominant gradient in the macaque insula using a diffusion map embedding. Meanwhile, extracting the 25% top and bottom components from the dominant and second gradient, which explained variance over 60% in total within ten gradients, the connectivity-based parcellation method was performed to subdivide each component into two subregions confirmed by the cross-validation analysis. Furthermore, permutations tests identified that two subregions from each component showed significant differences between their connectivity fingerprints. Finally, we found that the dominant and second gradients were significantly correlated with the T1w/T2w and cortical thickness maps in the macaque insula. Taken together, the global gradients combining the subdivisions examined the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex based on the structural connectivity, which may contribute to a better understanding of the intricate insular cortex anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphCells lacking several DNA repair proteins, including those promoting homologous recombination (HR), are sensitive to polymerase theta (Pol{theta}) repression1-4. Pol{theta} drives theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) and suppresses HR but what mediates its synthetic lethal relationships is unclear. Here we examine murine Brca1C61G/C61G 53bp1-/-cells and find they are largely HR proficient by using RNF168 and RAD52. They exhibit no more TMEJ than 53bp1-/- cells yet are more sensitive to targeting of Pol{theta}. We find that RAD52 recruitment to damaged chromatin is increased following Pol{theta} depletion. RAD52 accumulation and cellular sensitivity to Pol{theta} repression can be curbed by the RAD51-binding regions of BARD1 and BRCA2, and sensitivity of BRCA1/2 depleted cells to Pol{theta} repression is suppressed by RAD52 inhibition. 53bp1-/- cells exhibit a smaller increase in RAD52 recruitment following Pol{theta} repression and also become resistant to Pol{theta} repression following RAD52 inhibition. Thus, RAD52 mediates sensitivity to targeting Pol{theta} in these contexts.",

    "abstract": "During animal fasting, the nutrient supply and metabolism switch from carbohydrates to a new reliance on the catabolism of energy-dense lipid stores. Assembled under tight regulation, {beta}{gamma}-CAT is a pore-forming protein and trefoil factor complex identified in toad Bombina maxima. Here, we determined that this protein complex is a constitutive component in toad blood, that actively responds to the animal fasting. The protein complex was able to promote cellular albumin and albumin-bound fatty acid uptake in a variety of epithelial and endothelial cells, and the effects were attenuated by a macropinocytosis inhibitor. Endothelial cell-derived exosomes containing largely enriched albumin and fatty acids, called nutrisomes, were released in the presence of {beta}{gamma}-CAT. These specific nutrient vesicles were readily taken by starved muscle cells to support their survival. The results uncovered that pore-forming protein {beta}{gamma}-CAT is a fasting responsive element able to drive cell vesicular import and export of macromolecular nutrients.",

    "abstract": "Trichoderma spp. are among the most widely used plant beneficial fungi in agriculture. A novel approach to enhance their effectiveness in plant defense is to use the fungi in combination with bioactive molecules including plant-derived compounds. Here, we show that plant treatment with Trichoderma afroharzianum (strain T22) and Systemin (Sys), a tomato plant peptide active in triggering plant defense, confers protection against the fungal pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea and the insect pest Tuta absoluta. The observed defensive response was associated with increased accumulation of metabolites and transcripts involved in the Jasmonic acid (JA) pathway. Our findings suggest that the innovative combination of T. afroharzianum T22 and Sys can result in a more effective and robust control of different biotic stress agents.",
