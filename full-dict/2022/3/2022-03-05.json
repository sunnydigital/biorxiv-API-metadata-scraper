    "abstract": "Human infancy is characterized by most rapid cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increases across lifespan and emergence of a fundamental brain system default-mode network (DMN). However, how infant rCBF change spatiotemporally across the brain and how the rCBF dynamics support emergence of vital functional networks such as DMN remains unknown. Here, by acquiring cutting-edge multi-modal MRI including pseudo-continuous arterial-spin-labeled perfusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI of infants aged 0 to 24 months, we elucidated unprecedented 4D spatiotemporal infant rCBF framework and region-specific physiology-function coupling across infancy. We found faster rCBF increases in the DMN than other regions. We also found strongly coupled increases of rCBF and network strength specifically in the DMN, suggesting faster local blood flow increase to meet extra neuronal metabolic demands in the DMN maturation. These results offer insights into physiological mechanism of brain functional network emergence and have important implications in altered network maturation in brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Recent T Cell therapies have been effective in the treatment of hematological cancers. However, immunotoxicity and treatment relapse pose significant clinical challenges. Here, we revealed distinctive requirement for neutralizing TNF receptor ligands APRIL and BAFF in MM and DLBCL. Furthermore, we investigated the use of BCMA decoy receptor (sBCMA-Fc) as a therapeutic inhibitor of ARPIL and BAFF. While wild-type sBCMA-Fc successfully blocked APRIL signaling with picomolar binding affinity, inhibiting tumor growth in MM models, it lacked efficacy in inhibiting DLBCL progression due to its weak binding for BAFF. To expand the therapeutic utility of sBCMA-Fc, using a protein engineering approach, we generated an affinity enhanced mutant sBCMA-Fc fusion molecule (sBCMA-Fc V3) with 4-folds and 500-folds enhancement in binding to APRIL and BAFF respectively. The sBCMA-Fc V3 clone significantly enhanced antitumor activity against both MM and DLBCL. Importantly, sBCMA-Fc V3 was proven to be a viable clinical candidate by showing adequate toxicity profile and on-target mechanism of action in nonhuman primates.\n\nSUMMARYThis study demonstrates the dichotomous function of APRIL and BAFF in MM and DLBCL, that can be safely targeted by an engineered fusion protein designed to trap APRIL and BAFF with ultra-high binding affinity.",

    "abstract": "Fish often spawn eggs with ovarian fluids that have been hypothesized to support sperm of some males over others (cryptic female choice). Alternatively, sperm reactions to ovarian fluids could reveal male strategies linked to their likely roles during spawning. Sperm of males who would usually be close to females during spawning are then expected to be better adapted to the presence of ovarian fluids than to water only, while the reverse would be expected for males that typically spawn at larger distance to the females. We tested these predictions with gametes and ovarian fluids from wild-caught lake char (Salvelinus umbla). We found that sperm of more colorful males showed increased sperm velocity in diluted ovarian fluids while sperm of paler males were fastest in water only. We then let equal numbers of sperm compete for fertilizations in the presence or absence of ovarian fluids and used microsatellite markers to assign in total 1,464 embryos (from 70 experimental trials) to their fathers. Overall, sperm of more colorful males reached higher fertilization success than sperm of pale males. This difference was enhanced by the presence of ovarian fluids and best explained by the increased sperm velocity. Sperm competitiveness was not enhanced with decreasing genetic distance to a given female, although parallel stress tests on embryos had revealed that females would profit more from mating with least related males rather than most colored ones. We conclude that sperm of more colorful males are best adapted to ovarian fluids, and that the observed reaction norms reveal male strategies rather than cryptic female choice.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-binding shuttle UBQLN2 mediates crosstalk between proteasomal degradation and autophagy, likely via interactions with K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, respectively. UBQLN2 is recruited to stress granules in cells and undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. However, interactions with ubiquitin or multivalent K48-linked chains eliminate LLPS. Here, we found that, although some polyubiquitin chain types (K11-Ub4 and K48-Ub4) did generally inhibit UBQLN2 LLPS, others (K63-Ub4, M1-Ub4 and a designed tetrameric ubiquitin construct) significantly enhanced LLPS. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and complementary biophysical techniques, we demonstrated that these opposing effects stem from differences in chain conformations, but not in affinities between chains and UBQLN2. Chains with extended conformations and increased accessibility to the ubiquitin binding surface significantly promoted UBQLN2 LLPS by enabling a switch between homotypically to partially heterotypically-driven phase separation.

    "abstract": "Ovarian carcinoma (OC) forms outgrowths that extend from the outer surface of an afflicted organ into the peritoneum. OC outgrowth formation is poorly understood because there is limited availability of OC cell culture models to examine the behavior of cell assemblies that form outgrowths. Prompted by immunochemical evaluation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, laminin {gamma}1 and collagens, in human tissues representing untreated and chemotherapy-recovered OC, we developed laminin- and collagen-rich ECM-reconstituted cell culture models amenable to studies of cell clusters that can form outgrowths. We demonstrate that ECM promotes outgrowth formation in fallopian tube non-ciliated epithelial cells (FNE) expressing mutant p53-R175H and various OC cell lines. Outgrowths were initiated by cells that had undergone outward translocation and, upon mechanical detachment, could intercalate into mesothelial cell monolayers. Electron microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and small amplitude oscillatory shear experiments revealed that high ECM concentration increased ECM fibrous network thickness and led to high shear elasticity in the ECM environment. These physical characteristics were associated with the suppression of outgrowths. A culture environment with low ECM concentration mimicked viscoelasticity of malignant peritoneal fluids (ascites) and supported cell proliferation, cell translocation, and outgrowth formation. These results highlight the importance of ECM microenvironments in modulating OC growth and could provide an additional explanation of why primary and recurrent ovarian tumors form outgrowths that protrude into the peritoneal cavity.",

    "abstract": "Sleep consists of two basic stages: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep is characterized by slow high-amplitude cortical EEG signals, while REM sleep is characterized desynchronized cortical rhythms. While, until recently, it has been widely believed that cortical activity during REM sleep is globally desynchronized, recent electrophysiological studies showed slow waves (SW) in some cortical areas during REM sleep. Electrophysiological techniques, however, have been unable to resolve the regional structure of these activities, due to relatively sparse sampling. We mapped functional gradients in cortical activity during REM sleep using mesoscale imaging in mice, and observed local SW patterns occurring mainly in somatomotor and auditory cortical regions, with minimum presence within the default mode network. The role of the cholinergic system in local desynchronization during REM sleep was also explored by calcium imaging of cholinergic terminal activity within the mouse cortex. Terminal activity was weaker in regions exhibiting SW activity more frequently during REM sleep. We also analyzed Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity dataset and found that these regions have weaker cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain.",

    "abstract": "Follicle development is a complex dynamic process. The follicles are encapsulated in the stroma, and once the follicle develops, the follicle moves from the cortex to the medulla and finally to the cortex to ovulate in the process of continuous growth. Many of these processes cannot be explained with the follicle alone. Through single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing at key time points of follicular development in mice after birth, we found that ovarian stromal cells are not only one of the main cell groups that make up the ovary but that their cell population and spatial location are also closely related to follicular development. Through analysis of cell communication, it was found that ovarian stromal cells were the main transmitters of intercellular communication, and many of the signals they sent were received by granulosa cells and oocytes to participate in follicle development. Ovarian stromal cells are not a homogeneous cell population. We combined single cell types with their spatial location information to divide ovarian stromal cells into four types, namely, structural stromal cells, perifollicular stromal cells, stromal progenitor cells, and steroidogenic stromal cells, each of which plays a different function in follicle development. Indepth studies of the different spatial locations and different types of stromal cells will expand our understanding of follicle development dynamics, leading to new targets and novel approaches for the treatment of ovarian-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "In biological systems, proteins can be attracted to curved or stretched regions of lipid bilayers by sensing hydrophobic defects in the lipid packing on the membrane surface. Here, we present an efficient end-state free energy calculation method to quantify such sensing in molecular dynamics simulations. We illustrate that lipid packing defect sensing can be defined as the difference in mechanical work required to stretch a membrane with and without a peptide bound to the surface. We also demonstrate that a peptides ability to concurrently induce excess leaflet area (tension) and elastic softening - a property we call the  characteristic area of sensing (CHAOS) - and lipid packing sensing behavior are in fact two sides of the same coin. In essence, defect sensing displays a peptides propensity to generate tension. The here-proposed mechanical pathway is equally accurate yet, computationally, about 40 times less costly than the commonly used alchemical pathway (thermodynamic integration), allowing for more feasible free energy calculations in atomistic simulations. This enabled us to directly compare the Martini 2 and 3 coarse-grained and the CHARMM36 atomistic force-fields in terms of relative binding free energies for six representative peptides including the curvature sensor ALPS and two antiviral amphipathic helices (AH). We observed that Martini 3 qualitatively reproduces experimental trends, whilst producing substantially lower (relative) binding free energies and shallower membrane insertion depths compared to atomistic simulations. In contrast, Martini 2 tends to overestimate (relative) binding free energies. Finally, we offer a glimpse into how our end-state based free energy method can enable the inverse design of optimal lipid packing defect sensing peptides when used in conjunction with our recently developed Evolutionary Molecular Dynamics (Evo-MD) method. We argue that these optimized defect sensors - aside from their biomedical and biophysical relevance - can provide valuable targets for the development of lipid force-fields.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482978v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1872c25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1635f0eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5ad91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156209f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The adhesion protein Kindlin-1 is over-expressed in breast cancer where it has been shown to be associated with metastasis-free survival, however, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we report that Kindlin-1 promotes anti-tumor immune evasion in a mouse model of breast cancer. Deletion of Kindlin-1 in Met-1 mammary tumor cells leads to tumor regression following injection into immunocompetent hosts. This was associated with a reduction in tumor infiltrating Tregs and impairment of their immune-suppressive activities in Kindlin-1 depleted tumors. Similar changes in T cell populations were seen following depletion of Kindlin-1 in the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyV MT)-driven mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis. Analysis of cytokines secreted from the Met-1 cells identified a significant increase in IL-6 secretion when Kindlin-1 was depleted. Conditioned media from Kindlin-1 depleted cells lead to a decrease in the ability of Tregs to suppress the proliferation of CD8+ T cells, which was dependent on IL-6 and depletion of CD25+ Tregs resulted in a reduction of Met-1 tumor growth in mice. Overall, these data identify a novel function for Kindlin-1 in the regulation of anti-tumor immunity through cytokine regulation of Treg number and function.",

Recent evidence suggesting a single origin of nodulation followed by massive parallel evolutionary losses raises questions about why a few lineages in the N2-fixing clade retained nodulation and diversified as stable nodulators while most did not. Within legumes, nodulation is restricted to the two most diverse subfamilies, Papilionoideae and Caesalpinioideae, which show stable retention of nodulation across their core clades.\nC_LIO_LIWe characterize two nodule anatomy types across 128 species in 56 of the 150 genera of the legume subfamily Caesalpinioideae: 1) fixation thread nodules (FTs), where nitrogen-fixing bacteroids are retained within the apoplast in modified infection threads and 2) symbiosomes, where rhizobia are symplastically internalized in the host cell cytoplasm within membrane-bound symbiosomes.\nC_LIO_LIUsing a robust phylogenomic tree based on 997 genes from 146 caesalpinioid genera, we show that losses of nodulation are more prevalent in lineages with FTs.\nC_LIO_LIWe propose that evolution of the symbiosome allows for a more intimate and enduring symbiosis through greater compartmentalisation of their rhizobial microsymbionts, resulting in greater evolutionary stability of nodulation across this species-rich pantropical clade of legumes.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cooperatively breeding animals live longer than their solitary counterparts. The traditional explanation for this is that cooperative breeding evolves more readily in long-lived species. Here, we reverse this argument and show that long lifespans are an evolutionary consequence of cooperative breeding. Natural selection favours a delayed onset of senescence in cooperative breeders, relative to solitary breeders, because cooperative breeders have a delayed age of first reproduction due to reproductive queueing. Especially long lifespans evolve in cooperative breeders with age-dependent reproductive queueing. Finally, we show that lower genetic relatedness among group members leads to the evolution of longer lifespans. This is because selection against higher mortality is weaker when mortality reduces competition between relatives. Our results link the evolutionary theory of ageing with kin selection theory, demonstrating that the evolution of ageing in cooperative breeders is driven by the timing of reproduction and kin structure within breeding territories.",

    "abstract": "High salt intake is common and contributes to poor cardiovascular health. Sustained cortisol excess also induces an adverse cardiovascular profile. Urinary cortisol excretion positively correlates with urinary sodium excretion. We hypothesised that this was due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation by high salt intake.\n\nIn male C57BL6/J mice, 2 weeks of high salt intake increased Crh and Pomc mRNA abundance in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, respectively and caused a sustained rise in plasma corticosterone. Plasma copeptin and anterior pituitary V1b receptor mRNA expression was elevated, which may contribute to basal HPA axis activation. Additionally, high salt intake amplified glucocorticoid response to restraint stress, indicative of enhanced HPA axis sensitivity. In the periphery, high salt intake reduced the binding capacity of corticosteroid-binding globulin, enhancing glucocorticoid bioavailability. Within several tissues, the expression of glucocorticoid-regenerating enzyme, 11{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, was increased and the glucocorticoid receptor downregulated. Overall, high salt intake increased glucocorticoid exposure in the hippocampus, anterior pituitary and liver.\n\nChronic high salt intake amplifies basal and stress-induced glucocorticoid levels and resets glucocorticoid biology centrally, peripherally and within cells. This shows direct connectivity between salt homeostasis and HPA axis function. The cumulative effect is likely maladaptive and may contribute to the long-term health consequences of a high salt diet.",

    "abstract": "The extensive morphological changes of oligodendrocytes during axon ensheathment and myelination involve assembly of the Ilk-Parvin-Pinch (IPP) heterotrimeric complex of proteins to relay essential mechanical and biochemical signals between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Binding of Pinch 1 and 2 isoforms to Ilk is mutually exclusive and allows the formation of distinct IPP complexes with specific signaling properties. Using tissue-specific conditional gene ablation in mice, we reveal an essential role for Pinch2 during central nervous system myelination. Unlike Pinch1-gene ablation, loss of Pinch2 in oligodendrocytes results in hypermyelination and in the formation of pathological myelin outfoldings in white matter regions. These structural changes concurred with inhibition of Rho GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 activities and phenocopied aspects of myelin pathology observed in corresponding mouse mutants. We propose a dual role for Pinch2 in preventing excess of myelin wraps through RhoA-dependent control of membrane growth and in fostering myelin stability via Cdc42-dependent organization of cytoskeletal septins. Together, these findings indicate that IPP-containing Pinch2 is a novel critical cell-autonomous molecular hub ensuring synchronous control of key signaling networks during developmental myelination.\n\nSummary statementPinch proteins are core components of a ternary protein complex comprising Ilk and Parvin (IPP). This work identifies Pinch2 as key regulator of the formation and maturation of CNS myelin.",

    "abstract": "Every day we constantly observe other people receiving rewards. Theoretical accounts posit that vicarious reward processing might be linked to peoples sensitivity to internal body states (interoception) and facilitates a tendency to act prosocially. However, the neural processes underlying the links between vicarious reward processing, interoception and prosocial behaviour are poorly understood. Previous research has linked vicarious reward processing to the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) and the anterior insula (AI). Can we predict someones propensity to be prosocial or to be aware of interoceptive signals from variability in how the ACCg and AI process rewards? Here, participants monitored rewards being delivered to themselves or a stranger during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Later, they performed a task measuring their willingness to exert effort to obtain rewards for others, and a task measuring their propensity to be aware and use interoceptive signals. Using multivariate similarity analysis, we show that peoples willingness to be prosocial is predicted by greater similarity between self and other representations in the ACCg. Moreover, greater dissimilarity in self-other representations in the AI is linked to interoceptive propensity. These findings highlight that vicarious reward is linked to bodily signals in AI, and foster prosocial tendencies through the ACCg.",

Solution 1H NMR reveals significant anomeric signal attenuation following lyophilization of native EPS while 1H ssNMR shows few changes, suggesting diminished molecular motion and consequent broadening of 1H NMR polysaccharide resonances. 13C ssNMR, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy show that, while native EPS has rigid molecular characteristics and contains small, loosely packed polysaccharide assemblies, lyophilized and resuspended EPS is disordered and contains larger dense rosette-like aggregates, suggesting that structural water molecules in the interior of the polysaccharide assemblies are removed during extensive lyophilization. Importantly, mAbs to C. neoformans polysaccharide binds the native EPS more strongly than lyophilized EPS.

    "abstract": "The adolescent social experience is essential for the maturation of the prefrontal cortex in mammalian species. However, it still needs to be determined which cortical circuits mature with such experience and how it shapes adult social behaviors in a sex-specific manner. Here, we examined social approaching behaviors in male and female mice after post-weaning social isolation (PWSI), which deprives social experience during adolescence. We found that the PWSI, particularly isolation during late adolescence, caused an abnormal increase in social approaches (hypersociability) only in female mice. We further found that the PWSI female mice showed reduced parvalbumin (PV) expression in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFCL). When we measured neural activity in the female OFCL, a substantial number of neurons showed higher activity when mice sniffed other mice (social sniffing) than when they sniffed an object (object sniffing). Interestingly, the PWSI significantly reduced both the number of activated neurons and the activity level during social sniffing in female mice. Similarly, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-down of PV in the OFCL during late adolescence enhanced sociability and reduced the social sniffing-induced activity in adult female mice via decreased excitability of PV+ neurons and reduced synaptic inhibition in the OFCL. Moreover, optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons or optogenetic inhibition of PV+ neurons in the OFCL enhanced sociability in female mice. Our data demonstrate that the adolescent social experience is critical for the maturation of PV+ inhibitory circuits in the OFCL; this maturation shapes female social behavior via enhancing social representation in the OFCL.\n\nSignificance StatementAdolescent social isolation often changes adult social behaviors in mammals. Yet, we do not fully understand the sex-specific effects of social isolation and the brain areas and circuits that mediate such changes. Here, we found that adolescent social isolation causes three abnormal phenotypes in female but not male mice: hypersociability, decreased PV+ neurons in the OFCL, and decreased socially evoked activity in the OFCL. Moreover, PV deletion in the OFCL in vivo caused the same phenotypes in female mice by increasing excitation compared with inhibition within the OFCL. Our data suggest that adolescent social experience is required for PV maturation in the OFCL, which is critical for evoking OFCL activity that shapes social behaviors in female mice.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to ionizing radiation is considered by NASA to be a major health hazard for deep space exploration missions. Ionizing radiation sensitivity is modulated by both genomic and environmental factors. Understanding their contributions is crucial for designing experiments in model organisms, evaluating the risk of deep space (i.e. high-linear energy transfer, or LET, particle) radiation exposure in astronauts, and also selecting therapeutic irradiation regimes for cancer patients. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in 15 strains of mice, including 10 collaborative cross model strains and 5 founder strains, associated with spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced ex vivo DNA damage quantified based on immunofluorescent 53BP1+ nuclear foci. Statistical analysis suggested an association with pathways primarily related to cellular signaling, metabolism, tumorigenesis and nervous system damage. We observed different genomic associations in early (4 and 8 hour) responses to different LET radiation, while later (24 hour) DNA damage responses showed a stronger overlap across all LETs. Furthermore, a subset of pathways was associated with spontaneous DNA damage, suggesting 53BP1+ foci as a potential biomarker for DNA integrity in mouse models. Based on our results, we suggest several mouse strains as new models to further study the impact of ionizing radiation and validate the identified genetic loci. We also highlight the importance of future human ex vivo studies to refine the association of genes and pathways with the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation and identify targets for space travel countermeasures.",

We polished denovo assemblies for a mock microbial community and a human genome, and we called variants on a human genome. We repeated these experiments using various pipelines, under various coverage level scenarios, and various quality score quantizers. In all cases we found that the quantization of quality scores cause little difference on (or even improves) the results obtained with the original (non-quantized) data. This suggests that the precision that is currently used for nanopore quality scores is unnecessarily high, and motivates the use of lossy compression algorithms for this kind of data.

    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) is a multimodal ion channel widely regulating central and peripheral functions. Its important involvement in immune responses has been suggested such as in the macrophages phagocytosis process. However, the endogenous signaling cascades controlling the gating of TRPV2 remain to be understood. Here, we report that enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation remarkably alters the chemical and thermal sensitivities of TRPV2 endogenously expressed in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages. We identify that the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 mediates TRPV2 phosphorylation at the molecular sites Tyr(335), Tyr(471), and Tyr(525). JAK1 phosphorylation is required for maintaining TRPV2 activity and the phagocytic ability of macrophages. We further show that TRPV2 phosphorylation is dynamically balanced by protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1). PTPN1 inhibition increases TRPV2 phosphorylation, further reducing the activation temperature threshold to [~]40 {degrees}C. Our data thus unveil an intrinsic mechanism where the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation dynamic balance sets the basal chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2. Targeting this pathway will aid therapeutic interventions in physiopathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Oxygenic phototrophs have evolved a remarkable plethora of strategies to react to changes in light intensity and spectral range, which allows them to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions. Varying light quality and quantity influences the balance between solar energy capture and utilisation in photosynthesis, affecting concomitantly the downstream processes of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism as well as cellular growth and division. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms of long-term photoacclimation of an extremophilic red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae that grows in sulphuric hot springs at high temperatures and low pH. By using spectroscopic, confocal fluorescence microscopy, photosynthetic performance measurements and global transcriptome analyses, we identified several molecular mechanisms underlying the long-term adaptation of this acido-thermophilic red alga to varying light intensity and spectral quality. These include: (1) remodelling of the functional antenna size of both photosystems; (2) rearrangement of the PSB/PSII/PSI microdomains within thylakoids; (3) modulation of the photosynthetic performance parameters, especially at the level of non-photochemical quenching, and (4) transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis and its regulatory components as well as downstream metabolic pathways related to ROS detoxification, cell/organelle division, and central carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Such an intricate network of interplay between light-driven reactions and downstream metabolic pathways provides the necessary basis for maintaining the highest photosynthetic performance under light-limiting conditions.",

    "abstract": "Shigella is a Gram-negative bacterium that invades the human gut epithelium. The resulting infection, shigellosis, is the deadliest bacterial diarrheal disease. Much of the information about the genes dictating the pathophysiology of Shigella, both on the chromosome and the virulence plasmid, was obtained by classical reverse genetics. However, technical limitations of the prevalent mutagenesis techniques restrict the generation of mutants in a single reaction to a small number, preventing large scale targeted mutagenesis of Shigella and the subsequent assessment of phenotype. We adopted a CRISPR-Cas dependent approach, where a nickase Cas9 and cytidine deaminase fusion is guided by sgRNA to introduce targeted C[-&gt;]T transitions, resulting in internal STOP codons and premature termination of translation. In proof-of-principle experiments using an mCherry fluorescent reporter, we were able to generate loss-of-function mutants in both E. coli and Shigella with up to 100% efficacy. Using a modified fluctuation assay, we determined that under optimized conditions, the frequency of untargeted mutations introduced by the Cas9-deaminase fusion is in the same range as spontaneous mutations, making our method a safe choice for bacterial mutagenesis. Further, we programmed the method to mutate well-characterized chromosomal and plasmid-borne Shigella genes and found the mutant phenotype to be similar to that of the reported gene deletion mutants, with no apparent polar effects at the phenotype level. This method can be used in a 96-well plate format to increase the throughput and generate an array of targeted loss-of-function mutants in a few days.\n\nImportanceLoss-of-function mutagenesis is critical in understanding the physiological role of genes. Therefore, high-throughput techniques to generate such mutants are important for facilitating the assessment of gene function at a pace that matches system biology approaches. However, to our knowledge, no such method was available for generating an array of single gene mutants in an important enteropathogen - Shigella. This pathogen causes high morbidity and mortality in children and antibiotic resistant strains are quickly emerging. Therefore, determination of the function of unknown Shigella genes is of utmost importance to develop effective strategies to control infections. Our present work will bridge this gap by providing a rapid method for generating loss-of-function mutants. The highly effective and specific method has the potential to be programmed to generated multiple mutants in a single, massively parallel, reaction. By the virtue of plasmid compatibility, this method can be extended to other members of Enterobacteriaceae.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe definition of the genome distribution of the Myc transcription factor is extremely important since it may help predict its transcriptional activity particularly in the context of cancer. Myc is among the most powerful oncogenes involved in the occurrence and development of more than 80% of different types of pediatric and adult cancers. Myc regulates thousands of genes which can be in part different, depending on the type of tissues and tumours. Myc distribution along the genome has been determined experimentally through chromatin immunoprecipitation This approach, although powerful, is very time consuming and cannot be routinely applied to tumours of individual patients. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance to develop in-silico tools that can effectively and rapidly predict its distribution on a given cell genome. New advanced computational tools (DeeperBind) can then be successfully employed to determine the function of Myc in a specific tumour, and may help to devise new directions and approaches to experiments first and personalized and more effective therapeutic treatments for a single patient later on.\n\nResultsThe use of DeeperBind with DeepRAM on Colab platform can effectively predict the binding sites for the MYC factor with an accuracy above 0.96 AUC, when trained with multiple cell lines. The analysis of the filters in DeeperBind trained models shows, besides the consensus sequence CACGTG classically associated to the MYC factor, also the other consensus sequences G/C box or TGGGA, respectively bound by the SP1 and MIZ-1 transcription factors, which are known to mediate the MYC repressive response. Overall, our findings suggest a stronger sinergy between the machine learning tools as DeeperBind and biological experiments, which may reduce the time consuming experiments by providing a direction to guide them.",

    "abstract": "Visual perception plays a critical role in navigating space and extracting useful semantic information crucial to survival. To identify distant landmarks, we constantly shift gaze vectors through saccades, while still maintaining the visual perception of stable allocentric space. How can we sustain stable allocentric space so effortlessly? To solve this question, we have developed a new concept of NHT (Neural Holography Tomography). This model states that retinotopy is invisible (not available to consciousness) and must be converted to a time code by traveling alpha brainwaves to perceive objects consciously. According to this framework, if identical alpha phases are continually assigned to a landmark, we perceive its exact and consistent allocentric location.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we designed reaction time (RT) experiments to observe evidence of the predicted space-to-time conversion. Various visual stimuli were generated at a wide range of eccentricities either on a large TV (up to 40{degrees}) or by LED strips on a hemispherical dome (up to 60{degrees}). Participants were instructed to report the observed patterns promptly under either covert (no eye movement) or overt (with eye movement) conditions. As predicted, stimuli presented at the center of fixation always produced the fastest RTs. The additional RT delay was precisely proportional to the eccentricity of the peripheral stimulus presentation. Furthermore, both covert and overt attention protocols created the same RT delays, and trajectories of saccadic eye motions were in parallel to the overt RT vs. eccentricity. These findings strongly support our NHT model, in which the observed RT-eccentricity dependence is indicative of the spatiotemporal conversion required for maintaining a stable allocentric frame of reference. That is, we perceive space by time.",

    "abstract": "Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) permits the visualization of cellular structures an order of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit of visible light, and an accurate, objective evaluation of the resolution of an SMLM dataset is an essential aspect of the image processing and analysis pipeline. Here we present a simple method that uses the pair autocorrelation function evaluated both in space and time to measure the time-interval dependent effective point spread function of SMLM images of static samples. Using this approach, we demonstrate that experimentally obtained images typically have effective point spread functions that are broader than expected from the localization precision alone, due to additional uncertainty arising from factors such as drift and drift correction algorithms. The method is demonstrated on simulated localizations, DNA origami rulers, and cellular structures labelled by dye-conjugated antibodies, DNA-PAINT, or fluorescent fusion proteins.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCESingle molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a class of imaging methods that resolve fluorescently labeled structures beyond the optical resolution limit of visible light. SMLM detects stochastically blinking labels over time, and localizes each blink with precision of order 10 nm. The effective resolution depends on factors such as signal-to-noise ratio, localization algorithm, and several post-processing steps such as stage drift correction. We present a method to evaluate this effective resolution by taking advantage of temporal correlations of fluorophore blinking to separate the distribution of pairs of localizations from the same molecule from those from different molecules. The method is robust on useful timescales for a range of SMLM probes.",

Here we explore how this polyvalent interaction is manifested and examine if it can facilitate T cell activation. This is done by developing a multiscale biophysical model that takes into account the complexity of this interaction. Using the model, we quantify pMHC insertion probabilities, dwell time of NP binding, TCRnc carrying capacity, the distribution of covered and bound TCRs by NPs, and cooperativity in the binding of pMHCs within the contact area. Model fitting and parameter sweeping further reveal that moderate jumps between IFN{gamma} dose-response curves at low valences can occur, suggesting that the geometry of NP binding can prime T cells for activation.",

The method is quick, requiring as little as 1 month from conceptualization to knockout (KO), and highly efficient, enabling editing in >95% of target cells. To highlight its utility, we used this system to inactivate, alone or in combination, genes with functions spanning metabolism, mitosis, mitochondrial maintenance, and cell proliferation.\n\nConclusionRIME enables the rapid, efficient, and inexpensive analysis of multiple genes in the mouse liver in vivo.",

There is significant variation in the cellular and spatial architecture of the tumor-microenvironment within and across patients. Are there rules that constrain the architecture of the tumor-microenvironment?\n\nTo find out, we develop a quantitative framework of tumor architecture inspired by ideas from satellite imaging, which we apply on deep single-cell profiling and multiplex imaging data in breast tumors. Data analysis shows that inter-patient variation in the macroscopic cellular composition of tumors is structured as a continuum explained by four tumor niches: cancer, inflammatory, tertiary lymphoid structure and fibrotic/necrotic. These niches have their origin in tumor micro-architecture and are shared across patients and tumor subtypes. Niche prevalence depends strongly on the patient, which constraints and explains inter-patient variation.\n\nThe present framework will facilitate interpreting inter-patient variation in terms of a tractable number of micro-environmental niches which serve as organizational entities at the meso-scale to bridge the micro- and macro-scales of tumor architecture.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear position is precisely orchestrated during cell division, migration, and maturation of cells and tissues. Here we report a previously unrecognized, programmed movement of the nucleus in rat cochlear inner hair cells. This cell-type specific nuclear movement among hair cells of the inner ear offers a new glimpse into the cellular mechanisms involved in the functional maturation of inner hair cells. In early post-natal days, the nucleus sits at the very basal pole of the hair cell, far from the apically located mechano-transducing stereocilia, but close to where synapses with primary afferent and efferent neurons are forming. By maturity, the nucleus moves to occupy a new position half-way along the length of the cell. Remarkably, nuclear translocation happens quickly over the course of 1-2 post-natal days, coinciding with the onset of hearing. The movement of the nucleus likely signals the closing of a critical period correlated with the forming and refining of synapses at the onset of hearing.\n\nSignificance StatementThe misplacement of a cells nucleus has been implicated in hearing, vision, and muscular pathologies. In this study, we report a remarkably abrupt change in nuclear position in cochlear inner hair cells that coincides with the onset of hearing in rats, when hair cells switch from producing sensory-independent action potentials to sensory-dependent graded potentials. This work suggests that post-mitotic nuclear migration may be critical to the final phase of post-natal development in mammalian hearing.",

PROM1 is required for the maintenance of primary cilia and mutations in the Prom1 gene are associated with retinal degeneration.\n\nMethodsEpitope tagged clones of splice variants and tiled deletion mutants were used to map the mAB 13A4 epitope and test the predicted tertiary structure of PROM1. The proteins were expressed in Neuro 2a cells and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to PROM1 and the epitope tag.\n\nResultsDeletions in the second and third extracellular domains of the PROM1 protein disrupted the mAB 13A4 epitope. Furthermore, the affinity of mAB 13A4 to the major PROM1 isoform in photoreceptor cells is significantly reduced due to the inclusion of a photoreceptor-specific alternative exon in the third extracellular domain. Interestingly, a deletion in the photoreceptor specific isoform of six amino acids adjacent to the alternative exon restored the affinity of mAB 13A4 to PROM1.\n\nConclusionmAB 13A4 recognizes a structural epitope that is stabilized by two of the extracellular domains of PROM1. The results of our mutagenesis are consistent with the computationally predicted helical bundle structure of PROM1 and point to the utility of mAB 13A4 for evaluating the effect of mutations on the PROM1 structure. We show that the PROM1 isoform composition needs to be considered when interpreting tissue and developmental expression data produced by mAB 13A4.",

The loss of antigen presentation is a common mechanism for tumor escape in bladder cancer. NKG2A+ CD8 T cells are able to circumvent HLA-ABC loss through TCR-independent cytotoxicity, which is partly mediated by DNAM-1. In bladder tumors, NKG2A is acquired on a subset of PD-1+ CD8 T cells, alongside stronger tissue-residency memory features, TCR-independent cytotoxicity and evidence of recent proliferation. HLA-E is low but variably expressed on bladder tumors. When expressed, NKG2A+ CD8 T cell anti-tumor responses to HLA-ABC-deficient tumors are inhibited and partly restored upon NKG2A blockade.

    "abstract": "Gut-microbiota plays a pivotal role in development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that tryptamine, a microbial metabolite of tryptophan, impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Tryptamine presents a higher level in monkeys with spontaneous diabetes and human with T2D and positively correlated with the glucose tolerance. In parallel, tryptamine level was suppressed by dietary fibers intervention in T2D subjects and negatively correlated with improvement of glucose tolerance. The inhibitory effect of tryptamine on insulin signaling as shown was dependent on a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling axis. Monoassociation of T2D-associated tryptamine-producing bacteria Ruminococcus gnavus impairs insulin sensitivity in pseudo germ-free mice. Our findings indicate gut microbiota-derived tryptamine contributes to the development of insulin resistance in T2D and may serve as a new target for intervention.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Despite the strong association between gut microbial dysbiosis, serotonin (5-HT) dysregulation and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), the mechanism by which changes in the gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS-D, particularly the role of dysregulated 5-HT production, remains unclear. The present study identified Ruminococcus gnavus in the human gut microbiota as a key risk factor of IBS-D. R. gnavus was significantly enriched in IBS-D patients and exhibited positive correlation with serum 5- HT level and severity of diarrhea symptoms. We showed that R. gnavus induced diarrhea-like symptoms in mice by promoting microbial shunting of essential aromatic amino acids to aromatic trace amines including phenethylamine and tryptamine, thereby stimulating the biosynthesis of peripheral 5-HT, a potent stimulator for gastrointestinal transit. This study identify gut-microbial metabolism of dietary amino acids as a cause of IBS-D and lays a foundation for developing novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IBS-D.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483096v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@48400aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1645aedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d878dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be4b30_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

With keen microscopic observations and various experimentation, we concluded that the movement is of two types, trembling movement, and actual displacement. The movement is because of two reasons; 1. Due to the dynamic movement of intracellular lipid granules, and; 2. Due to the movement of an intracellular bacterial population which is present as an endosymbiont. The mechanism of displacement has been hypothesized. The presence of both lipid granules and bacteria has been confirmed using microscopic analysis (Bright field, Phase contrast, confocal, Cryo-SEM, and HR-TEM). The bacterial presence was confirmed using whole-genome metagenomic analysis. Endosymbiotic bacteria have also been isolated and identified by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Interestingly, some of them possibly are novel species. Also, the whole genome of A.tremulum has been announced.

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH), a widely abused stimulant drug, induces psychosis in approximately half of abusers; this effect is becoming a major concern for society. Although the Notch1 signalling pathway has been shown to play a part in the pathogenesis of some psychiatric disorders, its role in METH-induced psychosis (MIP) is still unknown. Here, we showed that Notch1 signalling was downregulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in a MIP mouse model. Direct genetic and pharmacological manipulations of Notch1 signalling bidirectionally altered MIP-related behaviours and governed neuronal activity in the mPFC. Moreover, Notch1 signalling negatively regulated GABAB1 receptor expression in the mPFC of MIP mice through Hes1, a transcriptional repressor in Notch1 signalling. Further, we show that Hes1 can directly bind to the GABAB1 receptor promoter. Notably, pharmacological regulation of the GABAB receptor in the mPFC reversed the changes in MIP-related behaviours caused by the dysfunction of Notch1 signalling. Together, our findings uncover a previously unrecognised Notch1-Hes1-GABAB1 receptor-dependent mechanism involved in regulating mPFC neuronal activity and behavioural phenotypes in MIP. Our work provides mechanistic insight into the aetiology and pathophysiology of MIP.",

    "abstract": "Chemical or enzymatic biotinylation of proteins is widely used in various studies, and proximity-dependent biotinylation coupled to mass spectrometry is a powerful approach for analyzing protein-protein interactions in living cells. We recently developed a simple method to enrich biotinylated peptides using Tamavidin 2-REV, an engineered avidin-like protein with reversible biotin-binding capability. However, the low abundance of protein biotinylation in cells required large amounts of cellular proteins to detect enough biotinylated peptides. Here we optimized the workflow for efficient enrichment and identification of biotinylated peptides. The most efficient recovery was achieved by heat inactivation of trypsin, prewashing Tamavidin 2-REV beads, clean-up of biotin solution, mock elution, and the optimal temperature and salt concentration for elution. Using the optimized workflow, over 2-fold more biotinylated peptides were identified with higher purity from RAW264.7 macrophages expressing TurboID-fused STING. In addition, sequential digestion with Glu-C and trypsin led to the identification of biotinylation sites that were not identified by trypsin digestion alone. Furthermore, the combination of this workflow with TMT labeling enabled large-scale quantification of cell surface proteome changes upon EGF stimulation. This workflow would be useful not only for BioID and cell surface proteomics but also for various other applications based on protein biotinylation.",

    "abstract": "After many years of neglect in the field of alternative splicing, the importance of intron retention (IR) in cancer has come into focus following landmark discoveries of aberrant IR patterns in cancer. Many solid and liquid tumours are associated with drastic increases in IR and such patterns have been pursued as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Paradoxically, breast cancer (BrCa) is the only tumour type in which IR is reduced compared to adjacent normal breast tissue.\n\nIn this study, we have conducted a pan-cancer analysis of IR with emphasis on BrCa and its subtypes. We explored mechanisms that could cause aberrant and pathological IR and clarified why normal breast tissue has unusually high IR.\n\nStrikingly, we found that reduced IR in BrCa can be largely attributed to normal breast tissue having the highest occurrence of IR events compared to other healthy tissues. Our analyses suggest that low numbers of IR events in breast tumours are associated with poor prognosis, particularly in the luminal B subtype. Interestingly, we found that IR frequencies negatively correlate with cell proliferation in BrCa cells, i.e. rapidly dividing tumour cells have the lowest number of IR events. Aberrant RNA binding protein (RBP) expression and changes in tissue composition are among the causes of low IR in BrCa.\n\nOur results suggest that IR should be considered for therapeutic manipulation in BrCa patients with aberrantly low IR levels and that further work is needed to understand the cause and impact of high IR in other tumour types.",

    "abstract": "Diverse neocortical GABAergic neurons specialise in synaptic targeting and their effects are modulated by presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) suppressing neurotransmitter release in rodents, but their effects in human neocortex are unknown. We tested whether activation of group III mGluRs by L-AP4 changes GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in two distinct dendritic spine-innervating GABAergic interneurons recorded in vitro in human neocortex. Calbindin-positive double bouquet cells (DBC) had columnar \"horsetail\" axons descending through layers II-V innervating dendritic spines (48%) and shafts, but not somata of pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons. Parvalbumin-expressing dendrite-targeting cell (PV-DTC) axons extended in all directions innervating dendritic spines (22%), shafts (65%) and somata (13%). As measured, 20% of GABAergic neuropil synapses innervate spines, hence DBCs, but not PV-DTCs, preferentially select spine targets. Group III mGluR activation paradoxically increased the frequency of sIPSCs in DBCs (to median 137% of baseline), but suppressed it in PV-DTCs (median 92%), leaving the amplitude unchanged. The facilitation of sIPSCs in DBCs may result from their unique GABAergic input being disinhibited via network effect. We conclude that dendritic spines receive specialised, diverse GABAergic inputs, and group III mGluRs differentially regulate GABAergic synaptic transmission to distinct GABAergic cell types in human cortex.",

To understand how signaling is optimized during graded transmission, we counted the number of vesicles released by a mammalian cone terminal and compared it to the simultaneous responses in each Off bipolar cell type. Off bipolar cells contacting the terminal base comprised two groups depending on how they sampled transmitter release. In both groups, responses initially grew non-linearly with the number of released vesicles implicating a role for cooperativity during sparse release. One group sampled release from most of a cones [~]20 ribbons and can exploit averaging to improve signal reliability. The other, less-sensitive group made 1-3 contacts at the terminal center and responded to pooled transmitter, a consequence of membrane depolarization, using an insensitive kainate receptor. Off bipolar cells use different strategies to minimize transmission noise and encode cone output over different ranges.",

    "abstract": "Resurgent currents (INaR) produced by voltage-gated sodium channels are required for many neurons to maintain high-frequency firing, and contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and disease pathophysiology. Here we show, for the first time, that INaR can be reconstituted in a heterologous system by co-expression of sodium channel -subunits and A-type fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs). Specifically, A-type FHFs induces INaR from Nav1.8, Nav1.9 tetrodotoxin-resistant neuronal channels and, to a lesser extent, neuronal Nav1.7 and cardiac Nav1.5 channels. Moreover, we identified the N-terminus of FHF as the critical molecule responsible for A-type FHFs-mediated INaR. Among the FHFs, FHF4A is the most important isoform for mediating Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 INaR. In nociceptive sensory neurons, FHF4A knockdown significantly reduces INaR amplitude and the percentage of neurons that generate INaR, substantially suppressing excitability. Thus, our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying TTX-resistant INaR generation and provides important potential targets for pain treatment.",

Although both CTMCs and MMCs can be induced from bone marrow (BM)-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro, recent research on MC ontogeny has revealed that MMCs are maintained with a supply of BM-derived HSCs, while CTMCs are maintained locally by self-proliferation in steady state in vivo. However, how CTMCs, such as skin MCs, are maintained in an inflammatory state such as atopic dermatitis (AD) remains to be fully elucidated. Methods: MC903-induced AD model was used to identify BM-derived MCs in the skin. The infiltration and proliferation of MCs were evaluated by flow cytometry using CD45.1 BM-chimera mice and parabiosis. BM-derived MCs in AD-like skin were compared to resident MCs (rMCs) in gene expressions by RNA sequence analysis. The fate of BM-derived MCs in AD-like skin was investigated for expressions of CTMC markers and responses to compound 48/80. Results: In AD-like skin, significant increase of both rMCs and BM-derived MCs was observed. BM-derived MCs were derived from circulating MC progenitors (MCps) and were distinguished from rMCs by integrin{beta}7 expression, which was gradually downregulated in the skin. RNA sequence analysis showed that integrin{beta}7+ MCs in the skin shared characteristics of both MMC and CTMC. Integrin{beta}7+ MCs proliferated in situ and acquired the CTMC phenotypes in AD-like skin. Conclusions: Skin MCs are maintained in AD-like skin by both local proliferation of rMCs and infiltration/proliferation of BM-derived MCs, which differentiate toward CTMC in the skin.",

Previously, novel antibiotic tolerant variants known as phoenix colonies as well as variants similar to viable but non-culturable (VBNC) colonies were identified in response to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. In this study, the mechanisms behind phoenix colony and VBNC-like colony emergence were further explored using both whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. Phoenix colonies were found to have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PA4673 gene, which is predicted to encode a GTP-binding protein. No SNPs were identified within VBNC-like colonies compared to the founder population. RNA sequencing did not detect change in expression of PA4673 but revealed multiple differentially expressed genes that may play a role in phoenix colony emergence. One of these differentially expressed genes, PA3626, encodes for a tRNA pseudouridine synthase which when knocked out led to a complete lack of phoenix colonies. Although not immediately clear whether the identified genes in this study may have interactions which have not yet been recognized, they may contribute to the understanding of how phoenix colonies are able to emerge and survive in the presence of antibiotic exposure.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic island floras are well-known for their morphological peculiarities and exhibit striking examples of trait evolution1,2. These morphological shifts are commonly attributed to insularity and thought to be shaped by biogeographical processes and evolutionary histories of oceanic islands1,3. However, the mechanisms through which biogeography and evolution have shaped the distribution and diversity of plant functional traits remain unclear. Here, we describe the functional trait space of an oceanic island flora (Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain) using extensive field and laboratory measurements, and relate it to global trade-offs in ecological strategies. We find that the island trait space is concentrated around a functional hotspot dominated by shrubs with a conservative life-history strategy. By dividing the island flora into species groups with distinct biogeographical distributions and diversification histories, our results reveal that long-distance dispersal, and the interplay between inter-island dispersal and archipelago-level speciation processes drive functional divergence and expand trait space. Conversely, speciation via cladogenesis has overall led to functional convergence, densely packing trait space around shrubbiness. Our approach combines ecology, biogeography and evolution and opens avenues for new trait-based insights into how dispersal and speciation shape the assembly of native island floras.",

    "abstract": "Each individual genome harbors multiple missense variants, which can be systematically identified via genome or exome sequencing. This class of genetic variation can alter the functional properties of the respective protein, and thereby lead to clinically relevant phenotypes, such as cancer or Mendelian diseases. Despite advances in computational prediction scores, the classification of missense variants as clinically significant or benign remains a major challenge. Recently, the structure of the human proteome was derived with unprecedented accuracy using the artificial intelligence system AlphaFold2. However, the question of whether AlphaFold2 structures can improve the accuracy of computational pathogenicity prediction for missense variants remains unclear. To address this, we first engineered a set of features for each amino acid from these structures. We then trained a random forest to distinguish between proxy-benign and proxy-pathogenic missense variants derived from gnomAD. This yielded a novel AlphaFold2-based pathogenicity prediction score, termed AlphScore. Important feature classes used by AlphScore are solvent accessibility, amino acid network related features, features describing the physicochemical environment, and AlphaFold2s quality parameter (pLDDT). AlphScore alone showed lower performance than existing scores, such as CADD or REVEL. However, when AlphScore was added to those scores, the performance always increased, as measured by the approximation of deep mutational scan data, as well as the prediction of expert-curated missense variants from the ClinVar database. Overall, our data indicate that the integration of AlphaFold2 predicted structures can improve pathogenicity prediction of missense variants.",

As a result, we discovered that genome editing induction has a binary nature, that is, the target alleles of cells tend to be all edited or not edited at all.

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is a critical regulator of energy balance that must rapidly shift its metabolism between fasting and feeding to maintain homeostasis. Adenosine has been characterized as an important regulator of adipocyte metabolism primarily through its actions on A1 adenosine receptors (A1R). We sought to understand the role A1R plays in adipocytes during fasting and feeding to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism by using an inducible, adiponectin-Cre with Adora1 floxed mice (FAdora1-/-), where F designates a fat-specific deletion. Fadora1-/- mice had impairments in the suppression of lipolysis by insulin on normal chow and impaired glucose tolerance on high-fat diet. FAdora1-/- mice also exhibited a higher lipolytic response to isoproterenol than WT controls when fasted, but not after a 4-hour refeeding period. We found that FOXO1 binds to the A1R promoter in adipocytes. Upon feeding, signaling along the insulin-Akt-FOXO1 axis leads to a rapid downregulation of A1R transcript and desensitization of adipocytes to A1R agonism. Obesity also desensitizes adipocyte A1R, and this is accompanied by a disruption of cyclical changes in A1R transcription between fasting and refeeding. We propose that FOXO1 drives high A1R expression under fasted conditions to limit excess lipolysis during stress and augment insulin action upon feeding. Subsequent downregulation of A1R under fed conditions facilitates reentrance into the catabolic state upon fasting.",

    "abstract": "Plants employ the Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) to fix atmospheric CO2 for the production of biomass. The flux of carbon through the CBC is limited by the activity and selectivity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). Alternative pathways that do not use RuBisCO to fix CO2 exist but occur only in anaerobic microorganisms. Rather than modifying existing routes of carbon metabolism in plants, we have developed a synthetic carbon fixation cycle that does not exist in nature, but is inspired by metabolisms of bacterial autotrophs. This synthetic cycle uses endogenous plant metabolites to fix CO2 and yield glyoxylate as a product. In this work, we build and characterize a condensed, reverse tricarboxylic acid (crTCA) cycle in vitro and in planta. We demonstrate that a simple, synthetic cycle can be used to fix carbon in vitro under aerobic and mesophilic conditions and that these enzymes retain activity when expressed transiently in planta. We then evaluate stable transgenic lines of Camelina sativa that have both phenotypic and physiologic changes. Transgenic C. sativa are shorter than controls with increased rates of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and changes in photorespiratory metabolism. This first iteration of a build-test-learn phase of the crTCA cycle provides promising evidence that this pathway can be used to increase photosynthetic capacity in plants.",

The knowledge about the developmental trajectory of these key pathophysiological components and their interplay is important to develop new preventive and treatment strategies. However, this assertion is so far limited. To investigate the developmental regulations of these key components, we assessed, for the first time, in vivo redox state from the oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD), energy and membrane metabolites, neurotransmitters ({gamma}-aminobutyrate and glutamate) by 31P and 1H MRS during the neurodevelopment of a SZ animal model with genetically compromised glutathione synthesis (gclm-KO mice). When compared to age-matched wild type (WT), an increase in NAD+/NADH redox ratio was found in gclm-KO mice until early adulthood, followed by a decrease in full adults as observed in patients. Especially, in early postnatal life (P20, corresponding to childhood), levels of several metabolites were altered in gclm-KO mice, including NAD+, ATP, phosphocreatine, intracellular pH, glutamine + glutamate and membrane phospholipids components, suggesting an interactive compensation for redox dysregulation between NAD, energy metabolism, and neurotransmission. The identified temporal neurometabolic regulations provide insights in preventive treatment targets for at-risk individuals, and other neurodevelopmental disorders involving oxidative stress and energetic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The parasite Trypanosoma brucei grows as bloodstream forms in mammals, and as procyclic forms in tsetse flies. Transcription is polycistronic, all mRNAs are trans spliced, and polyadenylation sites are defined by downstream splicing signals. Expression regulation therefore depends heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms. The RNA-binding protein DRBD18 was previously implicated in the export of some mRNAs from the nucleus in procyclic forms. It copurifies the outer ring of the nuclear pore, mRNA export factors and exon-junction-complex proteins. We show that for >200 mRNAs, DRBD18 depletion caused preferential accumulation of versions with shortened 3-untranslated regions, arising from use of polyadenylation sites that were either undetectable or rarely seen in non-depleted cells. The shortened mRNAs were often, but not always, more abundant in depleted cells than the corresponding longer versions in normal cells. Their appearance was linked to the appearance of trans spliced, polyadenylated RNAs containing only downstream 3-untranslated-region-derived sequences. Experiments with one mRNA suggested that nuclear retention alone, through depletion of MEX67, did not affect mRNA length, suggesting a specific effect of DRBD18 on processing. Since DRBD18-bound mRNAs were enriched in polypyrimidine tract motifs, and it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, we suggest that DRBD18 acts in the nucleus by binding to polypyrimidine tracts in 3-UTRs. DRBD18 binding might both prevent polypyrimidine tract recognition by splicing factors, and promote export of the bound RNAs to the cytosol.",
