    "abstract": "The effect of lifelong dynamics on host longevity of the gut microbiome is largely unknown. Herein, we analyzed the longitudinal fecal samples of seven sibling mice across their lifespan from birth to natural death, spanning over 1,000 days of age, and maintained them under controlled environmental and dietary conditions. Our 16S-rRNA sequencing analysis revealed 38 common \"life-core\" bacterial species/OTUs (operational taxonomic units) detected in [&ge;]80% of all samples collected across the lifespan of individual mice. Despite the shared genetic background and dietary habits, the gut microbiome structure significantly diversified with age and among individuals. We found a strong positive correlation between longevity and the alpha diversity in middle age (500-700 days) and negative correlation in old age (>800 days). Furthermore, host longevity was significantly associated with the abundance of 17 bacterial species/OTUs, most of which were \"life-core\" species. Our data suggest that temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome are strongly linked to host longevity.",

    "abstract": "SIRT6 is implicated in DNA repair, telomere maintenance, glucose and lipid metabolism and, importantly, it has critical roles in the brain ranging from its development to neurodegeneration. In this work, we combined transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches to characterize the functions of SIRT6 in mice brains. Our analysis revealed that SIRT6 is a critical regulator of mitochondrial activity in the brain. In its absence, there is a mitochondrial deficiency with a global downregulation of mitochondria-related genes and pronounced changes in metabolites content. We predict that SIRT6 can affect mitochondrial functions through its interaction with the transcription factor YY1 that, together, regulate mitochondrial gene expression. Moreover, SIRT6 target genes include SIRT3 and SIRT4, which are significantly downregulated in SIRT6-deficient brains. Our results demonstrate that the lack of SIRT6 leads to decreased mitochondrial gene expression and metabolomic changes of TCA cycle byproducts, including increased ROS production, reduced mitochondrial number, and impaired membrane potential that can be partially rescued by restoring SIRT3 and 4 levels. Importantly, the changes observed in SIRT6 deficient brains are observed in brains of aging people, but the overlapping is greater in patients with Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Huntingtons, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease. Overall, our results suggest that reduced levels of SIRT6 in the aging brain and neurodegeneration could initiate mitochondrial dysfunction by altering gene expression, ROS production and mitochondrial decay.",

    "abstract": "Caffeine, a widely consumed neuroactive compound, induces DNA damage checkpoint signalling override, and enhances sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. However, the precise underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. In fission yeast S. pombe, the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated Related (ATR) orthologue Rad3 has been proposed as the cellular target of caffeine. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) might be the main target. Caffeine mimics the effects of activating the Sty1-regulated stress response and the AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) homologue Ssp1-Ssp2 pathways on cell cycle progression. Direct inhibition of TORC1 with the ATP-competitive inhibitor torin1, is sufficient to override DNA damage checkpoint signalling. It is, therefore, plausible, that caffeine modulates cell cycle kinetics by indirectly suppressing TORC1 through Ssp2 activation. Ssp1 and ssp2 deletion suppresses the effects of caffeine on cell cycle progression. In contrast, direct inhibition of TORC1 advances cell division in these mutants. These observations suggest that caffeine overrides DNA damage signalling, in part, via the indirect inhibition of TORC1 through Ssp2 activation. Alternatively, Ssp1 and Ssp2 may potentiate the effect of caffeine on Cdc25 activity. The AMPK-mTORC1 signalling axis plays an important role in aging and disease and presents a potential target for chemo- and radio-sensitization. Our results provide further insights of the underlying mechanisms by which caffeine modulates cell cycle progression in the context of Ssp1-AMPKSsp2-TORC1 signalling activities and can potentially aid in the development of novel dietary regimens, therapeutics, and chemo-sensitizing agents.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are organelles with key roles in metabolism including long-chain fatty acid production. Their metabolic functions overlap and interconnect with mitochondria, with which they share an overlapping but distinct proteome. Both organelles are degraded by selective autophagy processes termed pexophagy and mitophagy. Whilst mitophagy has received intense attention, the pathways linked to pexophagy and associated tools are less well developed. We have identified the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924, as a potent activator of pexophagy and show that this is mediated by the HIF1-dependent upregulation of BNIP3L/NIX, a known adaptor for mitophagy. We show that this pathway is distinct from pexophagy induced by the USP30 deubiquitylase inhibitor, CMPD-39, for which we identify the adaptor NBR1 as a central player. Our work suggests a level of complexity to the regulation of peroxisome turnover that includes the capacity to co-ordinate with mitophagy, via NIX, which acts as a rheostat for both processes.",

    "abstract": "The lissencephaly-related protein LIS1 is a critical regulator of cytoplasmic dynein that governs motor function and intracellular localization (e.g., to microtubule plus-ends). Although LIS1 binding is required for dynein activity, its unbinding prior to initiation of cargo transport is equally important, since preventing dissociation leads to dynein dysfunction. To understand whether and how dynein-LIS1 binding is modulated, we engineered dynein mutants locked in a microtubule-bound (MT-B) or -unbound (MT-U) state. Whereas the MT-B mutant exhibits low LIS1 affinity, the MT-U mutant binds LIS1 with high affinity, and as a consequence remains almost irreversibly bound to microtubule plus-ends. We find that a monomeric motor domain is sufficient to exhibit these opposing LIS1 affinities, and that this is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon. Three cryo-EM structures of dynein with and without LIS1 reveal microtubule-binding induced conformational changes responsible for this regulation. Our work reveals key biochemical and structural insight into LIS1-mediated dynein activation.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin family motors are microtubule (MT)-stimulated ATPases known best as transporters of cellular cargoes through the cytoplasm, regulators of MT dynamics, organizers of the mitotic spindle, and for insuring equal division of DNA during mitosis. Several kinesins have also been shown to regulate transcription by interacting with transcriptional cofactors and regulators, nuclear receptors, or with specific promotor elements on DNA. We previously showed that an LxxLL nuclear receptor box motif in the kinesin-2 family motor KIF17 mediates binding to the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen related receptor alpha (ERR1) and is responsible for the suppression of ERR1-dependent transcription by KIF17. Analysis of all kinesin family proteins revealed that multiple kinesins contain this LxxLL motif, raising the question as to whether additional kinesins motors contribute to regulation of ERR1. In this study, we interrogated the effects of multiple kinesins with LxxLL motifs on ERR1-mediated transcription. We demonstrate that the kinesin-3 motor KIF1B contains two LxxLL motifs, one of which binds to ERR1. In addition, we show that expression of a KIF1B fragment containing this LxxLL motif inhibits ERR1-dependent transcription by regulating nuclear entry of ERR1. We also provide evidence that the effects of expressing the KIF1B-LxxLL fragment on ERR1 activity are mediated by a mechanism distinct from that of KIF17. Because LxxLL domains are found in many kinesins, our data suggest an expanded role for kinesins in nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that can sequence specific bacterial taxa of interest (pathogens, beneficial microbes, or low-abundance taxa), but not the vast background of other taxa in a microbiome sample. To address this need, we developed mEnrich-seq, a method that can enrich taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self vs. non-self genome differentiation provided by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (REs), individually or in combination, to deplete host DNA and most background microbial DNA while enriching bacterial taxa of interest. This core idea is integrated with library preparation procedures in a way that only non-digested DNA libraries are sequenced. We performed in-depth evaluations of mEnrich-seq and demonstrated its use in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) genomic DNA of pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including several species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We also assessed the broad applicability of mEnrich-seq and found that 3130 (68.03%) of the 4601 strains with mapped methylomes to date can be targeted by at least one commercially available RE, representing 54.78% of the species examined in this analysis. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest directly from the microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Using High-Throughput Microfluidic Enzyme Kinetics (HT-MEK), we measured over 9,000 inhibition curves detailing impacts of 1,004 single-site mutations throughout the Alkaline Phosphatase PafA on binding affinity for two transition state analogs (TSAs), vanadate and tungstate. As predicted by catalytic models invoking transition state complementary, mutations to active site and active site-contacting residues had highly similar impacts on catalysis and TSA binding. Unexpectedly, most mutations to more distal residues which reduced catalysis had little or no impact on TSA binding and many even increased affinity for tungstate. These disparate effects are accounted for by a model in which distal mutations alter the enzymes conformational landscape and increase occupancy of microstates that are catalytically less effective but better able to accommodate larger transition state analogs. In support of this model, glycine substitutions (rather than valine) were more likely to increase tungstate affinity, presumably due to increased conformational flexibility and increased occupancy of previously disfavored microstates. These results indicate that residues throughout an enzyme provide specificity for the transition state and discriminate against analogs that are larger only by tenths of an [A]ngstrom. Thus, engineering enzymes that rival the most powerful natural enzymes will likely require consideration not just of residues in and around the active site, but also of more distal residues that shape the enzymes conformational landscape and finetune the active site. In addition, the extensive functional communication between the active site and remote residues may provide interconnections needed for allostery and make allostery a highly evolvable trait.\n\nSignificance StatementTransition state analogs (TSAs) resemble fleeting high-energy transition states and have been used to inhibit enzymes in nature and medicine, to learn about enzyme active site features, and to design and select new enzymes. While TSAs mimic transition states, they differ from actual TSs, and we exploit these differences here. Systematic TSA affinity measurements for 1,004 mutants of PafA (a model phosphatase enzyme) revealed effects in and around the active site that mirror their effects on catalysis, but TSA-binding and catalytic effects diverge more distally. These observations suggest that residues throughout an enzyme adjust its conformational landscape on the tenth-[A]ngstrom scale to optimize the active site for catalysis, rendering allostery more evolvable in nature but likely complicating enzyme design.",

    "abstract": "The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2 is the target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that are crucial for vaccine effectiveness. The S1 subunit binds ACE2 while the S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. S2 is a class I fusion glycoprotein and contains a central coiled coil that acts as a scaffold for the conformational changes associated with fusion function. The coiled coil of S2 is unusual in that the 3-4 repeat of inward-facing positions are mostly occupied by polar residues that mediate few inter-helical contacts in the prefusion trimer. We examined how insertion of bulkier hydrophobic residues (Val, Leu, Ile, Phe) to fill a cavity formed by Ala1016 and Ala1020 that form part of the 3-4 repeat affects the stability and antigenicity of S trimers. Substitution of Ala1016 with bulkier hydrophobic residues in the context of a prefusion-stabilized S trimer, S2P-FHA, was associated with increased thermal stability. The trimer stabilizing effects of filling the Ala1016/Ala1020 cavity was linked to improved S glycoprotein membrane fusion function. When assessed as immunogens, two thermostable S2P-FHA mutants derived from the ancestral isolate, A1016L (16L) and A1016V/A1020I (VI) elicited very high titers of neutralizing antibodies to ancestral and Delta-derived viruses (1/2,700-1/5,110), while neutralization titer was somewhat reduced with Omicron BA.1 (1/210-1,1744). The antigens elicited antibody specificities that could compete with ACE2-Fc for binding to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and NAbs directed to key neutralization epitopes within the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD) and stem region of S2. The VI mutation enabled the production of intrinsically stable Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 S ectodomain trimers in the absence of an external trimerization motif (T4 foldon). The VI mutation represents a method for producing an intrinsically stable trimeric S ectodomain glycoprotein vaccine in the absence of a foreign trimerization tag.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYFirst-generation SARS CoV-2 vaccines that generate immune responses to ancestral Spike glycoprotein sequences have averted at least 14.4 million deaths, but their effectiveness against the recently emerged Omicron lineages is reduced. The updating of booster vaccines with variant Spike sequences are therefore likely required to maintain immunity as the pandemic continues to evolve. The Spike is a trimeric integral membrane protein with a membrane spanning sequence at its C-terminus. The Spike protein-based vaccine that is currently licensed for human use is produced by a complex process that reconstitutes the Spike in an artificial membrane. Alternatively, production of the Spike trimer as a soluble protein generally requires replacement of the membrane spanning sequence with a foreign often highly immunogenic trimerization motif that can complicate clinical advancement. We used systematic structure-directed mutagenesis coupled with functional studies to identify an alternative stabilization approach that negates the requirement for an external trimerization motif or membrane-spanning sequence. The replacement of 2 alanine residues that form a cavity in the core of the Spike trimer with bulkier hydrophobic residues resulted in increased Spike thermal stability. Thermostable Spike mutants retained major conserved neutralizing antibody epitopes and the ability to elicit broad and potent neutralizing antibody responses. One such mutation, referred to as VI, enabled the production of intrinsically stable Omicron variant Spike ectodomain trimers in the absence of an external trimerization motif. The VI mutation potentially enables a simplified method for producing a stable trimeric S ectodomain glycoprotein vaccine.",

To investigate how administration strategy can influence nasal vaccine efficiency, a validated multiscale model (i.e., computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) and host-cell dynamics (HCD) model) was employed. Droplet deposition fraction, size change, residence time, and the area percentage of OR covered by the vaccine droplets and triggered immune system response were predicted with different spray cone angles, initial droplet velocities, and compositions. Numerical results indicate that droplet initial velocity and composition have negligible influences on the vaccine delivery efficiency to OR. In contrast, the spray cone angle can significantly impact the vaccine delivery efficiency. The triggered immunity was not significantly influenced by the administration investigated in this study, due to the low percentage of OR area covered by the droplets. To enhance the effectiveness of the intranasal vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection, it is necessary to optimize the vaccine formulation and administration strategy so that the vaccine droplets can cover more epithelial cells in OR to minimize the available receptors for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Spectrum-based Mass-Charge modeling is increasingly used in biological analysis. To explain statistical phenomenon with positive and negative fluctuations of amino acid charges in spike protein sequences from Omicron and other coronaviruses, we propose calculation-based Mass-Charge modeling, a normalized derivation algorithm with exact Excel and MATLAB tool involving separate quadrant extension to normalized covariance, which is still compatible with Pearson covariance co-efficiency. The number of amino acids, molecular weight, isoelectric point, amino acid composition, charged residues, mass-charge ratio, hydropathicity of the proteins were taken into consideration in the analyses, and the relative peak and dip of the average with spike protein sequences based on hydrophobic mass to isoelectric charges of amino acids were also examined. The analyses with the algorithm provide more clear insights leading to revealing underline evolving trends of the viral proteins. Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants, seasonal and murine coronaviruses were taken as representative examples in this study. The analyses demonstrate that the Mass-Charge covariance co-efficiency can distinguish subtle differences between biological properties of spike proteins and correlate well with viral infectivity and virulence.",

Coincidently, CRISPR/Cas gene-editing technology is entering next-generation CAR T cell product manufacturing with the promise of more precise and more controllable cell modification methodology. The intersection of these medical and molecular advancements creates an opportunity for completely new ways of designing engineered cells to help overcome current limitations of cell therapy. In this manuscript we present proof-of-concept data for a novel engineered feedback loop. We manufactured activation-inducible CAR T cells with the help of CRISPR-mediated targeted integration. This new type of engineered T cells expresses the CAR gene dependent on their activation status. This artifice opens new possibilities to regulate CAR T cell function both in vitro and in vivo. We believe that such a physiological control system can be a powerful addition to the currently available toolbox of next-generation CAR constructs.",

We identified progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex) that were abundant in uninvolved LN and clonally related to terminally exhausted cells in the TME. After anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, Tpex in uninvolved LN reduced in frequency but localized near dendritic cells and proliferating intermediate-exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex-int), consistent with activation and differentiation. LN responses coincided with increased circulating Tex-int. In metastatic LN, these response hallmarks were impaired by immunosuppressive cellular niches.

    "abstract": "Endosomal sorting complex required transport (ESCRT) III proteins are essential for membrane remodeling and repair across all domains of life. Eukaryotic ESCRT-III and the cyanobacterial homologs PspA and Vipp1/Imm30 remodel membrane into vesicles, rings, filaments and tubular rods structures. Here our microscopy analysis showed that multicellular bacteria, referred to as magnetoglobules, possess multiple compartments including magnetosome organelles, polyphosphate granules, vesicles, rings, tubular rods, filaments and MVB-like structures. Therefore, membrane remodeling protein PspA might be required for the formation of these compartments, and contribute to the morphogenesis and evolution of multicellularity. To assess these hypotheses, we sequenced nine genomes of magnetoglobules and found a significant genome expansion compared to unicellular magnetotactic bacteria. Moreover, PspA was ubiquitous in magnetoglobules and formed a distinct clade on the tree of eubacterial and archaeal ESCRT-III. The phylogenetic feature suggested the evolution of magnetoglobules from a unicellular ancestor of deltaproteobacterium. Hetero-expression of ellipsoidal magnetoglobule pspA2 gene alone in Escherichia coli resulted in intracellular membrane aggregation. GFP fusion labeling revealed polar location of PspA2 in rod-shaped unicells and regular interval location in filamentous cells. Cryo-electron tomography analysis showed filament bundle, membrane sacculus, vesicles and MVB-like structure in the cells expressing PspA2. Moreover, electron-dense area with a similar distribution as GFP-PspA2 foci in filamentous cells changed the inward orientation of the septum, which might interfere with the cell division. Collectively, these results show the membrane remodeling function of magnetoglobule PspA proteins, which may contribute to morphogenesis and the evolution of multicellularity of magnetotactic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Propionate is a microbial metabolite that is formed in the gastrointestinal tract, and it affects host physiology as a source of energy and signaling molecule. Despite the importance of propionate, the biochemical pathways responsible for its formation are not clear in all microbes. For the succinate pathway used during fermentation, a key enzyme appears to be missing--one that can oxidize ferredoxin and reduce NAD. Here we show that Rnf [ferredoxin--NAD(+) oxidoreductase (Na(+)-transporting)] is this key enzyme in two abundant bacteria of the rumen (Prevotella brevis and Prevotella ruminicola). We found these bacteria form propionate, succinate, and acetate with the classic succinate pathway. At first, this pathway appears unbalanced, forming reduced ferredoxin and oxidized NAD in excess. If this continued unabated, fermentation would halt within 1.5 s. We found these bacteria solve this problem by oxidizing ferredoxin and reducing NAD with Rnf. This is demonstrated using growth experiments, genomics, proteomics, and enzyme assays. Genomic and phenotypic data suggest many bacteria use Rnf similarly. We cataloged fermentation products of >1,400 species of prokaryotes, and nearly 10% formed propionate, succinate, and acetate. Over 40% of species carrying out this fermentation also had genes for Rnf. This work shows Rnf is important to propionate formation in many bacteria from the environment, and it provides fundamental knowledge for manipulating fermentative propionate production.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial human pathogen Helicobacter pylori produces a type IV secretion system (cagT4SS) to inject the oncoprotein CagA into gastric cells. The cagT4SS external pilus mediates attachment of the apparatus to the target cell and the delivery of CagA. While the composition of the pilus is unclear, CagI is present at the surface of the bacterium and required for pilus formation. Here, we have investigated the properties of CagI by an integrative structural biology approach. Using Alpha Fold 2 and Small Angle X-ray scattering, it was found that CagI forms elongated dimers mediated by rod-shaped N-terminal domains (CagIN) and prolonged by globular C-terminal domains (CagIC). Three Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) K2, K5 and K8 selected against CagI interacted with CagIC with subnanomolar affinities. The crystal structures of the CagI:K2 and CagI:K5 complexes were solved and identified the interfaces between the molecules, thereby providing a structural explanation for the difference in affinity between the two binders. Purified CagI and CagIC were found to interact with adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cells, induced cell spreading and the interaction was inhibited by K2. The same DARPin inhibited CagA translocation by up to 65% in AGS cells while inhibition levels were 40% and 30% with K8 and K5, respectively. Our study suggests that CagIC plays a key role in cagT4SS-mediated CagA translocation and that DARPins targeting CagI represent potent inhibitors of the cagT4SS, a crucial risk factor for gastric cancer development.\n\nAuthor summaryHelicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that colonises the human stomach in half of the worlds population. The most virulent strains use the cag- type IV secretion system (cagT4SS), a molecular nanomachine capable of injecting the oncoprotein CagA into gastric cells. How CagA is delivered is unknown, but the cagT4SS produces an external appendage referred to as pilus, which interacts with host cell receptors, mediating CagA translocation from the cytoplasm of the bacteria to the inner membrane of the host cell. In this study we have investigated the structural and functional properties of CagI, a protein long-thought to be associated with the cagT4SS pilus but with yet unknown function. We found that CagI displays a unique dimeric structure and that its C-terminal domain is involved in interaction with the host cell. Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins were selected against CagI and found to interact with its C-terminal moiety with high affinity. DARPin binding was able to prevent CagI interaction with the host cell and inhibited CagA translocation by H. pylori. Our study reveals the role of CagI in cagT4SS interaction with gastric cells and provides a first example of a small protein binder inhibiting the cagT4SS activity.",

    "abstract": "Shigella represents a paraphyletic group of human-adapted Escherichia coli lineages that converged towards the same enteropathogenic pathovar. In low-income countries, Shigella is typically transmitted by ingestion of contaminated water and food, while in high-income countries sexual transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) is the dominant route of transmission. Although more than 40 different serotypes of Shigella have been reported globally, within the MSM community the majority of reported cases are attributed to three Shigella serotypes: the Shigella sonnei unique serotype (Ss) and the Shigella flexneri serotypes 2a and 3a. Here, using a zebrafish infection model, we demonstrate that Shigella can establish persistent infection in vivo. In this case, bacteria are not cleared by the host immune system and become tolerant to therapeutic doses of antibiotics. We show that persistence is dependent on the Shigella O-Antigen, a key constituent of the bacterial cell surface and determinant of serotype classification. Representative isolates of three Shigella serotypes associated with global dissemination and MSM transmission (S. sonnei Ss, S. flexneri 2a and 3a) all persist in zebrafish, while a serotype not associated with MSM transmission (S. flexneri 5a) does not. Strikingly, Shigella serotypes which establish persistent infection fail to promote macrophage cell death in vivo. We conclude that zebrafish can be a valuable platform to illuminate host and pathogen factors underlying the establishment of persistent infection with Shigella in humans.\n\nHighlightsO_LIShigella can establish persistent infection in zebrafish\nC_LIO_LIEstablishment of persistent infection in vivo depends on Shigella serotype\nC_LIO_LIThe same serotypes establishing persistent infection in zebrafish are prevalent in a patient group in whom persistent infection is observed\nC_LIO_LIShigella serotypes which establish persistent infection fail to promote macrophage cell death in vivo\nC_LI\n\nIn BriefIn high-income countries, sexual transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) is the dominant cause of domestic Shigella transmission.

    "abstract": "Microorganisms frequently colonize surfaces and equipment within food production facilities. Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen widely distributed in food production environments and is the target of numerous control and prevention procedures. Detection of L. monocytogenes in a food production setting requires culture dependent methods, but the complex dynamics of bacterial interactions within these environments and their impact on pathogen detection remains largely unexplored. To address this challenge, we applied both 16S rRNA and shotgun quasimetagenomic (enriched microbiome) sequencing of swab culture enrichments from seafood and dairy production environments. Utilizing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we observed variability between samples taken from different production facilities and a distinctive microbiome for each environment. With shotgun quasimetagenomic sequencing, we were able to assemble L. monocytogenes metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) and compare these MAGSs to their previously sequenced whole genome sequencing (WGS) assemblies, which resulted in two polyphyletic clades (lineages I and II). Using these same datasets together with in silico downsampling to produce a titration series of proportional abundances of L. monocytogenes, we were able to begin to establish limits for Listeria detection and subtyping using shotgun quasimetagenomics. This study contributes to the understanding of microbial diversity within food production environments and presents insights into how many reads or relative abundance is needed in a metagenome sequencing dataset to detect, subtype, and source track at a SNP level, as well as providing an important foundation for utilizing metagenomics to mitigate unfavorable occurrences along the farm to fork continuum.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn developed countries, the human diet is predominantly food commodities, which have been manufactured, processed, and stored in a food production facility. It is well known that the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is frequently isolated from food production facilities and can cause serious illness to susceptible populations. Multistate outbreaks of L. monocytogenes over the last 10 years have been attributed to food commodities manufactured and processed in production facilities, especially those dealing with dairy products such as cheese and ice cream. A myriad of recalls due to possible L. monocytogenes contamination have also been issued for seafood commodities originating from production facilities. It is critical to public health that the means of growth, survival and spread of Listeria in food production ecosystems is investigated with developing technologies, such as 16S rRNA and quasimetagenomic sequencing, to aid in the development of effective control methods.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile flagellin (FliC) is associated with toxin gene expression, bacterial colonization and virulence, and is also involved in pleiotropic gene regulation during in vivo infection. However, how fliC expression is regulated and how FliC modulates C. difficile pathogenicity remain unclear. In other bacterial species, FliC participates in a regulatory network with FliW and CsrA to regulate motility. Currently, studies investigating the role of fliC in C. difficile physiology were performed with motile strains. Despite its canonical role in motility, we found fliC is highly conserved in non-motile C. difficile strains that have jettisoned most flagellar assembly genes. We therefore investigated the roles of fliC in pathogenesis and physiology in the non-motile clade 5 ribotype 078 strain C. difficile 1015 (CD1015). We determined that fliC was expressed in CD1015 and the regulatory role of fliC on toxin production is independent of functional flagella and motility. We showed protein-protein interactions between FliW-FliC and FliW-CsrA using a bacterial two-hybrid system and identified the required binding site for CsrA post-transcriptional regulation in the 5 untranslated region of the fliC transcript. Analysis of mutations in fliC, fliW and csrA (and all combinations) on C. difficile pathogenesis indicated that FliW plays a central role in C. difficile virulence as animals infected with strains carrying a deletion of fliW showed decreased survival and increased disease severity. This work highlights that key proteins involved in flagellar biosynthesis retain their regulatory roles in pathogenesis independent of their functions in motility.\n\nAuthor SummaryC. difficile is a leading cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea in developed countries with many known virulence factors. In several pathogens, motility and virulence are intimately linked by regulatory networks that allow coordination of these processes in pathogenesis and physiology. Regulation of C. difficle toxin production by FliC has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo and has been proposed to link motility and virulence. Here we show that clinically important, non-motile C. difficile strains have conserved FliC and regulatory partners FliW and CsrA, despite lacking the rest of the machinery to produce functional flagella. Our work highlights a novel role for flagellin outside of its role in motility in the pathogenesis and physiology of C. difficile.",

    "abstract": "In its simplest form, bacterial flagellar filaments are composed of flagellin proteins with just two helical inner domains, which together comprise the filament core. Although this minimal filament is sufficient to provide motility in many flagellated bacteria, most bacteria produce flagella composed of flagellin proteins with one or more outer domains arranged in a variety of supramolecular architectures radiating from the inner core. Flagellin outer domains are known to be involved in adhesion, proteolysis and immune evasion but have not been thought to be required for motility. Here we show that in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa POA1 strain, a bacterium that forms a ridged filament on account of the arrangement of the two outer domains of its flagellin protein, motility is categorically dependent on these flagellin outer domains. Moreover, a comprehensive network of intermolecular interactions connecting the inner domains to the outer domains, the outer domains to one another, and the outer domains back to the inner domain filament core, is required for motility. This inter-domain connectivity confers PAO1 flagella with increased stability, essential for its motility in viscous environments. Additionally, we find that such ridged flagellar filaments are not unique to Pseudomonas but are, instead, present throughout diverse bacterial phyla.",

    "abstract": "In computer-aided drug discovery (CADD), virtual screening (VS) is used for identifying the drug candidates that are most likely to bind to a molecular target in a large library of compounds. Most VS methods to date have focused on using canonical compound representations (e.g., SMILES strings, Morgan fingerprints) or generating alternative fingerprints of the compounds by training progressively more complex variational autoencoders (VAEs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). Although VAEs and GNNs led to significant improvements in VS performance, these methods suffer from reduced performance when scaling to large virtual compound datasets. The performance of these methods has shown only incremental improvements in the past few years. To address this problem, we developed a novel method using multiparameter persistence (MP) homology that produces topological fingerprints of the compounds as multidimensional vectors. Our primary contribution is framing the VS process as a new topology-based graph ranking problem by partitioning a compound into chemical substructures informed by the periodic properties of its atoms and extracting their persistent homology features at multiple resolution levels. We show that the margin loss fine-tuning of pretrained Triplet networks attains highly competitive results in differentiating between compounds in the embedding space and ranking their likelihood of becoming effective drug candidates. We further establish theoretical guarantees for the stability properties of our proposed MP signatures, and demonstrate that our models, enhanced by the MP signatures, outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by a wide and highly statistically significant margin (e.g., 93% gain for Cleves-Jain and 54% gain for DUD-E Diverse dataset).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe trematode Fasciola hepatica is the most widespread causative agent of fasciolosis, a parasitic disease that mainly affects humans and ruminants worldwide. During F. hepatica infection, newly excysted juveniles (FhNEJ) emerge in the duodenum of the mammalian host and migrate towards the definitive location of the parasite, the intra-hepatic biliary ducts. Understanding how F. hepatica traverses the intestinal wall and migrates towards the liver is pivotal for the development of more successful strategies against fasciolosis. The central enzyme of the mammalian fibrinolytic system is plasmin, a serine protease whose functions are exploited by a number of parasite species owing to its broad spectrum of substrates, including components of tissue extracellular matrices. The aim of the present work is to understand whether FhNEJ co-opt the functions of their host fibrinolytic system as a mechanism to facilitate trans-intestinal migration.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsAn FhNEJ tegument protein extract (FhNEJ-Teg) was obtained in vitro, and its capability to bind the zymogen plasminogen (PLG) and enhance its conversion to the active protease, plasmin, were analyzed by a combination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent, chromogenic and immunofluorescence assays. Additionally, PLG-binding proteins in FhNEJ-Teg were identified by 2D electrophoresis coupled to mass-spectrometry analysis, and the interactions were validated using FhNEJ recombinant proteins.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results show that FhNEJ-Teg contains proteins that bind PLG and stimulate its activation to plasmin, which could facilitate the traversal of the intestinal wall by FhNEJ and contribute to the successful establishment of the parasite within its mammalian host. Altogether, our findings contribute to a better understanding of host-parasite relationships during early fasciolosis and may be exploited from a pharmacological and/or immunological perspective for the development of treatment and control strategies against this global disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryFasciolosis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus Fasciola, of which F. hepatica stands out as it has successfully spread all over the world and infects humans and animals throughout the entire global geography. Definitive hosts become infected by ingestion of aquatic plants or water contaminated with metacercariae, which excyst in the duodenum and release the so-called newly excysted juvenile flukes (FhNEJ). FhNEJ traverse the intestinal wall and evolve into immature parasites that migrate through the peritoneum and liver parenchyma until they reach their definitive location inside the major biliary ducts, where adult worms develop and egg shedding starts. In order to cross the intestinal wall, FhNEJ are endowed with a repertoire of proteases that degrade components of the intestinal extracellular matrix, and we hypothesized that they may also co-opt the proteolytic functions of plasmin, the central enzyme of the mammalian fibrinolytic system, to migrate more efficiently across host tissues. In this study, we demonstrate that FhNEJ express proteins on their tegument surface that interact with plasminogen, the zymogen of plasmin, and stimulate its conversion into its active form, which could potentially be used for trans-intestinal migration and contribute to the successful establishment of the parasite within its mammalian host.",

    "abstract": "The main components of the essential cellular process of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis are highly conserved from yeast to humans. Among these, the transcription-U3 Associated Proteins (t-UTPs) are a small subunit processome subcomplex that coordinate the first two steps of ribosome biogenesis in transcription and pre-18S processing. While we have identified the human counterparts of most of the yeast Utps, the homologs of yeast Utp9 and Bud21 (Utp16) have remained elusive. In this study, we find NOL7 is the likely ortholog of Bud21. Previously described as a tumor suppressor through regulation of antiangiogenic transcripts, we now show that NOL7 is required for early pre-rRNA stability and pre-18S processing in human cells. These roles lead to decreased protein synthesis, induction of the nucleolar stress response, and defects in cell cycle progression upon NOL7 depletion. Beyond Bud21s nonessential role in yeast, we establish human NOL7 as an essential UTP that is necessary for both pre-rRNA transcription and processing.",

    "abstract": "One of the keys to eliminating the personal and financial costs of cancer lies in the early detection of the disease. Consequently, effective cancer interventions increasingly rely on our understanding of the earliest cellular and nuclear events that lead to oncogenic transformation. Colorectal cancer, the third most prevalent cancer in the United States, results from the transformation of polyps. Our group demonstrated that the alteration of chromatin organization is a pivotal event in this oncogenic transformation. Here, we analyze the differences of the nucleosomal sensitivity to mocroccocal nuclease (MNase) between histopathologically matched pre-cancerous polyps taken from patients that did not develop cancer (cancer-free polyps, CFP) and those that did develop cancer (cancer-associated polyps, CAP). We produced high-resolution nucleosome distribution and nucleosome sensitivity maps from each of the five CFP patient samples and three CAP patient samples. We show that nucleosome distribution is largely invariant between CFP and CAP samples. Nucleosome sensitivity, however, is a powerful analysis that can identify genomic locations that distinguish CFP from CAP. We have identified more than 1000 genomic locations with altered nucleosomal sensitivity that discriminate between CAP and CFP. Furthermore, we show that these genomic locations with altered nucleosomal sensitivity between CFP and CAP include genes that play critical roles in oncogenic transformation. We propose that nucleosome sensitivity serves as a robust biomarker indicating the oncogenic potential of precancerous polyps and could be used for the early detection of polyps that will become cancerous.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAlternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major mechanism that increases transcriptional diversity and regulates mRNA abundance. Existing computational tools to analyze APA have low precision because these tools are designed for short-read RNA-seq, which is a suboptimal data source to study APA. Long-read RNA-seq (LR-RNA-seq) accurately detects complete transcript isoforms with poly(A)-tails, providing an ideal data source to study APA. However, current computational tools are incompatible with LR-RNA-seq.\n\nResultsHere, we introduce LAPA, a computational toolkit to study alternative polyadenylation (APA) from diverse data sources such as LR-RNA-seq and short-read 3 sequencing (3-seq). LAPA counts and clusters reads with poly(A)-tail, then performs peak-calling to detect poly(A)-site in a data source agnostic manner. The resulting peaks are annotated based on genomics features and regulatory sequence elements such as presence of a poly(A)-signal. Finally, LAPA can perform robust statistical testing and multiple testing correction to detect differential APA.\n\nWe analyzed ENCODE LR-RNA-seq data from human WTC11, mouse C2C12 myoblast, and C2C12-derived differentiated myotube cells using LAPA. Comparing LR-RNA-seq from different platforms and library preparation methods against 3-seq shows that LR-RNA-seq detects poly(A)-sites with a performance of 75% precision at 57% recall. Moreover, LAPA consistently improved TES validation by at least 25% over the baseline transcriptome annotation generated by TALON, independent of protocol or platform. Differential APA analysis detected 788 statistically significant genes with unique polyadenylation signatures between undifferentiated myoblast and differentiated myotube cells. Among these genes, 3 UTR elongation is significantly associated with higher expression, while shortening is linked with lower expression. This analysis reveals a link between cell state/identity and APA. Overall, our results show that LR-RNA-seq is a reliable data source for the study of post-transcriptional regulation by providing precise information about alternative polyadenylation.\n\nAvailabilityLAPA is publicly available at https://github.com/mortazavilab/lapa and PyPI.\n\nContact:: ali.mortazavi@uci.edu",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 (SpCas9) stabilizes each strand of a DNA bubble via distinct interactions, forming a stable ~20 bp R-loop on the complementary strand but relying on narrower protein-DNA interactions to bind the non-complementary strand with 5 NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The enzymes HNH endonuclease domain cleaves DNA within the R-loop, and its RuvC endonuclease cleaves 5 to the NGG and opposite the HNH cleavage site to generate blunt DNA ends. We show that this nucleoprotein complex can be mechanically strained by shifting the RNA:DNA hybrid and that the HNH cleavage site tracks this shift but the RuvC cleavage site does not, resulting in overhanging DNA ends. This is observed using cleavage in living cells and sequencing assays to characterize overhangs generated by stressed complexes, as well as single-molecule cleavage assays to characterize differential cleavage kinetics of HNH and RuvC endonucleases in stressed complexes as well as complex disassembly.\n\nUsing Sanger sequencing and high-throughput genome sequencing of DNA cleavage reactions, we find that the SpCas9 complex responds to internal mechanical strain by robustly generating overhanging, rather than blunt, DNA ends. Internal mechanical strain is generated by increasing or decreasing the spacing between the RNA:DNA hybrid and the downstream canonical PAM. Up to two-base 3 overhangs can be robustly generated via a two-base increase in the distance between hybrid and PAM. We also use single-molecule experiments to reconstruct the full course of the CRISPR-SpCas9 reaction in real-time, monitoring and quantifying the R-loop formation, the first and second DNA incision events, and the post-catalytic complex dissociation. Complex dissociation and release of broken DNA ends appears to be a rate-limiting step of the reaction, and strained SpCas9 are sufficiently destabilized so as to rapidly dissociate after formation of broken DNA ends.",

    "abstract": "Anopheles aquasalis is a primary malaria vector in coastal South America that grows in brackish waters of mangroves. Its importance has increased in recent years as it has been established as a model for parasite-vector studies for non-model Plasmodium species, such as P. yoelli. In this study, we present the complete genome of An. aquasalis and offer some insights into evolution and physiology. With a 162Mb and 12,446 coding proteins, the An. aquasalis genome is similar in size and gene content as other neotropical anophelines. 1,038 single-copy orthologs are present in An. aquasalis and all Diptera and it was possible to infer that An. aquasalis diverged from An. darlingi (the main malaria vector in inland South America) nearly 14 million years ago (mya). Ion transport and metabolism proteins is one the major gene families in An. aquasalis with 660 genes. Amongst these genes, important gene families relevant for osmosis control (e.g., aquaporins, vacuolar-ATPases, Na+/K+-ATPases and carbonic anhydrases) were identified in one-to-one orthologs with other anophelines. Evolutionary analysis suggests that all osmotic regulation genes are under strong purifying selection. We also observed low copy number variation in immunity-related genes (for which all classical pathways were described) and insecticide resistance genes. This is the third genome of a neotropical anopheline published so far. The data provided by this study may offer candidate genes for further studies on parasite-vector interactions and for studies on how brackish water anophelines deals with high fluctuation in water salinity.\n\nSignificance StatementThe brackish water mosquito Anopheles aquasalis is a primary malaria vector in coastal South America. Besides its peculiar ecological features (it is one of the few anopheline mosquitoes that survives high fluctuation of water salinity), An. aquasalis has gained relevance in recent years as a model for parasite-vector studies for non-model Plasmodium parasites. Still, the physiology and genetics of An. aquasalis are poorly understood. Here we present the genome of An. aquasalis with more than 12,000 annotated genes, offering insights in genome evolution, osmoregulation related, immunity, chemosensory and insecticide resistance genes. The data presented here will help to further advance the studies on An. aquasalis genetics and physiology to better understand parasite-vector interactions in non-model organisms.",

There are, however, limits to the throughput of such approaches and they are not without errors. DNA polymerases have benefited from over 50 years of detailed study and remain not fully understood. As such, methods that allow high-throughput interrogation of variants, and viable analysis pipelines to identify relevant variants, become an important tool to accelerate research. Using the DNA polymerase from B. subtilis Phi29 bacteriophage as a model, we demonstrate how coupling focused libraries, selection and deep sequencing can be combined to identify variants of interest for characterization. As selection parameters can be controlled, different areas of an enzymes mechanism can be explored. Focusing selection on faster HNA (1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleic acid) synthesis, we identified P562del as a variant of interest, enriching significantly between rounds. Characterization confirmed its faster HNA synthesis initiation but lower processivity and fidelity. P562 is a non-conserved residue, unlikely to be selected by more traditional approaches, but its deletion recapitulates knowledge on how Phi29 exonuclease, thumb and TPR2 subdomains regulate polymerase function. Our data further support the hypothesis that Phi29 shows a two-state binding to its template: a fast non-replicative complex that transitions to a replication-competent state.",

Remarkably, its catalytic efficiency kcat/Km can be boosted more than 100-fold by complex formation with a partner enzyme. Recently, an autonomously fully active MtCM variant was generated using directed evolution, and its structure solved by X-ray crystallography. However, key residues were involved in crystal contacts, challenging the functional interpretation of the structural changes. Here, we address these challenges by microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, followed up by additional kinetic and structural analyses of selected sets of specifically engineered enzyme variants. A comparison of wild-type MtCM with naturally and artificially activated MtCMs revealed the overall dynamic profiles of these enzymes as well as key interactions between the C-terminus and the active site loop. In the artificially evolved variant of this model enzyme, this loop is pre-organized and stabilized by Pro52 and Asp55, two highly conserved residues in typical, highly active chorismate mutases. Asp55 stretches across the active site and helps to appropriately position active site residues Arg18 and Arg46 for catalysis. The role of Asp55 can be taken over by another acidic residue, if introduced at position 88 close to the C-terminus of MtCM, as suggested by MD simulations and confirmed by kinetic investigations of engineered variants.",

More importantly, we established and quantified the correlation between the bacterial trapping in porous media and the geometric confinement imposed by the microspheres. In addition, numerical simulations showed that the active Brownian motion model in the presence of microspheres resulted in bacterial motion that are consistent with the experimental observations. Our study suggested that it is important to distinguish the ability of bacteria to move easily - bacterial mobility - from the ability of bacteria to move independently - bacteria motility. Our results showed that bacterial motility remains similar in porous media, but bacterial mobility was significantly affected by the pore-scale confinement.",

    "abstract": "Secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) are now known to play multifaceted roles in biological processes such as immune responses and cancer. The two primary classes of EVs are defined in terms of their origins: exosomes are derived from the endosomal pathway while microvesicles (ectosomes) bud from the cell membrane. However, it remains unclear whether the contents, sizes, and localizations of subpopulations of EVs can be used to associate them with the two primary classes. Here, we use confocal microscopy and high-resolution volumetric imaging to study intracellular localization of the EV markers CD9 and CD63 prior to EV export from cells. We find significantly different spatial expression of CD9 and CD63. CD9 is primarily localized in microvesicles, while CD63 is detected exclusively in exosomes. We also observe structures in which CD63 forms a shell that encapsulates CD9 and interpret them to be multi-vesicular bodies. The morphology and location within the endoplasmic reticulum of these shell-like structures are consistent with a role in differential sorting and export of exosomes and microvesicles. Our in situ imaging allows unambiguous identification and tracking of EVs from their points of origin to cell export, and suggest that CD9 and CD63 can be used as biomarkers to differentiate subpopulations of EVs.",

    "abstract": "MLL-rearranged leukemias are among the leukemic subtypes with poorest survival, and treatment options have barely improved over the last decades. Furthermore, despite increasing molecular understanding of the mechanisms behind these hematopoietic malignancies, this knowledge has had poor translation into the clinic. Identification of novel treatment methods is hampered by the lack of relevant in vivo models that allow for rapid identification of actionable drug targets and small molecule inhibitors. Here, we report a Drosophila melanogaster model system to explore the pathways affected in MLL-rearranged leukemia. We show that expression of the human leukemic oncogene MLL-AF4 in the Drosophila hematopoietic system resulted in increased levels of circulating hemocytes and an enlargement of the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. Strikingly, depletion of Drosophila orthologs of known interactors of MLL-AF4, such as DOT1L, rescued the leukemic phenotype. In agreement, treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of DOT1L also prevented the MLL-AF4-induced leukemia-like phenotype. Taken together, this model provides an in vivo system to unravel the genetic interactors involved in leukemogenesis and offers a strategy for a prompt identification of potential therapeutic options for treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Various studies have suggested the presence of triacylglycerol in cyanobacteria, but no convincing evidence exists. We purified a substance co-migrating with triacylglycerol and determined its structure using mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and 1H- and 13C-NMR. The major components were palmitoyl and stearoyl plastoquinols (acyl plastoquinol). Acyl plastoquinol has never been described before. The level of acyl plastoquinol was 0.4% of the total lipids. We still do not have clear evidence for the presence of triacylglycerol. If present, the maximum triacylglycerol level, must be at most 10% of acyl plastoquinol or less. The Synechocystis Slr2103 protein was suggested to synthesize triacylglycerol, but the product could be acyl plastoquinol. The possible roles of this novel compound in photosynthesis should be a new focus of research.",

    "abstract": "As an enduring hot topic in the field of innate immunity, apoptosis is widely considered as an effective approach to eliminate pathogenic microbes, and possesses crucial role during host-pathogen interactions. Recently, researchers have found that virus-containing host cells could transmit apoptotic signals to surrounding uninfected cells during infection, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that exosomes secreted by WSSV-infected mud crab hemocytes contain viral nucleic acid wsv277, which could be transported to the recipient cells and further expressed viral protein with phosphokinase activity. Besides, by using transcriptome, proteome, ChIP-seq and coIP techniques, the results revealed that wsv277 could activate the transcription and translation of apoptotic genes via interacting with CBF and EF-1, so as to suppress the spread of virus infection by inducing apoptosis of the surrounding cells. Therefore, for the first time, our study proved that the components of DNA virus could be encapsulated into exosomes, and elucidated the mechanism of apoptotic signal transduction between cells from the perspective of exosome. Moreover, comparing those of invertebrates, we hypothesized that the innate immune system of vertebrate was weakened or degenerated, allowing exosomes to be employed by virus as the vehicle for immune escape.\n\nSignificance statementOur study revealed that the components of DNA virus could be packaged and transmitted through the exosomes of lower invertebrates, which strongly demonstrated the diversity of exosome-mediated viral immunity and its universality in animals. Furthermore, we elucidated the mechanism of apoptotic signal transduction between cells from the perspective of exosome, and revealed a novel strategy for the host to cope with viral infection. Since exosome is an important innate immune regulation approach, we hypothesize that the innate immune system of vertebrates is weakened or degenerated, allowing exosomes to be employed by virus as the vehicle for immune escape.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that MgrA, SarA, SarR, SarS, SarZ, and Rot bind at least three of the four promoters associated with genes encoding primary extracellular proteases in Staphylococcus aureus. We also showed that mutation of sarA results in a greater increase in protease production, and decrease in biofilm formation, than mutation of the loci encoding any of these other proteins. However, these conclusions were based on in vitro studies. Thus, the goal of the experiments reported here was to determine the relative impact of the regulatory loci encoding these proteins in vivo. To this end, we compared the virulence of mgrA, sarA, sarR, sarS, sarZ, and rot mutants in a murine osteomyelitis model. Mutants were generated in the methicillin-resistant USA300 strain LAC and the methicillin-sensitive USA200 strain UAMS-1. As assessed based on an overall osteomyelitis pathology score derived from the incidence of bone fracture, bacterial burdens in the bone, cortical bone destruction, and reactive bone formation, mutation of mgrA and rot limited virulence to a statistically significant extent in UAMS-1, but not in LAC. In contrast, the sarA mutant exhibited reduced virulence in both strains. This illustrates the importance of considering diverse clinical isolates when evaluating the impact of regulatory mutations on virulence. The reduced virulence of the sarA mutant was correlated with reduced cytotoxicity for osteoblasts and osteoclasts, reduced biofilm formation, and reduced sensitivity to the antimicrobial peptide indolicidin, all of which were directly attributable to increased protease production in both LAC and UAMS-1. This suggests that these in vitro phenotypes, either alone or in combination with each other, may be useful in prioritizing additional mutants for in vivo evaluation. Most importantly, they illustrate the significance of limiting protease production in vivo in S. aureus, and confirm that SarA plays the primary role in this regard.\n\nAuthor SummaryStaphylococcus aureus causes a diverse array of infections due to its ability to produce an arsenal of virulence factors. Among these are extracellular proteases, which serve several purposes on behalf of the bacterium. However, it has become increasingly apparent that it is also critical to limit the production of these proteases to prevent them from compromising the S. aureus virulence factor repertoire. Many regulatory loci have been implicated in this respect, but it is difficult to draw relative conclusions because few reports have made direct comparisons, and fewer still have done so in vivo. We addressed this by assessing the impact on virulence of six regulatory loci previously implicated in protease production. We did this in the clinical context of osteomyelitis using mutants generated in two divergent clinical isolates. Our results confirm significant strain-dependent differences, reinforcing the importance of considering such diverse clinical isolates when evaluating targets for potential therapeutic intervention. In this respect, only mutation of sarA attenuated virulence in both strains. This illustrates the importance of limiting protease production as a means of post-translational regulatory control in S. aureus and confirms that sarA plays a predominant role in this regard.",

    "abstract": "The {beta}-propeller protein Sec13 plays roles in at least three distinct processes by virtue of being a component of the COPII endoplasmic reticulum export vesicle coat, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the Seh1-associated (SEA)/GATOR nutrient-sensing complex, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms coordinating these cellular activities may operate via Sec13. The NPC, COPII and SEA/GATOR are all ancient features of eukaryotic cells. In the vast majority of eukaryotes, a single Sec13 gene is present, but here we report that the Euglenozoa, a lineage encompassing the diplonemid, kinetoplastid and euglenid protists contain two Sec13 paralogs. Furthermore, based on protein interactions and localization studies we show that Sec13 functions in diplonemids are divided between the Sec13a and Sec13b paralogs. Specifically, Sec13a interacts with COPII and the NPC, but Sec13b interacts with Sec16 and components of the SEA/GATOR complex. We infer that euglenozoan Sec13a is responsible for NPC functions and canonical anterograde transport activities while Sec13b acts within nutrient and autophagy-related pathways, indicating a fundamentally distinct organization of coatomer complexes in the euglenozoan flagellates.",

It has been intriguing how this transient cytoskeletal array imprints the spatial information to be read by the cytokinetic phragmoplast at later stages of mitotic cell division. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we discovered that the PPB recruited the Myosin XI motor MYA1 to the cortical division site where it joined microtubule-associated proteins and motors to form a ring of prominent cytoskeletal assemblies which received the expanding phragmoplast. This regulatory function of MYA1 in phragmoplast guidance is dependent on intact actin filaments. The discovery of these assemblies revealed the mechanism underlying how two dynamic cytoskeletal networks govern PPB-dependent division plane orientation during vegetative growth in flowering plants.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYMyosin XI joins microtubule-associated proteins and motors to form cortical assemblies to demarcate the cell division site.",

    "abstract": "Cell size and growth are intimately related across the evolutionary scale, and the molecular pathways underlying cell size homeostasis have received much attention over the last decades. However, whether cell size is important to attain maximal growth or fitness is still an open question, and the reasons why a critical size is needed for triggering key transitions of the cell cycle are unknown. We show that growth is a non-monotonic function of volume in yeast cells, with maximal values around the critical size. Comparing small to normal, large and outsized cells, the transcriptome undergoes an extensive inversion that correlates with RNA polymerase II occupancy. Accordingly, highly expressed genes impose strong negative effects on growth when their DNA/mass ratio is altered. A similar transcriptomic inversion is displayed by mouse liver cells of different sizes, suggesting that the uncovered mechanistic implications of cell size on growth and fitness are universal. We propose that cell size is set to attain a properly balanced transcriptome and, hence, maximize growth during cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Social behavioral changes are a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, nevertheless the underlying neural substrates of such dysfunction remain poorly understood. Building evidence points to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as one of the key brain regions that orchestrates social behavior. We used this concept with the aim to develop a translational rat model of social-circuit dysfunction, the chronic PFC activation model (CPA). Chemogenetic designer receptor hM3Dq was used to induce chronic activation of the PFC over 10 days, and the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of prolonged PFC hyperactivity were evaluated. To test the sensitivity of this model to pharmacological interventions on longer timescales, and validate its translational potential, the rats were treated with our novel highly selective oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist RO6958375, which has a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile over oxytocin. CPA rats showed reduced sociability in the three-chamber sociability test, and a concomitant decrease in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission within the PFC as measured by electrophysiological recordings in acute slice preparation. Sub-chronic treatment with a low dose of the novel OXTR agonist following CPA interferes with the emergence of PFC circuit dysfunction, abnormal social behavior and specific transcriptomic changes. These results demonstrate that sustained PFC hyperactivity modifies circuit characteristics and social behaviors in ways that can be modulated by selective OXTR activation and that this model may be used to understand the circuit recruitment of prosocial therapies in drug discovery.",
