    "abstract": "Assuring that cell therapy products are safe before releasing them for use in patients is critical. Currently, compendial sterility testing for bacteria and fungi can take 7-14 days. The goal of this work was to develop a rapid untargeted approach for the sensitive detection of microbial contaminants at low abundance from low volume samples during the manufacturing process of cell therapies. We developed a long-read sequencing methodology using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform with 16S and 18S amplicon sequencing to detect USP<71> organisms and other microbial species. Reads are classified metagenomically to predict the microbial species. We used an extreme gradient boosting machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to first assess if a sample is contaminated and second, determine whether the predicted contaminant is correctly classified or misclassified. The model was used to make a final decision on the sterility status of the input sample. An optimised experimental and bioinformatics pipeline starting from spiked species through to sequenced reads allowed for the detection of microbial samples at 10 CFU / mL using metagenomic classification. Machine learning can be coupled with long read sequencing to detect and identify sample sterility status and microbial species present in T-cell cultures, including the USP<71> organisms to 10 CFU / mL.\n\nImportanceThis research presents a novel method for rapidly and accurately detecting microbial contaminants in cell therapy products, which is essential for ensuring patient safety. Traditional testing methods are time-consuming, taking 7-14 days, while our approach can significantly reduce this time. By combining advanced long read Nanopore sequencing techniques and machine learning, we can effectively identify the presence and types of microbial contaminants at low abundance levels. This breakthrough has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of cell therapy manufacturing, leading to better patient outcomes and a more streamlined production process.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of sequence-based drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction, showing that a straightforward deep learning architecture that leverages pre-trained protein language models (PLMs) for protein embedding outperforms state of the art approaches, achieving higher accuracy, expanded generalizability, and an order of magnitude faster training. PLM embeddings are found to contain general information that is especially useful in few-shot (small training data set) and zero-shot instances (unseen proteins or drugs). Additionally, the PLM embeddings can be augmented with features tuned by task-specific pre-training, and we find that these task-specific features are more informative than baseline PLM features. We anticipate such transfer learning approaches will facilitate rapid prototyping of DTI models, especially in low-N scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants (SV) are polymorphisms defined by their length (>50 bp). The usual types of SVs are deletions, insertions, translocations, inversions, and copy number variants. SV detection and genotyping is fundamental given the role of SVs in phenomena such as phenotypic variation and evolutionary events. Thus, methods to identify SVs using long read sequencing data have been recently developed. We present an accurate and efficient algorithm to predict SVs from long-read sequencing data. The algorithm starts collecting evidence (Signatures) of SVs from read alignments. Then, signatures are clustered based on a Euclidean graph with coordinates calculated from lengths and genomic positions. Clustering is performed by the DBSCAN algorithm, which provides the advantage of delimiting clusters with high resolution. Clusters are transformed into SVs and a Bayesian model allows to precisely genotype SVs based on their supporting evidence. This algorithm is integrated in the single sample variants detector of the Next Generation Sequencing Experience Platform (NGSEP), which facilitates the integration with other functionalities for genomics analysis. For benchmarking, our algorithm is compared against different tools using VISOR for simulation and the GIAB SV dataset for real data. For indel calls in a 20x depth Nanopore simulated dataset, the DBSCAN algorithm performed better, achieving an F-score of 98%, compared to 97.8 for Dysgu, 97.8 for SVIM, 97.7 for CuteSV, and 96.8 for Sniffles. We believe that this work makes a significant contribution to the development of bioinformatic strategies to maximize the use of long read sequencing technologies.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomic studies have improved the understanding of a broad range of biological tissues, fluids, and systems. Typically, metabolomic analyses employ a workflow that starts with detecting peaks from mass spectrometry data and is followed by a series of statistical analysis aimed at identifying dysregulated metabolites, group differences, and group similarities in dysregulated metabolites and pathways. Generating these group similarities relies on clustering analyses. However, current clustering methods are highly subjective and can be prone to errors, indicating the need for an updated workflow that improves upon these issues. Here we present a novel metabolomics workflow that can produce unbiased, reproducible clustering results: ensemble clustering combined with cluster optimization (ECCO). The first step, clustering optimization, is used to identify an optimal number of clusters without bias. The second step, ensemble clustering, is then performed by finding the consensus clustering solution across thirteen distance algorithms. This step improves the repeatability of analyses and eliminates bias through eliminating the need to choose one distance algorithm in clustering solutions. We employ ECCO to analyze synovial fluid metabolites from patients with early and late osteoarthritis (OA). This method improves upon the detection of distinct metabolomic endotypes compared with conventional analyses. Furthermore, novel pathways were identified corresponding with different stages of OA. These results demonstrate the utility of ECCO in metabolomics workflows that involve clustering data. ECCO, which we provide as an open-source tool, can improve the repeatability, reliability, and ease-of-use of metabolomics analyses, and is therefore expected to increase the confidence of biological interpretation from these data.",

    "abstract": "The statistical validation of peptide and protein identifications in mass spectrometry proteomics is a critical step in the analytical workflow. This is particularly important in discovery experiments to ensure only confident identifications are accumulated for downstream analysis and biomarker consideration. However, the inherent nature of discovery proteomics experiments leads to scenarios where the search space will inflate substantially due to the increased number of potential proteins that are being queried in each sample. In these cases, issues will begin to arise when the machine learning algorithms that are trained on an experiment specific basis cannot accurately distinguish between correct and incorrect identifications and will struggle to accurately control the false discovery rate. Here, we propose an alternative validation algorithm trained on a curated external data set of 2.8 million extracted peakgroups that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to create a generalizable peakgroup scoring (GPS) method for data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry. By breaking the reliance on the experimental data at hand and instead training on a curated external dataset, GPS can confidently control the false discovery rate while increasing the number of identifications and providing more accurate quantification in different search space scenarios. To first test the performance of GPS in a standard experimental environment and to provide a benchmark against other methods, a novel spike-in data set with known varying concentrations was analyzed. When compared to existing methods GPS increased the nunmber of identifications by 5-18% and was able to provide more accurate quantification by increasing the number of ratio validated identifications by 24-74%. To evaluate GPS in a larger search space, a novel data set of 141 blood plasma samples from patients developing acute kidney injury after sepsis was searched with a human tissue spectral library (10000+ proteins). Using GPS, we were able to provide a 207-377% increase in the number of candidate differentially abundant proteins compared to the existing methods while maintaining competitive numbers of global identifications. Finally, using an optimized human tissue library and workflow we were able to identify 1205 proteins from the 141 plasma samples and increase the number of candidate differentially abundant proteins by 70.87%. With the addition of machine learning aided differential expression, we were able to identify potential new biomarkers for stratifying subphenotypes of acute kidney injury in sepsis. These findings suggest that by using a generalized model such as GPS in tandem with a massive scale spectral library it is possible to expand the boundaries of discovery experiments in DIA proteomics. GPS is open source and freely available on github at (https://github.com/InfectionMedicineProteomics/gscore).",

    "abstract": "Cancers often display immune escape, but the mechanisms and potential for reversibility are incompletely understood. Epigenetic dysregulation has been implicated in the immune escape of various cancer types. We have identified the epigenetic modifier SET and MYND-domain containing protein 3 (SMYD3) as a mediator of immune escape in human papilloma virus (HPV)- negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), an aggressive disease with poor prognosis and low response to immunotherapy with pembrolizumab, a programmed-death-1 (PD-1) targeting antibody. SMYD3 loss increased the sensitivity of HNSCC cancer cells to IFN-{beta}, resulting in upregulation of type I IFN response and antigen presentation machinery genes. We found that SMYD3 regulates the transcription of Ubiquitin-Like PHD And RING Finger Domain- Containing Protein 1 (UHRF1), a key epigenetic reader of trimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), which binds to H3K9me3-enriched promoters of key immune-related genes and silences their expression. SMYD3 further maintains the repression of immune-related genes through the deposition of H4K20me3 within the gene body regions of these genes. In an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint resistant syngeneic mouse model of HPV-negative HNSCC, Smyd3 depletion induced influx of CD8+ T-cells, upregulated PD-L1 and MHC class I molecules, and increased sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy. SMYD3 overexpression was associated with decreased CD8 T-cell infiltration in tumor samples from patients with HPV-negative HNSCC, and was associated with poor response to pembrolizumab. Overall, these data highlight a previously unreported function of SMYD3 as a master epigenetic regulator of anti-tumor immune response in HPV-negative HNSCC and provide a rationale for translational approaches combining SMYD3 depletion strategies with checkpoint blockade to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance in this devastating disease.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of genomic methylation patterns at DNA replication forks by DNMT1 is the key to faithful mitotic inheritance. DNMT1 is often overexpressed in cancer cells and the DNA hypomethylating agents azacytidine and decitabine are currently used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, the toxicity of these cytidine analogs and their ineffectiveness in treating solid tumors have limited wider clinical use. GSK-3484862 is a newly-developed, dicyanopyridine containing, non-nucleoside DNMT1-selective inhibitor with low cellular toxicity. Here, we show that GSK-3484862 targets DNMT1 for protein degradation in both cancer cell lines and murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). DNMT1 depletion was rapid, taking effect within hours following GSK-3484862 treatment, leading to global hypomethylation. Inhibitor-induced DNMT1 degradation was proteasome-dependent, with no discernible loss of DNMT1 mRNA. In mESCs, GSK-3484862-induced Dnmt1 degradation requires Uhrf1, an accessory factor of Dnmt1 with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. We also show that Dnmt1 depletion and DNA hypomethylation induced by the compound are reversible after its removal. Together, these results indicate that this DNMT1-selective degrader/inhibitor will be a valuable tool for dissecting both coordinated events linking DNA methylation to gene expression and identifying downstream effectors that ultimately regulate cellular response to altered DNA methylation patterns in a tissue/cell-specific manner.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGSK-3484862 targets DNMT1 for protein degradation in a wide-range of cancer cell lines, without a decrease in DNMT1 mRNA levels\nC_LIO_LIDNMT1 depletion leads to a >50% loss of global DNA methylation in cells within 2-days of treatment with GSK-3484862\nC_LIO_LIGSK-3484862-induced DNMT1 degradation is proteasome-dependent\nC_LIO_LIIn mESCs, Uhrf1 is required for GSK-3484862 to induce Dnmt1 degradation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Anti-cancer therapies often result in a subset of surviving cancer cells that undergo therapy-induced senescence (TIS). Senescent cancer cells strongly modify the intratumoural microenvironment favoring immunosuppression and, thereby, tumour growth. An emerging strategy to optimise current therapies is to combine them with treatments that eliminate senescent cells. To this end, we undertook an unbiased proteomics approach to identify surface markers contributing to senescent cells immune evasion. Through this approach, we discovered that the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L2, but not PD-L1, is upregulated across multiple senescent human and murine cells. Importantly, blockade of PD-L2 strongly synergises with genotoxic chemotherapy, causing remission of solid tumours in mice. We show that PD-L2 inhibition prevents the persistence of chemotherapy-induced senescent cells, which exert cell-extrinsic immunomodulatory actions. In particular, upon chemotherapy, tumours deficient in PD-L2 fail to produce cytokines of the CXCL family, do not recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and are eliminated in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. We conclude that blockade of PD-L2 improves chemotherapy efficacy by reducing the intratumoural burden of senescent cells and their associated recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. These findings provide a novel strategy to exploit vulnerabilities arising in tumour cells as a result of therapy-induced damage and cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus is a macronutrient that regulates a wide range of physiological processes, including plant growth and development. The scarcity of bioavailable phosphate is often a constraint for plant growth in most agricultural ecosystems. Under phosphate limited conditions, plants increase phosphate acquisition or alter its distribution within tissues by activating different phosphate transporters and phosphate starvation-induced genes. Glutathione (GSH), on the other hand, is known to play a critical role in regulating iron and zinc homeostasis in Arabidopsis. However, how it regulates phosphate homeostasis under phosphate limited conditions remains unexplored. We found that the two GSH-deficient mutants, cad2-1, and pad2-1, were hypersensitive to phosphate starvation. Under phosphate-sufficient condition, the root phosphate content was lower in the mutants but significantly higher in the shoot over the Col-0 plants. The pattern was reversed under phosphate-deficient condition. Interestingly, among the different phosphate transporters analyzed, the AtPHT1;5 was significantly down-regulated in the two GSH-deficient mutants. Treatment with exogenous GSH could alter phosphate accumulation in Col-0 and the pht1;5 complementation lines but not in the pht1;5 mutant. This observation confirmed the role of GSH in phosphate reallocation during phosphate starvation via the AtPHT1;5 transporter. Further, promoter analysis demonstrated that GSH regulates the transcription of the AtPHT1;5 gene. The phosphate-responsive transcription factor (TF), AtWRKY75 was identified to interact with the AtPHT1;5 promoter, and phosphate deficiency or GSH treatment enhanced its binding affinity. Together our investigation delineates that GSH regulates the AtPHT1;5 transporter via the AtWRKY75 TF to modulate phosphate distribution under altered phosphate conditions.\n\nSummary statementGlutathione regulates phosphate translocation in Arabidopsis under altered phosphate condition via transcriptional activation of AtPHT1;5 gene by AtWRKY75 transcription factor.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to their conserved mammalian counterparts, plant long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are highly variable, splitting into many low-copy families. Curiously, LINE families from the RTE clade retain a stronger sequence conservation and hence reach higher copy numbers. The cause of this RTE-typical property is not yet understood, but would help clarifying why some transposable elements are removed quickly whereas others persist in plant genomes. Here, we bring forward the first detailed study of RTE LINE structure, diversity and evolution in plants. For this, we argue that the Nightshade family is the ideal taxon to follow the evolutionary trajectories of RTE LINEs, given their high abundance, recent activity and partnership to non-autonomous elements.\n\nUsing bioinformatic, cytogenetic and molecular approaches, we detect 4029 full-length RTE LINEs across the Solanaceae. We finely characterize and manually curate a core group of 458 full-length LINEs in allotetraploid tobacco, show amplification after polyploidization, and trace hybridization events by RTE LINE composition of parental genomes. Finally, we reveal the role of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as causes for the unique RTE LINE amplification and evolution pattern in plants: On one hand, we detect a highly conserved motif at the 3 UTR, suggesting strong selective constraints acting on the RTE terminus. On the other hand, we observed successive rounds of 5 UTR cycling, constantly rejuvenating the promoter sequences. This interplay between exchangeable promoters and conserved LINE bodies and 3 UTR likely allows RTE LINEs to persist and thrive in plant genomes.",

    "abstract": "Experimental observations of the 3-dimensional wake of swimmers are scarce. This study provides the first experimental measurements of the three-dimensional vortical structures of an anguilliform swimmer. A volumetric velocimetry (DDPTV) setup was used to quantify the wake of freely swimming dice snakes (Natrix tessellata) in a tank. Multiple swimming trials were recorded with three snakes swimming at a forward swimming speed ranging from 0.2 to 0.8L.s-1. The volumetric measurements show that during swimming, Natrix tessellata sheds vortex tubes from different parts of its body with oscillating lateral undulations. The vortex tubes are then linked to form a hairpin-like structure as predicted by computational fluid dynamic analyses. Quantitative measurements show that the vortex size gradually increases over time. The vortex circulation decreases after attaining a maximum. These results provide an experimental demonstration that the 3D wake structure of an anguilliform swimmer takes well organized dynamic shapes as predicted and provide baseline data for future studies comparing the wake structure of snakes with different locomotor ecologies.",

Alzheimers is a complex disease that can present with or without causative mutations and can be accompanied by a range of age-related comorbidities. This diverse presentation makes it difficult to study molecular changes specific to AD. To better understand the molecular signatures of disease we constructed a unique human brain sample cohort inclusive of autosomal dominant AD dementia (ADD), sporadic ADD, and those without dementia but with high AD histopathologic burden, and cognitively normal individuals with no/minimal AD histopathologic burden. All samples are clinically well characterized, and brain tissue was preserved postmortem by rapid autopsy. Samples from four brain regions were processed and analyzed by data-independent acquisition LC-MS/MS. Here we present a high-quality quantitative dataset at the peptide and protein level for each brain region. Multiple internal and external control strategies were included in this experiment to ensure data quality. All data are deposited in the ProteomeXchange repositories and available from each step of our processing.",

    "abstract": "The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection determines tuberculosis disease outcomes, yet we have an incomplete understanding of what immune factors contribute to a protective immune response. Neutrophilic inflammation has been associated with poor disease prognosis in humans and in animal models during M. tuberculosis infection and, therefore, must be tightly regulated. ATG5 is an essential autophagy protein that is required in innate immune cells to control neutrophil-dominated inflammation and promote survival during M. tuberculosis infection, however, the mechanistic basis for how ATG5 regulates neutrophil recruitment is unknown. To interrogate what innate immune cells require ATG5 to control neutrophil recruitment during M. tuberculosis infection, we used different mouse strains that conditionally delete Atg5 in specific cell types. We found that ATG5 is required in CD11c+ cells (lung macrophages and dendritic cells) to control the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines during M. tuberculosis infection, which would otherwise promote neutrophil recruitment. This role for ATG5 is autophagy-dependent, but independent of mitophagy, LC3-associated phagocytosis, and inflammasome activation, which are the most well-characterized ways that autophagy proteins regulate inflammation. In addition to the increase in proinflammatory cytokine production during M. tuberculosis infection, loss of ATG5 in innate immune cells also results in an early induction of TH17 responses. Despite prior published in vitro cell culture experiments supporting a role for autophagy in controlling M. tuberculosis replication in macrophages, loss of autophagy does not affect M. tuberculosis burden in macrophages in vivo and, therefore, the effects of autophagy on inflammatory responses occur without changes in pathogen numbers. These findings reveal new roles for autophagy proteins in lung resident macrophages and dendritic cells that are required to suppress inflammatory responses that are associated with poor control of M. tuberculosis infection.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are the key players in the global cycling of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) processes, availability and fluxes, and losses through emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), two very potent greenhouse gases. Thus, characterization of microbial functional guilds involved in these processes is high on the political agenda. Yet, typical sequence based characterization often represents only a minor fraction of their diversity in nature due to their frequent low relative abundance, insufficient sequencing depth of traditional metagenomes of complex communities, and limitations in coverage and efficiency of PCR-based assays. Here, we developed and tested a targeted metagenomic approach based on probe capture and hybridization to simultaneously characterize the diversity of multiple key metabolic genes involved in inorganic N and CH4 cycling. We designed comprehensive probe libraries for each of the 15 selected marker genes, resulting in 264,000 unique probes in total. These probes were used to selectively enrich the target genes in shotgun metagenomic libraries. In validation experiments with a mock community of cultured microorganisms, the target gene profiles were similar to those of the original community when sequenced with targeted metagenomics. Further, relative abundances of the marker genes obtained by targeted and shotgun metagenomics from agricultural and wetland soils correlated positively, indicating that the targeted approach did not introduce a significant quantitative bias. However, targeted metagenomics generated substantially higher diversity in terms of taxonomic coverage, and a larger number of sequence reads per sample, which allowed 35 times or 18% higher diversity estimates than when using shotgun metagenomics or targeted PCR amplification, respectively. Thus, captured metagenomics complements current approaches by enabling a targeted, more detailed characterization of the diversity of key functional genes involved in N and CH4 cycling within and across ecosystems.",

We determined mRNA enrichment in TIS granules (TGs) and the rough endopIasmic reticuIum (ER) through particle sorting and isolated cytosolic mRNAs by digitonin extraction. When focusing on non-membrane protein-encoding mRNAs, we observed that 52% have a biased transcript distribution across these compartments. Compartment enrichment is determined by a combinatorial code based on mRNA length, exon length, and 3'UTR-bound RNA-binding proteins. Compartment-biased mRNAs differ in the functional classes of their encoded proteins: TG-enriched mRNAs encode low-abundance proteins with strong enrichment of transcription factors, whereas ER-enriched mRNAs encode large and highly expressed proteins. Compartment localization is an important determinant of mRNA and protein abundance, which is supported by reporter experiments showing that redirecting cytosolic mRNAs to the ER increases their protein expression. In summary, the cytoplasm is functionally compartmentaIized by local translation environments.",

    "abstract": "Both zinc and plant-derived ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) are dietary components which regulate intestinal epithelial barrier function and protect against Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)1,2. Here, we explore whether zinc and AHR pathway are linked using a mouse IBD model with follow-on studies on human and mouse ileum organoids. Our data demonstrate that AHR regulates cellular zinc uptake, and that zinc is an integral part of AHR signalling processes. We show that dietary supplementation in mice with the plant-derived AHR ligand precursor, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), offers a high level of protection against dextran sulfate sodium induced IBD while protection fails in mice with AHR deleted in the intestinal epithelium. AHR agonist treatment is also ineffective in mice with a nutritional zinc deficiency. Experiments in the human Caco-2 cell line and ileum organoids showed that AHR activation increases total cellular zinc and cytosolic free Zn2+ concentrations through transcriptional upregulation of several SLC39 zinc importers. As a consequence, genes for tight junction (TJ) proteins were upregulated in a zinc-dependent manner involving zinc inhibition of signalling to NF-{kappa}B and attenuated degradation of TJ proteins through zinc inhibition of calpain activity. Thus, our data indicate that AHR activation by plant-derived dietary ligands improves gut barrier function via zinc-dependent cellular pathways, suggesting that combined dietary supplementation with AHR ligands and zinc might be effective in preventing and treating inflammatory gut disorders.",

Here, we investigate this problem in the context of mcr-1, a fitness-costly gene that confers resistance to the  last-resort antibiotic, colistin. Here we show that regulatory evolution has fine-tuned the expression of mcr-1, allowing E. coli to reduce the cost of mcr-1 while simultaneously increasing colistin resistance. Conjugative plasmids have transferred low cost/high resistance mcr-1 alleles across an incredible diversity of E. coli strains, further stabilizing mcr-1 at the species level. Crucially, regulatory mutations were associated with increased mcr-1 stability in pig farms following a ban on the use of colistin as a growth promoter that decreased colistin consumption by 90%. Our study shows how the rapid evolution and horizontal transmission of resistance genes can combine to stabilize resistance and reduce the efficiency of interventions aimed at reducing AMR by limiting antibiotic consumption.",

    "abstract": "Urbanisation is the fastest form of landscape transformation on the planet, but researchers understanding of the relationships between urbanisation and animal adaptability is still in its infancy. In terms of foraging, bold and innovative behaviours are proposed to help urban animals access, utilise, and exploit novel anthropogenic food sources. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are one of the best known and widespread urban-dwelling species. However, despite frequent stories, images, and videos portraying them as \"pests\" due to their exploitation of food-related objects (e.g., raiding the contents of outdoor bins), it is unknown whether they are bolder and more innovative in terms of their likelihood of exploiting these resources compared to rural populations. In the current study, we gave novel food-related objects to foxes from 104 locations (one object per location) across a large urban-rural gradient. To access the food, foxes had to use behaviours necessary for exploiting many food-related objects in the real world (e.g., biting, pushing, pulling, or lifting human-made materials). Despite all foxes acknowledging the objects, foxes from 31 locations touched them, while foxes from 12 locations gained access to the food inside. A principal component analysis of urban and other landscape variables (e.g., road, greenspace, and human population density) revealed that urbanisation was significantly and positively related to the likelihood of foxes touching, but not exploiting, the objects. Thus, while urban foxes may be bolder than rural populations in terms of their willingness to physically touch novel food-related objects, our findings are inconsistent with the notion that they are more innovative and pose a general nuisance to people by exploiting these anthropogenic resources.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe impact of urbanisation on animal adaptability remains unclear\nC_LIO_LIBold and innovative behaviour may help some urban species thrive\nC_LIO_LIWe studied wild red foxes responses to novel food-related objects\nC_LIO_LIUrban foxes were bolder, but not more innovative, than rural foxes\nC_LIO_LIUrbanisation may favour bolder, not more innovative, fox behaviour\nC_LI",

Leveraging techniques from self-supervised contrastive learning, we introduce a second-generation PLM-based DTI model trained on triplets of proteins, drugs, and decoys (small drug-like molecules that do not bind to the protein). We show that our approach, CON-Plex, improves specificity while maintaining high prediction accuracy and generalizability to new drug classes. CON-Plex maps proteins and drugs to a shared latent space which can be interpreted to identify mutually-compatible classes of proteins and drugs.
