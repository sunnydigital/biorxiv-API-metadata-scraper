    "abstract": "BackgroundThrombocytopenia is one of the hematologic disorders that frequently accompany HIV-1 infection. The interaction of HIV-1 and platelets is crucial in the Blood-Brain Barriers (BBB) degeneration and causes neuroinflammation. The research aims to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for HAT (HIV-1 associated thrombocytopenia) and summary the features of HAT-related neuroinflammation.\n\nMethodA retrospective study including 221 HAT patients was conducted in West China Hospital from 2017 to 2021. Clinical and laboratory data was analyzed the prevalence and risk factors for HAT and HAT-related neuroinflammation.\n\nResultsThe prevalence of HAT was 11.06% and most patients were men (76.92%), elderly ([&ge;]50, 55.21%) and 63.80% patients were mild thrombocytopenia. CD4+ T cell count, platelet crit (PCT) and the rate of large platelets (P-LCR) were significantly different between HAT group and control group (P < 0.001, P 0.001, P=0.002). CD4+ T cell count <200 cell/L (P=0.001) was an important risk factor in the occurrence of HAT while advanced age and high viral load were closely related to the occurrence of HAT. HAT-related neuroinflammation patients were mostly distributed in male (X2=10.066, P=0.007), with higher viral load (X2=12.297, P=0.006) and advanced age (X2=11.721, P=0.02) with neuropsychiatric symptoms and rising level of inflammatory factors like IL-6 and proteins in CSF.\n\nConclusionHAT and HAT with neuroinflammation cannot be ignored in HIV-1 infection because of the activation of monocytes, macrophages and microglia, further causing thrombocytopenia and neuroinflammation. Advanced age, lower CD4+ T cell count and high viral load were closely related to the occurrence of HAT and HAT-related neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Many mutations in genes for ribosomal proteins and assembly factors cause cell stress and altered cell fate resulting in congenital diseases, collectively called ribosomopathies. Even though all such mutations depress the cells protein synthesis capacity, they generate many different phenotypes, suggesting that the diseases are not due simply to insufficient protein synthesis capacity. To learn more, we have investigated how the global transcriptome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to reduced protein synthesis generated in two different ways: abolishing the assembly of new ribosomes or inhibiting ribosomal function. Our results show that the mechanism by which protein synthesis is obstructed affects the ribosomal protein transcriptome differentially: ribosomal protein mRNA abundance increases during the abolition of ribosome formation but decreases during the inhibition of ribosome function. Interestingly, the ratio between mRNAs from some, but not all, paralogous genes encoding slightly different versions of a given r-protein change differently during the two types of stress, suggesting that specific ribosomal protein paralogues may contribute to the stress response. Unexpectedly, the abundance of transcripts for ribosome assembly factors and translation factors remains relatively unaffected by the stresses. On the other hand, the state of the translation apparatus does affect cell physiology: mRNA levels for some other proteins not directly related to the translation apparatus also change differentially, though not coordinately with the r-protein genes, in response to the stresses.\n\nImportanceMutations in genes for ribosomal proteins or assembly factors cause a variety of diseases called ribosomopathies. These diseases are typically ascribed to a reduction in the cells capacity for protein synthesis. Paradoxically, ribosomal mutations result in a wide variety of disease phenotypes, even though they all reduce protein synthesis. Here we show that the transcriptome changes differently depending on how the protein synthesis capacity is reduced. Most strikingly, inhibiting ribosome formation and ribosome function have opposite effects on the abundance of mRNA for ribosomal proteins, while genes for ribosome translation and assembly factors show no systematic responses. Thus, the process by which the protein synthesis capacity is reduced contributes decisively to global mRNA composition. This emphasis on process is a new concept in understanding ribosomopathies and other stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Integrative approaches that simultaneously model multi-omics data have gained increasing popularity because they provide holistic system biology views of multiple or all components in a biological system of interest. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a correlation-based integrative method. It was initially designed to extract latent features shared between two assays by finding the linear combinations of features - referred to as canonical vectors (CVs) - within each assay that achieve maximal across-assay correlation. Sparse multiple CCA (SMCCA), a widely-used derivative of CCA, allows more than two assays but can result in non-orthogonal CVs when applied to high-dimensional data. Here, we incorporated a variation of the Gram-Schmidt (GS) algorithm with SMCCA to improve orthogonality among CVs. Applying our SMCCA-GS method to proteomics and methylomics data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Jackson Heart Study (JHS), we identified strong associations between blood cell counts and protein abundance. This finding suggests that adjustment of blood cell composition should be considered in protein-based association studies. Importantly, CVs obtained from two independent cohorts demonstrate transferability across the cohorts. For example, proteomic CVs learned from JHS explain similar amounts of blood cell count phenotypic variance in MESA, explaining 39.0% ~ 50.0% variation in JHS and 38.9% ~ 49.1% in MESA, similar transferability was observed for other omics-CV-trait pairs. This suggests that biologically meaningful and cohort-agnostic variation is captured by CVs. We further developed Sparse Supervised Multiple CCA (SSMCCA) to allow supervised integration analysis for more than two assays. We anticipate that applying our SMCCA-GS and SSMCCA on various cohorts would help identify cohort-agnostic biologically meaningful relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic traits.\n\nAuthor SummaryComprehensive understanding of human complex traits may benefit from incorporation of molecular features from multiple biological layers such as genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. CCA is a correlation-based method for multi-omics data which reduces the dimension of each omic assay to several orthogonal components - commonly referred to as canonical vectors (CVs). The widely-used SMCCA method allows effective dimension reduction and integration of multi-omics data, but suffers from potentially highly correlated CVs when applied to high-dimensional omics data. Here, we improve the statistical independence among the CVs by adopting a variation of the GS algorithm. We applied our SMCCA-GS method to proteomic and methylomic data from two cohort studies, MESA and JHS. Our results reveal a pronounced effect of blood cell counts on protein abundance, strongly suggesting blood cell composition adjustment in protein-based association studies may be necessary. Finally, we present SSMCCA which allows supervised CCA analysis for the association between one phenotype of interest and more than two assays. We anticipate that SMCCA-GS would help reveal meaningful system-level factors from biological processes involving features from multiple assays; and SSMCCA would further empower interrogation of these factors for phenotypic traits related to health and diseases.",

Prior mechanistic studies have established a proton-coupled hydride-transfer mechanism for LarALp, but direct evidence showing that hydride attacks the C4 atom in the pyridinium ring of NPN has been lacking. Here, we show that sodium borohydride (NaBH4) irreversibly inactivates LarALp accompanied by a rapid color change of the enzyme. The drastically altered ultraviolet-visible spectra during NaBH4 titration supported hydride transfer to C4 of NPN, and the concomitant Ni loss unraveled by mass spectrometry experiments accounted for the mechanism-based inactivation. High resolution structures of LarALp revealed a substantially weakened C-Ni bond in the metastable sulfite-NPN adduct where the NPN cofactor is in the reduced state. These findings allowed us to propose a mechanism of LarALp inactivation by NaBH4 that provides key insights into the enzyme-catalyzed reaction and sheds light on the reactivity of small molecule NPN mimetics.",

    "abstract": "To maximise the benefit of exploiting genebank resources, accurate and complete taxonomic assignments are imperative. The rise of genebank genomics allows genetic methods to be used for this task, but these need to be largely automated since the number of samples dealt with is too great for efficient manual recategorisation, but no clearly optimal method has yet arisen. A recent landmark genebank genomic study sequenced over 10,000 accessions of peppers (Capsicum spp.), for which the exploitation of genebank material is of huge commercial, cultural, and scientific importance. This study resulted in precisely the type of dataset that will, in coming decades, be likely be produced for hundreds of plant taxa. The long-appreciated difficulties of pepper taxonomy are evident from the many obvious misclassifications noted in this and other studies, providing a perfect opportunity to simultaneously advance methods development in the area, to correct many genebank taxonomic assignments of pepper accessions, and to provide insights into pepper taxonomy in general. This paper aims to achieve these goals using an approach that combines several ideas from standard classification algorithms to create a highly flexible and customisable classifier that performs favourably when compared with key alternative methods. The various characteristics of different methods are discussed, and possible sensible alterations to pepper taxonomy based on the results are proposed for discussion by the community.",

Here we propose PAST, a variational graph convolutional auto-encoder for ST, which effectively integrates prior information via a Bayesian neural network, captures spatial patterns via a self-attention mechanism, and enables scalable application via a ripple walk sampler strategy. Through comprehensive experiments on datasets generated by different technologies, we demonstrated that PAST could effectively characterize spatial domains and facilitate various downstream analyses, including ST visualization, spatial trajectory inference and pseudo-time analysis, by integrating spatial information and reference from various sources. Besides, we also show the advantages of PAST for accurate annotation of spatial domains in newly sequenced ST data and biological implications in the annotated domains.",

The scope of this re-analysis was focused on searching for ADAR-mediated RNA editing events, their clustering across samples of different origin, and classification. In total, 33 recoded protein sites were identified in 21 datasets. Of those, 18 sites were detected in at least two datasets representing the core human protein editome. In agreement with prior art works, neural and cancer tissues were found being enriched with recoded proteins. Quantitative analysis indicated that recoding of specific sites did not directly depend on the levels of ADAR enzymes or targeted proteins themselves, rather it was provided by differential and yet undescribed regulation of interaction of enzymes with mRNA. Nine recoding sites conservative between human and rodents were validated by targeted proteomics using stable isotope standards in murine brain cortex and cerebellum, and an additional one was validated in human cerebrospinal fluid. In addition to previous data of the same type from cancer proteomes, we provide a comprehensive catalog of recoding events caused by ADAR RNA editing in the human proteome.",

Our molecular simulation study on FUS-RNA complex provides atomic resolution insights into the observations from biochemical studies and also illuminate our understanding of molecular driving forces that mediate the structure, stability, and interaction of RRM and RGG domains of FUS with a stem-loop junction RNA. We observe a clear cooperativity and division of labour among the ordered (RRM) and disordered domains (RGG1 and RGG2 domain) of FUS that leads to an organized and tighter RNA binding. Irrespective of the length of RGG2, the RGG2-RNA interaction is confined to the stem-loop junction and the proximal stem regions. On the other hand, the RGG1-RNA interactions are primarily with the longer RNA stem. We find that the C-terminus of RRM, which make up the \"boundary residues\" that connect the folded RRM with the long disordered RGG2 stretch of the protein, plays a critical role in RNA binding with the RRM domain. Our study provides high-resolution molecular insights into the FUS-RNA interactions and forms the basis for understanding the molecular origins of full-length FUS interaction with RNA.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and its subcategories of machine learning and deep learning are gaining increasing importance and attention in the context of sports research. This has also meant that the number of corresponding publications has become complex and unmanageably large in human terms. In the current state of the research field, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis, which would prove useful for obtaining insights into the large amounts of available literature. Therefore, the present work aims to identify important research issues, elucidate the conceptual structure of the research field, and unpack the evolutionary trends and the direction of hot topics regarding key themes in the research field of artificial intelligence in sports. Using the Scopus database, 1215 documents (reviews and articles) were selected. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and bibliometrix R package. The main findings are as follows: (a) the literature and research interest concerning AI and its subcategories is growing exponentially; (b) the top 20 most cited works comprise 32.52% of the total citations; (c) the top 10 journals are responsible for 28.64% of all published documents; (d) strong collaborative relationships are present, as along with small, isolated collaboration networks of individual institutions; (e) the three most productive countries are China, the USA, and Germany; (f) different research themes can be characterized using author keywords with current trend topics, e.g., in the fields of biomechanics, injury prevention or prediction, new algorithms, and learning approaches. AI research activities in the fields of sports pedagogy, sports sociology, and sports economics seem to have played a subordinate role thus far. Overall, the findings of this study expand knowledge on the research situation as well as the development of research topics regarding the use of artificial intelligence in sports, and may guide researchers to identify currently relevant topics and gaps in the research.",

    "abstract": "Technical advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it more accessible to study the human microbiome, resulting in more available data and knowledge. As a result of this expansion of data, the need to obtain comparable and reproducible data has become one of the most important challenges facing microbiome research nowadays. In this study, we aim to contribute to existing knowledge to promote high quality microbiome data and minimize bias introduced by technical variation throughout studies, from sample collection, storage, to sequencing strategies. While immediate freezing upon sampling has been the \"golden standard\" in the field, this method is often logistically difficult and expensive, becoming a limiting factor when conducting large scale studies or in regions where maintenance of the cold-chain presents difficulties. Therefore, we compared the immediately frozen method to storage at room temperature for 3 - 5 days in two commercially available stabilization solutions (Omnigene gut and Zymo Research) as well as without buffer. Other important aspects were tested, such as DNA extraction, bacterial DNA input or number of PCR cycles. Method choice for cell disruption resulted in the biggest difference in compositional profiles. The changes observed in microbiome profiles in samples stored at RT without stabilization solution was prevented by the use of these. For library preparation and sequencing, we found the highest heterogeneity in the DNA extraction step, followed by the use of different Illumina barcodes, indicating that both of these steps have an impact during library preparation.

    "abstract": "Helminth endemic regions report lower COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Here, we show that lung remodeling from a prior infection with a lung migrating helminth, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, enhances viral clearance and survival of human-ACE2 transgenic mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2). This protection is associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate including an increased accumulation of pulmonary SCV2-specific CD8+ T cells and anti-CD8 antibody depletion abrogated the N. brasiliensis-mediated reduction in viral loads. Pulmonary macrophages with a type-2 transcriptional signature persist in the lungs of N. brasiliensis exposed mice after clearance of the parasite and establish a primed environment for increased antigen presentation. Accordingly, depletion of macrophages ablated the augmented viral clearance and accumulation of CD8+ T cells driven by prior N. brasiliensis infection. Together, these findings support the concept that lung migrating helminths can limit disease severity during SCV2 infection through macrophage-dependent enhancement of anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/515832v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c17a22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13967b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c723a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5e038_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Omicron variants boast the highest infectivity rates among all SARS-CoV-2 variants. Despite their lower disease severity, they can reinfect COVID-19 patients and infect vaccinated individuals as well. The high number of mutations in these variants render them resistant to antibodies that otherwise neutralize the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Recent research has shown that despite its strong immune evasion, Omicron still induces strong T Cell responses similar to the original variant. This work investigates the molecular basis for this observation using the neural network tools NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCiipan-4.0. The antigens presented through the MHC Class I and Class II pathways from all the notable SARS-CoV-2 variants were compared across numerous high frequency HLAs. All variants were observed to have equivalent T cell antigenicity. A novel positive control system was engineered in the form of spike variants that did evade T Cell responses, unlike Omicron. These evasive spike proteins were used to statistically confirm that the Omicron variants did not exhibit lower antigenicity in the MHC pathways. These results suggest that T Cell immunity mounts a strong defense against COVID-19 which is difficult for SARS-CoV-2 to overcome through mere evolution.\n\nAuthor summary",

    "abstract": "While mRNA vaccines have been effective in combating SARS-CoV-2, waning of vaccine-induced antibody responses and lack of vaccine-induced respiratory tract immunity contribute to ongoing infection and transmission. In this work, we compare and contrast intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of a SARS-CoV-2 self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine delivered by a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). Both i.m. and i.n. vaccines induce potent systemic serum neutralizing antibodies, bone marrow-resident IgG-secreting cells, and robust lymphoid tissue T cell immune responses. The i.n. vaccine additionally induces robust respiratory mucosal immune responses, including SARS-CoV-2-reactive lung-resident memory and lung-homing T cell populations. As a booster following previous i.m. vaccination, the i.n. vaccine also elicits the development of mucosal virus-specific T cells. Both the i.m. and i.n. administered vaccines protect hamsters from infection-associated morbidity upon viral challenge, significantly reducing viral loads and preventing challenged hamsters from transmitting virus to naive cagemates. This saRNA vaccines potent systemic immunogenicity, and additional mucosal immunogenicity when delivered i.n., may be key for combating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIntranasal SARS-CoV-2 saRNA vaccination induces systemic and mucosal immunity in mice, and prevents morbidity and blocks viral transmission in hamsters.",

    "abstract": "Single cell genomics is a powerful tool to distinguish altered cell states in disease tissue samples, through joint analysis with healthy reference datasets. Collections of data from healthy individuals are being integrated in cell atlases that provide a comprehensive view of cellular phenotypes in a tissue. However, it remains unclear whether atlas datasets are suitable references for disease-state identification, or whether matched control samples should be employed, to minimise false discoveries driven by biological and technical confounders. Here we quantitatively compare the use of atlas and control datasets as references for identification of disease-associated cell states, on simulations and real disease scRNA-seq datasets. We find that reliance on a single type of reference dataset introduces false positives. Conversely, using an atlas dataset as reference for latent space learning followed by differential analysis against a matched control dataset leads to precise identification of disease-associated cell states. We show that, when an atlas dataset is available, it is possible to reduce the number of control samples without increasing the rate of false discoveries. Using a cell atlas of blood cells from 12 studies to contextualise data from a case-control COVID-19 cohort, we sensitively detect cell states associated with infection, and distinguish heterogeneous pathological cell states associated with distinct clinical severities. Our analysis provides guiding principles for design of disease cohort studies and efficient use of cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.",

    "abstract": "Twinkle is the ring-shaped replicative helicase within the human mitochondria with high homology to bacteriophage T7 gp4 helicase-primase. Unlike many orthologs of Twinkle, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of human Twinkle has lost its primase activity through evolutionarily acquired mutations. The NTD has demonstrated no observed activity thus far, hence its role has remained unclear. In this study, we have biochemically characterized the isolated NTD and C-terminal domain with linker (CTD) to decipher their contributions to the activities of the full-length (FL) Twinkle. This novel CTD construct hydrolyzes ATP, has weak DNA unwinding activity, and assists Pol{gamma}-catalyzed strand-displacement synthesis on short replication forks. However, CTD fails to promote multi-kilobase length product formation by Pol{gamma} in rolling-circle DNA synthesis. Thus, CTD retains all the motor functions but struggles to implement them for processive translocation. We show that NTD has DNA binding activity, and its presence stabilizes Twinkle oligomerization. The CTD oligomerizes on its own, but loss of NTD results in heterogeneously-sized oligomeric species. The CTD also exhibits weaker and salt-sensitive DNA binding compared to FL Twinkle. Based on these results, we propose that NTD directly contributes to DNA binding and holds the DNA in place behind the central channel of the CTD like a  doorstop, preventing helicase slippages and sustaining processive unwinding. Consistent with this model, mtSSB compensate for the NTD loss and partially restore kilobase length DNA synthesis by CTD and Pol{gamma}. The implications of our studies are foundational for understanding the mechanisms of disease-causing Twinkle mutants that lie in the NTD.",

Interestingly, unusual coupling between the nucleotide- and microtubule-binding sites of this kinesin-6 has been reported but little is known about how its divergent sequence leads to atypical motility properties. We present here the first high-resolution structure of its motor domain that delineates the highly unusual structural features of this motor, including a long L6 insertion that integrates into the core of the motor domain and that drastically affects allostery and ATPase activity. Together with the high-resolution cryo-EM microtubule-bound KIF20A structure that reveal the microtubule-binding interface, we dissect the peculiarities of the KIF20A sequence that work to favor fast dissociation of ADP, particularly in contrast to other kinesins. Structural and functional insights from the KIF20A pre-power stroke conformation thus highlight the role of extended insertions in shaping the motor mechanochemical cycle. Essential for force production and processivity is the length of the neck linker in kinesins. We highlight here the role of the sequence preceding the neck linker in controlling its backward docking and show that a neck linker 4-times longer than kinesin-1 is required for the activity of this motor.",

    "abstract": "NAD is a key component of cellular metabolism and also serves as an alternative 5cap on short noncoding RNAs. The function of NAD in RNA, however, remains poorly understood. We investigated NAD capping of RNAs in HIV-1 infected cells, as HIV-1 is responsible for the depletion of the NAD/NADH cellular pool and causes intracellular pellagra. We used NAD captureSeq on HIV-1 infected/noninfected cells and revealed that four snRNAs (U1, U4ATAC, U5E, and U7) and four snoRNAs (SNORD3G, SNORD102, SNORA50A, and SNORD3B) lost their NAD cap when infected with HIV-1. Here, we provide evidence that the loss of the NAD cap increases the stability of the U1-HIV-1 pre-mRNA duplex. We also show that decreasing the amount of NAD-capped U1 snRNA by overexpressing the NAD RNA decapping enzyme DXO leads to a marked increase in HIV-1 infectivity. Moreover, an experimental increase of NAD capped RNAs improves the efficiency of splicing of HIV-1 and cellular RNAs and lowers HIV-1 infectivity. Our experiments show a dual role of U1 snRNA in HIV-1 infection and present the first clear role of NAD-capped RNAs in eukaryotic antiviral responses with a potential overlap into cellular splicing.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems have the potential to simplify and speed up the expression and high-throughput analysis of complex proteins with functionally relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs). However, low yields and the inability to scale such systems have so far prevented their widespread adoption in protein research and manufacturing.\n\nHere, we present a detailed demonstration for the capabilities of a CFPS system derived from Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 cell culture (BY-2 lysate; BYL). BYL is able to express diverse, functional proteins at high yields in under 48 hours, complete with native disulfide bonds and N-glycosylation. An optimised version of the technology is commercialised as  ALiCE(R), engineered for high yields of up to 3 mg/mL. Recent advances in the scaling of BYL production methodologies have allowed scaling of the CFPS reaction. We show simple, linear scale-up of batch mode reporter proten expression from a 100 L microtiter plate format to 10 mL and 100 mL volumes in standard Erlenmeyer flasks, culminating in preliminary data from 1 L reactions in a CELL-tainer(R) CT20 rocking motion bioreactor. As such, these works represent the first published example of a eukaryotic CFPS reaction scaled past the 10 mL level by several orders of magnitude.\n\nWe show the ability of BYL to produce the simple reporter protein eYFP and large, multimeric virus-like particles directly in the cytosolic fraction. Complex proteins are processed using the native microsomes of BYL and functional expression of multiple classes of complex, difficult-to-express proteins is demonstrated, specifically: a dimeric, glycoprotein enzyme, glucose oxidase; the monoclonal antibody adalimumab; the SARS-Cov-2 receptor-binding domain; human epidermal growth factor; and a G protein-coupled receptor membrane protein, cannabinoid receptor type 2. Functional binding and activity are shown using a combination of surface plasmon resonance techniques, a serology-based ELISA method and a G protein activation assay. Finally, in-depth post-translational modification (PTM) characterisation of purified proteins through disulfide bond and N-glycan analysis is also revealed - previously difficult in the eukaryotic CFPS space due to limitations in reaction volumes and yields.\n\nTaken together, BYL provides a real opportunity for screening of complex proteins at the microscale with subsequent amplification to manufacturing-ready levels using off-the-shelf protocols. This end-to-end platform suggests the potential to significantly reduce cost and the time-to-market for high value proteins and biologics.",

The relationship between CAR structure and Treg function was studied in xenogeneic, immunodeficient mice, revealing advantages of CD28-encoding CARs. However, these models could underrepresent interactions between CAR-Tregs, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and donor-specific antibodies. We generated mouse Tregs expressing HLA-A2-specific CARs with different costimulatory domains and compared their function in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays revealed the CD28-encoding CAR had superior antigen-specific suppression, proliferation and cytokine production. In contrast, in vivo protection from skin allograft rejection and alloantibody production was similar between Tregs expressing CARs encoding CD28, ICOS or PD1, but not GITR, 41BB or OX40, co-stimulatory domains. To reconcile in vitro and in vivo data, we analyzed effects of a CAR encoding CD3{zeta} but no co-stimulatory domain. These data revealed that exogenous co-stimulation via APCs can compensate for the lack of a CAR-encoded CD28 domain. Thus, Tregs expressing a CAR with or without CD28 are functionally equivalent in vivo.

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells have an established role in controlling poxvirus infection and there is a growing interest to exploit their capabilities in the context of poxvirus-based oncolytic therapy and vaccination. How NK cells recognise poxvirus-infected cells to become activated remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the NK cell response to vaccinia virus (VACV) in vivo, using a systemic infection murine model. We found broad alterations in NK cells transcriptional activity in VACV-infected mice, consistent with both direct target cell recognition and cytokine exposure. There were also alterations in the expression levels of specific NK surface receptors (NKRs), including the Ly49 family and SLAM receptors, as well as upregulation of memory-associated NK markers. Despite the latter observation, adoptive transfer of NK memory populations did not confer protection from re-infection. Comparison with the NK cell response to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection highlighted common features, but also distinct NK transcriptional programmes initiated by VACV. Finally, there was a clear overlap between the NK transcriptional response in humans vaccinated with an attenuated VACV, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), demonstrating conservation between the NK response in these different host species. Overall, this study provides new data about NK cell activation, function, and homeostasis during VACV infection, and may have implication for the design of VACV-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Crop breeding has traditionally ignored the plant-associated microbial communities. Consideration of the interactions between plant genotype and associated microbiota is of value since different genotypes of the same crop often harbor distinct microbial communities which can influence the plant phenotype. However, recent studies have reported contrasting results, which led us to hypothesize that the effect of genotype is constrained by time (growth stage, year) and space (plant compartment). To test this hypothesis, we sampled bulk soil, rhizosphere soil and roots of 10 wheat genotypes, twice per year, for 4 years. DNA was extracted and regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA and CPN60 genes and the fungal ITS region were amplified and sequenced. The effect of genotype was highly contingent on the time of sampling and on the plant compartment sampled. Only for a few sampling dates, were the microbial communities significantly different across genotypes. The effect of genotype was most often significant for root microbial communities. The three marker genes used provided a highly coherent picture of the effect of genotype. Taken together, our results confirm that microbial communities in the plant environment strongly vary temporally and spatially and that this can mask the effect of genotype.",

    "abstract": "Corynebacterium bovis (Cb), the etiology of hyperkeratotic dermatitis in various immunocompromised mouse strains, significantly impacts research in which infected mice are used. Although Cb has been isolated from a variety of species, including mice, rats, cows, and humans, little is known about the differences in the infectivity and clinical disease in mice associated with unique isolates. The infectious dose yielding colonization of 50% of the exposed population (ID50) and any associated clinical disease was determined for mouse (n=3), rat (n=1), cow (n=1), and human (n=2) Cb isolates in athymic nude mice (Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu). The same investigations were undertaken comparing 2 of these murine isolates in 2 furred immunocompromised mouse strains (NSG [NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/Sz] and NSG-S [NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1WjlTg(CMV-IL3,CSF2,KITLG)1Eav/MloySzJ]). To determine the ID50, mice (n=6/dose; 3 of each sex) were inoculated topically with 1 to 108 bacteria (10-fold increments) of each Cb isolate. Mice were scored (0 to 5) daily based on the severity of clinical signs for 14 days. On day 7 and 14 post-inoculation (PI), buccal and dorsal skin swabs were evaluated by aerobic culture to determine infection status. The mouse isolates yielded a lower ID50 (58 to 1,000 bacteria) as compared to the bovine (6,460 to 7,498 bacteria) and rat (10,000 bacteria) Cb isolates. Mice were not colonized and disease did not result when inoculated with human isolates. Mouse isolates produced varying clinical disease severity in nude mice (max score/isolate: 0 to 5). Despite significant immunodeficiency, furred NSG and NSG-S mice required a considerably higher (1,000- to 3,000-fold) inoculum to become colonized as compared to athymic nude mice. Once colonized, clinically detectable hyperkeratosis did not develop in these strains until 18 to 22 days PI. In contrast, in athymic nude mice that developed clinically detectable disease, hyperkeratosis was observed 6 to 14 days PI. In conclusion, there are significant differences in Cbs ID50, disease course, and severity between Cb isolates and among immunodeficient mouse strains.",

    "abstract": "The DNA clamp loader is critical to the processivity of the DNA polymerase and coordinating synthesis on the leading and lagging strands. In bacteria the major subunit of the clamp loader, DnaX, has two forms: the essential full-length {tau} and shorter {gamma}. These are conserved across bacterial species and three distinct mechanisms have been found to create them: ribosomal frameshift, transcriptional slippage, and, in Caulobacter crescentus, proteolysis. This conservation suggests that DnaX processing is evolutionarily important, but its role remains unknown.\n\nHere we find a bias against switching from expression of a wild type dnaX to a nonprocessable{tau} -only allele in Caulobacter. Despite this bias, cells are able to adapt to the{tau} -only allele with little effect on growth or morphology and only minor defects during DNA damage. Motivated by transposon sequencing, we find that loss of the gene sidA in the{tau} -only strain slows growth and increases filamentation. Even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage treatment, the{Delta} sidA {tau}-only double mutant shows induction of and dependance on recA, likely due to a defect in resolution of DNA replication fork stalling. We find that some of the phenotypes of the{Delta} sidA {tau}-only can be complemented by expression of {gamma} but that an overabundance of {tau}-only dnaX is also detrimental. The data presented here suggest that DnaX processing is important during resolution of replication fork stalling events during DNA replication stress.\n\nIMPORTANCEThough the presence of DnaX {tau} and {gamma} forms is conserved across bacteria, different species have developed different mechanisms to make these forms. This conservation and independent evolution of mechanisms suggest that having two forms of DnaX is important. Despite having been discovered more than 30 years ago, the purpose of expressing both {tau} and {gamma} is still unclear. Here, we present evidence that expressing two forms of DnaX and controlling the abundance and/or ratio of the forms is important during the resolution of replication fork stalling.",

    "abstract": "One quarter of the Northern hemisphere is underlain by permanently frozen ground, referred to as permafrost. Due to climate warming, irreversibly thawing permafrost is releasing organic matter frozen for up to a million years, most of which decomposes into carbon dioxide and methane, further enhancing the greenhouse effect. Part of this organic matter also consists of revived cellular microbes (prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes) as well as viruses that remained dormant since prehistorical times. While the literature abounds on descriptions of the rich and diverse prokaryotic microbiomes found in permafrost, no additional report about \"live\" viruses have been published since the two original studies describing pithovirus (in 2014) and mollivirus (in 2015). This wrongly suggests that such occurrences are rare and that \"zombie viruses\" are not a public health threat. To restore an appreciation closer to reality, we report the preliminary characterizations of 13 new viruses isolated from 7 different ancient Siberian permafrost samples, 1 from the Lena river and 1 from Kamchatka cryosol. As expected from the host specificity imposed by our protocol, these viruses belong to 5 different clades infecting Acanthamoeba spp. but not previously revived from permafrost: Pandoravirus, Cedratvirus, Megavirus, and Pacmanvirus, in addition to a new Pithovirus strain.",

    "abstract": "Application of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNMs) to the soil-plant system can affect plant physiology, with positive results ranging from enhanced seed germination and root system development to improved stress tolerance. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Plant rhizosphere microbiomes at the soil-root interface are strongly influenced by the host plant and play a key role in the plant hosts development and health. Yet few studies have characterized changes in plant rhizosphere microbiomes following applications of CNMs to the soil-plant system. Here we investigated the effects of multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene on microbial communities in the ectorhizosphere of tomato plants versus surrounding bulk soil. Pot experiments were conducted where tomato plants were exposed to CNT or graphene at 200 mg/kg soil for four weeks. Ectorhizosphere and bulk soils were then collected and analyzed for physicochemical properties and microbiome structure and function. While graphene had a limited impact on the tomato rhizosphere microbiome, CNT significantly increased microbial alpha diversity, induced greater divergence of beta diversity, enhanced microbial interactions, and potentially impacted community functions such as aromatic compound degradation, antioxidant synthesis, and redox cofactor biosynthesis. Furthermore, CNT induced stronger and/or unique microbiome alterations in the tomato rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. Our findings reveal the differential modulating effects of two widely-used CNMs on plant rhizosphere microbiomes and highlight an imminent need to understand complex plant root-microbe interplays in the CNM-impacted rhizosphere. These results have implication for realizing the full potential of phytoapplication of CNMs toward improved and sustainable plant production.",

    "abstract": "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the pandemic disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 vaccines were developed at record speed and were authorized approximately a year after the original outbreak. This fast response saved the lives of countless individuals and reduced the disease burden of many more. The experience has served as a reminder of the necessity to implement solid vaccine development platforms and fast production pipelines. Manufacturing vaccines for enveloped viruses, including some SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, often relies on the production of large quantities of viruses in vitro. Thus, speeding up or increasing virus production would expedite vaccine development. With this objective in mind, we established a high throughput screening (HTS) to identify small molecules that enhance or speed up host-virus membrane fusion. Among the HTS hits, we identified that ethynylestradiol augments SARS-CoV-2 fusion activity in both the absence and presence of TMPRSS2. Furthermore, we confirmed that ethynylestradiol can boost the growth of not only SARS-CoV-2 but also Influenza A virus in vitro. A small molecule with these characteristics could be implemented to improve vaccines production.\n\nImportanceThe (COVID-19) pandemic had a tremendous impact on our healthcare systems and the global economy. The rapid development of effective vaccines saved the lives of countless individuals and reduced the disease burden of many more.

    "abstract": "ApoL6 is a new LD-associated protein containing an apoprotein-like domain, expressed mainly in adipose tissue, specifically in adipocytes. ApoL6 expression is low in fasting but induced upon feeding. ApoL6 knockdown results in smaller LD with lower triglyceride (TAG) content in adipocytes, while ApoL6 overexpression causes larger LD with higher TAG content. We show that ApoL6 effect in adipocytes is by inhibition of lipolysis. While ApoL6, Perilipin 1 (Plin1) and HSL can form a complex on LD, C-terminal domain of ApoL6 directly interacts with Plin1, to compete with Plin1 binding to HSL through Plin1 N-terminal domain, thereby keeping HSL in a \"stand by\" status. Thus, ApoL6 ablation decreases WAT mass, protecting mice from diet-induced obesity, while adipose overexpression increases WAT mass to bring obesity and insulin resistance with hepatosteatosis, making ApoL6 a potential future target against obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients harbouring certain chromosome abnormalities have particularly adverse prognosis. For these patients, targeted therapies have not yet made a significant clinical impact. To understand the molecular landscape of poor prognosis AML we profiled 74 patients from two different centres (in UK and Finland) at the proteomic, phosphoproteomic and drug response phenotypic levels. These data were complemented with transcriptomics analysis for 39 cases. Data integration highlighted a phosphoproteomics signature that define two biologically distinct groups of KMT2A rearranged leukaemia, which we term MLLGA and MLLGB. MLLGA presented increased DOT1L phosphorylation, HOXA gene expression, CDK1 activity and phosphorylation of proteins involved in RNA metabolism, replication and DNA damage when compared to MLLGB and no KMT2A rearranged samples. MLLGA was particularly sensitive to 15 compounds including genotoxic drugs and inhibitors of mitotic kinases and inosine-5-monosphosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) relative to other cases. Intermediate-risk KMT2A-MLLT3 cases were mainly represented in a third group closer to MLLGA than to MLLGB. The expression of IMPDH2 and multiple nucleolar proteins was higher in MLLGA and correlated with the response to IMPDH inhibition in KMT2A rearranged leukaemia, suggesting a role of the nucleolar activity in sensitivity to treatment. In summary, our multilayer molecular profiling of AML with poor prognosis and KMT2A-MLLT3 karyotypes identified a phosphoproteomics signature that defines two biologically and phenotypically distinct groups of KMT2A rearranged leukaemia. These data provide a rationale for the potential development of specific therapies for AML patients characterised by the MLLGA phosphoproteomics signature identified in this study.",

    "abstract": "Of the various conjugation strategies for cellular biomolecules, Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) is the preferred click chemistry approach due to its fast reaction rate and the commercial availability of a wide range of conjugates. While extracellular labeling of biomolecules using CuAAC has been widely adopted, intracellular labeling in live cells has been challenging; the high copper concentration required for CuAAC reaction can be toxic to biological systems. As a critical first step towards achieving intracellular labeling with CuAAC, an ultrasensitive CuAAC ligand is needed to reduce the required copper concentration while maintaining fast reaction kinetics. Here, we develop a new DNA oligomer-conjugated CuAAC ligand for click reaction biomolecular labeling. The DNA oligo attachment serves several purposes: 1. Increases availability of local copper atoms in proximity to the ligand, which drives up reaction rates, 2. Enables the ligation of azide tags with up to 10-fold lower copper concentrations as compared to commercially available CuAAC ligands, 3. Allows nucleic acid template-driven proximity ligation through the choice of the attached DNA sequence and 4. Allows the CuAAC ligand and copper to traverse the cell and nuclear membrane. We demonstrate that this ligand enhances the intracellular 5-ethynyl uridine labeling of nascent RNAs using fluorogenic dyes. We also show that our DNA-enhanced CuAAC ligand enables the ligation of fluorogenic dyes to label both sialylated glycans on the surface on live cells as well as the live-cell intracellular labeling of nascent RNAs. This new ligand advances our efforts toward the final goal of applying CuAAC for live-cell applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPostresectional liver failure (PLF) is a dreaded complication after partial hepatectomy (PH). Data from animal experiments indicate that endogenous ligands (i.e. bile salts) can stimulate liver regeneration and prevent liver injury after PH, via hepatic Fxr and the ileal Fxr-Fgf15 axis.\n\nAimTo investigate whether exogenous activation of the Fxr pathway with the semi-synthetic bile acid derivative obeticholic acid (OCA) could stimulate postresectional liver regeneration in mice.\n\nMethodsTwelve weeks old male C57BL6/J mice were pre-treated with OCA (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle, and after 7 days subjected to 70% PH. Mice were sacrificed at 24, 48 and 72 hrs after PH, and liver injury, secretory function, and regenerative indices were assessed. In a second study, OCA pre-treated mice received oral sucrose supplementation in the postoperative trajectory, and a group of mice receiving intraperitoneal injection of FGF19 was included as a positive control group. Here, mice were sacrificed at 48 hours after PH.\n\nResultsNo effect could be detected on liver mass recovery after PH, although responses of Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1 and other Fxr target genes implied general effectiveness of OCA treatment. OCA had no consistent effects on the number of Ki-67+ hepatocytes and mitotic figures around the peak of proliferation (i.e. 48 hrs) after PH, having no effect or increasing these regenerative indices in the consecutive experiments. Hepatic bile salt content, an important determinant of PH-induced liver regeneration, at this time point was not affected by OCA. After pretreatment of mice with FGF19, a reduced expression of ileal bile salt-regulated genes Fgf15 and Slc51b indicating FGF19-mediated repression of bile salt synthesis was seen, but this did not stimulate postresectional liver regeneration in mice.\n\nConclusionDespite the activation of hepatic and ileal Fxr as shown by induction of target genes, treatment with OCA or FGF19 did not result in accelerated liver regeneration after PH and liver bile salt content was not influenced. We speculate that bile salt homeostasis and endogenous bile salt signaling is already optimal in unaffected livers for proper progression of regeneration after PH. It will be interesting to study the effects of Fxr agonism on liver regeneration after PH, and prevention of PLF in the context of compromised bile salt homeostasis/signaling prior to PH.",

    "abstract": "During autophagy, rapid membrane assembly expands small phagophores into large double-membrane autophagosomes. Theoretical modelling predicts the majority of autophagosomal phospholipids is derived from highly efficient non-vesicular phospholipid transfer (PLT) across phagophore-ER contacts (PERCS). Currently, the phagophore-ER tether Atg2 is the only PLT protein known to drive phagophore expansion in vivo. Here, our quantitative live-cell-imaging analysis reveals poor correlation between duration and size of forming autophagosomes and number of Atg2 molecules at PERCS of starving yeast cells. Strikingly, we find Atg2-mediated PLT is non-rate-limiting for autophagosome biogenesis, because membrane tether and PLT protein Vps13 localizes to the rim and promotes expansion of phagophores in parallel with Atg2. In the absence of Vps13, the number of Atg2 molecules at PERCS determines duration and size of forming autophagosomes with an apparent in vivo transfer rate of ~200 phospholipids per Atg2 molecule and second. We propose conserved PLT proteins cooperate in channeling phospholipids across organelle contact sites for non-rate-limiting membrane assembly during autophagosome biogenesis.",

Post-operative hyperbilirubinemia suggests that impaired hepatobiliary transport with intrahepatic accumulation of harmful cholephiles plays an etiological role. Bile salts serve dual roles as signaling molecules engaged in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) and biological detergents.\n\nAimIn this study we tested the hypothesis that excessive accumulation of bile salts in the regenerating liver results in PLF.\n\nMethodsTwelve weeks old male C57BL6/J mice were subjected to 70% PH and post-operatively challenged with a diet supplemented with cholic acid (CA, 0.5 or 1.0%; n=5-6 per group) or a control diet. After 48 hours mice were sacrificed, and liver injury, secretory function, and regenerative indices were assessed.\n\nResultsMice fed a 1.0% CA diet displayed more pronounced weight loss following PH and had a deranged post-operative glucose course. Liver injury (aminotransferase elevations) and impaired hepatobiliary transport function (hyperbilirubinemia) were apparent in the group fed a 1.0% CA diet, but not in animals fed a 0.5% CA diet. No differences in liver mass recovery were observed among groups. However, the percentage of hepatocytes staining positive for the proliferation marker Ki-67 were reduced in mice receiving a 1.0% CA diet relative to animals fed a 0.5% CA diet.

A longer duration of the dietary challenge and/or secondary hits may further improve the model. Once validated, it can be used to evaluate pharmaceutical strategies to prevent or treat PLF.",

    "abstract": "In female mice the gene dosage from X chromosomes is adjusted by a process called X chromosome inactivation (XCI) that occurs in two steps. An imprinted form of XCI (iXCI) silencing the paternally inherited X chromosome (Xp) is initiated at the 2-4 cell stages. As extraembryonic cells including trophoblasts keep the Xp silenced, epiblast cells that give rise to the embryo proper reactivate the Xp and undergo a random form of XCI (rXCI) during peri-implantation stages. Lack of X dosage compensation leads to peri-implantation lethality due to inhibition of trophoblast stem cells. However, as the epiblast regulates the trophoblast lineage, the roles of iXCI vs rXCI in the early lethal phenotype remains unclear. We have investigated functions and expression of Rlim (Rnf12), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and its target protein Rex1 (Zfp42) that control iXCI. Consistent with functions specifically for iXCI, we show an inverse correlation in the expression of Rlim and Rex1 throughout pre-implantation development, but an Rlim-independent downregulation of Rex1 in epiblast cells upon implantation. Moreover, disturbing the functional Rlim-Rex1 dynamics in females leads to cell fate confusion and premature differentiation specifically of the polar trophoblast stem cell pool. Thus, controlled by the Rlim-Rex1 axis, female mouse development requires iXCI in the polar trophoblast cell lineage.",

    "abstract": "In flowering plants, jasmonic acid (JA) signalling regulates the complex process of male gametophyte development. JA signalling initiates with the activation of MYC2 transcription factor, for the expression of several JA responsive genes throughout stamen development and pollen maturation. However, the regulation of JA signalling during different developmental stages of male gametophytes is still less understood. In this study we have characterized T-DNA insertion line of AtHMGB15. Phenotypic characterization of athmgb15-4 mutant plants showed delayed bolting, shorter siliques and reduced seed set compared to wildtype. Moreover, deletion of AtHMGB15 resulted in defective pollen morphology, delayed pollen germination, abberant pollen tube growth and a higher percentage of non-viable pollen population in athmgb15-4 compared to wildtype. Molecular analysis indicated down-regulation of JA-biosynthesis and JA-signalling genes viz MYC2, MYB21 and MYB24 in athmgb15-4 mutant. Furthermore, jasmonic acid and its derivatives were found almost ten-fold lower in athmgb15-4 flowers. However, exogenous application of jasmonate could restore pollen morphology and pollen germination, suggesting that impaired JA signalling is responsible for the pollen phenotype in athmgb15 mutant. AtHMGB15 physically interacts with MYC2 protein to form the transcription activation complex for promoting transcription of genes responsible for JA signalling during stamen and pollen development. Collectively, our findings indicate that AtHMGB15, a plant specific DNA binding protein of the ARID-HMG group, acts as a positive regulator of JA signalling to control the spatiotemporal expression of key regulators responsible for stamen and pollen development.",

    "abstract": "How various factors, including demography, recombination or genome duplication, may impact the efficacy of natural selection and the burden of deleterious mutations,is a central question in evolutionary biology and genetics. In this study, we show that key evolutionary processes, including variations in i) effective population size (Ne) ii) recombination rates and iii) chromosome inheritance, have influenced the genetic load and efficacy of selection in Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), a widely distributed salmonid species on the west coast of North America. Using whole genome resequencing data from 14 populations at different migratory distances from their southern glacial refugium, we found evidence supporting gene surfing, wherein reduced Ne at the postglacial recolonization front, leads to a decrease in the efficacy of selection and a surf of deleterious alleles in the northernmost populations. Furthermore, our results indicate that recombination rates play a prime role in shaping the load along the genome. Additionally, we identified variation in polyploidy as a contributing factor to within-genome variation of the load. Overall, our results align remarkably well with expectations under the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. We discuss the fundamental and applied implications of these findings for evolutionary and conservation genomics.\n\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding how historical processes, such as past glaciations, may have impacted variations in population size and genetic diversity along the genome is a fundamental question in evolution. In this study, we investigated how recent postglacial demographic expansion has affected the distribution of deleterious genetic variants and the resulting deleterious mutation load in Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), throughout its native range in North America. By sequencing the entire genome of 71 Coho salmon, we reveal that postglacial expansion has led to allele surfing, a process where alleles increase in frequency in populations that are expanding or colonizing new environments. Here, allele surfing resulted in an increased deleterious mutation load at the colonization front. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the efficacy of natural selection scales with variation in effective population size among populations. We showed that the specific genomic features of Coho salmon, namely variation in local recombination rate and variation in chromosomal inheritance, strongly impacted the segregation of deleterious mutations.",

    "abstract": "CLL-1 has been revealed its potential role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. CRISPR/Cas9 strategy was employed to knock out CLL-1 gene in U937 cells and western-blot was used to validate the success of knock out. CCK8 and Transwell assays were used to detect cells viability and migration, respectively. RNA-sequencing was performed to profile mRNA expression in CLL-1 gene knock-out and wide type U937 cells. A cutoff of 1.5-fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were presented by volcano plots and hierarchical cluster heatmap. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by String database and Cytoscape software. Furthermore, hub genes were mined by CytoNCA and MCODE, which were subjected to functional enrichment using R package. Finally, the findings were validated using qRT-PCR and western-blot. The protein level of CLL-1 was significantly lowered, and cell viability and migration were suppressed in knock-out cells compared to wide type. Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, 452 DEGs (179 up-regulated and 273 down-regulated) were obtained, and several important hub genes (such as CCR2, FBXO21, UBB and UBE2C) were filtered out, which were enriched in 132 GO terms and 36 KEGG pathways such as chemokine signaling pathway and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. A total of 8 representative genes mRNA expressions were validated by qRT-PCR, and the protein levels of 6 genes were confirmed by western-blot. CLL-1 gene might exert its role in AML through modulating genes enriched in multiple functions such as chemokine signaling and ubiquitination. Our results may give us new knowledge of CLL-1 in AML and provide a basis for mining novel targets.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, the causative agent of avian chlamydiosis and human psittacosis, is a genetically heterogeneous species. Its broad host range includes parrots and many other birds, but occasionally also humans (via zoonotic transmission), ruminants, horses, swine and rodents. To assess whether there are genetic markers associated with host tropism we comparatively analyzed whole-genome sequences of 61 C. psittaci strains. Initially, poorly assembled genomes in public databases were subjected to clean-up, reassembly and polishing. Multiple sequence alignment of the genome sequences revealed four major clades within this species. Clade 1 represents the most recent lineage comprising 40/61 strains and contains 9/10 of the psittacine strains, including type strain 6BC, and 10/13 of human isolates. Clades 2-4 carry strains from different non-psittacine hosts. We found that clade membership correlates with classification schemes based on SNP types, ompA genotypes, multilocus sequence types as well as plasticity zone (PZ) structure and host preference. Genome analysis also revealed that i) sequence variation in the major outer membrane porin OmpA can result in 3D structural changes of immunogenic domains, ii) past host change of Clade 3 and 4 strains could be associated with loss of MAC/perforin in the PZ, rather than the large cytotoxin, iii) the distinct phylogeny of atypical strains (Clades 3 and 4) is also reflected in their repertoire of inclusion proteins (Inc family) and polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmps). Altogether, our study identified a number of genomic features that can be correlated with the phylogeny and host preference of C. psittaci strains.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that three-dimensional architecture of bacterial chromatin plays an important role in gene expression regulation. However, genome topological organization in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the etiologic agent of tuberculosis, remains unknown. On the other hand, exact mechanism of differential pathogenesis in the canonical strains of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and H37Ra remains poorly understood in terms of their raw sequences. In this context, a detailed contact map from a Hi-C experiment is a candidate for what bridges the gap. Here we present the first comprehensive report on genome-wide contact maps between regions of H37Rv and H37Ra genomes. We tracked differences between the genome architectures of H37Rv and H37Ra, which could possibly explain the virulence attenuation in H37Ra. We confirm the existence of a differential organization between the two strains most significantly a higher Chromosome Interacting Domain (CID) size in attenuated H37Ra strain. CID boundaries are also found enriched with highly expressed genes and with higher operon density in H37Rv. Furthermore, most of the differentially expressed PE/PPE genes were present near the CID boundaries in H37Rv and not in H37Ra. Collectively our study proposes a differential genomic topological pattern between H37Rv and H37Ra, which could explain the virulence attenuation in H37Ra.",

As a graph-based clustering method, CosTaL transforms the cells with high-dimensional features into a weighted k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph. The cells are represented by the vertices of the graph, while an edge between two vertices in the graph represents the close relatedness between the two similar cells. Specifically, CosTaL builds an exact kNN graph using cosine similarity and uses the Tanimoto coefficient as the refining strategy to re-weight the edges in order to improve the effectiveness of clustering. We demonstrate that CosTaL generally achieves equivalent or higher effectiveness scores on seven benchmark cytometry datasets and six single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets using six different evaluation metrics, compared with other state-of-the-art graph-based clustering methods, including PhenoGraph, Scanpy, and PARC. CosTaL is also the most efficient algorithm on large datasets, suggesting that CosTaL generally has better scalability than the other methods, which is beneficial for large-scale analysis.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of an organism to metabolic challenges requires mechanisms coupling metabolism to gene expression. Acylations of metabolic and histone proteins acquire significant attention in this regard. We hypothesize that adaptive response to inhibition of a key metabolic process, catalyzed by the acetyl-CoA-generating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, may be mediated by changed protein acylations. The hypothesis is tested by intranasal administration to animals of PDH-specific inhibitors acetylmethylphosphinate (AcMeP) or methyl ester of acetylphosphonate (AcPMe), followed by assessment of physiological parameters, brain protein acylation system and expression/phosphorylation of PDHA subunit. At a fixed dose, AcMeP, but not AcPMe, decreases acetylation and increases succinylation of the brain proteins of apparent molecular mass of 15-20 kDa. Regarding the 30-50 kDa proteins, a strong inhibitor AcMeP affects acetylation only, while a less efficient AcPMe mostly increases succinylation. No increase in the succinylation of the 30-50 kDa proteins by AcMeP coincides with its induction of desuccinylase SIRT5, not observed in the AcPMe-treated animals. The brain PDHA expression or phosphorylation, the animal behavior or ECG do not significantly differ between the studied animal groups. The data indicate that a short-term inhibition of the brain PDH affects acetylation and/or succinylation of the brain proteins, dependent on the inhibitor potency, protein molecular mass and acylation type. Homeostatic nature of these changes is implied by stability of physiological parameters after the PDH inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel NaV1.7 has been identified as a potential novel pain target due to its striking human genetics. However, clinically available drugs (e.g. lidocaine, carbamazepine, etc.) are not selective among the nine NaV channel subtypes, NaV1.1-NaV1.9, and the two currently known classes of NaV1.7 subtype-selective inhibitors (aryl- and acylsulfonamides) have undesirable characteristics that may limit their development. Moreover, understanding of the structure-activity relationships of the acylsulfonamide class of NaV1.7 inhibitors, exemplified by the clinical development candidate GDC-0310, has been based solely on a single co-crystal structure of an arylsulfonamide inhibitor series. To advance inhibitor design targeting the NaV1.7 channel, we established an iterative system to routinely obtain high-resolution ligand-bound NaV1.7 structures using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We report that GDC-0310 engages the NaV1.7 voltage-sensing domain 4 (VSD4) through an unexpected binding mode orthogonal to the arylsulfonamide class binding pose, which identifies a previously unknown ligand binding site in NaV channels. This finding enabled the design of a novel hybrid inhibitor series that bridges the aryl and acylsulfonamide binding pockets and allows for the generation of molecules with substantially differentiated structures and properties. Overall, this study highlights the power of cryo-EM methods to pursue challenging drug targets using iterative and high-resolution structure-guided inhibitor design. It also underscores an important role of the membrane bilayer in the discovery of selective NaV channel modulators.",

    "abstract": "TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is involved in key processes in RNA metabolism such as splicing, stability and transcription. TDP-43 dysfunction is frequently implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). The prion-like, disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of TDP-43 is aggregation-prone and harbors the majority (~90%) of all ALS-related mutations. Recent studies have established that TDP-43 CTD can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in isolation and is important for phase separation (PS) of the full-length protein under physiological conditions. While a short conserved helical region (CR, spanning residues 319-341) promotes oligomerization and is essential for LLPS, aromatic residues in the flanking disordered regions (IDR1/2) have also been found to play a critical role in PS and aggregation. However, TDP-43 CTD has a distinct sequence composition compared with other phase separating proteins, including many aliphatic residues. These residues have been suggested to modulate the apparent viscosity of the resulting phases, but their direct contribution to phase separation has been relatively ignored. Here, we utilized a multiscale simulation and experimental approach to assess the residue-level determinants of TDP-43 CTD phase separation. Single chain and condensed phase simulations performed at the atomistic and coarse-grained level respectively, identified the importance of aromatic residues (previously established) while also suggesting an essential role for aliphatic methionine residues in LLPS. In vitro experiments confirmed the role of phenylalanine, methionine, and leucine (but not alanine) residues in driving the phase separation of CTD, which have not been previously considered essential for describing the molecular grammar of PS. Finally, NMR experiments also showed that phenylalanine residues in the disordered flanking regions and methionine residues both within and outside the CR contribute important contacts to CTD interactions. Broadly, our work highlights the importance of non-alanine aliphatic residues such as methionine and leucine, and potentially valine and isoleucine, in determining the LLPS propensity, expanding the molecular grammar of protein phase separation to include critical contributions from aliphatic residues.",

Here, we revealed extensive and large-scale metabolic reprogramming events in a SETD2-deficient ccRCC mouse model by performing a multi-omics study comprising transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and metabolic mass spectrometry imaging approaches. Our data unveiled dramatic alteration of fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), carbohydrate digestion and absorption, protein digestion and absorption and biosynthesis of amino acids, which eventually led to dysregulated sphingomyelin metabolism-related metabolic pathways. Clinically, we discovered that TCA and amino acid metabolism are positively associated with SETD2, while glycolysis, protein catabolic and lipids biosynthesis are negatively associated with SETD2. Mass spectrometry imaging of clinical ccRCC tissues revealed that SETD2 mutation is associated with upregulated sphingomyelin biosynthesis in human ccRCC.

We here report a complementary view on why and how brain activity relates to memory, indicating a functional role of cortico-ocular interactions for episodic memory formation. Recording simultaneous magnetoencephalography and eye tracking in 35 human participants, we demonstrate that gaze variability and amplitude modulations of alpha/beta oscillations (10-20 Hz) in visual cortex covary and predict subsequent memory performance between and within participants. Amplitude variation during pre-stimulus baseline was associated with gaze direction variability, echoing the co-variation observed during scene encoding. We conclude that encoding of visual information engages unison coupling between oculomotor and visual areas in the service of memory formation.",

    "abstract": "In expert readers, a brain region known as the visual word form area (VWFA) is highly sensitive to written words, exhibiting a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing sensitivity to orthographic stimuli whose statistics match those of real words. Using high-resolution 7T fMRI, we ask whether, in bilingual readers, distinct cortical patches specialize for different languages. In 21 English-French bilinguals, unsmoothed 1.2 mm fMRI revealed that the VWFA is actually composed of several small cortical patches highly selective for reading, with a posterior-to-anterior word similarity gradient, but with near-complete overlap between the two languages. In 10 English-Chinese bilinguals, however, while most word-specific patches exhibited similar reading specificity and word-similarity gradients for reading in Chinese and English, additional patches responded specifically to Chinese writing and, surprisingly, to faces. Our results show that the acquisition of multiple writing systems can indeed tune the visual cortex differently in bilinguals, sometimes leading to the emergence of cortical patches specialized for a single language.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide expansion of mosquito-borne pathogens necessitates improved control measures, including approaches to restrict infection and transmission by mosquito vectors. Reducing transmission is challenging because determinants of vector competence for viruses like Zika (ZIKV) are poorly understood. Our previous work established that Aedes (Ae.) aegypti larvae reared in environmental water containing microbes are less susceptible to ZIKV as adults compared to cohorts reared in laboratory tap water with fewer species and lower abundance of microbes. Here, we identify a process by which environment-derived microbes reduce susceptibility of Ae. aegypti for ZIKV. Provided that the midgut represents the first barrier to mosquito infection, we hypothesized that microbial exposure modulates midgut infection by ZIKV. Since mosquitoes live in water as larvae and pupae and then transition to air as adults, we also define the stage in the life of a mosquito when microbial exposure reduces ZIKV susceptibility. Ae. aegypti larvae were reared in water containing microbes and then treated with antibiotics during the pupal and adult stages, adult stage only, or provided no antibiotics at any stage. Vector competence was next evaluated in mosquitoes that ingested ZIKV-spiked bloodmeals. Antibiotic treated mosquitoes with reduced microbiota showed enhanced ZIKV infection rates in Ae. aegypti treated as both pupae and adults. Antibiotic treatment to reduce microbes in pupal and adult mosquitoes also resulted in increased midgut epithelium permeability, higher numbers of ZIKV-infected midgut cells, and impaired bloodmeal digestion. Parallel control experiments with antibiotic-treated or gnotobiotic mosquitoes reared in laboratory water showed that the dysbiotic state created by antibiotic use does not influence ZIKV vector competence or midgut permeability and that more than the single bacterial species in gnotobiotic mosquitoes is responsible for reducing ZIKV vector competence. Ae. aegypti with depleted microbes via antibiotic treatment as pupae and adults that ingested ZIKV in bloodmeals showed reduced expression of genes associated with bloodmeal digestion and metabolism relative to mosquitoes whose microbes were not reduced with antibiotics. Together, these data show that exposure to microbes throughout the life of Ae. aegypti restricts ZIKV infection by facilitating blood digestion and reducing midgut cell infection. Understanding the connections between mosquito microbiota, midgut physiology, and arbovirus susceptibility can lead to novel approaches to decrease mosquito transmission and will improve understanding of vector competence in environmental habitats containing microbes.\n\nAuthor SummaryMosquito-transmitted viruses like Zika continue to threaten human health. Absent vaccines or treatments, controlling mosquitoes or limiting their ability to transmit viruses represents a primary way to prevent mosquito-borne viral diseases. The role mosquito microbiota play in shaping transmission of Zika virus has been limited to association-based studies. Our prior work showed that Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae that develop in water containing bacteria are less susceptible to Zika virus compared to larvae reared in laboratory tap water with fewer numbers and species of bacteria. Here we identify a process that explains this association. Since mosquitoes are aquatic as larvae and pupae and terrestrial as adults, we also define the life stage when microbes need be present to reduce Zika virus susceptibility. We used antibiotics to reduce environmental water-derived microbes at pupal and adult or only adult stages and observed that microbe depletion via antibiotic treatment increases Zika virus infection and midgut permeability and impairs bloodmeal digestion. These data show that microbial exposure throughout the life of a mosquito restricts Zika virus infection by facilitating blood digestion and restricting midgut cell infection. These findings advance understanding of microbiota-mosquito-virus interactions by defining how microbes reduce susceptibility of Aedes aegypti to Zika virus.",

    "abstract": "Leguminous plants have established a mutualistic endosymbiotic interaction with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia to secure nitrogen sources in new specialized organs called root nodules. Before nodule formation, the development of early symbiotic structures is essential for rhizobia docking, internalization, targeted delivery, and intracellular accommodation. We have recently reported that overexpression of stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (SIMK) in alfalfa affects root hair, nodule and shoot formation. However, detailed subcellular spatial distribution, activation, and developmental relocation of SIMK during the early stages of alfalfa nodulation remain unclear. Here, we qualitatively and quantitatively characterized SIMK distribution patterns in rhizobium-infected root hairs using live-cell imaging and immunolocalization, employing alfalfa stable transgenic lines with genetically manipulated SIMK abundance and kinase activity. In the SIMKK-RNAi line, showing downregulation of SIMKK and SIMK, we found a considerably decreased accumulation of phosphorylated SIMK around infection pockets and infection threads, which was strongly increased in the GFP-SIMK line, constitutively overexpressing GFP-tagged SIMK. Thus, genetically manipulated SIMK modulates root hair capacity to form infection pockets and infection threads. These results shed new light on SIMK spatio-temporal participation in the early interactions between alfalfa and rhizobia, and its internalization into root hairs, showing that local accumulation of active SIMK indeed modulates nodulation in alfalfa.\n\nOne sentence summaryGenetic manipulation of SIMK in alfalfa revealed that SIMK modulates root hair capacity to form infection pockets and infection threads during the early interactions between alfalfa and rhizobia.",

    "abstract": "Sensory systems appear to learn to transform incoming sensory information into perceptual representations, or \"objects\", that can inform and guide behavior with minimal explicit supervision. Here, we propose that the auditory system can achieve this goal by using time as a supervisor, i.e., by learning features of a stimulus that are temporally regular. We will show that this procedure generates a feature space sufficient to support fundamental computations of auditory perception. In detail, we consider the problem of discriminating between instances of a prototypical class of natural auditory objects, i.e., rhesus macaque vocalizations. We test discrimination in two ethologically relevant tasks: discrimination in a cluttered acoustic background and generalization to discriminate between novel exemplars. We show that an algorithm that learns these temporally regular features affords better or equivalent discrimination and generalization than conventional feature-selection algorithms, i.e., principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Our findings suggest that the slow temporal features of auditory stimuli may be sufficient for parsing auditory scenes and that the auditory brain could utilize these slowly changing temporal features.",

    "abstract": "Natural sounds, such as speech, are complex time-varying waveforms containing information critical to how we communicate with each other and navigate the external world. Hearing loss results in a breakdown of this information and causes distortions in the neural code. As a result, perception of complex sounds such as speech is compromised. This problem is further complicated by the fact that sound intensity varies in natural settings, both in quiet and in noisy backgrounds. Somewhat paradoxically, despite increased audibility at high sound intensities, perception and discrimination of speech is actually diminished, especially in the presence of background noise. This phenomenon is known as rollover of speech and its neural basis is poorly understood in both normal-hearing listeners and hearing-impaired listeners. Here we performed in-vivo electrophysiology in awake and anaesthetized Mongolian gerbils (Meriones Unguiculatus) to investigate how hearing loss affects the neural encoding of speech. We presented 22 Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) syllables to the gerbil and recorded neural responses from the inferior colliculus (IC). We used a k-nearest neighbor neural classifier to investigate whether IC neurons could discriminate between different consonants in normal hearing (NH) and noise-exposed hearing-loss (HL) animals. We found that neural correlates of perceptual rollover were present in the IC and that performance in discrimination decreased when VCVs were presented in background noise when compared to in quiet. Furthermore, we found that forward masking played a prominent role in shaping neural responses and discrimination between various consonants in NH and HL animals. These results suggest there is a critical trade-off in listening between audibility and rollover mediated by temporal masking.",
