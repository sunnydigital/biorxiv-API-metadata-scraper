    "abstract": "Hippocampal place cells in freely moving rodents display both theta phase precession and procession, which is thought to play important roles in cognition, but the neural mechanism for producing theta phase shift remains largely unknown. Here we show that firing rate adaptation within a continuous attractor neural network causes the neural activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling theta sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. These forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. By tuning the adaptation strength, our model explains the difference between \"bimodal cells\" showing interleaved phase precession and procession, and \"unimodal cells\" in which phase precession predominates. Our model also explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. We hope that this study will aid an understanding of the neural mechanism supporting theta phase coding in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Originating from a series of morphometric studies conducted in the 1980s, it appears a widely held belief in cognitive neuroscience that the corpus callosum is larger in non-right handers than in right handers (RH). However, a recent meta-analysis challenges this belief by not finding significant differences in corpus callosum size between handedness groups. Yet, relying on the available published data, the meta-analysis was not able to account for a series of factors potential influencing its outcome, such as confounding effects of brain size differences and a restricted spatial resolution of previous callosal segmentation strategies. To address these remaining questions, we here analysed the midsagittal corpus callosum of N = 1057 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Young Adults) to compare handedness groups based on consistency (e.g., consistent RH vs. mixed handers, MH) and direction of hand preference (e.g., RH vs. left handers). A possible relevance of brain-size differences was addressed by analysing callosal variability by both using forebrain volume (FBV) as covariate and utilising relative area (callosal area/thickness divided by FBV) as dependent variable. Callosal thickness was analysed at 100 measuring points along the structure to achieve high spatial resolution to detect subregional effects. However, neither of the conducted analyses was able to find significant handedness-related differences in callosal and the respective effect-sizes estimates were small. For example, comparing MH and consistent RH, the effect sizes for difference in callosal area were below a Cohens d = 0.1 (irrespective of how FBV was included), and narrow confidence intervals allowed to exclude effects above |d| = 0.2. Analysing thickness, effect sizes were below d = 0.2 with confidence intervals not extending above |d| = 0.3. In this, the possible range of population effect sizes of hand preference on callosal morphology appears well below the effects commonly reported for factors like age, sex, or brain size. Effects on cognition or behaviour accordingly can be considered small, questioning the common practise to attribute performance differences between handedness groups to differences in callosal architecture.",

    "abstract": "During task execution cortical dynamics must bridge sensory cues with future behavioural outcomes. However, how cortical networks acquire such task-specific dynamics remains unclear. Here we propose that the cerebellum drives cortical dynamics to enable rapid and flexible task acquisition. We model cerebellar networks that are tuned through timing rules to provide cortical networks with task-outcome predictions. First, using sensorimotor tasks we show that cerebellar feedback with fixed cortical connectivity is sufficient for rapid task acquisition and zero-shot task switching. Next, we demonstrate that, when trained in working memory tasks, the cerebellum can also underlie the maintenance of cognitive-specific dynamics, explaining a range of optogenetic and behavioural observations. Finally, we use our model to introduce a systems consolidation theory in which task information is gradually transferred from the cerebellum to the cortex. In summary, our results suggest that cortico-cerebellar loops are critical for task acquisition, switching and consolidation in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that the internal dynamics of an artificial neural network model of sentence comprehension displayed a similar pattern to the amplitude of the N400 in several conditions known to modulate this event-related potential. These results led Rabovsky, Hansen, and McClelland (2018) to suggest that the N400 might reflect change in an implicit predictive representation of meaning corresponding to semantic prediction error. This explanation stands as an alternative to the hypothesis that the N400 reflects lexical prediction error as estimated by word surprisal (Frank, Otten, Galli, & Vigliocco, 2015). In the present study, we directly model the amplitude of the N400 elicited during naturalistic sentence processing by using as predictor the update of the distributed representation of sentence meaning generated by a Sentence Gestalt model (McClelland, St. John, & Taraban, 1989) trained on a large-scale text corpus. This enables a quantitative prediction of N400 amplitudes based on a cognitively motivated model, as well as quantitative comparison of this model to alternative models of the N400. Specifically, we compare the update measure from the SG model to surprisal estimated by a comparable language model trained on next word prediction. Our results suggest that both Sentence Gestalt update and surprisal predict aspects of N400 amplitudes. Thus, we argue that N400 amplitudes might reflect two distinct but probably closely related sub-processes that contribute to the processing of a sentence.",

Recent advancements in the development of iPSCs and 3D culturing can improve the in vivo-relevance of pre-clinical models, while generating 3D cultures though novel bioprinting technologies can offer increased scalability and replicability. As such, there is a need to develop platforms that combine iPSC-derived cells with 3D bioprinting to produce scalable, tunable and biomimetic cultures for preclinical drug discovery applications. We report a biocompatible PEG-based matrix which incorporates RGD and YIGSR peptide motifs and full length collagen IV at a stiffness similar to the human brain (1.5 kPa). Using a high-throughput commercial bioprinter we report the viable culture and morphological development of iPSC-derived astrocytes, brain microvascular endothelial cells, neural progenitors and neurons in our novel matrix. We also show that this system supports endothelial vasculogenesis and enhances neural differentiation and spontaneous activity.

    "abstract": "Even after successful extinction, conditioned fear can return. Strengthening the consolidation of the fear-inhibitory safety memory formed during extinction is one way to counteract return of fear. In this preregistered direct replication study in male participants, we confirm that spontaneous post-extinction reactivations of a neural activation pattern evoked in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction predict extinction memory retrieval 24 h later. We do not confirm that L-DOPA administration after extinction enhances retrieval and that this is mediated by enhancement of the number of vmPFC reactivations. However, additional non-preregistered analyses reveal a beneficial effect of L-DOPA on extinction retrieval when controlling for the trait-like stable baseline levels of salivary alpha-amylase enzymatic activity (trait sAA) levels that participants show on the three experimental days. Further, trait sAA negatively predicts retrieval, and this effect is rescued by L-DOPA treatment. Our results suggest that individuals with high basal levels of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity may have poor extinction and that L-DOPA may be selectively beneficial for these individuals, which holds potential for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The increased awareness of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is accompanied by burgeoning ASD research, and concerted research efforts are trying to elucidate the molecular ASD aetiology. However, much of this research is concentrated in the Global North, with recent reviews of research in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) highlighting the significant shortage of ASD publications from this region. The most limited focus area was molecular research with only two molecular studies ever published from SSA, both being from South Africa (SA). We examine the molecular ASD research publications from 2016 to 2021 from all African countries, with a special focus on SA. The SSA publications are compared to Brazil and India, two non-African, low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs), and to the UK and USA, two high-income countries (HICs). There were 228 publications across all regions of interest; only three publications were from SA. Brazil (n=29) and India (n=27) had almost 10 times more publications than SA. The HICs had more publications than the LMICs, with the UK (n=62) and the USA (n=74) having approximately 20 to 25 times more publications than SA, respectively. Given that SA has substantial research capacity as demonstrated by its recent research on SARS-CoV-2, we explore potential reasons for this deficit in molecular ASD publications from SA. We compare mental health research outputs, GDP per capita, research and development expenditure, and the number of psychiatrists and child psychiatrists per 100,000 people across all regions. The UK and the USA had significantly higher numbers for all these indicators, consistent with their higher publication output. Among the LMICs, SA can potentially produce more molecular ASD research, however, there are numerous barriers that need to be addressed to facilitate increased research capacity. These include cultural stigmas, challenges in accessing mental healthcare, shortages of specialists in the public sector, and the unreliability of ASD diagnostic tools across the 11 official SA languages. The unique genetic architecture of African populations presents an untapped reservoir for finding novel genetic loci associated with ASD. Therefore, addressing the disparity in molecular ASD research between the Global North and SSA is integral to global advancements in ASD research.",

We showed that when there are differences in taxonomic assignments between pairwise alignments and phylogenetic placements at the subtaxon level, there is a low pairwise similarity of the OTUs to the reference database. We then showcase how the output of EPA-ng can be further evaluated using GAPPA to assess the taxonomic assignments when there exist multiple equally likely placements of an OTU, by taking into account the sum over the likelihood weights of the OUT placements within a subtaxon, and the branch distances between equally likely placement locations. We also inferred evolutionary and ecological characteristics of the colpodean OTUs using their placements within subtaxa.

    "abstract": "The sequence contexts of genomic variants play important roles in understanding biological significances of variants and potential sequencing related variant calling issues. However, methods for assessing the diverse sequence contexts of genomic variants such as tandem repeats and unambiguous annotations have been limited. Herein, we describe the Variant Sequence Context Annotation Tool (VarSCAT) for annotating the sequence contexts of genomic variants, including breakpoint ambiguities, flanking sequences, variant nomenclatures, adjacent variants, and tandem repeats with user customizable options. Our analysis demonstrate that VarSCAT is more versatile and customizable than current methods or strategies for annotating variants in short tandem repeat (STR) regions. Variant sequence context annotations of high-confidence human variant sets with VarSCAT revealed that more than 75% of all human individual germline and clinically relevant insertions and deletions (indels) have breakpoint ambiguities. Moreover, we illustrate that more than 80% of human individual germline small variants in STR regions are indels and that the sizes of these indels correlated with STR motif sizes. VarSCAT is available at https://github.com/elolab/VarSCAT.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe sequence contexts have significant impacts on the biological and technical aspects of genomic variants. The sequence contexts, such as tandem repeats or nearby indels, may increase the mutation rate of a region compared to other genome regions. Besides, variants in specific sequence contexts like STRs may also have distinguished biological consequences, which can lead to certain human diseases and thus they may be used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatments. Moreover, potential ambiguous variant representations such as equivalent or redundant indels are also related with their sequence contexts, which may complicate variant harmonization from different sources. Our previous study demonstrated that more than half of false positive indel calls detected through next generation sequencing data are related with STRs. Thus, the sequence contexts of genomic variants are important and cannot be ignored. However, the current methods or strategies for assessing the sequence contexts of genomic variants are limited and not feasible to use. Here, we developed a computational tool VarSCAT for sequence contexts annotation of genomic variants. Our tool provides diverse sequence contexts annotations providing users information to further explore the variants of their interests. By applying VarSCAT to high confidence human variant sets, we demonstrate the influence of sequence context of genomic variants and emphasize the importance of sequence context assessment.",

    "abstract": "Despite the enormous harms of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), many mechanisms, as well as effective prevention or treatment strategies remain elusive. Genetic factors dictate a majority of AUD risk. These risk factors can manifest as reduced naive sensitivity to alcohols intoxicating effects and increased functional tolerance, i.e., brain-mediated decreases in sensitivity upon repeat exposure. The underlying neurobiology of how AUD-associated genes alter these endophenotypes remains poorly understood. Genes implicated in AUDs include epigenetic modifiers, such as histone demethylases, including Kdm3. We previously showed that whole-body and neuronal Kdm3 strongly affect ethanol sensitivity and tolerance in Drosophila. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of these effects, and, by extension, mechanisms of sensitivity and tolerance. RNA-seq and pathway analysis on Kdm3KO flies revealed disproportionate upregulation of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, including 1-carbon pathways. We show that acute amino acid feeding modulates sensitivity and tolerance in a Kdm3-dependent manner. Global manipulation of 1-carbon genes, especially glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), glycine decarboxylase (Gldc), and sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh), alters alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. These changes in alcohol responses are likely mediated by global glycine levels (a substrate of these enzymes) rather than by 1-carbon input. Conversely, neuronal manipulations of 1-carbon pathways change alcohol sensitivity and tolerance in a pattern that suggests a mechanism through S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), a 1-carbon metabolite that is the universal methyl donor required for epigenetic methylation. Increasing SAM production specifically in glutamatergic neurons increases sensitivity and tolerance. Together, these findings reveal distinct mechanisms affecting alcohol sensitivity and tolerance globally (via glycine) and neuronally (via SAM), thus revealing an important and complex role of 1-carbon metabolism in mediating AUD phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a primary dose-limiting side effect caused by antineoplastic agents, such as paclitaxel. This causes damage to peripheral nerves and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Currently, there are no effective treatments for CIPN, which can lead to long-term morbidity in cancer patients and survivors. Neuro-immune interactions occur in CIPN and have been implicated both in the development and progression of the disease and disease resolution. We investigated the potential role of Inducible co-stimulatory molecule (ICOS) in the resolution of CIPN pain-like behaviors in mice. ICOS is an immune checkpoint molecule that is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and promotes proliferation and differentiation of T cells. We found that intrathecal administration of ICOS agonist antibody (ICOSaa) alleviates mechanical hypersensitivity caused by paclitaxel and facilitates the resolution of mechanical sensitivity in female mice. Administration of ICOSaa reduced astrocyte-gliosis in the spinal cord and satellite cell gliosis in the DRG of mice previously treated with paclitaxel. Mechanistically, ICOSaa intrathecal treatment promoted pain resolution by increasing interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression in the dorsal root ganglion. In line with these observations, blocking IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) activity occluded the effects of ICOSaa treatment on CIPN behavior in female mice. Suggesting a broader activity in neuropathic pain, ICOSaa also partially resolved mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model. Our findings support a model wherein ICOSaa administration induces IL-10 expression to facilitate neuropathic pain relief in female mice. ICOSaa treatment is in clinical development for solid tumors and given our observation of T cells in the human DRG, ICOSaa therapy could be developed for combination chemotherapy - CIPN clinical trials.\n\nHighlightsO_LIICOS agonist antibody (ICOSaa) promotes pain resolution in female mice\nC_LIO_LIDRG T cells appear to enter an anti-inflammatory phenotype by ICOSaa treatment\nC_LIO_LIICOSaa treatment increases DRG levels of IL-10 cytokine\nC_LIO_LIICOSaa effects in female mice are blocked by IL-10 sequestering treatment\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder linked to numerous rare, inherited and arising de novo genetic variants. ASD often co-occurs with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy, which are associated with hyperexcitability of neurons. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability in ASD remain poorly understood. Transient receptor potential canonical-6 (TRPC6) is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel that regulates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and is a candidate risk gene for ASD. Using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cortical neurons, single cell calcium imaging, and electrophysiological recording, we show that TRPC6 knockout (KO) reduces SOCE signaling and leads to hyperexcitability of neurons by increasing action potential frequency and network burst frequency. Our data provide evidence that reduction of SOCE by TRPC6 KO results in neuronal hyperexcitability, which we hypothesize is an important contributor to the cellular pathophysiology underlying hyperactivity in some ASD.",

    "abstract": "Migraine Disease (MD) is one of the primary headaches in which the pathophysiological mechanism is yet unknown. It is still unclear how the ictal phases periods are determined? Why can any small trigger sometimes initiate the ictal phase, and sometimes, even bigger triggers cannot? Considering the brain as a dynamic system and proposing a complex system model for that as a migraineur or a healthy subject is a viable method. Here, the interaction between whole neurons is analyzed rather than individual neurons. This model is a complex system with a chaotic attractor. With parameter alternations, this attractor changes from one scroll to double scroll, representing a healthy or a migraineur brain. In the proposed system, the attractors borders are the regions where every small trigger can start the ictal phase, while the outer areas are the non-sensitive brain situations. We believe that MD and Chuas systems have certain behavioral similarities. This study aimed to explain the function of MD and offer a theory that adequately describes its behavior. Finally, it has been tried to discuss some physiological evidences such as Migraine Generator Network (MGN), Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD), and the role of Serotonin and other substances in relation to the expressed hypotheses. This insight may propose newer methods for preventing or curing MD. Knowing the functioning of dynamic systems and finding similar behaviors with MD on the one hand, as well as linking physiological and pathophysiological evidence with a quantitative model can be very useful in better understanding, managing, and controlling the MD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParkinsons disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction and dopamine deficits. The MitoPark mouse recapitulates several facets of Parkinsons disease, including gradual development of motor deficits, which enables the study of potential therapeutic interventions. One therapeutic strategy involves decreasing the mitochondrial metabolic load by inducing ketosis and providing an alternative energy source for neurons, leading to decreased neuronal oxidative stress.\n\nObjectiveWe assessed whether administration of a ketone ester-enriched diet would improve motor and dopamine release deficits in MitoPark mice.\n\nMethodsMotor function (rotarod and open field tests), dopamine release (fast-scan cyclic voltammetry), tissue dopamine levels (GC-MS), and dopamine neurons and axons (immunofluorescence) were assessed in MitoPark and control mice fed either the standard or ketone ester-enriched diets.\n\nResultsWhen started on the ketone diet before motor dysfunction onset, MitoPark mice had preserved motor function relative to standard diet MitoPark mice. While the ketone ester enriched diet did not preserve dopamine neurons or striatal dopamine axons, dopamine release in ketone diet MitoPark mice was greater than standard diet MitoPark mice but less than control mice. In a follow up experiment, we began the ketone diet after motor dysfunction onset and observed a modest preservation of motor function in ketone diet MitoPark mice relative to standard diet MitoPark mice.\n\nConclusionThe improvement in motor dysfunction indicates that a ketone ester enriched diet or ketone supplement may represent a promising adjunct treatment for Parkinsons disease.",

Although these techniques exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for antibody-labeled targets, the provided anatomical information remains limited. To allow anatomical mapping of fluorescent signal in whole brain, we developed a novel magnetic resonance (MR) - based template with its associated tissue priors and atlas labels, specifically designed for brains subjected to tissue processing protocols required for 3D optical imaging. We investigated the effect of tissue pre-processing and clearing on brain size and morphology and developed optimized templates for BABB/Murrays clear (OCUM) and DBE/iDISCO (iOCUM) cleared brains. By creating optical-(i)OCUM fusion images using our mapping procedure, we localized dopamine transporter and translocator protein expression and tracer innervation from the eye to the lateral geniculate nucleus of thalamus and superior colliculus. These fusion images allowed for precise anatomical identification of fluorescent signal in discrete brain areas. As such, these templates enable applications in a broad range of research areas integrating optical 3D brain imaging by providing an MR template for cleared brains.",

    "abstract": "To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context). How does the brains functional architecture enable sensory and mnemonic representations to closely interface, while also avoiding sensory-mnemonic interference? Here, we asked this question using first-person, head-mounted virtual reality (VR) and fMRI. Using VR, human participants of both sexes learned a set of immersive, real-world visuospatial environments in which we systematically manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions, spanning from a single field-of-view to a city street. We used individualized, within-subject fMRI to determine which brain areas support memory of the visuospatial context associated with a scene during recall (Exp. 1) and recognition (Exp. 2). Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex was modulated by the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immediately anterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior patches corresponded to three functionally-defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that were modulated by the amount of visuospatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these anterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled. Together, these results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of the local visuospatial context at the anterior edge of high-level visual cortex.\n\nSignificance statementAs we move through the world, the visual scene around us is integrated with our memory of the wider visuospatial context. Here, we sought to understand how the functional architecture of the brain enables coexisting representations of the current visual scene and memory of the surrounding environment. Using a combination of immersive virtual reality and fMRI, we show that memory of visuospatial context outside the current field-of-view is represented in a distinct set of brain areas immediately anterior and adjacent to the perceptually-oriented scene-selective areas of high-level visual cortex. This functional architecture would allow efficient interaction between immediately adjacent mnemonic and perceptual areas, while also minimizing mnemonic-perceptual interference.",

    "abstract": "Prevailing theories of offline memory consolidation posit that the pattern of neurons activated during a salient sensory experience will be faithfully reactivated, thereby stabilizing the entire pattern1-3. However, sensory-evoked patterns are not stable, but instead drift across repeated experiences4-7. To investigate potential roles of reactivations in the stabilization and/or drift of sensory representations, we imaged calcium activity of thousands of excitatory neurons in mouse lateral visual cortex. Presentation of a stimulus resulted in transient, stimulus-specific reactivations during the following minute. These reactivations depended on local circuit activity, as they were abolished by local silencing during the preceding stimulus. Contrary to prevailing theories, reactivations systemically differed from previous patterns evoked by the stimulus. Instead, they were more similar to future patterns evoked by the stimulus, thereby predicting representational drift. In particular, neurons that participated more or less in early reactivations than in stimulus response patterns subsequently increased or decreased their future stimulus responses, respectively. The rate and content of these reactivations was sufficient to accurately predict future changes in stimulus responses and, surprisingly, the decreasing similarity of responses to distinct stimuli. Thus, activity patterns during sensory cortical reactivations may guide the drift in sensory responses to improve sensory discrimination8.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are characterized by compulsive alcohol use, loss of control over intake, and a negative emotional state during abstinence. While AUDs are associated with both mood and chronic pain disorders, the relationship between these associations remains unclear. Corticotropin releasing factor-1 receptor (CRF1) has been implicated in alcohol (EtOH) use, affective states, and pain sensitivity; often in a sex-dependent manner. Using CRF1-cre transgenic rats, we found no sex differences in basal affective behavior with the exception of mechanical sensitivity, where females were more sensitive to mechanical stimuli. Following baseline testing, rats began EtOH (or water) drinking under intermittent access conditions. Females consumed more alcohol in the first week, but overall EtOH intake was not significantly different between males and females. Following 3-4 weeks of drinking, rats were tested again for negative affect. EtOH drinking decreased mechanical sensitivity, but no other group effects were observed. However, individual EtOH intake was directly correlated with anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in both sexes. Interestingly, EtOH intake inversely correlated with thermal sensitivity in males only. There were no group differences in CRF1+ neuronal activity in either prelimbic or infralimbic cortices, but final session EtOH intake was significantly correlated with activity in CRF1+ neurons in the infralimbic cortex. Together, our results suggest complex interplay between affective state, EtOH drinking, and the role of prefrontal cortex CRF1-containing neurons in mediating these behaviors. Additionally, these results highlight the importance of examining individual differences in AUD-related behaviors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDespite alcohol use disorders being extremely comorbid with mood and pain disorders, there is still a limited understanding of the interaction and directionality between the them. To investigate this problem, rats were tested for affective behavior before and after being allowed to drink alcohol for 6 weeks. While baseline behavior did not predict subsequent intake, alcohol intake predicted both anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. These findings were accompanied by increased activity of the corticotropin releasing factor 1 containing neurons in the infralimbic region of the prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings reveal a new mechanism for understanding alcohol use.",

    "abstract": "Cellular morphology and synaptic configuration are key determinants of neuronal function and are often modified under pathological conditions. In the first nucleus of the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus (CN), principal bushy neurons specialize in processing temporal information of sound critical for hearing. These neurons alter their physiological properties during aging that contribute to age-related hearing loss (ARHL). The structural basis of such changes remains unclear, especially age-related modifications in their dendritic morphology and the innervating auditory nerve (AN) synapses. Using young (2-5 months) and aged (28-33 months) CBA/CaJ mice of either sex, we filled individual bushy neurons with fluorescent dye in acute brain slices to characterize their dendritic morphology, followed by immunostaining against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and calretinin (CR) to identify innervating AN synapses. We found that dendritic morphology of aged bushy neurons had significantly reduced complexity, suggesting age-dependent dendritic degeneration, especially in neurons with predominantly non-CR-expressing synapses on the soma. These dendrites were innervated by AN bouton synapses, which were predominantly non-CR-expressing in young mice but had increased proportion of CR-expressing synapses in old mice. While somatic AN synapses degenerated substantially with age, as quantified by VGluT1-labeled puncta volume, no significant difference was observed in the total volume of dendritic synapses between young and old mice. Consequently, synaptic density on dendrites was significantly higher in old mice. The findings suggest that dendritic degeneration and altered synaptic innervation in bushy neurons during aging may underlie their changed physiological activity and contribute to the development of ARHL.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIDendrites of bushy neurons degenerate during aging with reduced complexity\nC_LIO_LIBushy dendrites receive AN input primarily from SGNs with medium/high threshold\nC_LIO_LIDendritic synapses show similar total volume but increased density during aging\nC_LIO_LIDendritic degeneration in bushy neurons and altered AN input may underlie ARHL\nC_LI",

However, how endogenously generated networks respond to the onset of sensory experience, and how they form mature sensory representations with experience remains unclear. Here we examine this  nature-nurture transform using in vivo calcium imaging in ferret visual cortex. At eye-opening, visual stimulation evokes robust patterns of cortical activity that are highly variable within and across trials, severely limiting stimulus discriminability. Initial evoked responses are distinct from spontaneous activity of the endogenous network. Visual experience drives the development of low-dimensional, reliable representations aligned with spontaneous activity.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can offer solutions to communicative impairments induced by conditions such as locked-in syndrome. While covert speech-based BCIs have garnered interest, a major issue facing their clinical translation is the collection of sufficient volumes of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) examples of covert speech signals which can typically induce fatigue in users. Fortuitously, investigations into the linkage between covert speech and speech perception have revealed spatiotemporal similarities suggestive of shared encoding mechanisms. Here, we sought to demonstrate that an electroencephalographic cross-condition machine learning model of speech perception and covert speech can successfully decode neural speech patterns during online BCI scenarios.\n\nMethodsIn the current study, ten participants underwent a dyadic protocol whereby participants perceived the audio of a randomly chosen word and then subsequently mentally rehearsed it. Eight words were used during the offline sessions and subsequently narrowed down to three classes for the online session (two words, rest). The modelling was achieved by estimating a functional mapping derived from speech perception and covert speech signals of the same speech token (features were extracted via a Riemannian approach).\n\nResultsWhile most covert speech BCIs deal with binary and offline classifications, we report an average ternary and online BCI accuracy of 75.3% (60% chance-level), reaching up to 93% in select participants. Moreover, we found that perception-covert modelling effectively enhanced the SNR of covert speech signals correlatively to their high-frequency correspondences.\n\nConclusionsThese findings may pave the way to efficient and more user-friendly data collection for passively training such BCIs. Future iterations of this BCI can lead to a combination of audiobooks and unsupervised learning to train a non-trivial vocabulary that can support proto-naturalistic communication.\n\nSignificance StatementCovert speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide new communication channels. However, these BCIs face practical challenges in collecting large volumes of high-quality covert speech data which can both induce fatigue and degrade BCI performance. This study leverages the reported spatiotemporal correspondences between covert speech and speech perception by deriving a functional mapping between them. While multiclass and online covert speech classification has previously been challenging, this study reports an average ternary and online classification accuracy of 75.3%, reaching up to 93% for select participants. Moreover, the current modelling approach augmented the signal-to-noise ratio of covert speech signals correlatively to their gamma-band correspondences. The proposed approach may pave the way toward a more efficient and user-friendly method of training covert speech BCIs.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal network activity at theta frequencies (5-10Hz) is important for behavior. However, it remains unclear how behaviorally-relevant network theta rhythms arise and interact with cellular dynamics to dictate spike timing. We performed membrane voltage (Vm) imaging of individual CA1 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons with simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings in mice during locomotion. We found that Vm theta rhythms organize spike timing in both cell types regardless of behavioral conditions, but the Vm of parvalbumin interneurons is better synchronized with LFP. The temporal relationships between spikes and LFP theta reliably reflect the Vm-LFP relationships in parvalbumin cells, but not in pyramidal cells. Thus, cellular theta rhythms broadly organize spike timing in CA1 neurons, and parvalbumin interneurons are critical in coordinating network theta rhythms.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCellular membrane voltage of parvalbumin interneurons organizes spiking and network dynamics in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Major gastrointestinal and systemic functions are regulated by the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), whose cells are organized in interconnected clusters or ganglia to form plexuses in the gut wall. Previously, we showed that neuronal turnover, driven by overall equal rates of neurogenesis and neuronal loss, is an important homeostatic mechanism that maintains the larger myenteric plexus of the healthy adult ENS. While this process maintains neuronal numbers, whether it occurs at the same rate across the two sexes, in different regions and within ganglia that contain a diversity of neuronal numbers remains unknown. Here, by using antibodies against the DNA replication marker phospho-Histone H3 and against the pan-neuronal marker Hu to detect new-born neurons, we observe that while the proportions of new-born myenteric neurons are conserved irrespective of the region or sex in the healthy small intestine, they are inversely correlated with ganglia size. In contrast, by using antibodies against the apoptosis marker Cleaved Caspase 3 and Hu, we found that proportions of apoptotic neurons were directly correlated with ganglia size. Our observations on the unequal rate of neuronal turnover across ganglia, where smaller ganglia are more neurogenic and larger ganglia are more apoptotic, suggests that the myenteric ganglia are plastic in nature. These results provide further insight into the dynamic nature of the adult ENS.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks provide powerful tools for estimating health and lifespan but their ability to predict brain degeneration and neuronal damage during the aging process is unknown. In this study, we use GrimAge, an epigenetic clock correlated to several blood plasma proteins, to longitudinally investigate brain cellular microstructure in axonal white matter from a cohort of healthy aging individuals. Given the blood plasma correlations used to develop GrimAge, a specific focus was made on white matter hyperintensities, a visible neurological manifestation of small vessel disease, and the axonal pathways throughout each individuals brain affected by their unique white matter hyperintensity location and volume. 98 subjects over 55 years of age were scanned at baseline with 41 returning for a follow-up scan 2 years later. Using diffusion MRI lesionometry, we reconstructed subject-specific networks of affected axonal tracts and examined the diffusion cellular microstructure composition of these areas, both at baseline and longitudinally, for evidence of cellular degeneration. A chronological age-adjusted version of GrimAge was significantly correlated with baseline WMH volume and markers of neuronal decline, indicated by increased extracellular free water, increased intracellular signal, and decreased axonal signal within WMH. By isolating subject-specific axonal regions  lesioned by crossing through a WMH, age-adjusted GrimAge was also able to predict longitudinal development of similar patterns of neuronal decline throughout the brain. This study is the first to establish a relationship between accelerated epigenetic GrimAge and brain cellular microstructure in humans.",

Monthly sampling was carried out at selected stations of coastal waters with average depth of 8m. The qualitative analyses revealed the presence of seventeen different groups of zooplankton. copepods, cladocerans are dominant group in zooplankton followed by chaetognaths, during the study period seven species of chaetognaths recorded viz, Sagitta enflata, Sagitta robusta, Sagitta bedotii, Sagitta bipunctata, Sagitta ferox, Sagitta planktonis, and Sagitta elegans. Among them, Sagitta enflata was the dominant species followed by S.bedotii and S. robusta. The richness, evenness and diversity of chaetognaths varied in the different stations and the maximum and minimum values also varied between stations, but in the most of the stations the minimum values were observed in the post-monsoon season and the highest values ranged between January to March. On comparison of the present abundance of chaetognaths with previous study, it was observed that the density of chaetognaths decreased compared to previous studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding gait development is essential for identifying motor impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders. Defining typical gait development in a rhesus macaque model is critical prior to characterizing abnormal gait. The goal of this study was to 1) explore the feasibility of using the Noldus Catwalk to assess gait in infant rhesus macaques and 2) provide preliminary normative data of gait development during the first month of life.\n\nNew methodThe Noldus Catwalk was used to assess gait speed, dynamic and static paw measurements, and interlimb coordination in twelve infant rhesus macaques at 14, 21, and 28 days of age. All macaque runs were labeled as a diagonal or non-diagonal walking pattern.\n\nResultsInfant rhesus macaques primarily used a diagonal (mature) walking pattern as early as 14 days of life. Ten infant rhesus macaques (83.3%) were able to successfully walk across the Noldus Catwalk at 28 days of life. Limited differences in gait parameters were observed between timepoints because of the variability within the group at 14, 21, and 28 days.\n\nComparison with existing methods: No prior gait analysis system has been used to provide objective quantification of gait parameters for infant macaques.\n\nConclusionsThe Catwalk system can be utilized to quantify gait in infant rhesus macaques less than 28 days old. Future applications to infant rhesus macaques could provide a better understanding of gait development and early differences within various neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nHighlights- Infant rhesus macaque gait parameters can successfully be captured by the Catwalk\n- At 14 days of life, macaques were consistently using a diagonal walking pattern\n- Limited developmental change occurs in gait parameters over the first month of life\n- Infant macaque gait parameters had high within group variability at each timepoint\n\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516450v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6185edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9fa472org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e54919org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12231cc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Note: Brown and grey-colored macaques were created in biorender",

    "abstract": "The fundament of an evidence-based severity assessment in laboratory animal science is reliable distress parameters. Many readouts are used to evaluate and determine animal distress and the severity of experimental procedures. Therefore, we analyzed four distinct parameters like the body weight, burrowing behavior, nesting, and distress score in the four gastrointestinal animal models (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), pancreatitis, CCl4 intoxication, and bile duct ligation (BDL)). Further, we determined the parameters  robustness in various experimental subgroups due to slight variations like drug treatment or telemeter implantations. We used non-parametric bootstrapping to get robust estimates and 95 % confidence intervals for the experimental groups. It was found that the performance of the readout parameters is model-dependent and that the distress score is prone to experimental variation. On the other hand, we also found that burrowing and nesting can be more robust than, e.g., the body weight when evaluating PDA. However, the body weight still was highly robust in BDL, pancreatitis, and CCl4 intoxication. To address the complex nature of the multi-dimensional severity space, we used the Relative Severity Assessment (RELSA) procedure to combine multiple distress parameters into a score and mapped the subgroups and models against a defined reference set obtained by telemeter implantation. This approach allowed us to compare the severity of individual animals in the experimental subgroups using the maximum achieved severity (RELSAmax). With this, the following order of severity was found for the animal models: CCl4 < PDA {approx} Pancreatitis < BDL. Furthermore, the robustness of the RELSA procedure and outcome was externally validated with a reference set from another laboratory also obtained from telemeter implantation. Since the RELSA procedure reflects the multi-dimensional severity information and is highly robust in estimating the quantitative severity within and between models, it can be deemed a valuable tool for laboratory animal severity assessment.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause Parkinsons disease (PD), increasing phosphorylation of RAB GTPases through hyperactive kinase activity. We found that LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs disrupt the axonal transport of autophagosomes by perturbing the coordinated regulation of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin motors. In iPSC-derived human neurons, knock-in of the strongly-hyperactive LRRK2-p.R1441H mutation caused striking impairments in autophagosome transport, inducing frequent directional reversals and pauses. Knock-out of the opposing Protein Phosphatase 1H (PPM1H) phenocopied the effect of hyperactive LRRK2. Overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a GTPase that acts as a switch for selective activation of dynein or kinesin, attenuated transport defects in both p.R1441H knock-in and PPM1H knock-out neurons. Together, these findings support a model where a regulatory imbalance between LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs and ARF6 induces an unproductive \"tug-of-war\" between dynein and kinesin, disrupting processive autophagosome transport. This disruption may contribute to PD pathogenesis by impairing the essential homeostatic functions of axonal autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Liver transplantation is currently the only treatment for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Liver transplant rejection is among the most lethal complications of transplantation, and therapeutic development is limited by our lack of a comprehensive understanding of the cellular landscape of the liver. The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus), ideal in size as a model for surgical procedures, is a strong platform to study liver biology in the context of liver transplantation. Liver allograft rejection is known to be strain-specific in the rat model, although the transplantation is accepted without rejection in some strains, it leads to acute rejection in others. To shed light on the cellular landscape of the rat liver and build a foundation for strain comparison, we present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomics map of the healthy rat liver of Lewis and Dark Agouti strains. Using a novel computational pipeline we developed to guide the detailed annotation of our rat liver atlas, we discovered that hepatic myeloid cells have strong Lewis and Dark Agouti strain-specific differences focused on inflammatory signaling pathways. We experimentally validated these strain-specific differences in myeloid inflammatory potential in vitro using intracellular cytokine staining. Our work provides the first examination of the multi-strain healthy rat liver by single cell transcriptomics and uncovers key insights into strain-specific differences in this valuable model animal.\n\nSummaryThe laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) is a standard model animal for orthotopic liver transplantation. Transplanting a liver from a Dark agouti (DA) to a Lewis (LEW) strain rat leads to transplant rejection and the reverse procedure leads to tolerance. Understanding this strain difference may help explain the cellular drivers of liver allograft rejection post-transplant. This study uses single-cell transcriptomics to better understand the complex cellular composition of the rat liver and unravels cellular and molecular sources of inter-strain hepatic variation. We generated single-cell transcriptomic maps of the livers of healthy DA and LEW rat strains and developed a novel, factor analysis-based bioinformatics pipeline to study data covariates, such as strain and batch. Using this approach, we discovered variations within hepatocyte and myeloid populations that explain how the states of these cells differ between strains in the healthy rat, which may explain why these strains respond differently to liver transplants.",
