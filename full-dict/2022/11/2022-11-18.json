    "abstract": "Inhibition is a key cognitive control mechanism. When rapidly exerted, inhibitory control has broad, non-selective motor effects, typically demonstrated using cortico-spinal excitability measurements (CSE) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For example, during rapid action-stopping, CSE is suppressed at both stopped and task-unrelated muscles. While such TMS-based CSE measurements provide crucial insights into the fronto-basal ganglia circuitry underlying non-selective inhibition, they have several downsides. TMS is contraindicated in many populations (e.g., epilepsy, deep-brain stimulation patients), has limited temporal resolution, produces distracting auditory and haptic stimulation, is difficult to combine with other imaging methods, and necessitates expensive, immobile equipment. Here, we attempted to measure the non-selective motor effects of inhibitory control using a method unaffected by these shortcomings. 30 participants exerted isometric force on a hand-held force transducer while performing a foot-response stop-signal task. Indeed, when foot movements were stopped, force output at the task-irrelevant hand was suppressed as well. Moreover, this non-selective reduction of isometric force was highly correlated with stop-signal performance and showed frequency dynamics similar to established inhibitory signatures typically found in neural and muscle recordings. Together, we demonstrate that isometric force recordings capture the non-selective effects of motor inhibition, enabling many applications that are impossible with TMS.",

    "abstract": "The recognition of objects is strongly facilitated when they are presented in the context of other objects (Biederman, 1972). Such contexts facilitate perception and induce expectations of context-congruent objects (Trapp & Bar, 2015). The neural mechanisms underlying these facilitatory effects of context on object processing, however, are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigate how context-induced expectations affect subsequent object processing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and measured repetition suppression, a proxy for prediction error processing, for pairs of alternating or repeated object images, preceded by context-congruent, context-incongruent or neutral cues. We found a stronger repetition suppression in congruent as compared to incongruent or neutral cues in the object sensitive lateral occipital cortex. Interestingly, this effect was driven by enhanced responses to alternating stimulus pairs in the congruent contexts. In addition, in the congruency condition, we discovered significant functional connectivity between object-responsive and frontal cortical regions, as well as between object-responsive regions and the fusiform gyrus. Our findings unravel the neural mechanisms underlying context facilitation.",

We report that the Swedish familial AD (FAD) mutation perturbs fast anterograde axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by altering directionality of its movement. APP thus spends more time in retrograde movement and accumulates in the soma. We found that the Swedish mutation enhances recruitment of dynactin 1 to the APP transport assemblies. Given that dynactin 1 activates the retrograde motor dynein3, this hampers physiological anterograde axonal transport of APP. We last show that the Swedish mutation perturbs also the axonal transport of early endosomes, which rely on the same molecular motors as APP. Our findings reveal extensive impairment of the axonal transport pathways by a FAD mutation, which reflects dysregulation of the cargo motor assemblies.",

However, despite this influential view, experimental studies have exclusively focused on how the neural code adapts to a range of stimuli lying along a single feature axis, such as orientation or contrast. Here, we performed electrical recordings in macaque visual cortex (area V4) to reveal significant adaptive changes in the neural code of single cells and populations across multiple feature axes. Both during free viewing and passive fixation, populations of cells improved their ability to encode image features after rapid exposure to stimuli lying on orthogonal feature axes even in the absence of initial tuning to these stimuli. These results reveal a remarkable adaptive capacity of visual cortical populations to improve network computations relevant for natural viewing despite the modularity of the functional cortical architecture.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent successes in machine vision, artificial recognition systems continue to be less robust than biological systems. The brittleness of artificial recognition system has been attributed to the linearity of the core operation that matches inputs to target patterns at each stage of the system. Here we analyze responses of neurons from the visual areas V1, V2, and V4 of the brain using the framework that incorporates quadratic computations into multi-stage models. These quadratic computations make it possible to capture local recurrent computation, and in particular, nonlinear suppressive interactions between visual features. We find that incorporating quadratic computation not only strongly improved predictive power of the resulting model, but also revealed several computation motifs that increased the selectivity of neural responses to natural stimuli. These motifs included the organization of excitatory and suppressive features along mutually exclusive hypotheses about incoming stimuli, such as orthogonal orientations or opposing motion directions. The balance between excitatory and suppressive features was largely maintained across brain regions. These results emphasize the importance and properties of quadratic computations that are necessary for achieving robust object recognition.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the cause of porcine pleuropneumonia, a severe respiratory tract infection that is responsible for major economic losses to the swine industry. Many host-adapted bacterial pathogens encode systems known as phasevarions (phase- variable regulons). Phasevarions result from variable expression of cytoplasmic DNA methyltransferases. Variable expression results in genome-wide methylation differences within a bacterial population, leading to altered expression of multiple genes via epigenetic mechanisms. Our examination of a diverse population of A. pleuropneumoniae strains determined that Type I and Type III DNA methyltransferases with the hallmarks of phase variation were present in this species. We demonstrate that phase variation is occurring in these methyltransferase, and show associations between particular Type III methyltransferase alleles and serovar. Using Pacific BioSciences Single-Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we demonstrate the presence of the first ever characterised phase-variable, cytosine-specific Type III DNA methyltransferase. Phase variation of distinct Type III DNA methyltransferase variants results in the regulation of distinct phasevarions, and in multiple phenotypic differences relevant to pathobiology. Our characterisation of these newly described phasevarions in A. pleuropneumoniae will aid in the selection of stably expressed antigens, and direct and inform development of a rationally designed subunit vaccine against this major veterinary pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The molecular links between tissue-level morphogenesis and the differentiation of cell lineages in the pancreas remain elusive despite a decade of studies. We previously showed that in pancreas both these processes depend on proper lumenogenesis. The Rab GTPase Rab11 has been shown to be essential to epithelial lumen formation in vitro, however few studies have addressed its functions in vivo and none have tested its requirement in pancreas. Here, we show that Rab11 is critical to proper pancreas development. Co-deletion of the Rab11 isoforms Rab11A and Rab11B in the developing pancreatic epithelium (Rab11pancDKO) results in ~50% neonatal lethality, and surviving adult Rab11pancDKO mice exhibit defective endocrine function. Loss of Rab11 in the embryonic pancreas results in morphogenetic defects of the epithelium linked to defective lumen formation and interconnection. In contrast to wildtype cells, Rab11pancDKO cells attempt to form multiple lumens, resulting in a failure to coordinate a single apical membrane initiation site (AMIS) between groups of cells. We show that these defects are due to failures in vesicle trafficking, as apical components remain trapped within Rab11pancDKO cells. Together, these observations suggest Rab11 directly regulates epithelial lumen formation and morphogenesis. Our report links intracellular trafficking to organ morphogenesis in vivo, and presents a novel framework for decoding pancreatic development.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIRab11Af/f;Rab11B-/-;Pdx1-Cre pancreas displays disruption of epithelial organization and reduction of endocrine cell mass.\nC_LIO_LILoss of Rab11 results in disruption of pancreatic lumen continuity due to a failure of lumen formation.\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial cells lacking Rab11 display abnormal polarity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The fossil record contains dinosaur jaws with rows of unerupted successional teeth that are arranged in a variety of elegant patterns. The remnants of these patterns are visible in modern dentate reptiles but the mechanism for generating and maintaining these rows of teeth is unknown. The biology underlying the tooth replacement pattern was hypothesized to either be stimuli transmitted across tooth families in the jaws (Edmund) or secretion of local inhibitory molecules that would stagger development of adjacent tooth families (Osborn). To test these hypotheses and generate new ones, we completed a study on 6 treated adult geckos in which one side of the jaw had teeth removed. Wax bites were used to record the maxillary teeth 2 times a week. Tooth presence or absence was recorded and transformed mathematically. The time between eruption at each tooth position was measured as was the relative phase compared to the immediate adjacent teeth over successive bites. The period between eruption events at each tooth position was approximately 30 days with some lengthening over time. The average relative phase showed there was a tilt in the data that fit the observation that alternating teeth were being shed. This tilt was opposite on the left and right sides of the jaw. The asymmetry of the right and left sides was consistent across the dentition. After plucking, the pattern recovers after 3 periods fitting with the consistent finding that there are 3 teeth in each tooth family. Ablated areas did not recover tooth formation even after 14 months. The plucked animals showed evidence of fixed, local signaling that restores the pattern. Two models based on Osborns concept of a \"zone of inhibition\" deviate from the observed data. The ablated animals show no change in patterns of tooth eruption anterior and posterior to the gap. Thus there is no support for the Wave stimulus theory of Edmund. Finally, we propose a new Phase Inhibition Model. This model assumes fixed initiation sites at which teeth are initiated at some phase within a month-long cycle and that, as a tooth is initiated, the cycles of nearby initiation sites are inhibited in their progress. This inhibition causes nearest neighbours to erupt in anti-synchrony. This model best maintained the tilt, spacing timing of the real biological data. Mathematical modeling was sensitive enough to measure the normal developmental instability and the resilience of the gecko to restore homeostasis after tooth removal.",

However, generating fully mature cells constitutes a bottleneck for realizing their full potential in research and medicine. Here, we report a transcriptional mechanism that governs the timing of cellular maturation in post-mitotic oligodendrocytes. During differentiation of PSCs to oligodendrocytes, the transcription factor SOX6 redistributes from nearly all super enhancers in proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to cluster across specific gene bodies in immature oligodendrocytes. These sites exhibit  gene melting, a process of extensive chromatin decondensation and transcription, which abruptly turns off upon maturation. Suppression of SOX6 deactivates these immaturity loci, resulting in rapid transition to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. Cells harboring this immature oligodendrocyte SOX6 gene signature are specifically enriched in multiple sclerosis patient brains, suggestive that failed maturation may contribute to limited myelin regeneration in disease. Collectively, our finding that maturation rate is controlled by transient transcriptional clusters may inform approaches to accelerate the generation and regeneration of mature cell types.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LITranscription factors (TFs) can act as gatekeepers of post-mitotic cellular maturation\nC_LIO_LIIn oligodendrocytes, clustering of SOX6 controls the immaturity program through transient gene melting\nC_LIO_LISuppressing SOX6 deactivates immaturity genes and unlocks oligodendrocyte maturation\nC_LIO_LISOX6 immaturity signature is enriched in oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis patients\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A relevant number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors suffers from post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PASC). Current evidence suggests a dysregulated alveolar regeneration in COVID-19 as a possible explanation for respiratory PASC symptoms, a phenomenon which deserves further investigation in a suitable animal model. This study investigates morphological, phenotypical and transcriptomic features of alveolar regeneration in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian golden hamsters. We demonstrate that CK8+ alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cells occur following SARS-CoV-2-induced diffuse alveolar damage. A subset of ADI cells shows nuclear accumulation of TP53 at 6- and 14-days post infection (dpi), indicating a prolonged arrest in the ADI state. Transcriptome data show the expression of gene signatures driving ADI cell senescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. Moreover, we show that multipotent CK14+ airway basal cell progenitors migrate out of terminal bronchioles, aiding alveolar regeneration. At 14 dpi, presence of ADI cells, peribronchiolar proliferates, M2-type macrophages, and sub-pleural fibrosis is observed, indicating incomplete alveolar restoration. The results demonstrate that the hamster model reliably phenocopies indicators of a dysregulated alveolar regeneration of COVID-19 patients. The results provide important information on a translational COVID-19 model, which is crucial for its application in future research addressing pathomechanisms of PASC and in testing of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for this syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data is required as an input function for graphical analysis (e.g., Patlak plot) of single positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) data to evaluate tissue influx rate of radiotracers. Dynamic heart imaging data is often used as a surrogate of plasma PK. However, accumulation of radiolabel (representing both intact and degraded tracer) in the heart tissue may interfere with accurate prediction of plasma PK from the heart data. Therefore, we developed a compartmental model, which involves forcing functions to describe intact and degraded radiolabeled proteins in plasma and their accumulation in heart tissue, to deconvolve plasma PK of 125I-amyloid beta 40 (125I-A{beta}40) and 125I-insulin from their dynamic heart imaging data. The three-compartment model was shown to adequately describe the plasma concentration-time profile of intact/degraded proteins and the heart radioactivity time data obtained from SPECT/CT imaging for both tracers. The model was successfully applied to deconvolve the plasma PK of both tracers from their naive datasets of dynamic heart imaging. In agreement with our previous observations made by conventional serial plasma sampling, the deconvolved plasma PK of 125I-A{beta}40 and 125I-insulin in young mice exhibited lower area under the curve (AUC) than the aged mice. Further, Patlak plot parameters (Ki) extracted using deconvolved plasma PK as input function successfully recapitulated age-dependent blood-to-brain influx kinetics changes for both 125I-A{beta}40 and 125I-insulin. Therefore, the compartment model developed in this study provides a novel approach to deconvolve plasma PK of radiotracers from their noninvasive dynamic heart imaging. This method facilitates the application of preclinical SPECT or PET imaging data to characterize distribution kinetics of tracers where simultaneous plasma sampling is not feasible.",

    "abstract": "Engineered consortia are a major research focus for synthetic biologists because they can implement sophisticated behaviors inaccessible to single-strain systems. However, this functional capacity is constrained by their constituent strains ability to engage in complex communication. DNA messaging, by enabling information-rich channel-decoupled communication, is a promising candidate architecture for implementing complex communication. But its major advantage, its messages dynamic mutability, is still unexplored. We develop a framework for addressable and adaptable DNA messaging that leverages all three of these advantages and implement it in a plasmid conjugation-based communication channel. Our system can bias the transfer of messages to targeted receiver strains by 100-to 1000-fold, and their recipient lists can be dynamically updated in situ to control the flow of information through the population. This work lays the foundation for future developments that further utilize the unique advantages of DNA messaging to engineer previously-inaccessible levels of complexity into biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a hallmark of cardiovascular (CV) disorders and influences their progression; however, there are currently no direct therapeutic targets, primarily due to the lack of knowledge regarding EDs molecular basis. We used a computational approach to identify candidate targets for ED treatment. We constructed an ED disease gene network by combining the integration of epigenomics (ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq-H3K27ac) and transcriptomics data (RNA-seq) from human aorta endothelial cells (HAEC) exposed to surrogates of primary CV risk factors using network propagation. We then used in silico perturbation to prioritise genes that could influence the ED network most when removed. This process resulted in identifying 17 key candidates for which chemical inhibitors are available. These are genes associated with ED and atherosclerosis, and drugs that target those genes have not yet been tested for the treatment of CV disorders. The EGLN3 target and its inhibitor displayed significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in ECs assessed using a high-content screening platform. These findings illustrate the potential of in silico knockouts to discover disease-specific candidate targets for drug development or repositioning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReaction networks are widely used as mechanistic models in systems biology to reveal principles of biological systems. Reactions are governed by kinetic laws that describe reaction rates. Selecting the appropriate kinetic laws is difficult for many modelers. There exist tools that attempt to find the correct kinetic laws based on annotations. Here, I developed annotation-independent technologies that assist modelers by focusing on finding kinetic laws commonly used for similar reactions.\n\nResultsRecommending kinetic laws and other analyses of reaction networks can be viewed as a classification problem. Existing approaches to determining similar reactions rely heavily on having good annotations, a condition that is often unsatisfied in model repositories such as BioModels. I developed an annotation-independent approach to find similar reactions via reaction classifications. I proposed a two-dimensional kinetics classification scheme (2DK) that analyzed reactions along the dimensions of kinetics type (K type) and reaction type (R type). I identified approximately ten mutually exclusive K types, including zeroth order, mass action, Michaelis-Menten, Hill kinetics, and others. R types were organized by the number of distinct reactants and the number of distinct products in reactions. I constructed a tool, SBMLKinetics, that inputted a collection of SBML models and then calculated reaction classifications as the probability of each 2DK class. The effectiveness of 2DK was evaluated on BioModels, and the scheme classified over 95% of the reactions.\n\nConclusions2DK had many applications. It provided a data-driven annotation-independent approach to recommending kinetic laws by using type common for the kind of models in combination with the R type of the reactions. Alternatively, 2DK could also be used to alert users that a kinetic law was unusual for the K type and R type. Last, 2DK provided a way to analyze groups of models to compare their kinetic laws. I applied 2DK to BioModels to compare the kinetics of signaling networks with the kinetics of metabolic networks and found significant differences in K type distributions.",

Although the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on feline health are poorly characterized, cats have close contact with humans, and with both domesticated and wild animals. Accordingly, they could act as a reservoir of infection, an intermediate host and a source of novel variants. To investigate the spread of the virus in the cat population, serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by ELISA and a pseudotype-based virus neutralization assay, designed to detect exposure to variants known to be circulating in the human population. Overall seroprevalence was 3.2%, peaking at 5.3% in autumn 2021. Variant-specific neutralizing antibody responses were detected with titers waning over time. The variant-specific response in the feline population correlated with and trailed the variants circulating in the human population, indicating multiple ongoing human-to-cat spill-over events.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible respiratory pathogen whose main transmission route is airborne. Development of an animal model and exposure system that recapitulates airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is integral for understanding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread in individuals and populations. Here we designed, built, and characterized a hamster transmission caging and exposure system that allows for efficient SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission from an infected index animal to naive recipients under unidirectional airflow, without contribution from fomite or direct contact transmission. To validate our system, we assessed a 1:1 or 1:4 ratio of infected index to naive recipient hamsters and compared their virological and clinical measurements after eight hours of airborne exposure. Airborne exposure concentrations and pulmonary deposited dose of SARS-CoV-2 in index and naive hamsters, respectively, were similar in both groups. Daily nasal viral RNA levels, and terminal (day 5) lung viral RNA and infectious virus, and fecal viral RNA levels were statistically similar among 1:1 and 1:4 naive animals. However, virological measurements in the 1:4 naive animals were more variable than the 1:1 naive animals, likely due to hamster piling behavior creating uneven SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the grouped 1:4 airborne exposure. This resulted in slight, but not statistically significant, changes in daily body weights between the 1:1 and 1:4 naive groups. Our report describes a multi-chamber caging and exposure system that allowed for efficient SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in single and grouped hamsters. This system can be used to better define airborne transmission dynamics and test transmission-blocking therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nImportanceThe main route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is airborne. However, there are few experimental systems that can assess airborne transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Here, we designed, built, and characterized a hamster transmission caging and exposure system that allows for efficient SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in Syrian hamsters, without contributions from fomite or direct contact transmission. We successfully measured SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in aerosols and demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently at either a 1:1 or 1:4 infected index to naive recipient hamster ratio. This is meaningful as a 1:4 infected index to naive hamster ratio would allow for simultaneous comparisons of various interventions in naive animals to determine their susceptibility of infection by aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Our SARS-CoV-2 exposure system allows for testing viral airborne transmission dynamics and transmission-blocking therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian hamsters.",

It is not clear whether the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection of PNS and CNS neurons is similar, and which are the key factors that cause neurological disease: SARS-CoV-2 infection or the subsequent immune response. Here, we addressed these questions by infecting human induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived CNS and PNS neurons with the {beta} strain of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 infects PNS neurons more efficiently than CNS neurons, despite lower expression levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Infected PNS neurons produced interferon {lambda}1, several interferon stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines. They also displayed neurodegenerative-like alterations, as indicated by increased levels of sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin receptor motif-containing protein 1, amyloid precursor protein and -synuclein and lower levels of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 and {beta}-III-tubulin. Interestingly, blockade of the Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway by Ruxolitinib did not increase SARS-CoV-2 infection, but reduced neurodegeneration, suggesting that an exacerbated neuronal innate immune response contributes to pathogenesis in the PNS.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing and devastating pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global public health crisis. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can potentially pose a serious risk to maternal and neonatal health. Cases of abnormal pregnancy and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to foetus have been reported but no firm conclusions are drawn. Trophoblasts are the major constituents of the placenta to protect and nourish the developing foetus. However, direct in vivo investigation of trophoblasts susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and of COVID-19 and pregnancy is challenging. Here we report that human early syncytiotrophoblasts (eSTBs) are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-dependent manner. From human expanded potential stem cells (hEPSCs), we derived bona fide trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) that resembled those originated from the blastocyst and the placenta in generating functional syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs) and extravillus trophoblasts (EVTs) and in low expression of HLA-A/B and amniotic epithelial (AME) cell signature. The EPSC-TSCs and their derivative trophoblasts including trophoblast organoids could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, eSTBs expressed high levels of ACE2 and produced substantially higher amounts of virion than Vero E6 cells which are widely used in SARS-CoV-2 research and vaccine production. These findings provide experimental evidence for the clinical observations that opportunistic SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy can occur. At low concentrations, two well characterized antivirals, remdesivir and GC376, effectively eliminated infection of eSTBs by SARS-CoV-2 and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and rescued their developmental arrest caused by the virus infection. Several human cell lines have been used in coronavirus research. However, they suffer from genetic and/or innate immune defects and have some of the long-standing technical challenges such as cell transfection and genetic manipulation. In contrast, hEPSCs are normal human stem cells that are robust in culture, genetically stable and permit efficient gene-editing. They can produce and supply large amounts of physiologically relevant normal and genome-edited human cells such as eSTBs for isolation, propagation and production of coronaviruses for basic research, antivirus drug tests and safety evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Herring gulls are one of the few species that thrive in anthropogenic landscapes and their familiarity with people makes them an excellent target for studies of inter-species social cognition. Urban gulls pay attention to human behaviour in food-related contexts and we set out to investigate whether such cues can be used to redirect a gulls attention to potential food items in their environment. Herring gulls were given free choice of two differently coloured anthropogenic food items in the presence of a demonstrator, who was either sitting still or pretending to eat food from an item that matched one of the secondary food items. We found that a demonstrator mimicking eating significantly increased the likelihood of an approach or peck. Furthermore, 95% of pecks were directed towards the secondary food item which colour-matched the demonstrators food item. The results show situation-dependent attentional modulation in gulls, whereby gulls are able to use human cues for stimulus enhancement and foraging decisions. Given the relatively recent history of urbanisation in herring gulls, this cross-species social information transfer is likely to be a by-product of the cognitive flexibility inherent in kleptoparasitic species.",

This integration relies on the coordinated responses from distinct striatal cell types. While previous studies have characterized the cellular and molecular composition of the striatum using single-cell RNA-sequencing at distinct developmental timepoints, the molecular changes spanning embryonic through postnatal development at the single-cell level have not been examined. Here, we combine published mouse striatal single-cell datasets from both embryonic and postnatal timepoints to analyze the developmental trajectory patterns and transcription factor regulatory networks within striatal cell types. Using this integrated dataset, we found that dopamine receptor-1 expressing spiny projection neurons have an extended period of postnatal development with greater transcriptional complexity compared to dopamine receptor-2 expressing neurons. Moreover, we found the transcription factor, FOXP1, exerts indirect changes to oligodendrocytes.

Voluntary attention, the prioritization of sensory information at relevant time points, enhances visual perception, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. To determine whether and how voluntary temporal attention dynamically modulates visual cortical activity, we continuously tracked visual cortical responses using a flickering noise stimulus and MEG recording while human observers performed a temporal attention task. We found two neural signatures of voluntary temporal attention: First, cortical response reliability gradually ramped up in anticipation of the predictable onset of visual targets, with the slope of the ramp modulated by temporal attention. Second, the impact of a target on the cortical response to the flicker was larger when that target was temporally attended. These data reveal how temporal attention dynamically modulates visual cortical responses to prioritize sensory information at precise moments.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting 1-2% of the global population with no cure to date. PD is characterized by accumulation of Lewy Bodies (LBs), which are caused due to aggregation of incorrectly folded -Synuclein, (SNCA). Another form of PD manifestation is characterized by loss of function of parkin, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Despite extensive research, the cause for onset and progression of PD remains unknown and current therapeutics mainly help manage the disease. An alternative line of treatment can be useful.\n\nIn this study, we have employed two different genetic models of Drosophila to screen for Ayurvedic compounds and found an Ayurvedic mercury based organo-metallic drug Ras-Sindoor has neuroprotective function. Our data indicate that characteristic locomotory dysfunction phenotype of PD is restored upon administration of the compound. Interestingly, RS fed flies also exhibit reduced transcript levels of initiator caspase dronc, which possibly prevents cell death in dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, RS fed PD model flies exhibit an enhanced life span. Our studies emphasize beneficial use of traditional Ayurvedic compounds as a holistic cure for PD like multifactorial diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is well-established that individuals with autism show atypical functional brain connectivity. However, the role this plays in behavior, especially in naturalistic social settings, has remained unclear. Some atypical patterns may reflect core deficits, while others may instead compensate for deficits and promote adaptive behavior. Distinguishing these possibilities requires measuring the  typicality of spontaneous behavior and determining which connectivity patterns correlate with it.\n\nMethodsThirty-nine male participants (19 autism, 20 typically-developed) engaged in 115 spontaneous conversations with an experimenter during fMRI scanning (Jasmin, et al., 2019, Brain). A classifier algorithm was trained to distinguish participants by diagnosis based on 81 semantic, affective and linguistic dimensions derived from their use of language. The algorithms certainty that a participant was in either the autism or typical group was used as a measure of task performance and compared with functional connectivity levels.\n\nResultsThe algorithm accurately classified participants (74%, P = .002), and its scores correlated with clinician-observed autism signs (ADOS) (rs = .56, P = .03). In support of a compensatory role, greater functional connectivity, most prominently between left-hemisphere social communication regions and right inferior frontal cortex, correlated with more typical language behaviour, only for the autism group (rs = .56, P = .01).\n\nConclusionWe report a simple and highly generalizable method for quantifying behavioral performance and neural compensation during complex spontaneous social behavior, without the need for an a priori benchmark. The findings suggest that functional connectivity increases in autism during communication reflect a neural compensation strategy.",

    "abstract": "Radial glial cells (RGCs) are essential for the generation and organization of neurons in the cerebral cortex. RGCs have an elongated bipolar morphology with basal and apical endfeet which reside in distinct niches. Yet, how this subcellular compartmentalization of RGCs controls cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we employ in vivo proximity labeling using unfused BirA to generate the first subcellular proteome of RGCs and uncover new principles governing local control of cortical development. We discover a cohort of proteins that are significantly enriched in RGC basal endfeet, with MYH9 and MYH10 among the most abundant. Myh9 and Myh10 transcripts also localize to endfeet with distinct temporal dynamics. Although they each encode isoforms of non-muscle myosin II heavy chain, Myh9 and Myh10 have drastically different requirements for RGC integrity. Myh9 loss from RGCs decreases branching complexity and causes endfoot protrusion through the basement membrane. In contrast, Myh10 controls endfoot adhesion, as mutants have unattached apical and basal endfeet. Finally, we show that Myh9- and Myh10-mediated regulation of RGC complexity and endfoot position non-cell autonomously controls interneuron number and organization in the marginal zone. Our study demonstrates the utility of in vivo proximity labeling for dissecting local control of complex systems, and reveals new mechanisms for dictating RGC integrity and cortical architecture.",

PCP discoordinates hippocampal ensemble action potential discharge and impairs cognitive control in rats, but how this uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist impairs cognition remains unknown.\n\nMethodsThe effects of PCP were investigated i) on hippocampal CA1 ensemble action potential discharge in vivo in urethane-anesthetized rats and during awake behavior in mice; ii) on synaptic responses in ex vivo mouse hippocampus slices; iii) in mice on a hippocampus-dependent active place avoidance task that requires cognitive control; and iv) on activating the molecular machinery of translation in acute hippocampus slices. Mechanistic causality was assessed by comparing the PCP effects to the effects of inhibitors of protein synthesis, group-1-type metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5), and subunit-selective NMDARs.\n\nResultsConsistent with ionotropic actions, PCP discoordinated CA1 ensemble action potential discharge. PCP caused hyperactivity, and impaired active place avoidance, despite learning the task before PCP. Consistent with metabotropic actions, PCP exaggerated protein-synthesis dependent DHPG-induced mGluR1/5-stimulated long-term synaptic depression (LTD).

    "abstract": "Microglial endolysosomal (dys)function is strongly implicated in neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic studies show that a microglial state characterised by a set of genes involved in endolysosomal function is induced in both mouse Alzheimers Disease (AD) models and in human AD brain and that the onset of this state is emphasized in females. Cst7 (encoding protein Cystatin F) is among the most highly upregulated genes in these microglia. However, despite such striking and robust upregulation, the sex-specific function of Cst7 in neurodegenerative disease is not understood. Here, we crossed Cst7-/- mice with the AppNL-G-F mouse to test the role of Cst7 in a model of amyloid-driven AD. Surprisingly, we found that Cst7 plays a sexually dimorphic role regulating microglia in this model. In females, Cst7-deficient microglia had greater endolysosomal gene expression, lysosomal burden, and amyloid beta (A{beta}) burden in vivo and were more phagocytic in vitro. However, in males, Cst7-deficient microglia were less inflammatory and had a reduction in lysosomal burden but had no change in A{beta} burden. This study has important implications for AD research, confirming the functional role of a gene which is commonly upregulated in disease models, but also raising crucial questions on sexual dimorphism in neurodegenerative disease and the interplay between endolysosomal and inflammatory pathways in AD pathology.",

The role of active dendrites in shaping spiking responses, in particular, is unclear. Although existing models account for active dendrites and spiking responses, they are too complex to analyze analytically and demand long stochastic simulations. Here we combined cable and renewal theory to describe how input fluctuations shape the response of neuronal ensembles with active dendrites. We found that dendritic input readily and potently controls interspike interval dispersion. This phenomenon can be understood by considering that neurons display three fundamental operating regimes: one mean-driven regime and two fluctuation-driven regimes. We show that these results are expected to appear for a wide range of dendritic properties and verify the predictions of the model in experimental data.

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key regulator of systemic phosphate homeostasis, but also an interplay with glucose metabolism has been suggested. Several studies implicate a function of FGF23 in the brain, and indeed we have recently identified FGF23 protein in several brain areas in rats, such as the hypothalamus, third ventricle and choroid plexus. In the current study, we aimed to determine the effect of an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of FGF23 in the third ventricle of rats on hypothalamic genes involved in glucose regulation. In addition, we assessed whether glycerol can be used safely for icv injections as glycerol is used as a stabilizing compound for FGF23 protein.\n\nAdult Wistar rats received an icv injection of recombinant rat FGF23 or vehicle. Dose dependent behavioral changes, suggestive of stress, were observed directly after infusion of FGF23. After 60 min animals were sacrificed and the arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus and choroid plexus were isolated. In these brain regions gene expression was determined of the FGF23 receptor complex (FGFR1, Klotho), NPY, POMC, phosphate transporters (SLC20 and SLC34 families) and markers of cellular ER stress (ATF4 and the ratio of spliced/unspliced XBP1).\n\nWe showed that glycerol is well tolerated as stabilizer for icv injections. In FGF23-treated animals, cellular ER stress markers were increased in the arcuate nucleus. FGF23 injection did not affect expression of its receptor complex, NPY, POMC, or phosphate transporters. Future studies are warranted to investigate the effect of FGF23 in the brain on the protein level and on neuronal activation.",

However, its epigenetic regulation is still largely unknown, thus limiting our understanding of a fundamental process for species propagation.

We integrate Hi-C with ChIP-seq experiments using METALoci, a novel genome spatial auto-correlation analysis that identifies 3D enhancer hubs across the genome. We uncover a prominent rewiring of chromatin interactions during sex determination, affecting the enhancer hubs of hundreds of genes that display temporal- and sex-specific expression. Moreover, the identification of the 3D enhancer hubs allows the reconstruction of regulatory networks, revealing key transcription factors involved in sex determination. By combining predictive approaches and validations in transgenic mice we identify a novel Fgf9 regulatory hub, deletion of which results in male-to-female sex reversal with the upregulation of ovarian-specific markers and the initiation of meiosis. Thus, spatial auto-correlation analysis is an effective strategy to identify regulatory networks associated to biological processes and to further characterize the functional role of the 3D genome.",

However, we find that CRs do not undergo centriole amplification or multiciliation. We show that upon genetic disruption of Gmnc, the master regulator of the multiciliation cascade, CRs are initially produced but fail to reach their normal identity and lean towards an aberrant fate resulting in their massive apoptosis. We further dissect the contribution of multiciliation effector genes and identify Trp73 as a key determinant. Finally, we use in utero electroporation to demonstrate that the intrinsic competence of hem progenitors as well as the heterochronic expression of Gmnc prevent centriole amplification in the CR lineage. Our work exemplifies how the co-option of a complete gene module, repurposed to control a completely distinct process, may contribute to the emergence of novel cell identities.",

    "abstract": "The development of the visceral musculature of the Drosophila midgut encompasses a closely coordinated sequence of migration events of cells from the trunk and caudal visceral mesoderm, respectively, that underlies the formation of the stereotypic orthogonal pattern of circular and longitudinal midgut muscles. Our current study focuses on the last step of migration and morphogenesis of the longitudinal visceral muscle precursors derived from the caudal mesoderm. We show that these multinucleated muscle precursors utilize dynamic filopodial extensions to migrate in dorsal and ventral directions over the forming midgut tube. The establishment of maximal dorsoventral distances from one another and subsequent alignment with their anteroposterior neighbors leads to the equidistant coverage of the midgut with longitudinal muscle fibers. We identify Teyrha-Meyhra (Tey), a tissue-specific nuclear factor related to the RNF220 domain protein family, as a crucial regulator of this process of muscle migration and morphogenesis that is further required for proper differentiation of the longitudinal visceral muscles. In addition, Tey is expressed in a single type of somatic muscle founder cell in each hemisegment. Tey regulates the migration of this founder cell and is required for the proper pathfinding of its developing myotube to specific myotendinous attachment sites.",

    "abstract": "Defining pattern formation mechanisms during embryonic development is important for understanding the etiology of birth defects and to inform tissue engineering approaches. In this study, we used tricaine, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) inhibitor, to show that VGSC activity is required for normal skeletal patterning in Lytechinus variegatus sea urchin larvae. We demonstrate that tricaine-mediated patterning defects are rescued by an anesthetic-insensitive version of the VGSC LvScn5a. Expression of this channel is enriched in the ventrolateral ectoderm where it spatially overlaps with posterolaterally expressed Wnt5. We show that VGSC activity is required to spatially restrict Wnt5 expression to this ectodermal region that is adjacent and instructive to clusters of primary mesenchymal cells that initiate secretion of the larval skeleton as triradiates. Tricaine-mediated Wnt5 spatial expansion correlates with the formation of ectopic PMC clusters and triradiates. These defects are rescued by Wnt5 knock down, indicating that the spatial expansion Wnt5 is responsible for the patterning defects induced by VGSC inhibition. These results demonstrate a novel connection between bioelectrical status and the spatial control of patterning cue expression during embryonic pattern formation.\n\nSummary statementInhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels perturbs Wnt5-mediated patterning of the sea urchin larval skeleton",

    "abstract": "Children undergoing cancer treatments are at risk for impaired fertility. Cryopreserved prepubertal testicular biopsies could theoretically be later matured in vitro to produce spermatozoa for assisted reproductive technology. A complete in vitro spermatogenesis has been obtained from mouse prepubertal testicular tissue, although with low efficiency. Steroid hormones being essential for the progression of spermatogenesis, the aim of this study was to investigate steroidogenesis and steroid signaling in organotypic cultures. Histological, RT-qPCR, western blot analyses and steroid hormone measurements were performed on in vitro cultured mouse prepubertal testicular tissues and age-matched in vivo controls. Despite a conserved density of Leydig cells after 30 days of culture (D30), transcript levels of adult Leydig cell and steroidogenic markers were decreased. Increased amounts of progesterone and estradiol and reduced androstenedione levels were observed at D30, together with decreased transcript levels of steroid metabolizing genes and steroid target genes. hCG was insufficient to facilitate Leydig cell differentiation, restore steroidogenesis and improve sperm yield. In conclusion, this study reports the failure of adult Leydig cell development and altered steroid production and signaling in tissue cultures. The organotypic culture system will need to be further improved before it can be translated in clinics for childhood cancer survivors.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent network models are instrumental in investigating how behaviorally-relevant computations emerge from collective neural dynamics. A recently developed class of models based on low-rank connectivity provides an analytically tractable framework for understanding of how connectivity structure determines the geometry of low-dimensional dynamics and the ensuing computations. Such models however lack some fundamental biological constraints, and in particular represent individual neurons in terms of abstract units that communicate through continuous firing rates rather than discrete action potentials. Here we examine how far the theoretical insights obtained from low-rank rate networks transfer to more biologically plausible networks of spiking neurons. Adding a low-rank structure on top of random excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, we systematically compare the geometry of activity in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons to rate networks with statistically equivalent low-rank connectivity. We show that the mean-field predictions of rate networks allow us to identify low-dimensional dynamics at constant population-average activity in spiking networks, as well as novel non-linear regimes of activity such as out-of-phase oscillations and slow manifolds. We finally exploit these results to directly build spiking networks that perform nonlinear computations.\n\nAuthor summaryBehaviorally relevant information processing is believed to emerge from interactions among neurons forming networks in the brain, and computational modeling is an important approach for understanding this process. Models of neuronal networks have been developed at different levels of detail, with typically a trade off between analytic tractability and biological realism. The relation between network connectivity, dynamics and computations is best understood in abstract models where individual neurons are represented as simplified units with continuous firing activity. Here we examine how far the results obtained in a specific, analytically-tractable class of rate models extend to more biologically realistic spiking networks where neurons interact through discrete action potentials. Our results show that abstract rate models provide accurate predictions for the collective dynamics and the resulting computations in more biologically faithful spiking networks.",

    "abstract": "The malaise symptoms of cybersickness are thought to be related to the sensory conflict present in the exposure to virtual reality (VR) content. When there is a sensory mismatch in the process of sensory perception, the perceptual estimate has been shown to change based on a reweighting mechanism between the relative contributions of the individual sensory signals involved. In this study, the reweighting of vestibular and body signals was assessed before and after exposure to different typical VR experiences and sickness severity was measured to investigate the relationship between susceptibility to cybersickness and sensory reweighting. Participants reported whether a visually presented line was rotated clockwise or counterclockwise from vertical while laying on their side in a subjective visual vertical (SVV) task. Task performance was recorded prior to VR exposure and after a low and high intensity VR game. The results show that the SVV was significantly shifted away from the body representation of upright and towards the vestibular signal after exposure to the high intensity VR game. Cybersickness measured using the fast motion sickness (FMS) scale found that sickness severity ratings were higher in the high intensity compared to the low intensity experience. The change in SVV from baseline after each VR exposure modelled using a simple 3-parameter gaussian regression fit was found to explain 49.5% of the variance in the FMS ratings. These results highlight the aftereffects of VR for sensory perception and suggests a potential relationship between the susceptibility to cybersickness and sensory reweighting.",

    "abstract": "Recent development of large-scale activity imaging of neuronal ensembles provides opportunities for understanding how activity patterns are generated in the brain and how information is transmitted between neurons or neuronal ensembles. However, methodologies for extracting the component properties that generate overall dynamics are still limited. In this study, the results of time-lapse 3D imaging (4D imaging) of head neurons of the nematode C. elegans were analyzed by hitherto unemployed methodologies.\n\nBy combining time-delay embedding with independent component analysis, the whole-brain activities were decomposed to a small number of component dynamics. Results from multiple samples, where different subsets of neurons were observed, were further combined by matrix factorization, revealing common dynamics from neuronal activities that are apparently divergent across sampled animals. By this analysis, we could identify components that show common relationships across different samples and those that show relationships distinct between individual samples.\n\nWe also constructed a network model building on time-lagged prediction models of synaptic communications. This was achieved by dimension reduction of 4D imaging data using the general framework gKDR (gradient kernel dimension reduction). The model is able to decompose basal dynamics of the network. We further extended the model by incorporating probabilistic distribution, resulting in models that we call gKDR-GMM and gKDR-GP. The models capture the overall relationships of neural activities and reproduce the stochastic but coordinated dynamics in the neural network simulation. By virtual manipulation of individual neurons and synaptic contacts in this model, information flow could be estimated from whole-brain imaging results.",

    "abstract": "The stomach-derived hormone ghrelin motivates food search and stimulates food consumption, with highest plasma concentrations before a meal and lowest shortly after. However, ghrelin also appears to affect the value of non-food rewards such as interaction with rat conspecifics, and monetary rewards in humans. The present pre-registered study investigated how nutritional state and ghrelin concentrations are related to the subjective and neural responses to social and non-social rewards.\n\nIn a cross-over feed-and-fast design, 67 healthy volunteers (20 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a hungry state and after a meal with repeated plasma ghrelin measurements. In task 1, participants received social rewards in the form of approving expert feedback, or non-social computer reward. In task 2, participants rated the pleasantness of compliments and neutral statements.\n\nNutritional state and ghrelin concentrations did not affect the response to social reward in task 1. In contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortical activation to non-social rewards was reduced when the meal strongly suppressed ghrelin. In task 2, fasting increased activation in the right ventral striatum during all statements, but ghrelin concentrations were neither associated with brain activation nor with experienced pleasantness. Complementary Bayesian analyses provided moderate evidence for a lack of correlation between ghrelin concentrations and behavioral and neural responses to social rewards, but moderate evidence for an association between ghrelin and non-social rewards.\n\nThis suggests that ghrelins influence may be restricted to non-social rewards. Social rewards implemented via social recognition and affirmation may be too abstract and complex to be susceptible to ghrelins influence. In contrast, the non-social reward was associated with the expectation of a material object that was handed out after the experiment. This may indicate that ghrelin might be involved in anticipatory rather than consummatory phases of reward.",

    "abstract": "To survive in a complex and changing environment, animals must adapt their behavior. This ability is called behavioral flexibility and is classically evaluated by a reversal learning paradigm. During such a paradigm, the animals adapt their behavior according to a change of the reward contingencies. To study these complex cognitive functions (from outcome evaluation to motor adaptation), we developed a versatile, low-cost, open-source platform, allowing us to investigate the neuronal correlates of behavioral flexibility with 1-photon calcium imaging. This platform consists of FreiBox, a novel low-cost Arduino behavioral setup, as well as further open-source tools which we developed and integrated into our framework. FreiBox is controlled by a custom Python interface and integrates a new licking sensor (Strain Gauge lickometer) for controlling spatial licking behavioral tasks. In addition to allowing both discriminative and serial reversal learning, the Arduino can track mouse licking behavior in real time to control task events in a sub-millisecond timescale. To complete our setup, we also developed and validated an affordable commutator, crucial for recording calcium imaging with the Miniscope V4 in freely moving mice. Further, we demonstrated that FreiBox can be associated with 1-photon imaging and other open-source initiatives (e.g., Open Ephys), to form a versatile platform for exploring the neuronal substrates of licking based behavioral flexibility in mice. The combination of the FreiBox behavioral setup and our low-cost commutator represents a highly competitive and complementary addition to the recently emerging battery of open-source initiatives.\n\nSignificance StatementBehavioral flexibility is essential to survive in a complex and changing environment.

    "abstract": "The IL-2 receptor -chain (IL-2R/CD25) is constitutively expressed on DN2/DN3 thymocytes and Treg cells but induced by IL-2 on mature T and NK cells. Il2ra expression is regulated by a super-enhancer extensively bound by STAT5 in mature T cells. Here, we demonstrate that STAT5 cooperates with Notch to induce/maintain Il2ra/CD25 expression in DN2/DN3 cells. Moreover, we systematically investigated CD25 regulation using a series of mice with deletions spanning STAT5 binding elements. Deleting the upstream super-enhancer region mainly affected constitutive CD25 expression on DN2/DN3 thymocytes and Tregs, whereas deleting an intronic region primarily decreased IL-2-induced CD25 on peripheral T and NK cells. Thus, distinct elements preferentially control constitutive versus inducible expression in a cell-type-specific manner, with the MED1 coactivator co-localizing with specific STAT5 binding sites. Moreover, the intronic region was a dominant element whose deletion altered the structure throughout the super-enhancer in mature T cells. These results demonstrate differential functions for distinct super-enhancer elements, thereby indicating ways to manipulate CD25 expression in a cell-type specific fashion.",

    "abstract": "Proteases play key roles in viral replication cycles. They can provide cleavage maturation of viral glycoproteins, processing of viral polyproteins, or disassembly of viral capsids. Thus, proteases constitute ideal targets for antiviral intervention - pharmaceutically, by small molecule inhibitors, or naturally, by host immune responses. Indeed, we and others have shown that individual members of the Serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) family have specific antiviral function by blocking proteolytic steps inherent to viral replication cycles. Whether additional members of the large SERPIN family possess antiviral activity and whether SERPINs function as part of the antiviral cell-intrinsic immune response, is currently unknown. Here, we found that specific SERPINs are produced upon infection with clinically relevant respiratory viruses in vitro and in vivo, and in concert with classical interferon-stimulated genes. We next developed a structure-based in silico screen to uncover non-canonical SERPIN-protease pairs. We identified several SERPINs with potential antiviral function, including: SERPINE1 targeting cathepsin L, required for SARS-CoV-2 entry; SERPINB8 targeting furin, required for glycoprotein maturation cleavage of numerous viruses; and SERPINB2 targeting adenovirus protease, which suggests the first direct-acting antiviral SERPIN. Our study demonstrates how proteolysis is modulated for antiviral defense and how this process could inform antiviral targets against clinically relevant respiratory pathogens.",

Pteridic acids induce stress response genes expression in salinity-stressed Arabidopsis seedlings. The bifunctional biosynthetic gene cluster of pteridic acids and antimicrobial elaiophylin is confirmed in vivo and mainly disseminated by vertical transmission which is geographically distributed in various environments.

Single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics of adult uteri revealed new markers of uterine epithelial stem cells, identified luminal and glandular progenitor cells, and defined a glandular epithelial differentiation trajectory. Neonatal DES exposure disrupted uterine epithelial differentiation, resulting in widespread activation of Wnt signaling and a failure to generate epithelial stem cells or distinguishable glandular and luminal epithelial cells.

In 87% of cases our procedure yielded a model with at least 50% of C atoms matching those in the deposited models within 2[A]. Predictions from our iterative template-guided prediction procedure were more accurate than those obtained without templates. We suggest a general strategy for macromolecular structure determination that includes AI-based prediction both as a starting point and as a method of model optimization.",

    "abstract": "eIF2A was the first eukaryotic initiator tRNA carrier discovered but its exact function has remained enigmatic. Uncharacteristic of translation initiation factors, eIF2A is reported to be non-cytosolic in multiple human cancer cell lines. Attempts to study eIF2A mechanistically have been limited by the inability to achieve high yield of soluble recombinant protein. Here, we developed a purification paradigm that yields [~]360-fold and [~]6,000-fold more recombinant human eIF2A from E. coli and insect cells, respectively, than previous reports. Using a mammalian in vitro translation system, we found that increased levels of recombinant human eIF2A inhibit translation of multiple reporter mRNAs, including those that are translated by cognate and near-cognate start codons, and does so prior to start codon recognition. eIF2A also inhibited translation directed by all four types of cap-independent viral IRESs, including the CrPV IGR IRES that does not require initiation factors or initiator tRNA, suggesting excess eIF2A sequesters 40S subunits. Supplementation with additional 40S subunits prevented eIF2A-mediated inhibition and pull-down assays demonstrated direct binding between recombinant eIF2A and purified 40S subunits. These data support a model that eIF2A must be kept away from the translation machinery to avoid sequestering 40S ribosomal subunits.",

    "abstract": "Remediation using micro-algae offers an attractive solution to environmental phosphate (Pi) pollution. However, for maximum efficiency, pre-conditioning of algae to induce  luxury phosphorus (P) uptake is needed. Here we show that natural pre-conditioning can be mimicked through over-expression of a single gene, the global regulator PSR1 (Myb transcription factor: Phosphate Starvation Response 1), raising P levels to 8% dry cell weight from 2% in control. Complete removal of Pi occurred in log phase, unlike the control. This was associated with increases in PolyP granule size and uptake of Mg2+, the principal counterion. Hyper-accumulation of P depended on a feed-forward mechanism, where a small set of  Class I genes were activated despite abundant external Pi levels. This drove a reduction in external Pi levels, permitting more genes to be expressed (Class II), leading to more Pi-uptake. These discoveries enable a bio-circular approach of recycling nutrients from wastewater back to agriculture.\n\nTeaserManipulating a single gene drove uptake of P and a Mg2+ counter-ion for increased PolyP accumulation.",

In the HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus)-type E3 ligases, the HECT domain is composed of an N-lobe containing the E2-binding site and a C-lobe containing the catalytic Cys residue that forms a thioester bond with Ub. These two lobes are connected by a flexible hinge loop. The large conformational rearrangement of the HECT domain via the flexible hinge loop is essential for HECT-type E3-mediated Ub transfer from E2 to a target protein. However, detailed insights into the structural dynamics of this type of E3 ligases remain unclear. Here, we provide the first direct demonstration of structural dynamics of the E6AP HECT domain using high-speed atomic force microscopy. We also investigated structural dynamics of hinge loop flexibility restricted HECT domain, and we found that flexibility of the E6AP hinge loop has a great impact not only on its structural dynamics but also on the formation of free Ub chains mediated by E3-E3 interactions.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblasts substantially remodel extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to tissue injury and generate fibrotic scars in chronic diseases. Recent studies have identified diverse fibroblast subsets in healthy and injured tissues. However, the origin(s) and functional importance of injury-induced fibroblast lineages remain unclear. Here we show that alveolar fibroblasts, which provide a niche for maintaining alveolar type 2 cells in uninjured lungs, are the dominant source of multiple emergent fibroblast subsets that sequentially arise to facilitate fibrosis after lung injury. We demonstrate that Cthrc1+ fibroblasts, which express the highest levels of ECM proteins at injured sites, are effector cells for fibrogenesis using a novel mouse tool, Cthrc1-CreER. We use another novel mouse tool, Scube2-CreER, that uniquely targets alveolar fibroblasts, to reveal that alveolar fibroblasts are the dominant origin for multiple fibroblast subsets that emerge after lung injury. Pseudotime and in vitro analysis suggest that inflammatory cytokines initially induce chemokine-producing inflammatory fibroblasts from alveolar fibroblasts, which can differentiate into Cthrc1+ fibrotic fibroblasts in response to TGF-{beta}. We identify similar fibroblast lineages from scRNA-seq in human pulmonary fibrosis. These results elucidate the pathologic fibroblast lineage development in response to lung injury and suggest that targeting key steps in transitions among these subsets could provide novel strategies for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.",

    "abstract": "While it is well-known that mechanical signals can either promote or disrupt intervertebral disc (IVD) homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms for transducing mechanical stimuli are not fully understood. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel activated in isolated IVD cells initiates extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression, while TRPV4 ablation reduces cytokine production in response to circumferential stretching. However, the role of TRPV4 on ECM maintenance during tissue-level mechanical loading remains unknown. Using an organ culture model, we modulated TRPV4 function over both short-(hours) and long-term (days) and evaluated IVDs response. Activating TRPV4 with the agonist GSK101 resulted in a Ca2+ flux propagating across the cells within the IVD. NF-{kappa}B signaling in the IVD peaked at 6 hours following TRPV4 activation that subsequently resulted in higher IL-6 production at 7 days. These cellular responses were concomitant with the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and increased hydration in the nucleus pulposus that culminated in higher stiffness of the IVD. Sustained compressive loading of the IVD resulted in elevated NF-{kappa}B activity, IL-6 and VEGF-A production, and degenerative changes to the ECM. TRPV4 inhibition using GSK205 during loading mitigated the changes in inflammatory cytokines, protected against IVD degeneration, and but could not prevent ECM disorganization due to mechanical damage in the annulus fibrosus. These results indicate TRPV4 plays an important role in both short-and long-term adaptations of the IVD to mechanical loading. The modulation of TRPV4 may be a possible therapeutic for preventing load-induced IVD degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Despite several promising candidates there is a paucity of drug treatments available for patients suffering from retinal diseases. An important reason for this is the lack of suitable delivery systems that can achieve sufficiently high drug uptake in the retina and its photoreceptors. A promising and versatile method for drug delivery to specific cell types involves liposomes, surface-coated with substrates for transporter proteins highly expressed on the target cell.\n\nWe identified strong lactate transporter (monocarboxylate transporter, MCT) expression on photoreceptors as a potential target for drug delivery vehicles. To evaluate MCT suitability for drug targeting, we used PEG-coated liposomes and conjugated these with different monocarboxylates, including lactate, pyruvate, and cysteine. Monocarboxylate-conjugated dye-loaded liposomes were tested on both human-derived cell-lines and murine retinal explant cultures. We found that liposomes conjugated with pyruvate consistently displayed higher cell uptake than unconjugated liposomes or liposomes conjugated with lactate or cysteine. Pharmacological inhibition of MCT1 and MCT2 reduced internalization, suggesting an MCT-mediated uptake mechanism. Pyruvate-conjugated liposomes loaded with the drug candidates CN03 and CN04 reduced photoreceptor cell death in murine rd1 and rd10 retinal degeneration models.\n\nOverall, this study proposes pyruvate-conjugated liposomes as a vehicle for drug delivery specifically to photoreceptors. Notably, in retinal degeneration models, free drug solutions could not achieve the same therapeutic effect. Our study thus highlights pyruvate-conjugated liposomes as a promising system for drug delivery to retinal photoreceptors, as well as other neuronal cell types displaying high expression of MCT-type proteins.",

    "abstract": "When infected with a virus, cells may secrete interferons (IFNs) that prompt nearby cells to prepare for upcoming infection. Reciprocally, viral proteins often interfere with IFN synthesis and IFN-induced signaling. We modeled the crosstalk between the propagating virus and the innate immune response using an agent-based stochastic approach. By analyzing immunofluorescence microscopy images we observed that the mutual antagonism between the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and infected A549 cells leads to dichotomous responses at the single-cell level and complex spatial patterns of cell signaling states. Our analysis indicates that RSV blocks innate responses at three levels: by inhibition of IRF3 activation, inhibition of IFN synthesis, and inhibition of STAT1/2 activation. In turn, proteins coded by IFN-stimulated (STAT1/2-activated) genes inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA and viral proteins. The striking consequence of these inhibitions is lack of coincidence of viral proteins and IFN expression within single cells. The model enables investigation of the impact of immunostimulatory defective viral particles and signaling network perturbations that could potentially facilitate containment or clearance of the viral infection.",

    "abstract": "PLX5622 is a small molecular inhibitor of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) and is widely used to deplete macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS). However, recent reports have indicated that PLX5622 may affect myeloid cells in other organs including the bone marrow and spleen. We investigated the impact of PLX5622 treatment in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and discovered that one-week treatment with PLX5622 was sufficient to deplete interstitial macrophages in the lung and brain-infiltrating Ly6Clow patrolling monocytes, in addition to CNS-resident macrophages. These cell types were previously indicated to act as infection reservoirs for the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. We therefore took advantage of PLX5622-mediated depletion of these myeloid cell subsets to examine their functional role in C. neoformans lung infection and extrapulmonary dissemination. We found that PLX5622-treated mice had significantly reduced fungal lung infection and reduced extrapulmonary dissemination to the CNS but not to the spleen or liver. Fungal lung infection mapped to MHCIIhi interstitial lung macrophages, which underwent significant expansion during infection following monocyte replenishment and not local division. Although PLX5622 depleted CNS infiltrating patrolling monocytes, these cells did not accumulate in the fungal-infected CNS following pulmonary infection. In addition, Nr4a1-deficient mice, which lack patrolling monocytes, had similar control and dissemination of C. neoformans infection to wild-type controls. Our data demonstrate that PLX5622 may have a beneficial effect in the control of intracellular replicating pathogenic fungi that utilise CSF1R-dependent myeloid cells as infection reservoirs.",

Genomics has emerged as a powerful tool for mining environmental microbes that may have the ability to degrade different types of plastics. In this study, we use 16S sequencing to analyze the microbiomes for multiple PS samples collected from sites with different vegetation in Taiwan to reveal potential common properties between species that have exhibit growth advantages on PS surfaces. Phylum enrichment analysis identified Cyanobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus as being the most over-represented groups on PS, and both phyla include species known to reside in extreme environments and could encode unique enzymes that grant them properties suitable for colonization on PS surfaces. Investigation of functional enrichment in PS-enriched species highlighted carbon metabolic pathways, especially those related to hydrocarbon degradation. This is corroborated by the finding that genes encoding long-chain alkane hydroxylases such as AlmA are more prevalent in the genomes of PS-associated bacteria. Our analyses illustrate how plastic in the environment support the colonization of different microbes compared to surrounding soil. In addition, our results point to the possibility that alkane hydroxylases could confer growth advantages of microbes on PS.",

    "abstract": "The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria prevents many antibiotics from reaching intracellular targets. However, some antimicrobials can take advantage of iron import transporters to cross this barrier. We showed previously that the thiopeptide antibiotic, thiocillin, exploits the nocardamine (ferrioxamine E) xenosiderophore transporter, FoxA, of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa for uptake. Here we show that FoxA also transports the xenosiderophore bisucaberin and describe at 2.5 [A] resolution the first crystal structure of bisucaberin bound to FoxA. Bisucaberin is distinct from other siderophores because it forms a 3:2 rather than 1:1 siderophore-iron complex. Mutations in a single extracellular loop of FoxA differentially affected nocardamine, thiocillin, and bisucaberin binding, uptake, and signal transduction. These results show that in addition to modulating ligand binding, the extracellular loops of siderophore transporters are of fundamental importance for controlling ligand uptake and its regulatory consequences, which has implications for the development of siderophore-antibiotic conjugates to treat difficult infections.",

    "abstract": "Common in swine production worldwide, influenza causes significant reductions in feed efficiency and potential transmission to the workforce. Swine vaccines are not universally used in swine production, partly due to their limited efficacy because of continuously evolving influenza viruses. We evaluated the effects of vaccination, quarantine of infected pigs, and changes to workforce routine (ensuring workers moved from younger pig batches to older pig batches). A Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model was used to simulate stochastic influenza transmission during a single production cycle on an indoor hog growing unit containing 4000 pigs and two workers. The absence of control practices resulted in 3,958 pigs [1 - 3972] being infected and a 0.61 probability of workforce infection. Quarantine of infected pigs the same day they became infectious was the single effective control practice, reducing the number of infected pigs to 3 [1 - 3961] and the probability of workforce infection to 0.27. The second-best control practice was mass pig vaccination (80% effective vaccine), which reduced the number of infected pigs to 23.5 [1 - 635] and the probability of workforce infection to 0.07. The third-best control practice was changing the worker routine by starting with younger to older pig batches, which reduced the number of infected pigs to 997 [1 - 1984] and the probability of workforce infection (0.22). All other control practices, when considered alone, showed little improvement in reducing total infected pigs and the probability of workforce infection. Combining all control strategies reduced the total number of infected pigs to 1 or 2 with a minimal probability of workforce infection (0.03 - 0.01). These findings suggest that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the impact of influenza on swine production and reduce the risk of interspecies transmission when efficacious vaccines are unavailable. Therefore, these results can help prevent the emergence of influenza strains with pandemic potential.",

Well-known examples of chromosomally integrated MGEs (ciMGEs) are integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements (ICEs and IMEs), and most studies to date have focused on the biological mechanisms that shape their lifestyle. It is crucial to profile the diversity and understand their distribution across the microbial community, as the number of genome sequences increases exponentially. Herein, I scanned a collection of more than 20000 bacterial and archaeal non-redundant genomes and found over 13000 ciMGEs across multiple phyla, representing a massive increase in the number of ciMGEs available in public databases (<1000). Although ICEs are the most important ciMGEs for the accretion of defense systems, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, IMEs outnumbered ICEs. Moreover, defense systems, AMR, and virulence genes were negatively correlated in both ICEs and IMEs. Multiple ciMGEs form heterogeneous communities and challenge inter-phylum barriers.

    "abstract": "Sequences that can form DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s) and intercalated-Motifs (iMs), are abundant in the human genome and play a range of physiological roles. However, they can also pose a challenge to the replication machinery and in turn threaten genome stability. Multiple lines of evidence suggest G4s interfere with replication, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Moreover, there is a lack of evidence of how iMs affect the replisome. Here, we reconstitute replication of physiologically derived structure-forming sequences to find that a single G4 or iM is sufficient to arrest DNA replication. Direct single molecule structure detection within solid-state nanopores reveals structures form as a consequence of replication. A combination of genetic and biophysical characterisation establishes that structure forming capacity is a key determinant of replisome arrest. Mechanistically, replication fork arrest is caused by impaired synthesis, resulting in helicase-polymerase uncoupling. Significantly, iMs also induce breakage of nascent DNA. Finally, stalled forks are only rescued by a specialised helicase, Pif1, but not Sgs1 or Chl1. Altogether, this study provides a potential mechanism for quadruplex structure formation and resolution during replication and highlights G4s and iMs as endogenous sources of replication stress, which may explain their genomic instability and mutation frequencies in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (IAV) of the H1N1 classical swine lineage became endemic in North American swine following the 1918 pandemic. Additional human-to-swine transmission events after 1918, and a spillover of H1 viruses from wild birds in Europe, potentiated a rapid increase in genomic diversity via reassortment between introductions and the endemic classical swine lineage. To determine mechanisms affecting reassortment and evolution, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of N1 and paired HA swine IAV genes in North America between 1930 and 2020. We described fourteen N1 clades within the N1 Eurasian avian lineage (including the N1 pandemic clade) and the N1 classical swine lineage. Seven N1 genetic clades had evidence for contemporary circulation. To assess antigenic drift associated with N1 genetic diversity, we generated a panel of representative swine N1 antisera and quantified the antigenic distance between wild-type viruses using enzyme-linked lectin assays and antigenic cartography. Within the N1 lineage, antigenic similarity was variable and reflected shared evolutionary history. Sustained circulation and evolution of N1 genes in swine had resulted in significant antigenic distance between the N1 pandemic clade and classical swine lineage. We also observed a significant increase in the rate of evolution in the N1 pandemic clade relative to the classical lineage. Between 2010 and 2020, N1 clades and N1-HA pairings fluctuated in detection frequency across North America, with hotspots of diversity generally appearing and disappearing within two years. We also identified frequent N1-HA reassortment events (n = 36), which were rarely sustained (n = 6) and sometimes also concomitant with the emergence of new N1 genetic clades (n = 3). These data form a baseline from which we can identify N1 clades that expand in range or genetic diversity that may impact viral phenotypes or vaccine immunity and subsequently the health of North American swine.",

    "abstract": "Lepidopteran insects are an important group of animals, among which some are used as biochemical and physiological model species in the insect and silk industries, whereas others are major agricultural pests. Therefore, genome sequences of several lepidopteran insects have been reported thus far. The oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, is an agricultural pest commonly used to study insect immune reactions and interactions with parasitoid wasps as hosts. To improve our understanding of these research topics, reference genome sequences were constructed in the present study. Using long-read and short-read sequence data, de novo assembly and polishing were performed, and haplotigs were purged. Subsequently, gene predictions and functional annotations were performed. To search for orthologs of the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways and C-type lectins, annotation data analysis, BLASTp, and Hummer scans were performed. The M. separata genome is 682 Mbp; its contig N50 was 2.7 Mbp with 21,970 genes and 24,452 coding sites predicted. All orthologs of the core components of the Toll and IMD pathways and 105 C-type lectins were identified. These results suggest that the genome data were of sufficient quality as reference genome data and could contribute to promoting M. separata and lepidopteran research at the molecular and genome levels.\n\nSimple SummaryThe oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, an agricultural pest, is commonly used to study insect immune reactions and interactions with parasitoid wasps. To promote such studies, a reference genome was constructed. The M. separata genome is 682Mbp long--a size comparable to that of other lepidopteran insects. The contig N50 value of the genome is 2.7 Mb, which indicates sufficient quality to be used as reference genome data. Gene set data were constructed using genome and RNA-sequencing data; a total of 21,970 genes and 24,452 coding sites were predicted. Functional gene annotation was performed using the predicted amino acid sequences and reference gene set data of the model organism and other insect species as well as Unigene and Pfam datasets. Consequently, 45-80% of the amino acid sequences were annotated using these data sets. Using these data, most of the orthologs of core components in the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways were identified, suggesting the presence of these two pathways in M. separata. Additionally, 105 C-type lectins were identified in the M. separata genome, which were more numerous than those in other insect species, suggesting that these genes may be duplicated.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal loci in bacterial cells show a robust sub-diffusive scaling of the mean square displacement, MSD({tau}) [~]{tau} , with  < 0.5. On the other hand, recent experiments have also shown that DNA-bridging Nucleoid Associated Proteins (NAPs) play an important role in chromosome organisation and compaction. Here, using polymer simulations we investigate the role of DNA bridging in determining the dynamics of chromosomal loci. We find that bridging compacts the polymer and reproduces the sub-diffusive elastic dynamics of monomers at timescales shorter than the bridge lifetime. Consistent with this prediction, we measure a higher exponent in a NAP mutant ({Delta}H-NS) compared to wild-type E. coli. Furthermore, bridging can reproduce the rare but ubiquitous rapid movements of chromosomal loci that have been observed in experiments. In our model the scaling exponent defines a relationship between the abundance of bridges and their lifetime. Using this and the observed mobility of chromosomal loci, we predict a lower bound on the average bridge lifetime of around 5 seconds.\n\nSignificance StatementThe bacterial chromosome exhibits dynamics that cannot be explained by simple polymer models. In particular, the mean square displacement of individual chromosomal loci exhibits a power law scaling with an exponent less than that predicted by polymer theory. Here, we use polymer simulations and experiments to show that DNA bridging by Nucleoid Associated Proteins can explain these anomalous dynamics. Consistent with this, we show that in the absence of the bridging protein H-NS, the scaling exponent increases. Chromosomal loci also display rare rapid movements not explainable by polymer theory, even accounting for the viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm. Our simulations show that bridging can additionally explain this behaviour. Finally, we predict a lower bound on the average bridge lifetime within cells.",

We identified consistent upregulation of poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase 14 (PARP14) in both chronic IFN{gamma}-treated cancer cells and patient melanoma with elevated IFNG expression. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of PARP14 increased effector T cell infiltration into tumours derived from cells pre-treated with IFN{gamma} and decreased the presence of regulatory T cells, leading to restoration of -PD-1 sensitivity.

Here we apply in silico bioprospecting methods followed by in vitro expression and biochemical analyses to characterise a novel low temperature lipase from the Antarctic tunicate Salpa thompsoni. A 586 amino acid pancreatic lipase-like gene was identified from S. thompsoni transcriptomic data, expressed as a hexahistadine fusion protein in Escherichia coli at 10{degrees}C and purified by affinity chromatography. Hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate {rho}-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB) showed that this recombinant protein has optimal activity at 20 {degrees}C and pH 7, and a specific activity of 3.16 U/mg under this condition. Over 60% of enzyme activity was maintained between 15 to 25 {degrees}C, with a sharp decrease outside this range. These results are indicative of cold active psychrophilic enzyme activity. A meta-analysis of lipase activities towards PNPB showed that the novel S. thompsoni lipase displays a higher activity at lower temperatures relative to previously characterised enzymes.

    "abstract": "Defense systems that recognize viruses have provided not only the tools of molecular biology but also important insights into other mechanisms that can induce immunity to these or other infectious agents including transmissible plasmids and chromosomal genetic elements. Several systems that trigger cell death upon viral infection have recently been recognized but the signals that activate these abortive infection systems remain largely unknown. Here we characterize one such system in Vibrio cholerae that we found was responsible for triggering cell-density dependent death (CDD) of bacterial cells in response to the presence of certain genetic elements. The key components of the CDD system include quorum-regulated components DdmABC and the host factor PriA. Our analysis indicates that the plasmid and phage signals that trigger CDD were palindromic DNA sequences that are predicted to form stem-loop hairpin structures from single-stranded DNA during stalled replication. Our results further suggest that other agents that generate damaged DNA can also trigger DdmABC/PriA activation and cell death probably through activation of a nuclease domain present in the DdmA protein. Thus, any infectious process that results in damaged DNA, particularly during DNA replication, can in theory trigger cell death through the DdmABC/PriA abortive infection system.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobes are increasingly (re)considered for environmental assessments because they are powerful indicators for the health of ecosystems. The complexity of microbial communities necessitates powerful novel tools to derive conclusions for environmental decision-makers, and machine learning is a promising option in that context. While amplicon sequencing is typically applied to assess microbial communities, metagenomics and total RNA sequencing (herein summarized as omics-based methods) can provide a more holistic picture of microbial biodiversity at sufficient sequencing depths. Despite this advantage, amplicon sequencing and omics-based methods have not yet been compared for taxonomy-based environmental assessments with machine learning. In this study, we applied 16S and ITS-2 sequencing, metagenomics, and total RNA sequencing to samples from a stream mesocosm experiment that investigated the impacts of two aquatic stressors, insecticide and increased fine sediment deposition, on stream biodiversity. We processed the data using similarity clustering and denoising (only applicable to amplicon sequencing) as well as multiple taxonomic levels, data types, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms and evaluated the stressor prediction performance of each generated model for a total of 1,536 evaluated combinations of taxonomic datasets and data-processing methods.\n\nResultsSequencing and data-processing methods had a substantial impact on stressor prediction. While omics-based methods detected much more taxa than amplicon sequencing, 16S sequencing outperformed all other sequencing methods in terms of stressor prediction based on the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. However, even the highest observed performance for 16S sequencing was still only moderate. Omics-based methods performed poorly overall, but this was likely due to insufficient sequencing depth. Data types had no impact on performance while feature selection significantly improved performance for omics-based methods but not for amplicon sequencing.\n\nConclusionAmplicon sequencing might be a better candidate for machine-learning-based environmental stressor prediction than omics-based methods, but the latter require further research at higher sequencing depths to confirm this conclusion. More sampling could improve stressor prediction performance, and while this was not possible in the context of our study, thousands of sampling sites are monitored for routine environmental assessments, providing an ideal framework to further refine the approach for possible implementation in environmental diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "A substrate specificity of the pharmaceutically attractive tumor-promoter SIRT5 was already investigated multiple times by advanced proteomic tools. However, the present bioinformatic analysis brings new highlights to the knowledge about the lysine demalonylation activity of SIRT5, a member of the sirtuin family with multiple roles in aging and age-related diseases. It shows unreported functional aspects of the lysine demalonylated substrates in Eukaryotic translation elongation (ETE), Amino acid and derivative metabolism (AADM), and Selenoamino acid metabolism (SAM). The cluster of the elongation factors (EEF1A1, EEF2, EEF1D, and EEF1G) belonging to ETE participates in the peptide chain elongation and the export of the tRNA-s from the nucleus to the primary sites of the proteosynthesis. SIRT5 regulates the activity of the key enzymes with tumor-promoting functions involved in AADM (GLUD1, SHMT1, ACAT1). In contrast, SIRT5 also lysine demalonylates tumor suppressor substrates as a part of the AADM and SAM interaction networks (ALDH9A1, BHMT, GNMT). It indicates comparable functions like SIRT3, which has dual tumor promoter/oncogene functions. Similar to the roles of the sirtuins, the SAM pathway impacts longevity, protects against cardiovascular diseases, and is associated with hepatic steatosis. The selen supplementation mediates the calorie restriction effect, which increases the NAD+/NADH ratio in the cells and stimulates the expression of SIRT5 and other sirtuins. SIRT5 in turn regulates the selenocysteine synthesis through the lysine demalonylation of the participating ribosomal proteins, SECISBP2 and GNMT, which creates a regulatory loop.",

Although important for all stemness-to-differentiation transitions, mechanistic understanding of the fine-tuning of stemness gene transcription is lacking due to the compensatory effect of translational control. We used intermediate neural progenitor (INP) identity commitment to define the mechanisms that fine-tune stemness gene transcription in fly neural stem cells (neuroblasts). We demonstrate that the transcription factor FruitlessC (FruC) binds cis-regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in neuroblasts. Loss of fruC function alone has no effect on INP commitment but drives INP dedifferentiation when translational control is reduced. FruC negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis-regulatory regions. Identical to fruC loss-of-function, reducing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 activity increases stemness gene activity. We propose low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes stemness gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.",

This biochemical reaction corresponds to that of the ubiquitous FAD-dependent methylene-H4F reductase (MTHFR), although the latter uses a ping-pong mechanism with FAD as prosthetic group. Comparative genomics and genetic analyses indicated that Mfr is indispensable for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which lacks the MTHFR-encoding gene. Thus, Mfr is an excellent target enzyme for the design of antimycobacterial drugs. Here, we report the heterologous production, enzymological characterization and the crystal structure of Mfr from the thermophilic mycobacterium M. hassiacum (hMfr), which shows 78% sequence identity to Mfr from M. tuberculosis. Although hMfr and MTHFR show very low sequence identity and different catalytic mechanisms, their tertiary structures are highly similar, which suggests a divergent evolution of Mfr and MTHFR from a common ancestor. Most of the important active-site residues of MTHFR are conserved and equivalently positioned in the tertiary structure of hMfr. The Glu9Gln variant of hMfr exhibits a drastic reduction of the catalytic activity, which supports the predicted function of the glutamate residue as proton donor in both Mfr and MTHFR. The predicted nicotinamide binding site of hMfr is substantially narrower than the isoalloxazine binding site of MTHFR, which may reflect an evolutional adaptation to the different sizes of the coenzymes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA gap currently exists between genetic variants and the underlying cell and tissue biology of a trait, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies provide important information to help close that gap. However, two concerns that arise with eQTL analyses using RNA-sequencing data are normalization of data across samples and the data not following a normal distribution. Multiple pipelines have been suggested to address this. For instance, the most recent analysis of the human and farm Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project proposes using trimmed means of M-values (TMM) to normalize the data followed by an inverse normal transformation.\n\nResultsIn this study, we reasoned that eQTL analysis could be carried out using the same framework used for differential gene expression (DGE), which uses a negative binomial model, a statistical test feasible for count data. Using the GTEx framework, we identified 38 significant eQTLs (P<5x10-8) following the ANOVA model and 15 significant eQTLs (P<5x10-8) following the additive model. Using a differential gene expression framework, we identified 2,471 and nine significant eQTLs (P<5x10-8) following an analytical framework equivalent to the ANOVA and additive model, respectively. When we compared the two approaches, there was no overlap of significant eQTLs between the two frameworks. Because we defined specific contrasts, we identified trans eQTLs that more closely resembled what we expect from genetic variants showing complete dominance between alleles. Yet, these were not identified by the GTEx framework.\n\nConclusionsOur results show that transforming RNA-sequencing data to fit a normal distribution prior to eQTL analysis is not required when the DGE framework is employed, thus this may be more suitable for finding genes whose expression are impacted by genetic variants. Our approach detected biologically relevant variants that otherwise would not have been identified due to data transformation to fit a normal distribution.",
