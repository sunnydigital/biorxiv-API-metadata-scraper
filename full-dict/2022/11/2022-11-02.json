    "abstract": "It is well established that epigenetic features, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, are associated with variation in gene expression across cell types. Less well known is the extent to which epigenetic states vary across genetically diverse individuals, and whether such variation corresponds to inter-individual variation in gene expression. To investigate genetically driven variation in epigenetics, we conducted a survey of epigenetic modifications and gene expression in hepatocytes of nine inbred mouse strains. We surveyed four histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac), and DNA methylation. We used ChromHMM to identify 14 chromatin states, each of which represented a distinct combination of the four histone modifications. We found that chromatin states varied widely across the nine strains and that epigenetic state was strongly correlated with local gene expression. We replicated this correspondence between chromatin state and gene expression in an independent population of Diversity Outbred mice in which we imputed local chromatin state. In contrast, we found that DNA methylation did not vary across the inbred strains and was not correlated with variation in gene expression in DO mice. This work suggests that chromatin state is highly influenced by local genotype and may be a primary mode through which expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are mediated. Through examples, we demonstrate that naturally occurring chromatin state variation, in conjunction with gene expression, can aid in functional annotation of the mouse genome. Finally, we provide a data resource that documents variation in chromatin state in hepatocytes across genetically distinct mice.",

    "abstract": "The Nipah and Hendra viruses (NiV and HeV) are biosafety level 4 human pathogens classified within the Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family. In both NiV and HeV, the gene encoding the Phosphoprotein (P protein), an essential polymerase cofactor, also encodes the V and W proteins. These three proteins, which share an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) and have unique C-terminal domains (CTD), are all known to counteract the host innate immune response, with V and W acting by either counteracting or inhibiting Interferon (IFN) signaling. Recently, using a combination of biophysical and structural approaches, the ability of a short region within the shared NTD (PNT3 region) to form amyloid-like structures was reported. Here, we evaluated the relevance of each of three contiguous tyrosine residues located in a previously identified amyloidogenic motif (EYYY) within HeV PNT3 to the fibrillation process. Our results indicate that removal of a single tyrosine in this motif significantly decreases the ability to form fibrils independently of position, mainly affecting the elongation phase. In addition, we show that the C-terminal half of PNT3 has an inhibitory effect on fibril formation that may act as a molecular shield and could thus be a key domain in the regulation of PNT3 fibrillation. Finally, the kinetics of fibril formation for the two PNT3 variants with highest and lowest fibrillation propensity were studied by Taylor Dispersion Analysis (TDA). The results herein presented shed light onto the molecular mechanisms involved in fibril formation. In addition, the PNT3 variants we generated represent valuable tools to further explore the functional impact of V/W fibrillation in transfected and infected cells.",

However, BETi demonstrate poor single agent activity in clinical trials. Several studies suggest that combination with other anti-cancer inhibitors may enhance the efficacy of BETi. To nominate BETi combination therapies for myeloid neoplasms, we used a chemical screen with therapies currently in clinical cancer development. We identified PIM inhibitors (PIMi) as therapeutically synergistic with BETi in myeloid leukemia models. Mechanistically, we show that PIM kinase is increased after BETi treatment, and that PIM kinase upregulation is sufficient to induce resistance to BETi and sensitize cells to PIMi. Further, we demonstrate that miR-33a downregulation is the underlying mechanism driving PIM1 upregulation. We also show that GM-CSF hypersensitivity, a hallmark of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), represents a molecular signature for sensitivity to combination therapy and credential this using patient-derived xenografts supporting the clinical investigation of this combination.",

    "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REE) are essential ingredients of sustainable energy technologies, but separation of individual REE is one of the hardest problems in chemistry today1. Biosorption, where molecules adsorb to the surface of biological materials, offers a sustainable alternative to environmentally harmful solvent extractions currently used for separation of rare earth elements (REE). The REE-biosorption capability of some microorganisms allows for REE separations that, under specialized conditions, are already competitive with solvent extractions2, suggesting that genetic engineering could allow it to leapfrog existing technologies. To identify targets for genomic improvement we screened 3,373 mutants from the whole genome knockout collection of the known REE-biosorbing microorganism Shewanella oneidensis MR-13,4. We found 130 genes that increased biosorption of the middle REE europium, and 112 that reduced it. We verified biosorption changes from the screen for a mixed solution of three REE (La, Eu, Yb) using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) in solution conditions with a range of ionic strengths and REE concentrations. We found, among other things, that disruptions of a key regulatory component of the arc system (hptA), which regulates cellular response to anoxic environments and polysaccharide biosynthesis related genes (wbpQ, wbnJ, SO_3183) consistently increase biosorption across all our solution conditions. Our largest total biosorption change comes from our SO_4685--a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) synthesis gene--disruption which results in an up to 79% increase in biosorption and nusA--a regulatory protein--disruption which results in an up to 35% decrease in biosorption. Knockouts of glnA, pyrD, and SO_3183 increase relative biosorption affinity for ytterbium over lanthanum in multiple solution conditions tested, while many other genes we explored have more complex binding affinity changes. Taken together, these results begin to elucidate how various genes affect the membrane chemistry of S. oneidensis and offer potential targets for improving biosorption and separation of REE.",

    "abstract": "The ability to self-evaluate motor performance or estimate performance errors is beneficial for motor learning or relearning in the context of neurologic injury. Some evidence suggests those with injury like stroke may be unable to accurately self-evaluate their performance; however, it is unclear if individuals who are absent of injury are accurate in this domain. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of self-evaluation and potential influencing factors by conducting a systematic search to identify literature involving the self- and objective-evaluation of upper-extremity motor tasks. Twenty-three studies satisfied inclusion criteria. Data revealed a moderate positive correlation between self- and objective evaluations across a variety of tasks, from trivial button pressing to specialized surgical suturing. Both under- and overestimation of performance was found across the papers. Key factors identified to influence the accuracy of self-evaluation were the task purpose, familiarity, difficulty, and whether an individual received a demonstration. This review identified some limitations in this field of research. Most notably, we found that very few studies have investigated the accuracy of self-evaluation of motor performance with the primary goal of comparison to objective performance. Many studies reported the data but did not make direct statistical comparisons. Moreover, due to inconsistencies between how self and objective-evaluations were conducted, we argue that in this area of investigation self-evaluation tools need to replicate the objective evaluation method, or at minimum the self-evaluation tool should ask questions specific to the construct of performance that is being measured objectively.",

    "abstract": "Millions suffer from incurable lung diseases, and the donor lung shortage hampers organ transplants. Identifying the crucial lineage and the program for lung organogenesis could facilitate designing whole-lung bioengineering. Using lineage-tracing mice and human iPSC-derived lung-directed differentiation, we revealed that gastrulating Foxa2 lineage contributed to both lung mesenchyme and epithelium formation. Interestingly, Foxa2 lineage-derived cells in the lung mesenchyme progressively increased and occupied more than half of the mesenchyme niche, including endothelial cells, during lung development. Foxa2 promoter-driven, conditional Fgfr2 gene depletion caused the lung agenesis phenotype in mice. Importantly, wild-type donor mouse iPSCs injected into their blastocysts rescued this phenotype by complementing the Fgfr2-defective niche in the lung epithelium and mesenchyme. Donor cell is shown to replace the entire lung epithelial and robust mesenchymal niche during early chimeric lung development, resulting in efficient complementation of the nearly entire lung niche at the late stage of lung development. These results suggest that lung complementation based on the Foxa2 lineage is a unique model for the progressive mobilization of donor cells into both epithelial and mesenchymal lung niches and provides crucial insights for designing new bioengineering strategies to generate whole lungs.",

    "abstract": "Capture mark recapture (CMR) models allow the estimation of various components of animal populations, such as survival and recapture probabilities. In recent years, incorporating the spatial distribution of the devices used to detect an animals presence has become possible. By incorporating spatial information, we explicitly acknowledge the fact that there will be spatial structuring in the ecological processes which give rise to the capture data. Individual detection probability is not heterogeneous for a range of different reasons, for example the location of traps within an individuals home range, the environmental context around the trap or the individual characteristics of an animal such as its age. Spatial capture recapture models incorporate this heterogeneity by including the spatial coordinates of traps, data which is often already collected in standard CMR approaches. Here, we compared how the inclusion of spatial data changed estimations of survival, detection probability, and to some extent the probability of seroconversion to a common arenavirus, using the multimammate mouse as our model system. We used a Bayesian framework to develop non spatial, partially spatial and fully spatial models alongside multievent CMR models. First, we used simulations to test whether certain parameters were sensitive to starting parameters, and whether models were able to return the expected values. Then we applied the non-spatial, partially spatial and fully spatial models to a real dataset. We found that bias and precision were similar for the three different model types, with simulations always returning estimates within the 95% credible intervals. When applying our models to the real data set, we found that the non-spatial model predicted a lower survival of individuals exposed to Morogoro virus (MORV) compared to unexposed individuals, yet in the spatial model survival between exposed and non-exposed individuals was the same. This suggests that the non-spatial model underestimated the survival of seropositive individuals, most likely due to an age effect. We suggest that spatial coordinates of traps should always be recorded when carrying out CMR and spatially explicit methods of analysis should be used whenever possible, particularly as incorporating spatial variation may more easily capture ecological processes without the need for additional data collection that can be challenging to acquire with wild animals.",

    "abstract": "Plant biomass production (BP), nitrogen uptake (Nup) and their ratio, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), must be quantified to understand how nitrogen (N) cycling constrains terrestrial carbon (C) uptake. But the controls of key plant processes determining Nup and NUE, including BP, C and N allocation, tissue C:N ratios and N resorption efficiency (NRE), remain poorly known. We compiled measurements from 804 forest and grassland sites and derived regression models for each of these processes with growth temperature, vapour pressure deficit, stand age, soil C:N ratio, fAPAR (remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation) and growing-season average daily incident photosynthetic photon flux density (gPPFD) (effectively the seasonal concentration of light availability, which increases polewards) as predictors. An empirical model for leaf N was based on optimal photosynthetic capacity (a function of gPPFD and climate) and observed leaf mass-per-area. The models were used to produce global maps of Nup and NUE. Global BP was estimated as 72 Pg C/yr; Nup as 950 Tg N/yr; and NUE as 76 gC/gN. Forest BP was found to increase with growth temperature and fAPAR and to decrease with stand age, soil C:N ratio and gPPFD. Forest NUE is controlled primarily by climate through its effect on C allocation - especially to leaves, being richer in N than other tissues. NUE is greater in colder climates, where N is less readily available, because belowground allocation is increased. NUE is also greater in drier climates because leaf allocation is reduced. NRE is enhanced (further promoting NUE) in both cold and dry climates. These findings can provide observationally based benchmarks for model representations of C-N cycle coupling. State-of-the-art vegetation models in the TRENDY ensemble showed variable performance against these benchmarks, and models including coupled C-N cycling produced relatively poor simulations of Nup and NUE.",

    "abstract": "Microplastics (MP) are perceived as a threat to aquatic ecosystems but bear many similarities to suspended sediments which are often considered less harmful. It is, therefore pertinent to determine if and to what extent MPs are different from other particles occurring in aquatic ecosystems in terms of their adverse effects. We applied meta-regressions to hazard data extracted from the literature and harmonized the data to construct Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) for both types of particles. The results demonstrate that the average toxicity of MPs is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of suspended solids. However, the estimates were associated with large uncertainties and did not provide very strong evidence. In part, this is due to the general lack of comparable experimental studies and dose-dependent point estimates. We, therefore, argue that a precautionary approach should be used and MP in the 1-1000 {micro}m size range should be considered moderately more hazardous to aquatic organisms capable of ingesting such particles. Organisms inhabiting oligotrophic habitats like coral reefs and alpine lakes, with naturally low levels of non-food particles are likely more vulnerable, and it is reasonable to assume that MP pose a relatively higher risk to aquatic life in such habitats.\n\nSynopsisA meta-analysis indicates that microplastics are one order of magnitude more toxic than suspended sediments/solids, an estimate surrounded by considerable uncertainty.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/514507v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18826c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a98189org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17762d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa4a6d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We introduce a method to identify priority areas and taxa to study and protect affected by vehicle collisions using Latin America as a case study. In this region high biodiversity and an expanding road network can result in high impacts from roads, yet emerging research expertise offers opportunities for action. To identify priority targets we combined predicted spatially-explicit roadkill rates for birds and mammals with information about the current road network and species conservation status. Priority areas for conservation (with many species susceptible to roadkill but few or inexistent roads) were largely concentrated in the Amazon; while priority areas for research (unstudied regions with many roads and many species susceptible to roadkill) occur in various areas from Southern Mexico to Chile. Priority taxa for conservation reflected studied, roadkill-susceptible groups (eg, vultures and armadillos), while priority taxa for research were defined as either poorly-studied roadkill-susceptible groups or unstudied groups of conservation concern (eg, cuckoos and shrew opossums). Our approach offers a tool that could be applied to other areas and taxa to facilitate a more strategic allocation of resources in conservation and research in road ecology.",

Bacterial diversity across 10 fish species suggests our experimental findings are generalizable to consumer guild: corallivore feces contained more coral-associated bacteria, and lower abundances of the coral pathogen, Vibrio coralliilyticus. These findings recontextualize the ecological roles of consumers on coral reefs: although herbivores support coral dominance through removal of algal competitors, they also disperse coral pathogens. Corallivore predation can wound corals, yet their feces contain potentially beneficial coral-associated bacteria, supporting the hypothesized role of corallivores in coral symbiont dispersal.

    "abstract": "Changes in host species richness can alter infection risk and disease levels in communities. I review theoretical predictions for direct and environmental transmission pathogens about the effects of host additions (or removals) on three common disease metrics: the pathogen community reproduction number ([R]0) and the proportion (i.e., infection prevalence) and density of infected individuals in a focal host. To help explain why predictions differ between studies and between metrics, I analyze an SIR-type model of an environmentally transmitted pathogen and multiple host species that compete for resources. I use local sensitivity analysis to explore and compare how variation in an added hosts ability to transmit a pathogen, its density, and the pathogen transmission mechanism affect each disease metric. I find that if an added host species is a weak interspecific competitor, then each metric typically increases or decreases, respectively, when the added host has a high or low ability to transmit the pathogen. However, if the added host species is a strong interspecific competitor, then the response of each metric can be strengthened, weakened, or reversed depending on how the competitive effects of the added host propagate through the community and alter the densities of all host species in the community. The three metrics often respond in the same direction, but the metrics can respond in different directions for three reasons: (1) strong density-mediated feedbacks driven by high disease-induced mortality; (2) host additions or removals cause large changes in focal host density via competition or disease-induced mortality; and (3) the metrics use different quantities to define a hosts ability to transmit disease: the quantities for infection prevalence and infected density depend on the instantaneous production rates of infectious propagules whereas the quantities for [R]0 depend on lifetime production of infectious propagules. This study provides a framework that unifies prior theoretical studies and identifies rules governing the context-dependent relationships between host species richness and the three metrics of disease.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks generated from DNA methylation array data provide important insights into biological aging, disease susceptibility, and mortality risk. However, these clocks cannot be applied to high-throughput, sequence-based datasets more commonly used to study nonhuman animals. Here, we built a generalizable epigenetic clock using genome-wide DNA methylation data from 493 free-ranging rhesus macaques. Using a sliding-window approach that maximizes generalizability across datasets and species, this model predicted age with high accuracy ({+/-} 1.42 years) in held-out test samples, as well as in two independent test sets: rhesus macaques from a captive population (n=43) and wild baboons in Kenya (n=271). Our model can also be used to generate insight into the factors hypothesized to alter epigenetic aging, including social status and exposure to traumatic events. Our results thus provide a flexible tool for predicting age in other populations and species and illustrate how connecting behavioral data with the epigenetic clock can uncover social influences on biological age.",

    "abstract": "Species vary in their susceptibility to pathogens, and this can alter the ability of a pathogen to infect a novel host. However, many factors can generate heterogeneity in infection outcomes, obscuring our ability to understand pathogen emergence. Such heterogeneities can alter the consistency of responses across individuals and host species. For example, sexual dimorphism in susceptibility means males are often intrinsically more susceptible than females (although this can vary by host and pathogen). Further, we know little about whether the tissues infected by a pathogen in one host are the same in another species, and how this relates to the harm a pathogen does to its host. Here, we first take a comparative approach to examine sex differences in susceptibility across 31 species of Drosophilidae infected with Drosophila C Virus (DCV). We found a strong positive inter-specific correlation in viral load between males and females, with a close to 1:1 relationship, suggesting that susceptibility to DCV across species is not sex specific. Next, we made comparisons of the tissue tropism of DCV across seven species of fly. We found differences in viral load between the tissues of the seven host species, but no evidence of tissues showing different patterns of susceptibility in different host species. We conclude that, in this system, patterns of viral infectivity across host species are robust between males and females, and susceptibility in a given host is general across tissue types.",

    "abstract": "How protein properties such as protein activity and protein essentiality affect the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations are important questions in protein evolution. Deep mutational scanning studies typically measure the effects of a comprehensive set of mutations on either protein activity or fitness. Our understanding of the underpinnings of the DFE would be enhanced by a comprehensive study of both for the same gene. Here, we compared the fitness effects and in vivo protein activity effects of [~]4,500 missense mutations in the E. coli rnc gene. This gene encodes RNase III, a global regulator enzyme that cleaves diverse RNA substrates including precursor ribosomal RNA and various mRNAs including its own 5 untranslated region (5UTR). We find that RNase IIIs ability to cleave dsRNA is the most important determinant of the fitness effects of rnc mutations. The DFE of RNase III was bimodal, with mutations centered around neutral and deleterious effects, consistent with previously reported DFEs of enzymes with a singular physiological role. Fitness was buffered to small effects on RNase III activity. The enzymes RNase III domain (RIIID), which contains the RNase III signature motif and all active site residues, was more sensitive to mutation than its dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD), which is responsible for recognition and binding to dsRNA. Differential effects on fitness and functional scores for mutations at highly conserved residues G97, G99, and F188 suggest that these positions may be important for RNase III cleavage specificity.",

    "abstract": "TP53 is a master tumor suppressor gene, mutated in approximately half of all human cancers. Given the many regulatory roles of the corresponding p53 protein, it is possible to infer loss of p53 activity -- which may occur from trans-acting alterations -- from gene expression patterns. We apply this approach to transcriptomes of ~8,000 tumors and ~1,000 cell lines, estimating that 12% and 8% of tumors and cancer cell lines phenocopy TP53 loss: they are likely deficient in the activity of the p53 pathway, while not bearing obvious TP53 inactivating mutations. While some of these are explained by amplifications in the known phenocopying genes MDM2, MDM4 and PPM1D, others are not. An analysis of cancer genomic scores jointly with CRISPR/RNAi genetic screening data identified an additional TP53-loss phenocopying gene, USP28. Deletions in USP28 are associated with a TP53 functional impairment in 2.9-7.6% of breast, bladder, lung, liver and stomach tumors, and are comparable to MDM4 amplifications in terms of effect size. Additionally, in the known CNA segments harboring MDM2, we identify an additional co-amplified gene (CNOT2) that may cooperatively boost the TP53 functional inactivation effect. An analysis using the phenocopy scores suggests that TP53 (in)activity commonly modulates associations between anticancer drug effects and relevant genetic markers, such as PIK3CA and PTEN mutations, and should thus be considered as a relevant interacting factor in personalized medicine studies. As a resource, we provide the drug-marker associations that differ depending on TP53 functional status.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHumans regularly follow non-linear trajectories, such as turning, during everyday ambulation. However, globally-defined and locally-defined reference frames fall out of alignment during non- linear locomotion, which complicates spatiotemporal and biomechanical analyses of gait. Thus, the choice of the locally-defined reference frame is an important methodological consideration. This study investigated how different definitions of reference frame change the results and interpretations of common gait measures.\n\nMethodsNine healthy adults completed two walking trials around a circular track. Kinematic data were collected via motion capture and used to calculate step length, step width, anteroposterior margin of stability, and mediolateral margin of stability using three different locally-defined reference frames: walkway-fixed, body-fixed, and trajectory-fixed. Linear-mixed effects models compared the effect of reference frame on each gait measure, and the effect of reference frame on conclusions about a known effect of turning gait - asymmetrical stepping patterns.\n\nResultsAll four gait measures differed significantly across the three reference frames. A significant interaction of reference frame and step type (i.e. inside vs outside step) on all four gait measures (p < 0.001) indicated conclusions about asymmetry differed based on the choice of reference frame.\n\nConclusionThe choice of reference frame will change the calculated gait measures and may alter the conclusions of studies investigating non-linear gait. Care should be taken when comparing studies that used different reference frames, as results cannot be easily harmonized. Future studies of non-linear gait need to justify and detail their choice of reference frame.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of gene expression in individual cell types from heterogeneous tissue. To date, scRNA-seq studies have focused primarily on expression of protein-coding genes, as the functions of these genes are more broadly understood and more readily linked to phenotype. However, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are even more diverse than protein-coding genes, yet remain an underexplored component of scRNA-seq data. While less is known about lncRNAs, they are widely expressed and regulate cell development and the progression of diseases including cancer and liver disease. Dedicated lncRNA annotation databases continue to expand, but most lncRNA genes are not yet included in reference annotations applied to scRNA-seq analysis. Simply creating a new annotation containing known protein-coding and lncRNA genes is not sufficient, because the addition of lncRNA genes that overlap in sense and antisense with protein-coding genes will affect how reads are counted for both protein-coding and lncRNA genes. Here we introduce Singletrome, an enhanced human lncRNA genome annotation for scRNA-seq analysis, by merging protein-coding and lncRNA databases with additional filters for quality control. Using Singletrome to characterize expression of lncRNAs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and liver scRNA-seq samples, we observed an increase in the number of reads mapped to exons, detected more lncRNA genes, and observed a decrease in uniquely mapped transcriptome reads, indicating improved mapping specificity. Moreover, we were able to cluster cell types based solely on lncRNAs expression, providing evidence of the depth and diversity of lncRNA reads contained in scRNA-seq data. Our analysis identified lncRNAs differentially expressed in specific cell types with development of liver fibrosis. Importantly, lncRNAs alone were able to predict cell types and human disease pathology through the application of machine learning. This comprehensive annotation will allow mapping of lncRNA expression across cell types of the human body facilitating the development of an atlas of human lncRNAs in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Variability is an intrinsic property of biological systems and is often at the heart of their complex behaviour. Examples range from cell-to-cell variability in cell signalling pathways to variability in the response to treatment across patients. A popular approach to model and understand this variability is nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) modelling. However, estimating the parameters of NLME models from measurements quickly becomes computationally expensive as the number of measured individuals grows, making NLME inference intractable for datasets with thousands of measured individuals. This shortcoming is particularly limiting for snapshot datasets, common e.g. in cell biology, where high-throughput measurement techniques provide large numbers of single cell measurements. We extend earlier work by Hasenauer et al (2011) to introduce a novel approach for the estimation of NLME model parameters from snapshot measurements, which we call filter inference. Filter inference is a new variant of approximate Bayesian computation, with dominant computational costs that do not increase with the number of measured individuals, making efficient inferences from snapshot measurements possible. Filter inference also scales well with the number of model parameters, using state-of-the-art gradient-based MCMC algorithms, such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). We demonstrate the properties of filter inference using examples from early cancer growth modelling and from epidermal growth factor signalling pathway modelling.\n\nAuthor summaryNonlinear mixed effects (NLME) models are widely used to model differences between individuals in a population. In pharmacology, for example, they are used to model the treatment response variability across patients, and in cell biology they are used to model the cell-to-cell variability in cell signalling pathways. However, NLME models introduce parameters, which typically need to be estimated from data. This estimation becomes computationally intractable when the number of measured individuals - be they patients or cells - is too large. But, the more individuals are measured in a population, the better the variability can be understood. This is especially true when individuals are measured only once. Such snapshot measurements are particularly common in cell biology, where high-throughput measurement techniques provide large numbers of single cell measurements. In clinical pharmacology, datasets consisting of many snapshot measurements are less common but are easier and cheaper to obtain than detailed time series measurements across patients. Our approach can be used to estimate the parameters of NLME models from snapshot time series data with thousands of measured individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the ten years since the initial publication of the RenSeq protocol, the method has proved to be a powerful tool for studying disease resistance in plants and providing target genes for breeding programmes. Since the initial publication of the methodology, it has continued to be developed as new technologies have become available and the increased availability of computing power has made new bioinformatic approaches possible. Most recently, this has included the development of a k-mer based association genetics approach, the use of PacBio HiFi data, and graphical genotyping with diagnostic RenSeq. However, there is not yet a unified workflow available and researchers must instead configure approaches from various sources themselves. This makes reproducibility and version control a challenge and limits the ability to perform these analyses to those with bioinformatics expertise.\n\nResultsHere we present HISS, consisting of three workflows which take a user from raw RenSeq reads to the identification of candidates for disease resistance genes. These workflows conduct the assembly of enriched HiFi reads from an accession with the resistance phenotype of interest. A panel of accessions both possessing and lacking the resistance are then used in an association genetics approach (AgRenSeq) to identify contigs positively associated with the resistance phenotype. Candidate genes are then identified on these contigs and assessed for their presence or absence in the panel with a graphical genotyping approach that uses dRenSeq. These workflows are implemented via Snakemake, a python-based workflow manager. Software dependencies are either shipped with the release or handled with conda. All code is freely available and is distributed under the GNU GPL-3.0 license.\n\nConclusionsHISS provides a user-friendly, portable, and easily customised approach for identifying novel disease resistance genes in plants. It is easily installed with all dependencies handled internally or shipped with the release and represents a significant improvement in the ease of use of these bioinformatics analyses.",

In most pathological conditions it is rather the dysregulation of a complex network of genes than a problem with a single gene dysregulation that causes its emergence or progression, and aging differently gives a \"predisposition\" towards an age-related pathology or another, or in a favorable situation towards none.

Finding that an antibody of interest has a similar sequence to naturally expressed antibodies in healthy or diseased repertoires is a powerful approach for the prediction of antibody properties, such as immunogenicity or antigen specificity.

    "abstract": "A common assumption about the cochlea is that the local characteristic frequency (CF) is determined by a local resonance of basilar-membrane (BM) stiffness with the mass of the organ-of-Corti (OoC) and entrained fluid. We modeled the cochlea while avoiding such a priori assumptions by using a finite-element model of a 20-m-thick cross-sectional slice of the middle turn of a passive gerbil cochlea. The model had anatomically accurate structural details with physiologically appropriate material properties and interactions between the fluid spaces and solid OoC structures. The longitudinally-facing sides of the slice had a phase difference that mimicked the traveling-wave wavelength at the location of the slice by using Floquet boundary conditions. A paired volume-velocity drive was applied in the scalae at the top and bottom of the slice with the amplitudes adjusted to mimic experimental BM motion. The development of this computationally efficient model with detailed anatomical structures is a key innovation of this work. The resulting OoC motion was greatest in the transverse direction, stereocilia-tip deflections were greatest in the radial direction and longitudinal motion was small in OoC tissue but became large in the sulcus at high frequencies. If the source velocity and wavelength were held constant across frequency, the OoC motion was almost flat across frequency, i.e., the slice showed no local resonance. A model with the source velocity held constant and the wavelength varied realistically across frequency, produced a low-pass frequency response. These results indicate that tuning in the gerbil middle turn is not produced by a resonance due to local OoC mechanical properties, but rather is produced by the characteristics of the traveling wave, manifested in the driving pressure and wavelength.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe sensory epithelium of hearing, the organ of Corti, is encased in the bone of the fluid-filled cochlea and is difficult to study experimentally. We provide a new method to study the cochlea: making an anatomically-detailed finite-element model of a small transverse slice of the cochlea using Floquet boundary conditions and incorporating global cochlear properties in the slice drive and the wavelength-frequency relationship. The model shows that the slice properties do not show a mechanical resonance and therefore do not produce the frequency-response tuning of the cochlea. Instead, tuning emerges from global cochlear properties carried by the traveling wave.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of the circadian clock is linked to cancer development and progression. Establishing this connection has proven beneficial for understanding cancer pathogenesis, determining prognosis, and uncovering novel therapeutic targets. However, barriers to characterizing the circadian clock in human pancreas and human pancreatic cancer - one of the deadliest malignancies - have hindered an appreciation of its role in this cancer. Here, we employed normalized coefficient of variation (nCV) and clock correlation analysis in human population-level data to determine the functioning of the circadian clock in pancreas cancer and adjacent normal tissue. We found a substantially attenuated clock in the pancreatic cancer tissue. Then we exploited our existing mouse pancreatic transcriptome data to perform an analysis of the human normal and pancreas cancer samples using a machine learning method, cyclic ordering by periodic structure (CYCLOPS). Through CYCLOPS ordering, we confirmed the nCV and clock correlation findings of an intact circadian clock in normal pancreas with robust cycling of several core clock genes. However, in pancreas cancer, there was a loss of rhythmicity of many core clock genes with an inability to effectively order the cancer samples, providing substantive evidence of a dysregulated clock. The implications of clock disruption were further assessed with a Bmal1 knockout pancreas cancer model, which revealed that an arrhythmic clock caused accelerated cancer growth and worse survival, accompanied by chemoresistance and enrichment of key cancer-related pathways. These findings provide strong evidence for clock disruption in human pancreas cancer and demonstrate a link between circadian disruption and pancreas cancer progression.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe circadian clock is a regulator of human homeostasis. Dysfunction of the clock can lead to the development of diseases, including cancer. Although several cancers have been shown to have a dysfunctional clock which may alter prognosis or change treatment, this has been suggested but not demonstrated in pancreatic cancer. Investigation of this link is important because pancreatic cancer is highly lethal with few effective treatment options. Here we use recently pioneered bioinformatics approaches to assess clock functionality in human pancreatic cancer specimens, where we demonstrate that the clock is dysfunctional relative to normal pancreatic tissue. We then knocked out the core clock gene, Bmal1, in pancreatic cancer cells, which led to faster tumor growth and worse survival in mice and enhanced chemotherapeutic resistance to standard chemotherapy agents used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Collectively, our findings establish human pancreatic cancer as having clock dysfunction and clock dysfunction causing a more aggressive cancer.",

    "abstract": "The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway promotes differentiation and induces apoptosis in normal colorectal epithelial cells. However, the effect of the BMP pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) is controversial; it can either be tumor promoting or tumor suppressing, depending on the study. In this study, we found that CRC cells reside in a BMP-rich environment based on RNA-sequencing database analysis. Suppression of BMP using a specific BMP inhibitor, LDN193189, suppresses the growth of organoids in some CRC cases. CRC organoids treated with LDN193189 exhibited a decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor, which was, at least in part, mediated by protein degradation induced by leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (LRIG1). Among CRC organoid panels from 18 different patients, suppression of organoid growth by BMP inhibition correlated with the induction of LRIG1 gene expression. Notably, knockdown of LRIG1 in organoids diminished the growth-suppressive effect of LDN193189. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with LDN192189 and trametinib, an FDA-approved MEK inhibitor, resulted in a combination effect in both in vivo and in vitro xenograft tumor treatment in CRC organoids, which are susceptible to growth suppression by LDN193189. Taken together, the simultaneous inhibition of BMP and MEK can be a novel treatment option in CRC cases, and evaluating in vitro growth suppression and LRIG1 induction by BMP inhibition using patient-derived organoids could offer functional biomarkers for predicting potential responders.",

    "abstract": "The growth and division of cells in plant leaves is highly dynamic in time and space, all while the cells cannot move relative to their neighbors. Given these constraints, models predict that long range regulatory systems must exist to maintain flat forms. Juxtaposed microRNA (miR-NA) networks could serve as one of these regulatory systems. One of these miRNAs, miR319 is thought to be expressed from the base of leaves and to promote growth by degrading class II TCP transcription factor mRNAs. A miR319 overexpression mutant, jagged and wavy (jaw-D) exhibits rippling and undulating leaves, consistent with biomechanical predictions that without genetic spatial coordination, tissues will deform. It has been theorized that jaw-D rippling results from overgrowth at the margins, however this does not fully address how miR319 expression from the base of wild-type (WT) leaves allows them to flatten. Here, we track the growth, cell division and cell maturation in live WT and jaw-D leaves to ask how miR319 expression in WT promotes flattening. This data revealed the importance of spatially distinct growth, division and differentiation patterns in WT leaves, which are missing in jaw-D. We propose that WT leaf cells respond to differentiation cues to dynamically re-orient growth in specific tissue locations and regulate flattening.",

    "abstract": "Live imaging is the gold standard for determining how cellular development gives rise to organs. However, tracking all individual cells across whole organs over large developmental time windows is extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a comparably simple method for confocal live imaging of Arabidopsis thaliana first leaves across early development. Our imaging method works for both wild-type leaves and the complex curved leaves of the jaw-1D mutant. We find that dissecting the cotyledons, affixing a coverslip above the samples and mounting samples with perfluorodecalin yields optimal imaging series for robust cellular and organ level analysis. We provide details of our complementary image processing steps in MorphGraphX software for segmenting cells, tracking the cell lineages, and measuring a suite of cellular growth properties. We also provide MorphoGraphX image processing scripts that we developed to automate analysis of segmented images and data presentation. Our imaging techniques and processing steps combine into a robust imaging pipeline. With this pipeline we are able to examine important nuances in the cellular growth and differentiation of jaw-D versus WT leaves that have not been demonstrated before. Our pipeline is a practical starting place for researchers new to live imaging plant leaves, but also to anyone interested in improving the throughput and reliability of their live imaging process.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of incompletely folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to ER stress, activates ER protein degradation pathways, and upregulates genes involved in protein folding (Unfolded Protein Response; UPR). ER stress has been associated with abiotic stress conditions that affect protein folding, including salt stress. However, the role of ER protein folding in plant responses to nutrient deficiencies is unclear. We analyzed several Arabidopsis thaliana mutants affected in ER protein quality control and established that both CALNEXIN (CNX) genes function in the primary roots response to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. CNX and calreticulin (CRT) are homologous ER lectins that bind to N-glycosylated proteins to promote their folding. Growth of cnx1-1 and cnx2-2 single mutants was similar to that of the wild type under high and low Pi conditions, but the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 double mutant showed decreased primary root growth under low Pi conditions due to reduced meristematic cell division. This phenotype was specific to Pi deficiency; the double mutant responded normally to osmotic and salt stress. The root growth phenotype was Fe dependent and was associated with Fe accumulation in the root. Two genes involved in Fe-dependent inhibition of root growth under Pi deficiency, the ferroxidase gene LPR1 and P5-type ATPase PDR2, are epistatic to CNX1/CNX2. Overexpressing PDR2 failed to complement the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 root phenotype. cnx1-1 cnx2-2 showed no evidence of UPR activation, indicating a limited effect on ER protein folding. CNX might process a set of N-glycosylated proteins specifically involved in the response to Pi deficiency.\n\nOne sentence summaryCalnexin, a lectin chaperone engaged in the folding of N-glycosylated proteins in the ER, participates in primary root adaptation to low phosphate conditions.",

Teachers and students had to face a new reality for which they were not prepared adapting in an improvised way new methods and strategies to teach and to learn. Within virtual education, exams reduced in some cases to multiple choice tests while others tried to mimic traditional (pen and paper) exams. In this paper, these two kind of evaluations are compared. Although the results appear to be similar, a deeper look shows that their structure is completely different and some groups of students are unfairly harmed or benefited depending on the assessment applied. Beyond analyzing the reasons of this discrepancy, it is determined that for some type of evaluation, at least 21.1% of students maybe passing a course irregularly meanwhile, at least 5.5% could be failing a course despite their actual capabilities.",

Understanding how organelle biogenesis at systems-scale is coordinated with cellular growth rate and size is a major goal of quantitative cell biology. Here we map out the correlation structure of systems-level organelle biogenesis with cellular growth using \"rainbow yeast\", a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that expresses fluorescent labels for 6 major organelles. By carrying out hyperspectral imaging of thousands of single rainbow yeast cells, we decomposed the systems-level organelle biogenesis program into specific modes that characterize the response to changes in nutrient availability. Upon chemical biological dissection of this response, our results suggest that systems-level organelle biogenesis represents the sum of distinct organelle modes excited by growth rate and cell size separately. The flexibility afforded by this regulatory architecture may underlie how eukaryotic cells leverage compartmentalization to independently tune cell sizes and growth rates and satisfy potentially incompatible environmental and developmental constraints.",

Combining our data with stochastic computational modeling, we demonstrate that the rates of promoter inversion regulated by a broadly conserved serine recombinase are a major mechanism shaping population heterogeneity. Exploiting control over the expression of the recombinase, we devise a method for creating phase-locked variants and show that populations with different initial compositions converge to a similar steady-state composition over time.

Little is known about aging-related molecular changes in PFC that may mediate these effects. To date, no studies have used untargeted discovery methods with integrated analyses to determine PFC molecular changes in healthy female primates. We quantified PFC changes associated with healthy aging in female baboons by integrating multiple omics data types (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from samples across the adult age span. Our integrated omics approach using unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to integrate data and treat age as a continuous variable, revealed highly interconnected known and novel pathways associated with PFC aging. We found GABA tissue content associated with these signaling pathways, providing one potential biomarker to assess PFC changes with age. These highly coordinated pathway changes during aging may represent early steps for aging-related decline in PFC functions, such as learning and memory, and provide potential biomarkers to assess cognitive status in humans.",

However, AP models are nonlinear, complex, and can contain more than a hundred differential equations, making them difficult to parameterise. Therefore, cellular cardiac models have been limited to describing  average cell dynamics, when cell-specific models would be ideal to uncover inter-cell variability but are too experimentally challenging to be achieved. Here, we focus on automatically designing experimental protocols that allow us to better identify cell-specific maximum conductance values for each major current type--optimal experimental designs--for both voltage-clamp and current-clamp experiments. We show that optimal designs are able to perform better than many of the existing experiment designs in the literature in terms of identifying model parameters and hence model predictive power. For cardiac cellular electrophysiology, this approach will allow researchers to define their hypothesis of the dynamics of the system and automatically design experimental protocols that will result in theoretically optimal designs.",

    "abstract": "Aging is often associated with a decline in cognitive function. A reduction in the number of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) has been described in cognitively impaired but not in unimpaired aged rodents. However, it remains unclear whether the reduction in SOM+ interneurons in the DG hilus is causal for age-related cognitive dysfunction. We hypothesized that hilar SOM+ interneurons play an essential role in maintaining cognitive function and that a reduction in the number of hilar SOM+ interneurons might be sufficient to induce cognitive dysfunction. Hilar SOM+ interneurons were ablated by expressing a diphtheria toxin transgene specifically in these interneurons, which resulted in a reduction in the number of SOM+/GAD-67+ neurons and dendritic spine density in the DG. C-fos and Iba-1 immunostainings were increased in DG and CA3 but not in CA1. Behavioral testing revealed a reduced recognition index in the novel object recognition test, a reduction in the percentage of correct alternations in the Y maze tests, and increased latencies and path lengths in the learning and the reversal learning phase of the Morris water maze. Our results show that partial genetic ablation of SOM+ hilar interneurons is sufficient to increase activity in DG and CA3, as has been described to occur with aging and to induce an impairment of learning and memory functions. Thus, partial ablation of hilar SOM+ interneurons may be a significant contributing factor to age-related cognitive dysfunction.

    "abstract": "Focal epilepsy is characterized by repeated spontaneous seizures that originate from cortical epileptogenic zone networks (EZN). More recently, analysis of intracerebral recordings showed that subcortical structures, and in particular the thalamus, play an important role in facilitating and/or propagating epileptic activity. This supports previously reported structural alterations of these structures. Nonetheless, between-patient differences in EZN (e.g., temporal vs. non-temporal lobe epilepsy) as well as other clinical features (e.g., number of epileptogenic regions) might impact the magnitude as well as spatial distribution of subcortical structural changes. Here we used 7 Tesla MRI T1 data to provide a comprehensive description of subcortical morphological (volume, tissue deformation, and shape) and longitudinal relaxation (T1) changes in focal epilepsy patients to evaluate the impact of the EZN and patient-specific clinical features. Our results showed widespread morphometric and T1 changes. Focusing on the thalamus, atrophy varied across nuclei but appeared most prominent for the TLE group and the ipsilateral side, while shortening of T1 was observed for the lateral thalamus, in particular. Multivariate analyses across thalamic nuclei and basal ganglia showed that volume acted as the dominant discriminator between patients and controls, while (posterolateral) thalamic T1 measures looked promising to further differentiate patients based on EZN. In particular, the observed differences in T1 changes between thalamic nuclei indicated differential involvement of thalamic nuclei based on EZN. Finally, the number of epileptogenic regions was found to best explain the observed variability between patients. To conclude, this work revealed multi-scale subcortical alterations in focal epilepsy as well as their dependence on several clinical characteristics. Our results provide a basis for further, in-depth investigations using (quantitative) MRI and SEEG data and warrant further personalization of intervention strategies, such as deep brain stimulation, for treating focal epilepsy patients.",

We compute the sensitivities of disease prevalence in each host species to model parameters. Sensitivity rankings and subsequent biological interpretations are calculated and contrasted for cases were the pathogen is introduced into a disease-free community and where a second host species is introduced into an endemic single-host community. In some cases the magnitudes and dynamics of the sensitivities can be predicted only by knowing the host species characteristics (i.e., their competitive abilities and disease competence) whereas in other cases they can be predicted by factors independent of the species characteristics (specifically, intraspecific versus interspecific processes or the species roles of invader versus resident). For example, when a pathogen is initially introduced into a disease-free community, disease prevalence in both hosts is more sensitive to the burst size of the first host than the second host. In comparison, disease prevalence in each host is more sensitive to its own infection rate than the infection rate of the other host species. In total, this study illustrates that global sensitivity analysis can provide useful insight into how ecological and epidemiological processes shape disease dynamics and how those effects vary across time and system conditions. Our results show that sensitivity analysis can provide quantification and direction when exploring biological hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMany organisms experience an increase in disease resistance as they age but the time of life at which this change occurs varies. Increases in resistance are partially due to prior exposure and physiological constraints but these cannot fully explain the observed patterns of age-related resistance. An alternative explanation is that developing resistance at an earlier age incurs costs to other life-history traits. Here, we explore how trade-offs with host reproduction or mortality affect the evolution of the onset of resistance, depending on when during the hosts life-cycle the costs are paid (only when resistance is developing, only when resistant or throughout the lifetime). We find that the timing of the costs is crucial to determining evolutionary outcomes, often making the difference between resistance developing at an early or late age. Accurate modelling of biological systems therefore relies on knowing not only the shape of trade-offs but also when they take effect. We also find that the evolution of the rate of onset of resistance can result in evolutionary branching. This provides an alternative, possible evolutionary history of populations which are dimorphic in disease resistance, where the rate of onset of resistance has diversified rather than the level of resistance.",

    "abstract": "Robust and dynamic localization of self-reproducing autocatalytic chemistries is a key step in the realization of heritable and evolvable chemical systems. While autocatalytic chemical reaction networks already possess attributes such as heritable self-reproduction and evolvability, localizing functional multispecies networks within complex primitive phases, such as coacervates, has remained unexplored. Here, we show the self-reproduction of an RNA system within charge-rich coacervates where catalytic RNAs are produced by the autocatalytic assembly of constituent smaller RNA fragments. We systematically demonstrate the catalytic assembly of active ribozymes within phase-separated coacervates -- both in micron sized droplets as well as a coalesced macrophase, underscoring the facility of the complex, charge-rich phase to support these reactions in multiple configurations. By constructing multispecies reaction networks, we show that these newly assembled molecules are active, participating both in self- and cross-catalysis within the coacervates. Finally, these collectively autocatalytic reaction networks endow unique compositional identities to the coacervates which in turn transiently protect the identity against external perturbations, due to differential molecular transport and reaction rates. Our results establish a compartmentalised chemical system possessing a compositional identity possessing a balance between robustness and variability required for chemical evolution.",

In this study, as a preliminary observation, we adopted 148 single nucleic polymorphism (SNP) sites from 13 language genes, each with 4-13 SNPs. These SNPs were screened across 112 whole genome sequences (including 59 ancient genomes ranging from 2000 BP to 120000 BP) from five continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America). We found that four distinct LGPPs featured across human evolution history, though it is still to decipher whether they correspond to the three batches of out-of-Africa ancient humans and modern human; Surprisingly, ten ancient samples from the small country, Nepal, contain all 4 basic LGPPs, suggesting that the southern foothills and nearby of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were likely an agglomeration place for ancient humans; Chinese samples also have 3-4 basic LGPPs. Of note, some types of Neanderthals and Denisovans possessed a LGPP almost the same as modern humans.",

    "abstract": "De novo gene birth--the evolution of new protein-coding genes from ancestrally noncoding DNA--is increasingly appreciated as an important source of genetic and phenotypic innovation. However, the frequency and overall biological impact of de novo genes (DNGs) remain controversial. Large-scale surveys of de novo genes are critical to address these issues, but DNG identification represents a persistent challenge due to the lack of standardized protocols and the laborious analyses traditionally used to detect DNGs. Here, we introduced novel approaches to identify de novo genes that rely on Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) and are poised to accelerate DNG discovery. We specifically investigated if MLAs developed in one species using known DNGs can accurately predict de novo genes in other genomes. To maximize the applicability of these methods across species, we relied only on DNA and protein sequence features that can be easily obtained from annotation data. Using hundreds of published and newly annotated DNGs from three angiosperms, we trained and tested both Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN) algorithms. Both MLAs showed high levels of accuracy and recall within-genomes. Although accuracies and recall decreased in cross-species analyses, they remained elevated between evolutionary closely related species. A few training features, including presence of a protein domain and coding probability, held most of the MLAs predictive power. In analyses of all genes from a genome, recall was still elevated. Although false positive rates were relatively high, MLA screenings of whole-genome datasets reduced by up to ten-fold the number of genes to be examined by conventional comparative genomic methods. Thus, a combination of MLAs and traditional strategies can significantly accelerate the accurate discovery of DNG and the annotation in angiosperm genomes.",

RNA 3D structure is modular and can be seen as a composition of building blocks of various sizes called tertiary motifs. Currently, long-range motifs formed between distant loops and helical regions are largely less studied than the local motifs determined by the RNA secondary structure. We surveyed long-range tertiary interactions and motifs in a non-redundant set of non-coding RNA 3D structures. A new dataset of annotated LOng-RAnge RNA 3D modules (LORA) was built using an approach that does not rely on the automatic annotations of non-canonical interactions. An original algorithm, ARTEM, was developed for annotation-, sequence- and topology-independent superposition of two arbitrary RNA 3D modules. The proposed methods allowed us to identify and describe the most common long-range RNA tertiary motifs. Three basic interaction types were identified to be recurrent in the long-range RNA 3D modules: ribose-ribose interactions, canonical Type I and Type II A-minor interactions, and previously undescribed staple interactions. These three interaction types were found to be different building blocks of the same complex staple motifs common to non-coding RNA 3D structures.",

    "abstract": "Outer membrane protein (OMP) biogenesis in gram-negative bacteria is managed by a network of periplasmic chaperones that includes SurA, Skp, and FkpA. These chaperones bind unfolded OMPs (uOMPs) in dynamic conformational ensembles to suppress uOMP aggregation, facilitate diffusion across the periplasm, and enhance OMP folding. FkpA primarily responds to heat-shock stress, but its mechanism is comparatively understudied. To determine FkpA chaperone function, we monitored the folding of a cognate client uOmpA171 and found that FkpA increases the folded uOmpA171population but also slows the folding rate, dual functions distinct from the other periplasmic chaperones. The results indicate that FkpA behaves as a chaperone and not as a folding catalyst to directly influence the uOmpA171folding trajectory. We determine the binding affinity between FkpA and uOmpA171 by globally fitting sedimentation velocity titrations and found it to be intermediate between the known affinities of Skp and SurA for uOMP clients. Notably, complex formation steeply depends on the urea concentration, suggestive of an extensive binding interface. Initial characterizations of the complex using photo-crosslinking indicates that the binding interface spans the inner surfaces of the entire FkpA molecule. In contrast to prior findings, folding and binding experiments performed using subdomain constructs of FkpA demonstrate that the full-length chaperone is required for full activity. Together these results support that FkpA has a distinct and direct effect on uOMP folding and that it achieves this by utilizing an extensive chaperone-client interface.\n\nSignificanceThe periplasmic chaperone network is required for the survival and virulence of gram-negative bacteria. Here we find that the chaperone FkpA enhances outer membrane protein folding and tightly binds its clients with an extensive interaction interface. This modified holdase function of FkpA distinguishes it from other periplasmic chaperones and complements their functions to ensure robust outer membrane biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The poor preclinical and clinical success rates of low molecular weight (LMW) compounds can be partially attributed to the inherent trial-and-error nature of pharmaceutical research, which is limited largely to retrospective data-driven, rather than prospective prediction-driven human relevant workflows stemming from: 1) inadequate scientific understanding of structure-activity, structure-property, and structure-free energy relationships; 2) disconnects between empirical models derived from in vitro equilibrium data (e.g., Hill and Michaelis-Menten models) vis-a-vis the native non-equilibrium cellular setting (where the pertinent metrics consist of rates, rather than equilibrium state distributions); and 3) inadequate understanding of the non-linear dynamic (NLD) basis of cellular function and disease. We argue that the limit of understanding of cellular function/dysfunction and pharmacology based on empirical principles (observation/inference) has been reached, and that further progress depends on understanding these phenomena at the first principles theoretical level. Toward that end, we have been developing and applying a theory (called \"Biodynamics\") on the general mechanisms by which: 1) cellular functions are conveyed by dynamic multi-molecular/-ionic (multi-flux) systems operating in the NLD regime; 2) cellular dysfunction results from molecular dysfunction; 3) molecular structure and function are powered by covalent/non-covalent forms of free energy; and 4) cellular dysfunction is corrected pharmacologically. Biodynamics represents a radical departure from the status quo empirical science and reduction to practice thereof, replacing: 1) the interatomic contact model of structure-free energy and structure-property relationships with a solvation free energy model; 2) equilibrium drug-target occupancy models with dynamic models accounting for time-dependent drug and target/off-target binding site buildup and decay; and 3) linear models of molecular structure-function and multi-molecular/-ionic systems conveying cellular function and dysfunction with NLD models that more realistically capture the emergent non-linear behaviors of such systems. Here, we apply our theory to COVID Mpro inhibition and overview its implications for a holistic, in vivo relevant approach to drug design.",

However, a method that can be used to transform a vaccine from a liquid to a dry powder and a device that can be used to administer the powder to the desired region(s) of the nasal cavity are critical for a successful intranasal vaccination. In the present study, using a model vaccine that contains the liposomal AS01B as an adjuvant and ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen, it was shown that thin-film freeze-drying can be applied to convert the liquid vaccine containing sucrose at a sucrose to lipid ratio of 15:1 (w/w), in the presence or absence of carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC) as a mucoadhesive agent, into dry powders. Ultimately, the thin-film freeze-dried AS01B/OVA vaccine powder containing 1.9% w/w of CMC (i.e., TFF AS01B/OVA/CMC1.9% powder) was selected for additional evaluation because the TFF AS01B/OVA/CMC1.9% powder was mucoadhesive and maintained the integrity of the antigen and the physical properties of the vaccine. Compared to the TFF AS01B/OVA powder that did not contain CMC, the TFF AS01B/OVA/CMC1.9% powder had a lower moisture content and a higher glass transition temperature and was more porous. In addition, the TFF AS01B/OVA/CMC1.9% thin films were relatively thicker than the TFF AS01B/OVA thin films without CMC. When sprayed with the Unit Dose System Powder (UDSP) nasal device, the TFF AS01B/OVA powder and the TFF AS01B/OVA/CMC1.9% powder generated similar particle size distribution curves, spray patterns, and plume geometries. Importantly, after the TFF AS01B/OVA/CMC1.9% powder was sprayed with the UDSP nasal device, the integrity of the OVA antigen and the AS01B liposomal adjuvant did not change. Finally, a Taguchi L8 orthogonal array was applied to identify the optimal parameters for using the UDSP device to deliver the TFF AS01B/OVA/CMC1.9% vaccine powder to the middle and lower turbinate and the nasopharynx regions in both adult and child nasal casts. Results from this study showed that it is feasible to apply the TFF technology to transform a nasal vaccine candidate from liquid to a dry powder and then use the UDSP nasal device to deliver the TFF vaccine powder to the desired regions in the nasal cavity for intranasal vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Correct gene expression levels in space and time are crucial for normal development. Advances in genomics enable the inference of gene regulatory programs that are active during development. However, this approach cannot capture the complex multicellular interactions that occur during embryogenesis. Compared to model organisms such as fruit flies and zebrafish, the growth of mammalian embryos in utero further complicates the analysis of cell-cell communication during development. However, in vitro models of mammalian development such as gastruloids can overcome this limitation. Using time-resolved single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, we have delineated the regulatory landscape during gastruloid development and thereby identified the critical drivers of developmental transitions. We observed that gastruloids develop from pluripotent cells driven by the transcription factor (TF) dimer OCT4-SOX2 and differentiate along two main branches. A mesoderm branch characterized by the TF MSGN1 and a spinal cord branch characterized by CDX1, 2, 4 (CDX). Consistent with our lineage reconstruction, {Delta}CDX gastruloids fail to form spinal cord. Conversely, Msgn1 ablation inhibits the development of paraxial mesoderm, as expected. However, this also abolished spinal cord cells, which is surprising given that MSGN1 is not associated with differentiation along this branch. Therefore, formation of paraxial mesoderm is required for spinal cord development. To validate this, we generated chimeric gastruloids using {Delta}MSGN1 and wildtype cells, which formed both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm. Strikingly, {Delta}MSGN1 cells specifically contributed to spinal cord, suggesting that cell-cell interactions between paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord are necessary for the formation of the latter. Our work has important implications for the study of cell-cell communication in development and how gene regulatory programs are functionally executed to form complex multicellular developmental structures.",

    "abstract": "The leukocyte diversity of early maternal-fetal interface has been recently described, however, characterization of decidua at term is still pending. We, therefore, profiled the CD45+ compartment within human term decidua collected via cesarean section. Relative to the first trimester, our analyses revealed a shift from NK cells and macrophages to T-cells and enhanced activation of all immune cells. T-cells in the decidua were phenotypically distinct from their blood counterparts and demonstrated significant clonotype sharing. Using pseudo-temporal analyses of macrophages, we characterize previously undescribed diversity of bonafide tissue resident decidual macrophages. The frequency of this population correlated with high pregravid maternal body mass index but responded poorly to bacteria ligands. Collectively, these findings provide evidence of skewing of decidual myeloid cells towards immunoregulation representing a possible mechanism to safeguard the fetus. This immune cell atlas of term decidua is an asset for future studies investigating pathological conditions that compromise reproductive success.\n\nOne sentence summaryHuman immune cell atlas of term decidua and observed alterations with pre-gravid obesity.",

    "abstract": "The vestibular maculae of the inner ear contain sensory receptor hair cells that detect linear acceleration, contribute to equilibrioception, and thereby coordinate posture and ambulatory movements. These hair cells are divided between two groups, separated by a line of polarity reversal (LPR), with oppositely oriented planar-polarized stereociliary bundles that detect motion in opposite directions. The transcription factor EMX2 is known to establish this planar polarized organization by regulating the distribution of the transmembrane receptor GPR156 at the hair cell surface in one group of cells, however those genes regulated by EMX2 in this context were previously not known. We have identified the serine threonine kinase STK32A as a downstream effector negatively regulated by EMX2. Stk32a is expressed in hair cells on one side of the LPR in a pattern complementary to Emx2 due to transcriptional repression. Stk32a is necessary to align the intrinsic polarity of the bundle with the core planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins in EMX2-negative regions, and is sufficient to reorient bundles when ectopically expressed in neighboring EMX2-positive regions. We demonstrate that STK32a reinforces LPR formation by regulating the apical localization of GPR156. These observations support a model in which bundle orientation is determined through separate mechanisms in hair cells on opposite sides of the LPR, with EMX2-mediated repression of Stk32a determining the position of the LPR.\n\nHighlightsO_LISTK32A is a planar polarity effector that is negatively regulated by the transcription factor EMX2\nC_LIO_LIStk32a is necessary and sufficient to determine vestibular hair cell stereociliary bundle orientation\nC_LIO_LISTK32A contributes to the post-translational regulation of GPR156, preventing GPR156 localization in the absence of EMX2\nC_LI",
