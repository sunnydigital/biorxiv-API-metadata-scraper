    "abstract": "Modern mass spectrometers routinely allow deep proteome coverage in a single experiment. These methods are typically operated at nano and micro flow regimes, but they often lack throughput and chromatographic robustness, which is critical for large-scale studies. In this context, we have developed, optimized and benchmarked LC-MS methods combining the robustness and throughput of analytical flow chromatography with the added sensitivity provided by the Zeno trap across a wide range of cynomolgus monkey and human matrices of interest for toxicological studies and clinical biomarker discovery. SWATH data independent acquisition (DIA) experiments with Zeno trap activated (Zeno SWATH DIA) provided a clear advantage over conventional SWATH DIA in all sample types tested with improved sensitivity, quantitative robustness and signal linearity as well as increased protein coverage by up to 9-fold. Using a 10-min gradient chromatography, up to 3,300 proteins were identified in tissues at 2 {micro}g peptide load. Importantly, the performance gains with Zeno SWATH translated into better biological pathway representation and improved the ability to identify dysregulated proteins and pathways associated with two metabolic diseases in human plasma. Finally, we demonstrate that this method is highly stable over time with the acquisition of reliable data over the injection of 1,000+ samples (14.2 days of uninterrupted acquisition) without the need for human intervention or normalization. Altogether, Zeno SWATH DIA methodology allows fast, sensitive and robust proteomic workflows using analytical flow and is amenable to large-scale studies. This work provides detailed method performance assessment on a variety of relevant biological matrices and serves as a valuable resource for the proteomics community.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling the spatiotemporal organization and dynamical interactions of receptors in the plasma membrane remains a key challenge for our mechanistic understanding of cell signal initiation. A paradigm of such process is the oligomerization of TNF receptor CD95 during apoptosis signaling, where molecular configurations are yet to be defined. Here, we scrutinize proposed oligomerization models in live cells, establishing a molecular sensitive imaging toolkit including time-resolved FRET spectroscopy, quantitative STED microscopy, confocal Photobleaching Step Analysis and FCS. CD95 interactions were probed over molecular concentrations of few to [~] 1000 molecules/{micro}m2, over ns to hours, and molecular to cellular scales. We further established high-fidelity monomer and dimer controls for quantitative benchmarking. Efficient apoptosis was already observed when [~] 8 to 17% monomeric CD95 oligomerize to dimers/trimers after ligand binding. Our multiscale study highlights the importance of molecular concentrations, of the native environment, and reveals a minimal oligomerization model of CD95 signal initiation.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsMacrophage inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) is expressed on Kupffer cells and senses ethanol-induced danger signals released from dying hepatocytes and promotes IL-1{beta} production. However, it remains unclear what and how ethanol-induced Mincle ligands activate downstream signaling events to mediate IL-1{beta} release and contribute to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). In this study, we investigated the association of circulating {beta}-glucosylceramide ({beta}-GluCer), an endogenous Mincle ligand, with severity of ALD and examined the mechanism by which {beta}-GluCer engages Mincle on Kupffer cells to release IL-1{beta} in the absence of cell death and exacerbates ALD.\n\nApproach and ResultsConcentrations of {beta}-GluCer were increased in serum of patients with severe AH and correlated with disease severity. Challenge of Kupffer cells with LPS and {beta}-GluCer induced formation of a Mincle and Gsdmd-dependent secretory complex containing chaperoned full-length GSDMD (Hsp90-CDC37-NEDD4) with polyubiquitinated pro-IL-1{beta} and components of the Casp8-NLRP3 inflammasome loaded as cargo in small extracellular vesicles (sEV). Gao-binge ethanol exposure to wild-type, but not Mincle-/- and Gsdmd-/-, mice increased release of IL-1{beta} containing sEVs from liver explant cultures. Myeloid-specific deletion of Gsdmd similarly decreased the formation of sEVs by liver explant cultures and protected mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. sEVs collected from ethanol-fed wild-type, but not Gsdmd-/-, mice promoted injury of cultured hepatocytes and, when injected into wild-type mice, aggravated Gao-binge ethanol-induced liver injury.\n\nConclusion{beta}-GluCer functions as a DAMP activating Mincle-dependent GSDMD-mediated formation and release of IL-1{beta}-containing sEVs, which in turn exacerbate hepatocyte cell death and contribute to the pathogenesis of ALD.",

    "abstract": "Contacts between enhancers and promoters are thought to relate to their ability to activate transcription. Investigating mechanisms that drive such chromatin interactions is therefore important for understanding gene regulation. Here, we have determined contact frequencies between millions of pairs of cis-regulatory elements from chromosome conformation capture datasets and analysed a collection of hundreds of DNA-binding factors for binding at regions of enriched contacts. This analysis revealed enriched contacts at sites bound by many factors associated with active transcription. We show that active regulatory elements, independent of cohesin and polycomb, interact with each other across distances of 10s of megabases in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes and that interactions correlate and change with activity. However, these ultra-long-range interactions are not dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription or several transcription cofactors. We propose that long-range interactions between cis-regulatory elements are driven by three distinct mechanisms - cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, polycomb contacts, and association between active regions.",
