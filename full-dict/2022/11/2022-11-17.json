    "abstract": "All strains of the marine bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus harbor a type VI secretion system (T6SS) named T6SS2, suggesting that this system plays an important role in the life cycle of this emerging pathogen. Although T6SS2 was recently shown to play a role in interbacterial competition, its effector repertoire remains unknown. Here, we employed proteomics to investigate the T6SS2 secretome of two V. parahaemolyticus strains, and we identified several antibacterial effectors encoded outside of the main T6SS2 gene cluster. We revealed two T6SS2-secreted proteins that are conserved in this species, indicating that they constitute the core secretome of T6SS2; other identified effectors are found only in subsets of strains, suggesting that they comprise an accessory effector arsenal of T6SS2. Remarkably, a conserved Rhs repeat-containing effector serves as a quality control checkpoint and is required for T6SS2 activity. Our results reveal the effector repertoire of a conserved T6SS, some of which have no known activity and have not been previously associated with T6SSs.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings are challenging the classical hematopoietic model in which long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) are the base of the hematopoietic system. Clonal dynamics analysis of the hematopoietic system indicate that LT-HSC are not the main contributors of normal hemapoiesis in physiological conditions and the hematopoietic system is mainly maintained by multipotent progenitors (MPPs, hereafter HPC) and LT-HSCs are mostly in a non-active state. The first HSCs emerge from the aorta-gonad and mesonephros (AGM) region along with hematopoietic progenitors (HPC) within hematopoietic clusters. Molecular pathways that determine the HSC fate instead of HPC are still unknown, although inflammatory signaling, including NF-{kappa}B has been implicated in the development of HSCs. Here, we identify a chromatin binding function for I{kappa}B (also known as the inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B) that is Polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent and specifically determines dormant vs proliferating HSCs from the onset of their emergence in the AGM. We find a specific reduction of LT-HSCs in the I{kappa}B knockout new-born pups. This defect is manifested at the FL stage already, and traceable to the first emerging HSCs in the E11.5 AGM, without affecting the general HPC population. I{kappa}B deficient LT-HSCs express dormancy signature genes, are less proliferative and can robustly respond to activation stimuli such as in vitro culture and serial transplantation. At the molecular level, we find decreased PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 at the promoters of several retinoic acid signaling elements in the I{kappa}B - deficient aortic endothelium and E14.5 FL LT-HSCs. Additionally, I{kappa}B binding itself is found in the promoters of retinoic acid receptors rar in the AGM, and rar{gamma} in the LT-HSC of FL. Overall, we demonstrate that the retinoic acid pathway is over-activated in the hematopoietic clusters of I{kappa}B-deficient AGMs leading to premature dormancy of LT-HSCs that persists in the FL LT-HSCs.",

    "abstract": "During mouse gametogenesis, germ cells derived from the same progenitor are connected via intercellular bridges forming germline cysts, within which asymmetrical or symmetrical cell fate occurs in female and male germ cells respectively. Here, we have identified branched cyst structures in mice, and investigated their formation and function in oocyte determination. In fetal female cysts, 16.8% of the germ cells are connected by three or four bridges, namely branching germ cells. These germ cells are preferentially protected from cell death and cyst fragmentation, and to accumulate organelles and cytoplasm from sister germ cells to become primary oocytes. Changes in cyst structure and single-cell mRNA profiles suggested that cytoplasmic transport in germline cysts is conducted in a directional manner, in which cellular content is first transported locally between peripheral germ cells and further enriched in branching germ cells, a process causing selective germ cell loss in cysts. Cyst fragmentation occurs extensively in female cysts, but not in male cysts. Male cysts in fetal and adult testes have branched cyst structures, without differential cell fates between germ cells. During cyst formation, E-cadherin junctions between germ cells position intercellular bridges to form branched cysts. Disrupted junction formation in E-cadherin-depleted cysts led to an altered ratio in branched cysts. Germ cell-specific E-cadherin knockout resulted in reductions in primary oocyte number and oocyte size. These findings shed light on the mechanism of how the size of the ovarian reserve, the number of primary oocytes available to sustain adult ovarian function, is determined during ovary formation.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements including LINE-1 (Long INterspersed Element-1) impact genome variation, function, regulation, and disease. LINE-1s seem to have expanded as distinct consecutive lineages, but the drivers of lineage emergence and disappearance are unknown. Reference genomes provide a snapshot of LINE-1 evolution; however, the ongoing retrotransposition of LINE-1s in humans is not evident in these mosaic assemblies. Utilizing long-read-based haploid assemblies, we identified the sequence and location of all the youngest LINE-1s in these genomes at allelic resolution. We cloned and assayed the in vitro retrotransposition activity of the subset of LINE-1s with intact open reading frames and found 34 were measurably active. Yet, among individuals, these same LINE-1s varied in their presence, allelic sequences, and activity. Using a measure of in vivo retrotransposition of closely related groups of LINE-1, we found that recently retrotransposed LINE-1s tend to be active in vitro and polymorphic in the population. However, for a considerable number of LINE-1s, their measured in vitro activity and inferred in vivo fitness were uncorrelated, regardless of their frequency in the population. Some of these unexpected patterns come from rare allelic forms of old LINE-1s that retain activity, suggesting older LINE-1 lineages can persist much longer than expected. Finally, some LINE-1s showed mutations that were potentially adaptive, increasing their replication in the genome. These key mutations specific to LINE-1s with both in vitro activity and in vivo fitness represent promising candidates for the future mechanistic investigation of the drivers of LINE-1 evolution which may contribute to disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) sequencing for low-burden cancer monitoring is limited by sparsity of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), the abundance of genomic material within a plasma sample, and pre-analytical error rates due to library preparation, and sequencing errors. Sequencing costs have historically favored the development of deep targeted sequencing approaches for overcoming sparsity in ctDNA detection, but these techniques are limited by the abundance of ccfDNA in samples, which imposes a ceiling on the maximal depth of coverage in targeted panels. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is an orthogonal approach to ctDNA detection that can overcome the low abundance of ccfDNA by supplanting sequencing depth with breadth, integrating signal across the entire tumor mutation landscape. However, the higher cost of WGS limits the practical depth of coverage and hinders broad adoption. Lower sequencing costs may thus allow for enhanced ctDNA cancer monitoring via WGS. We therefore applied emerging lower-cost WGS (Ultima Genomics, 1USD/Gb) to plasma samples at [~]120x coverage. Copy number and single nucleotide variation profiles were comparable between matched Ultima and Illumina datasets, and the deeper WGS coverage enabled ctDNA detection at the parts per million range. We further harnessed these lower sequencing costs to implement duplex error-corrected sequencing at the scale of the entire genome, demonstrating a [~]1,500x decrease in errors in the plasma of patient-derived xenograft mouse models, and error rates of [~]10-7 in patient plasma samples. We leveraged this highly de-noised plasma WGS to undertake cancer monitoring in the more challenging context of resectable melanoma without matched tumor sequencing. In this context, duplex-corrected WGS allowed us to harness known mutational signature patterns for disease monitoring without matched tumors, paving the way for de novo cancer monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Under physiological conditions, phosphatidylserine (PS) predominantly localizes to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane of cells. During apoptosis, PS is exposed on the cell surface and serves as an \"eat-me\" signal for macrophages to prevent releasing self-immunogenic cellular components from dying cells which could potentially lead to autoimmunity. However, increasing evidence indicates that viable cells can also expose PS on their surface. Interestingly, tumor cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) also externalize PS. Recent studies have proposed PS-exposing EVs as a potential biomarker for the early detection of cancer and other diseases. However, there are confounding results regarding subtypes of PS-positive EVs, and knowledge of PS exposure on the EV surface requires further elucidation. In this study, we enriched small EVs (sEVs) and medium/large EVs (m/lEVs) from conditioned media of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) and non-cancerous cells (keratinocytes, fibroblasts). Since several PS-binding molecules are available to date, we compared recombinant proteins of annexin A5 and the carboxylated glutamic acid domain of Protein S (GlaS), also specific for PS, to detect PS-exposing EVs. Firstly, PS externalization in each EV fraction was analyzed using a bead-based EV assay, which combines EV capture using microbeads and analysis of PS-exposing EVs by flow cytometry. The bulk EV assay showed higher PS externalization in m/lEVs derived from MDA-MB-468 cells but not from MDA-MB-231 cells, while higher binding of GlaS was also observed in m/lEVs from fibroblasts. Second, using single EV flow cytometry, PS externalization was also analyzed on individual sEVs and m/lEVs. Significantly higher PS externalization was detected in m/lEVs (annexin A1+) derived from cancer cells compared to m/lEVs (annexin A1+) from non-cancerous cells. These results emphasize the significance of PS-exposing m/lEVs as an undervalued EV subtype for early cancer detection and provide a better understanding of PS externalization in disease-associated EV subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy often curable only by using intensive chemotherapy. Nonetheless, resistance/early relapses are frequent, underscoring the need to investigate the molecular events occurring shortly after chemotherapy. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) is a fail-safe tumor suppressive mechanism that may elicit immune-mediated responses contributing to senescent cell clearance. Yet, TIS functional role in AML eradication and immune surveillance early post-chemotherapy remains ill-defined. By combining transcriptional and cellular-based evaluation of senescence markers in AML patient samples, we found upregulation of senescence-associated genes and interferon gene categories with concomitant induction of HLA class I and class II molecules, pointing to a causal link between TIS and leukemia immunogenicity. Consistently, senescence-competent AML samples activated autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and improved leukemia recognition by both T-cell subsets. Lastly, the anti-leukemic activity of Immune Checkpoint Blockades (ICBs) was enhanced upon senescence engagement in AML. Altogether, our results identify senescence as a potent immune-related anti-leukemic mechanism that may rapidly translate into innovative senescence-based strategies to prevent AML relapse.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEOur findings uncover a novel link between senescence induction and leukemia immune recognition by T cells via upregulation of antigen presentation machinery components, providing the basis for conceptually novel senescence-based targeted immunotherapeutic regimens for AML patients.",

    "abstract": "Chemical probes are lacking for most human proteins. Covalent chemistry represents an attractive strategy for expanding the ligandability of the proteome, and chemical proteomics has revealed numerous electrophile-reactive cysteines on diverse proteins. Determining which of these covalent binding events impact protein function, however, remains challenging. Here, we describe a base-editing strategy to infer the functionality of cysteines by quantifying the impact of their missense mutation on cell proliferation. We show that the resulting atlas, which covers >13,800 cysteines on >1,750 cancer dependency proteins, correctly predicts the essentiality of cysteines targeted by cancer therapeutics and, when integrated with chemical proteomic data, identifies essential, ligandable cysteines on >110 cancer dependency proteins. We further demonstrate how measurements of reactivity in native versus denatured proteomes can discriminate essential cysteines amenable to chemical modification from those buried in protein structures, providing a valuable resource to prioritize the pursuit of small-molecule probes with high function-perturbing potential.",

We examined an episodic area important for temporal relations, anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (alEC), and a semantic area important for action concepts, middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Participants underwent fMRI while watching sequences of novel events and recalling their temporal relations over two sessions one week apart. Across different contexts, the roles of these events could either be consistent, or conflict; integrative representations should weaken in the conflicting condition. We found integrative representations that emerged quickly in alEC, and only subsequently in MTG, which showed a significant change across sessions. Thus, alEC is important in building integrative representations early in learning and may be a gateway to semantic knowledge in MTG. We suggest that both episodic and semantic systems participate in integrating new information when it is aligned with their content specializations.",

    "abstract": "Brain functional dynamics have been linked to emotion and cognition in mature individuals, where alterations are associated with mental ill-health and neurodevelopmental conditions (such as autism spectrum disorder). Although reliable resting-state networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is known about the early development of dynamic brain functional connectivity and whether it is linked to later neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood. In this study we characterised dynamic functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the first few weeks of postnatal life in term-born (n = 324) and preterm-born (n = 66) individuals and evaluated whether early dynamic functional connectivity: i) changes with age in the neonatal period ii) is altered by preterm birth and iii) is associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes at 18 months.\n\nGlobal brain dynamics in preterm-born infants were atypical when compared with term-born controls, and associated with atypical social, sensory, and repetitive behaviours measured by the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) scores at 18 months of age. On a modular scale, we identified six transient states of neonatal dynamic functional connectivity: three whole-brain synchronisation states and three regionally constrained states occupying occipital, sensorimotor, and frontal regions. Modular characteristics of these brain states were correlated with postmenstrual age and postnatal days at scan. Preterm-born infants had increased occurrence of frontal and occipital states. Higher neonatal sensorimotor synchronisation was associated with lower motor and language outcome scores at 18 months. Lower frequency of occurrence of whole-brain synchronisation states and higher frequency of occurrence of the sensorimotor state were associated with higher Q-CHAT scores at 18 months.\n\nOverall, we show that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity is already established by the time of birth in the human brain. This landscape is altered by preterm birth and its profile is linked to neurodevelopmental outcomes in toddlerhood.",

Still, the specific circuit computations that underpin this foundational aspect of intelligence remain unclear. Here, by examining neural ensemble activity in rats that sample different strategies in a self-guided search for latent task structure, we demonstrate a robust tracking of individual strategy prevalence in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), especially in an area homologous to primate area 32D. Prevalence encoding in the ACC is wide-scale, independent of reward delivery, and persists through a substantial ensemble reorganization that tags ACC representations with contextual content. Our findings argue that ACC ensemble dynamics is structured by a summary statistic of recent behavioral choices, raising the possibility that ACC plays a role in estimating - through statistical learning - which actions promote the occurrence of events in the environment.",
