    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that results in 250,000 infections, 12,000 deaths, and $1 billion in medical costs in the US each year. There has been recent interest in using a daptomycin analog, Surotomycin, to treat C. difficile infections. Daptomycin interacts with both phosphatidylglycerol and Lipid II to disrupt the membrane and halt peptidoglycan synthesis. C. difficile has an unusual lipid membrane composition as it has no phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine, and [~]50% of its membrane is composed of glycolipids, including the unique C. difficile lipid aminohexosyl-hexosyldiradylglycerol (HNHDRG). We identified a two-component system (TCS) HexRK that is required for C. difficile resistance to daptomycin. Using RNAseq we found that HexRK regulates a three gene operon of unknown function hexSDF. Based on bioinformatic predictions, hexS encodes a monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase, hexD encodes a polysaccharide deacetylase, and hexF encodes an MprF-like flippase. We find that deletion of hexRK leads to a 4-fold decrease in daptomycin MIC, and that deletion of hexSDF leads to an 8-16-fold decrease in daptomycin MIC. The {Delta}hexSDF mutant is also 4-fold less resistant to bacitracin but no other cell wall active antibiotics. Our data indicate that in the absence of HexSDF the phospholipid membrane composition is altered. In WT C. difficile the unique glycolipid, HNHDRG makes up [~]17% of the lipids in the membrane. However, in a {Delta}hexSDF mutant, HNHDRG is completely absent. While it is unclear how HNHDRG contributes daptomycin resistance, the requirement for bacitracin resistance suggests it has a general role in cell membrane biogenesis.\n\nImportanceClostridioides difficile is a major cause of hospital acquired diarrhea and represents an urgent concern due to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the rate of recurrent infections. Little is understood about C. difficile membrane lipids, but a unique glycolipid, HNHDRG, has been previously identified in C. difficile and, currently, has not been identified in other organisms. Here we show that HexSDF and HexRK are required for synthesis of HNHDRG, and that production of HNHDRG impacts resistance to daptomycin and bacitracin.",

    "abstract": "Didymella theifolia specifically infects some local varieties of Camellia sinensis in China, representing a unique fungal species, and characterization of the mycoviruses related to this fungal species is attractive. Three double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs; dsRNAs 1, 2 and 3 with sizes of 6338, 5910 and 727 bp, respectively) were identified in an avirulent strain CJP4-1 of D. theifolia exhibiting normal growth and morphologies. Characterization of the dsRNAs 1 and 2 revealed that they are genomic components of a novel botybirnavirus, tentatively named Didymella theifolia botybirnavirus 1 (DtBRV1), and encapsidated in isometric virions with a size of [~]39.8 nm in diameter. It is worth noting that dsRNA3 shares no detectable identity with those sequences deposited in NCBI database, while a high identity (36.58% and 40.93%) with the left regions of dsRNAs 1 and 2, but is not encapsidated in DtBRV1 particles, suggesting it is a unique dsRNA unit that is not a DtBRV1 component or a satellite and its taxonomic classification remains unclear. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with peptide mass fingerprint analysis revealed that DtBRV1 capsid protein consisting of polypeptides encoded by the left regions of both genomic components. DtBRV1 is efficiently vertically transmitted through conidia while difficult in horizontal transmission from strain CJP4-1 to other strains. DtBRV1 has no effects on fungal growth and virulence as accessed with the transfectants of virulent strain JYC1-6 of D. theifolia infected by DtBRV1. DtBRV1 with specific molecular traits contributes useful information for a better understanding of the mycoviral community.\n\nImportanceTea plants represent an ancient and unique plant species community cultured in China, while the mycoviruses related to the phytopathogenetic fungi infecting tea remain limited. Here, we characterized a novel botybirnavirus (tentatively named Didymella theifolia botybirnavirus1 (DtBRV1), and a specific dsRNA infecting Didymella theifolia responsible for a noticeable disease of tea plants. DtBRV1 contains two dsRNAs (1 and 2) encapsidated in isometric virions in size of [~]39.8 nm, while dsRNA3 is not encapsidated in the viral particles although it has a high identity with the mycoviral genomic components. Additionally, DtBRV1 coat proteins are composed of fused proteins encoded by both dsRNA-coding open reading frames most likely after cleave and fuse processing progress, which is striking unlike most mycoviruses. With some specific molecular traits, DtBRV1 and the related specific dsRNA unit expand our understanding of virus diversity, taxonomy, and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Pro-proliferative, M2-like polarization of macrophages is a critical step in the development of fibrosis and remodeling in chronic lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Macrophages in healthy and diseased lungs express gremlin 1 (Grem1), a secreted glycoprotein that acts in both paracrine and autocrine manners to modulate cellular function. Increased Grem1 expression plays a central role in pulmonary fibrosis and remodelling, however, the role of Grem1 in M2-like polarization of macrophages has not previously been explored. The results reported here show that recombinant Grem1 potentiated M2-like polarization of mouse macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in response to the Th2 cytokines IL4 and IL13. Genetic depletion of Grem1 in BMDMs inhibited M2 polarization while exogenous gremlin 1 could partially rescue this effect. Taken together, these findings reveal that gremlin 1 is required for M2-like polarization of macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance is under strong selective pressure in Anopheles mosquitoes due to widespread usage of insecticides in vector control strategies. Resistance mechanisms likely cause changes that profoundly affect mosquito physiology, yet it remains poorly understood how selective pressures imposed by insecticides may alter the ability of the mosquito to host and transmit a Plasmodium infection. From pyrethroid-resistant field-derived Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes, we performed selection experiments to establish resistant (RES) and susceptible (SUS) colonies by either selection for, or loss of, insecticide resistance. We show increased prevalence, intensity, and oocyst growth rate of Plasmodium falciparum infection in RES females compared to SUS. The increase in infection intensity in RES females was not associated with the presence of the kdrL1014F mutation, and was not impacted by inhibition of Cytochrome P450s. The lipid transporter lipophorin (Lp), which was upregulated in RES compared to SUS, was at least partly implicated in the increased intensity of P. falciparum but not directly in the insecticide resistance phenotype. Interestingly, we observed that although P. falciparum infections were not affected when RES females were exposed to permethrin, these females had decreased lipid abundance in the fat body following exposure, pointing to a possible role for lipid mobilization in response to damage caused by insecticide challenge. The finding that selection for insecticide resistance can increase P. falciparum infection intensities and growth rate reinforces the need to assess the overall impact on malaria transmission dynamics of selective pressures mosquitoes experience during repeated insecticide challenge.\n\nSignificance StatementInsecticide resistance poses a severe threat for malaria control. Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, the active component of most insecticide-treated nets, is now widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, reducing the efficacy of these crucial tools. Despite significant research characterizing insecticide resistance mechanisms, it remains unknown how these traits influence Plasmodium falciparum infections in malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes. We established a pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible population of Anopheles gambiae derived from the same genetic background and performed experimental infections with P. falciparum. We found that the pyrethroid-resistant population was more supportive of malaria parasites compared to the susceptible population. This was not caused by well-known insecticide resistance mechanisms, but linked with a lipid transporter, lipophorin, which may play an indirect role in resistance.",

    "abstract": "The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex recognizes and processes DNA double-strand breaks for homologous recombination by performing short-range removal of 5' strands. Endonucleolytic processing by MRN requires a stably bound protein at the break site--a role we postulate is played by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in mammals. Here we interrogate the sites of MRN-dependent processing by isolating and sequencing DNA-PK-bound DNA fragments that are products of MRN cleavage. These intermediates are generated with highest efficiency when DNA-PK is catalytically blocked, yielding products within 200 bp of the break site, whereas DNA-PK products in the absence of kinase inhibition show much greater dispersal. Use of light-activated Cas9 to induce breaks facilitates temporal resolution of DNA-PK and Mre11 binding, showing that Mre11 and DNA-PK both bind to DNA ends before release of DNA-PK-bound products. These results support a sequential model of double-strand break repair involving collaborative interactions between homologous and non-homologous repair complexes.",

    "abstract": "SummaryInitiation of mRNA translation is a key regulatory step in gene expression in all eukaryotes. Canonical initiation of translation in eukaryotes involves recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex to the 5' end of mRNA by the cap-binding complex eIF4F to form the 48S initiation complex (48S), followed by scanning along the mRNA until the start codon is selected.1-8 We have previously shown that eIF4F binds near the mRNA channel exit site of the 43S, leaving an open question about how mRNA secondary structure is removed as it enters the mRNA binding channel on the other side of the 40S subunit.4 Here we describe a human 48S positioned at the start codon that shows that in addition to the eIF4A that is part of eIF4F, there is a second eIF4A helicase bound to the mRNA entry site. The entry channel bound eIF4A is positioned through interactions with eIF3 and the 40S subunit to enable its ATP-dependent helicase activity to directly unwind secondary structure located downstream of the scanning 48S complex. The structure also reveals universally conserved interactions between eIF4F and the 48S, likely explaining how this complex can promote mRNA recruitment in all eukaryotes. mRNA translation has emerged as an important tool for developing innovative therapies, yet several fundamental aspects of its regulation remain unknown. This work sheds light on the critical regulatory roles of eIF4A and eIF4F during the recruitment and scanning of the 5' UTR of mRNA.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations including epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disability. TSC is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode the hamartin/tuberin proteins respectively. These proteins function as a heterodimer that negatively regulates mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). TSC research has focused on the effects of mTORC1, a critical signaling hub, on regulation of diverse cell processes including metabolism, cell growth, translation, and neurogenesis. However, non-canonical functions of TSC2 are not well studied, and the potential disease-relevant biological mechanisms are not well understood. We observed aberrant multipolar mitotic division, a novel phenotype, in TSC2 mutant iPSCs. The multipolar phenotype is not meaningfully affected by treatment with mTORC1 inhibition, suggesting that multipolar division is an mTORC1-independent phenotype. We further observed dominant negative activity of the mutant form of TSC2 in producing the multipolar division phenotype. These data expand the knowledge of TSC2 function and pathophysiology which will be highly relevant to future treatments for patients with TSC.\n\nHighlightsO_LINovel multipolar division in patient-derived iPSCs with mutant form of tuberin, TSC2 encoded protein\nC_LIO_LIMutant tuberin may act in a dominant negative, mTORC1-independent manner\nC_LI\n\neTOCTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a disorder caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes leading to mTORC1 hyperactivity.

    "abstract": "Craniofacial development is a complex and tightly regulated process and disruptions can lead to structural birth defects, the most common being nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCLP). Previously, we identified FOS as a candidate regulator of NSCLP through family-based association studies, yet its specific contributions to oral and palatal formation are poorly understood. This study investigated the role of fos during zebrafish craniofacial development through genetic disruption and knockdown approaches. Fos was expressed in the periderm, olfactory epithelium and other cell populations in the head. Genetic perturbation of fos produced an abnormal craniofacial phenotype with a hypoplastic oral cavity that showed significant changes in midface dimensions by quantitative facial morphometric analysis. Loss and knockdown of fos caused increased cell apoptosis in the head, followed by a significant reduction in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) populating the upper and lower jaws. These changes resulted in abnormalities of cartilage, bone and pharyngeal teeth formation. Periderm cells surrounding the oral cavity showed altered morphology and a subset of cells in the upper and lower lip showed disrupted Wnt/{beta}-catenin activation, consistent with modified inductive interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that perturbation of fos has detrimental effects on oral epithelial and CNCC-derived tissues suggesting that it plays a critical role in zebrafish craniofacial development and a potential role in NSCLP.\n\nSummary statementPerturbation of fos, a candidate gene associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate in humans, causes a distinctive orofacial phenotype in zebrafish as a result of abnormal development of craniofacial tissues. Disruption of fos in the oral epithelial, cranial neural crest and Wnt responsive cell populations around the oral cavity causes anomalies that suggest a potential role in the etiology of NSCLP.",

    "abstract": "To regulate gene expression, enhancers must come into proximity with their target gene. At some loci the timing of enhancer-promoter proximity is uncoupled from gene activation, while at others it is tightly linked. Here, we assessed this more globally for 600 characterized enhancers or promoters (E/P) with tissue-specific activity in Drosophila embryos, by performing Capture-C and insulator ChIP in FACS-purified myogenic or neurogenic cells at different stages of embryogenesis. This high-resolution view enabled direct comparison between E/P interactions and activity across 5 developmental conditions. This revealed largely invariant E/P contacts between the blastoderm and cell fate specification stages, despite changes in activity. However, E/P interactions diverge during terminal tissue differentiation when many tissue-specific interactions are gained on top of a pre-existing topology. Changes in E/P proximity reflect changes in enhancer activity and gene activation, and are generally not accompanied by changes in insulator binding. Using transgenes and deletions, we show that many tissue-specific interactions represent functional E-P pairs. Our results reveal a shift in E-P landscapes as embryogenesis proceeds, from largely pre-formed topologies at early stages to more distal tissue-specific loops during differentiation, when E/P proximity appears coupled to activation.",

    "abstract": "Gene ontology analyses of high confidence autism spectrum disorder (hcASD) risk genes have historically highlighted chromatin regulation and synaptic function as major contributors to pathobiology. Our recent functional work in vivo has additionally implicated microtubule biology and identified disrupted cellular proliferation as a convergent ASD phenotype. As many chromatin regulators, including ASD risk genes ADNP and CHD3, are known to directly regulate both tubulins and histones, we studied the five chromatin regulators most strongly associated with ASD (ADNP, CHD8, CHD2, POGZ, and SUV420H1/KMT5B) specifically with respect to microtubule biology. We observe that all five localize to microtubules of the mitotic spindle in vitro and in vivo. Further in-depth investigation of CHD2 provides evidence that patient-derived mutations lead to a range of microtubule-related phenotypes, including disrupted localization of the protein at the mitotic spindle, spindle defects, cell cycle stalling, DNA damage, and cell death. Lastly, we observe that ASD genetic risk is significantly enriched among microtubule-associated proteins, suggesting broader relevance. Together, these results provide further evidence that the role of tubulin biology and cellular proliferation in ASD warrant further investigation and highlight the pitfalls of relying solely on annotated gene functions in the search for pathological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndividuals who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are at increased risk for aging-related diseases and perform less well on tests of cognitive function. The Weathering Hypothesis proposes that these disparities in physical and cognitive health arise from an acceleration of biological processes of aging. Theories of how life adversity is biologically embedded identify epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation (DNAm), as a mechanistic interface between the environment and health. Consistent with the Weathering hypothesis and theories of biological embedding, recently developed DNAm algorithms have revealed profiles reflective of more advanced aging and lower cognitive function among socioeconomically-at-risk groups. These DNAm algorithms were developed using blood-DNA, but social and behavioral science research commonly collect saliva or cheek-swab DNA. This discrepancy is a potential barrier to research to elucidate mechanisms through which socioeconomic disadvantage affects aging and cognition. We therefore tested if social gradients observed in blood-DNAm measures could be reproduced using buccal-cell DNA obtained from cheek swabs.\n\nResultsWe analyzed three DNAm measures of biological aging and one DNAm measure of cognitive performance, all of which showed socioeconomic gradients in previous studies: the PhenoAge and GrimAge DNAm clocks, DunedinPACE, and Epigenetic-g. We first computed blood-buccal cross-tissue correlations in n=21 adults (GEO111165). Cross-tissue correlations were low-to-moderate across (r=.25 to r=.48). We next conducted analyses of socioeconomic gradients using buccal DNAm data from SOEP-G (n=1128, 57% female; age mean=42 yrs, SD=21.56, range 0-72). Associations of socioeconomic status with DNAm measures of aging were in the expected direction, but were smaller as compared to reports from blood DNAm datasets (r=-.08 to r=-.13).\n\nConclusionsOur findings are consistent with the hypothesis that socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with DNAm indicators of worse physical and cognitive health. However, relatively low cross-tissue correlations and attenuated effect-sizes for socioeconomic gradients in buccal DNAm compared with reports from analysis of blood DNAm suggest that, in order to take full advantage of buccal-DNA samples, DNAm algorithms customized to buccal DNAm are needed.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between coinfecting pathogens have the potential to alter the course of infection and can act as a source of phenotypic variation in susceptibility between hosts. This phenotypic variation may influence the evolution of host-pathogen interactions within host species and interfere with patterns in the outcomes of infection across host species. Here, we examine experimental coinfections of two Cripaviruses - Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV), and Drosophila C Virus (DCV) -across a panel of 25 Drosophila melanogaster inbred lines and 47 Drosophilidae host species. We find that interactions between these viruses alter viral loads across D. melanogaster genotypes, with a ~3 fold increase in the viral load of DCV and a ~2.5 fold decrease in CrPV in coinfection compared to single infection, but we find little evidence of a host genetic basis for these effects. Across host species, we find no evidence of systematic changes in susceptibility during coinfection, with no interaction between DCV and CrPV detected in the majority of host species. These results suggest that phenotypic variation in coinfection interactions within host species can occur independently of natural host genetic variation in susceptibility, and that patterns of susceptibility across host species to single infections can be robust to the added complexity of coinfection.",

    "abstract": "Social factors influence health outcomes and life expectancy. Individuals living in poverty often have adverse health outcomes related to chronic inflammation that affect the cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary systems. Negative psychosocial experiences are associated with transcriptional changes in genes associated with complex traits. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which poverty increases the risk of disease and health disparities are still not fully understood. To bridge the gap in our understanding of the link between living in poverty and adverse health outcomes, we performed RNA sequencing of blood immune cells from 204 participants of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study in Baltimore, Maryland. We identified 138 genes differentially expressed in association with poverty. Genes differentially expressed were enriched in wound healing and coagulation processes. Of the genes differentially expressed in individuals living in poverty, EEF1DP7 and VIL1 are also associated with hypertension in transcriptome-wide association studies. Our results suggest that living in poverty influences inflammation and the risk for cardiovascular disease through gene expression changes in immune cells.",

We tested the social complexity hypothesis on three macaque species that vary in their degree of social tolerance and complexity. We coded facial behavior in >3000 social interactions across three social contexts (aggressive, submissive, affiliative) in 389 animals, using the Facial Action Coding System for macaques (MaqFACS). We quantified communicative complexity using three measures of uncertainty: entropy, specificity, and prediction error. We found that the relative entropy of facial behavior was higher for the more tolerant crested macaques as compared to the less tolerant Barbary and rhesus macaques across all social contexts, indicating that crested macaques more frequently use a higher diversity of facial behavior. The context specificity of facial behavior was higher in rhesus as compared to Barbary and crested macaques, demonstrating that Barbary and crested macaques used facial behavior more flexibly across different social contexts. Finally, a random forest classifier predicted social context from facial behavior with highest accuracy for rhesus and lowest for crested, indicating there is higher uncertainty and complexity in the facial behavior of crested macaques. Overall, our results support the social complexity hypothesis.",

Leukocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can cross the BBB at inflammatory sites, emerging as promising carriers to target the disease brain. However, efficient mRNA loading into EVs and their uptake by neurons remain challenges. Here we incorporated inside EVs the endogenous retrovirus-like Arc protein capsids, stabilized by Arc 5UTR RNA elements, to effectively load and deliver mRNAs. Produced from self-derived leukocytes, engineered retrotransposon Arc EVs (eraEVs) are immunologically inert with minimal clearance. Equipped with endothelial adhesion molecules from donor leukocytes, circulating eraEVs enter the brain enriching at neuro-inflammatory sites. During self-assembly, Arc recruits enveloping proteins onto eraEVs further promoting neuronal uptake. Possessing high effectiveness like viral vectors and biocompatibility as natural vesicles, eraEV-nanocarriers can be produced from virtually all donor cell types, potentially leading to the development of future clinical therapies for a range of diseases.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518870v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@260a4aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16da754org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a79dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1983da8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), detectable in all bodily fluids, mediate intercellular communication by transporting molecules between cells. The capacity of EVs to transport molecules between distant organs has drawn interest for clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Although EVs hold potential for nucleic acid-based and other molecular therapeutics, the lack of standardized technologies, including isolation, characterization, and storage, leaves many challenges for clinical applications, potentially resulting in misinterpretation of crucial findings. Previously, several groups demonstrated the problems of commonly used storage methods that distort EV integrity. This work aims to evaluate the process to optimize the storage conditions of EVs and then characterize them according to the experimental conditions and the models used previously. Our study reports a highly efficient EV storage condition, focusing on EVs capacity to protect their molecular cargo from biological, chemical, and mechanical damage. Compared with commonly used EV storage conditions, our EV storage buffer leads to less size and particle number variation at both 4{degrees}C and -80 {degrees}C, enhancing the ability to protect EVs while maintaining targeting functionality.",

    "abstract": "In phylogenetic reconstruction, substitution models that assume nucleotide frequencies do not change through time are in very widespread use. DNA sequences can exhibit marked compositional difference. Such compositional heterogeneity implies sequence divergence has arisen from substitution processes that differ between the lineages. Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in exploring the non-stationary model class, which is capable of generating divergent sequence composition. These models are typically parameter rich and this richness is further compounded by the use of time-heterogeneous variants in order to capture compositional heterogeneity. This illuminates two barriers limiting the widespread application of the non-stationary model class: both the compute-time required to fit a model and the risk of model over-fitting increase with the number of parameters and the extent of time-heterogeneity. In this study, we address these issues with a novel model selection algorithm we term the Inherited Rate Matrix algorithm (hereafter IRM). This approach is based on the notion that a species inherits the substitution tendencies of its ancestor. We further present the non-stationary heterogeneous across lineages model (hereafter ns-HAL algorithm) which extends the HAL algorithm of Jayaswal et al. [2014] to the general nucleotide Markov process. The IRM algorithm substantially reduces the complexity of identifying a sufficient solution to the problem of time-heterogeneous substitution processes across lineages. We also address the issue of reducing the computing time with development of a constrained-optimisation approach for the IRM algorithm (fast-IRM). Our algorithms are implemented in Python 3. From a simulation study based on 2nd codon position genome sequences of yeast, we establish that IRM is significantly more accurate than both ns-HAL and heterogeneity in the substitution process across lineages (hereafter HAL) for close and dispersed sequences. IRM is up to 70x faster than ns-HAL while fast-IRM is around 140x faster. fast-IRM also showed a marked speed improvement over a C++ implementation of HAL. Our comparison of the accuracy of IRM with fast-IRM showed no difference with identical inferences made for all data sets. These two algorithms greatly improve the compute time for model selection of a non-stationary process, increasing the suite of problems to which this important substitution model class can be applied.",

    "abstract": "Cellular processes are the product of interactions between biomolecules, which associate to form biologically active complexes 1. These interactions are mediated by intermolecular contacts, which if disrupted, lead to alterations in cell physiology. Nevertheless, the formation of intermolecular contacts nearly universally requires changes in the conformations of the interacting biomolecules. As a result, binding affinity and cellular activity crucially depend not only on the strength of the contacts, but also on the inherent propensities to form binding-competent conformational states2,3. Thus, conformational penalties are ubiquitous in biology and must be known in order to quantitatively model binding energetics for protein and nucleic acid interactions4,5. However, conceptual and technological limitations have hindered our ability to dissect and quantitatively measure how conformational propensities impact cellular activity. Here, we systematically altered and determined the propensities for forming the protein-bound conformation of HIV-1 TAR RNA. These propensities quantitatively predicted the binding affinities of TAR to the RNA-binding region of the Tat protein and predicted the extent of HIV-1 Tat-dependent transactivation in cells. Our results establish the role of ensemble-based conformational propensities in cellular activity and reveal an example of a cellular process driven by an exceptionally rare and short-lived RNA conformational state.",

    "abstract": "High frequency burst firing is critical in summation of back-propagating action potentials (APs) in dendrites, which may greatly depolarize dendritic membrane potential. The physiological significance of burst firings of hippocampal dentate GCs in synaptic plasticity remains unknown. We found that GCs with low input resistance could be categorized into regular-spiking (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) cells based on their initial firing frequency (Finit) upon somatic rheobase current injection, and investigated how two types of GCs differ in long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency lateral perforant pathway (LPP) inputs. Induction of Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses required at least three postsynaptic APs at Finit higher than 100 Hz, which was met in BS but not in RS cells. The synaptically evoked burst firing was critically dependent on persistent Na+ current, which was larger in BS than RS cells. The Ca2+ source for Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses was primarily provided by L-type calcium channels. In contrast, Hebbian LTP at medial PP synapses was mediated by T-type calcium channels, and could be induced regardless of cell types or Finit of postsynaptic APs. These results suggest that intrinsic firing properties affect synaptically driven firing patterns, and that bursting behavior differentially affects Hebbian LTP mechanisms depending on the synaptic input pathway.",

    "abstract": "Error-related potentials (ErrP) are a prominent electroencephalogram (EEG) correlate of performance monitoring, and so crucial for learning and adapting our behavior. Although there exists an agreement that ErrP signal awareness to errors, it remains poorly understood whether they encode further information. Here we report an experiment with sixteen participants during three recording sessions in which occasional visuomotor rotations of varying magnitude occurred during a cursor reaching task. We designed a brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect ErrP in single trials that provided real-time feedback to participants by changing the color of the cursor upon ErrP detection. The individual ErrP-BCI decoders exhibited good transfer across recording sessions and scalability over the varying magnitude of errors. Our results indicate that ErrPs encode not only the conscious perception of errors, but also their magnitude, in their amplitude and latency. Furthermore, a non-linear relationship between the ErrP-BCI output and the magnitude of errors predicts individual perceptual thresholds to detect rotations. The uncovered relationship is consistent with non-human primate studies, which found a similar relationship between the size of errors and simple spike activity of Purkinje cells, and we conjecture a cerebellar contribution to ErrP. Our experimental setup and findings open new avenues to probe and extend current theories of performance monitoring, which are based on response conflict tasks, by incorporating continuous human-interaction tasks as well as analysis of the ErrP complex as a whole rather than individual peaks.",

    "abstract": "Despite our best efforts to discover new antimicrobials, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to become resistant. Resistance to antimicrobials can be attributed to innate, inducible, and acquired mechanisms. Mycobacterium abscessus is one of the most antimicrobial resistant bacteria and is known to cause chronic pulmonary infections within the cystic fibrosis community. Previously, we identified epetraborole as an inhibitor against M. abscessus with in vitro and in vivo activities and that the efficacy of epetraborole could be improved with the combination of the non-proteinogenic amino acid norvaline. Norvaline demonstrated activity against the M. abscessus epetraborole resistant mutants thus, limiting resistance to epetraborole in wild type populations. Here we show M. abscessus mutants with resistance to epetraborole can acquire resistance to norvaline in a leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) editing-independent manner. After showing that the membrane hydrophobicity and efflux activity are not linked to norvaline resistance, whole-genome sequencing identified a mutation in the allosteric regulatory domain of -isopropylmalate synthase (-IPMS). We found that mutants with the -IPMSA555V variant incorporated less norvaline in the proteome and produced more leucine than the parental strain. Furthermore, we found that leucine can rescue growth inhibition from norvaline challenge in the parental strain. Our results demonstrate that M. abscessus can modulate its metabolism through mutations in an allosteric regulatory site to upregulate the biosynthesis of the natural LeuRS substrate and outcompete norvaline. These findings emphasize the antimicrobial resistant nature of M. abscessus and describe a unique mechanism of substrate-inhibitor competition.\n\nSignificance StatementCystic fibrosis patients and individuals undergoing plastic surgery are at risk for acquiring chronic infections from Mycobacterium abscessus. Current antibiotics are not adequate and require increased drug discovery efforts to identify better treatments for these patients. The benzoxaborole, epetraborole has been shown by our group and others to be a promising candidate against M. abscessus but the emergence of resistance to epetraborole in a clinical trial for complicated urinary tract infections has hindered its development. Previously, we identified the combination of epetraborole and norvaline as a potential means to limit resistance against epetraborole. Our results here demonstrate that M. abscessus can acquire resistance to both epetraborole and norvaline. These results may help develop combination therapies to reduce the risk of resistance to benzoxaboroles and non-proteinogenic amino acids.",

    "abstract": "During nutrient stress, macroautophagy is employed to degrade cellular macromolecules, thereby providing biosynthetic building blocks while simultaneously remodeling the proteome. While the machinery responsible for initiation of macroautophagy is well characterized, our understanding of the extent to which individual proteins, protein complexes and organelles are selected for autophagic degradation, and the underlying targeting mechanisms is limited. Here, we use orthogonal proteomic strategies to provide a global molecular inventory of autophagic cargo during nutrient stress in mammalian cell lines. Through prioritization of autophagic cargo, we identify a heterodimeric pair of membrane-embedded proteins, YIPF3 and YIPF4, as receptors for Golgiphagy. During nutrient stress, YIPF4 is mobilized into ATG8-positive vesicles that traffic to lysosomes as measured via Golgiphagy flux reporters in a process that requires the VPS34 and ULK1-FIP200 arms of the autophagy system. Cells lacking YIPF3 or YIPF4 are selectively defective in elimination of Golgi membrane proteins during nutrient stress. By merging absolute protein abundance with autophagic turnover, we create a global protein census describing how autophagic degradation maps onto protein abundance and subcellular localization. Our results, available via an interactive web tool, reveal that autophagic turnover prioritizes membrane-bound organelles (principally Golgi and ER) for proteome remodeling during nutrient stress.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryDuring nutrient stress, macroautophagy uses organelle-phagy receptors to prioritize recycling of Golgi and ER membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by a decline in tissue function, but the underlying changes at cellular resolution across the organism remain unclear. Here, we present the Aging Fly Cell Atlas, a single-nucleus transcriptomic map of the whole aging Drosophila. We characterize 163 distinct cell types and perform an in-depth analysis of changes in tissue cell composition, gene expression, and cell identities. We further develop aging clock models to predict the fly age and show that ribosomal gene expression is a conserved predictive factor for age. Combining all aging features, we find unique cell type-specific aging patterns. This atlas provides a valuable resource for studying fundamental principles of aging in complex organisms.",

    "abstract": "Firefly flashes are well-known visual signals used by these insects to find, identify, and choose mates. However, many firefly species have lost the ability to produce light as adults. These \"unlighted\" species generally lack developed adult light organs, are diurnal rather than nocturnal, and are believed to use volatile pheromones acting over a distance to locate mates. While cuticular hydrocarbons, which may function in mate recognition at close range, have been examined for a handful of the over 2000 extant firefly species, no volatile pheromone has ever been identified. In this study, using coupled gas chromatography - electroantennographic detection, we detected a single female-emitted compound that elicited antennal responses from wild-caught male winter fireflies, Photinus corrusca. The compound was identified as (1S)-exo-3-hydroxycamphor (hydroxycamphor). In field trials at two sites across the species eastern North American range, large numbers of male P. corrusca were attracted to synthesized hydroxycamphor, verifying its function as a volatile sex attractant pheromone. Males spent more time in contact with lures treated with synthesized hydroxycamphor than those treated with solvent only in laboratory two-choice assays. Further, using single sensillum recordings, we characterized a pheromone-sensitive odorant receptor neuron in a specific olfactory sensillum on male P. corrusca antennae and demonstrated its sensitivity to hydroxycamphor. Thus, this study has identified the first volatile pheromone and its corresponding sensory neuron for any firefly species, and provides a tool for monitoring P. corrusca populations for conservation, and further inquiry into the chemical and cellular bases for sexual communication among fireflies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious human cases or epidemics have suggested that Monkeypox virus (MPXV) can be transmitted through contacts with animals of African rainforests. Although MPXV has been identified in many mammal species, most are likely secondary hosts and the reservoir host has yet to be discovered.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsIn this study, we provide the full list of African mammal genera (and species) in which MPXV was previously detected and predict the geographic distributions of all species of these genera based on museum specimens and an ecological niche modelling (ENM) method. Then, we reconstruct the ecological niche of MPXV using georeferenced data on animal MPXV sequences and human index cases, and conduct overlap analyses with the ecological niches inferred for 99 mammal species in order to identify the most probable animal reservoir.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results show that the MPXV niche covers three African rainforests, the Congo Basin and Upper and Lower Guinean forests. The four mammal species showing the best niche overlap with MPXV are all arboreal rodents, including three squirrels, Funisciurus anerythrus, Funisciurus pyrropus, and Heliosciurus rufobrachium, and Graphiurus lorraineus. We conclude that the most probable MPXV reservoir is F. anerythrus based on two niche overlap metrics, the areas of higher probabilities of occurrence, and available data on MPXV detection.\n\nSummaryMonkeypox (MPX) is an emerging zoonotic disease, endemic to rainforests of West and Central Africa, which manifests as a fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue, followed by a rash with macular lesions progressing from papules to vesicles, pustules and scabs, usually on the face, hands, and feet for two to four weeks. The case fatality rate ranges from 1-3% in West Africa to 5-10% in Central Africa. The disease has been reported in 10 African countries between 1970 and today, with an increasing number of cases over the last decades and several exportations outside the continent, the last one in 2022 resulting in an epidemic involving mostly men who have sex with men, with more than 80,000 cases detected worldwide.\n\nAlthough MPX virus has been identified in many mammal species, most are likely secondary hosts and the reservoir host has yet to be discovered. In this study, we compare the predicted geographic distribution (ecological niche) of the MPX virus with that of 99 mammal species, and conclude that the most probable MPX reservoir is Thomass rope squirrel (Funisciurus anerythrus), followed by three other arboreal rodents, including two squirrels (Funisciurus pyrropus and Heliosciurus rufobrachium) and the Lorrain dormouse (Graphiurus lorraineus).",

    "abstract": "Traditional genetic mapping studies using inbred crosses are a powerful tool for identifying chromosomal regions associated with ethanol-related traits, but typically have very large confidence intervals which make identification of specific and potentially causal candidate genes difficult. Diversity Outbred (DO) mice offer the ability to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with ethanol-drinking behaviors at a high resolution that allows for easier identification of candidate genes. Here, we exposed a population of 636 male DO mice to four weeks of intermittent ethanol access via a three-bottle choice paradigm, identifying 3 significant (Chrs 3, 4, and 12) and 12 suggestive loci for ethanol-drinking behaviors. The confidence intervals for these loci were narrow (1-4 Mbp for significant QTLs). We then further analyzed positional candidate genes using transcriptomics data from prefrontal cortex samples taken from 220 of these animals, as well as human GWAS data and prior gene set data for ethanol or other drugs of abuse. These results represent the highest-resolution genetic mapping of ethanol consumption behaviors in mice to date, providing for the identification of novel loci and candidate genes for progressive ethanol consumption, including Car8 --the lone gene with a significant cis-eQTL in strong linkage disequilibrium with our QTL for last week ethanol consumption on Chr 4.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the second most diagnosed and the deadliest subtype of leukemia. Recently genetic loss-of-function studies have demonstrated that a human YEATS domain-containing protein named eleven-nineteen-leukaemia (ENL) functions as a transcriptional coactivator and is essential for the proliferation of AML that harbours oncogenic multiple lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangements. We previously synthesized a series of small molecule inhibitors (1, 7-9, 11-15 and 24) that displayed significant and specific inhibitory effects against the ENL YEAST domain. In the current work, we report the development of a novel NanoBRET system that allows the analysis of cellular permeability, potency, selectivity, and stability of synthesized ENL inhibitors for their prioritization for further characterizations. Followed by in vitro metabolic stability and cell growth inhibition studies, we narrowed down to a potent and specific ENL YEATS domain inhibitor 13 with both high in vitro metabolic stability and strong anti-proliferation ability on MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines. A mouse pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis showed that at an oral dose of 20 mg/kg compound 13 had 60.9% bioavailability and 2.6 h mean residence time. With these favorable PK characteristics, compound 13 is ready for efficacy studies in an animal model. Cumulatively, the current study has prioritized compound 13 as a promising drug candidate to disrupt the pathogenic functions of ENL for the AML treatment.",

We replicated the survey in 2022 to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought more information on bullying and QRPs. Here, we compare data from 2019 (658 respondents) and 2022 (530 respondents), and detail poor professional and research conditions experienced by ECRs. Job satisfaction declined (62% versus 57%), workload concerns increased (48.6% versus 60.6%), more indicated \"now is a poor time to commence a research career\" (65% versus 76%) from 2019 to 2022, and roughly half reported experiencing bullying. Perhaps conditions could be tolerable if the ecosystem were yielding well-trained scientists and high-quality science. Unfortunately, there are signs of poor supervision and high rates of QRPs. ECRs detailed problems likely worthy of investigation, but few (22.4%) felt that their institute would act on a complaint.

    "abstract": "BackgroundTreatment of nerve injuries proves to be a worldwide clinical challenge. Acellular nerve allografts are suggested to be a promising alternative for bridging a nerve gap to the current gold standard, an autologous nerve graft.\n\nObjectiveTo systematically review the efficacy of the acellular nerve allograft, its difference from the gold standard (the nerve autograft) and to discuss its possible indications.\n\nMaterial and methodsPubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched until the 4th of January 2022. Original peer reviewed paper that presented 1) distinctive data; 2) a clear comparison between not immunologically processed acellular allografts and autologous nerve transfers; 3) was performed in laboratory animals of all species and sex. Meta analyses and subgroup analyses (for graft length and species) were conducted for muscle weight, sciatic function index, ankle angle, nerve conduction velocity, axon count diameter, tetanic contraction and amplitude using a Random effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted on graft length and species.\n\nResultsFifty articles were included in this review and all were included in the meta-analyses. An acellular allograft resulted in a significantly lower muscle weight, sciatic function index, ankle angle, nerve conduction velocity, axon count and smaller diameter, tetanic contraction compared to an autologous nerve graft. No difference was found in amplitude between acellular allografts and autologous nerve transfers. Post hoc subgroup analyses of graft length showed a significant reduced muscle weight in long grafts versus small and medium length grafts. All included studies showed a large variance in methodological design.\n\nConclusionOur review shows that the included studies, investigating the use of acellular allografts, showed a large variance in methodological design and are as a consequence difficult to compare. Nevertheless, our results indicate that treating a nerve gap with an allograft results in an inferior nerve recovery compared to an autograft in seven out of eight outcomes assessed in experimental animals. In addition, based on our preliminary post hoc subgroup analyses we suggest that when an allograft is being used an allograft in short and medium (0-1cm, > 1-2cm) nerve gaps is preferred over an allograft in long (> 2cm) nerve gaps.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory experimental evolution provides a powerful tool for studying microbial adaptation to different environments. To understand the differences and similarities of the dynamic evolutionary landscapes of two model species from the Bacillus genus as they adapt to abiotic and biotic surfaces, we revived the archived population samples from our four previous experimental evolution studies and performed longitudinal whole-population genome sequencing. Surprisingly, higher number of mutations, higher genotypic diversity, and higher evolvability were detected in the biotic conditions with smaller population size. Different adaptation strategies were observed in different environments within each species, with more diversified mutational spectrum detected in biotic conditions. The insertion sequences of Bacillus thuringiensis are critical for its adaptation to the plastic bead-attached biofilm environment, but insertion sequence mobility was a general phenomenon in this species independent of the selection condition. Additionally, certain parallel evolution has been observed across species and environments, particularly when two species adapt to the same environment at the same time. Further, our results suggest that the population size might be an important driver of evolution. Together, these results provide the first comprehensive mutational landscape of two bacterial species biofilms that is adapted to an abiotic and biotic surface.\n\nImportanceBiofilm formation is a vital factor for the survival and adaptation of bacteria in diverse environmental niches. Experimental evolution combined with the advancement of whole-population genome sequencing provides us a powerful tool to understand the genomic dynamic of evolutionary adaptation to different environments, such as during biofilm development. Previous studies described the genetic and phenotypic changes of selected clones from experimentally evolved Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus subtilis that were adapted under abiotic and biotic biofilm conditions. However, the full understanding of the dynamic evolutionary landscapes was lacking. Further, the differences and similarities of adaptive mechanisms in B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis were not identified. To overcome these limitations, we performed longitudinal whole-population genome sequencing to study the underlying genetic dynamics at high resolution. Our study provides the first comprehensive mutational landscape of two bacterial species biofilms that is adapted to an abiotic and biotic surface.",

The fundamental challenge in eDNA analyses has been the bioinformatical assignment of reads to taxonomic groups. It has long been known that full probabilistic methods for phylogenetic assignment are preferable, but unfortunately, such methods are computationally intensive and are typically inapplicable to modern Next-Generation Sequencing data. We here present a fast approximate likelihood method for phylogenetic assignment of DNA sequences. Applying the new method to several mock communities and simulated datasets, we show that it identifies more reads at both high and low taxonomic levels more accurately than other leading methods. The advantage of the method is particularly apparent in the presence of polymorphisms and/or sequencing errors and when the true species is not represented in the reference database.",

We propose that this architecture enables better learning and generalization than architectures with less specialized modules. To test this hypothesis, we trained reinforcement learning agents with various neural architectures on a naturalistic navigation task. We found that the architecture that largely segregates computations of state representation, value, and action into specialized modules enables more efficient learning and better generalization. Behaviors of agents with this architecture also resemble macaque behaviors more closely. Investigating the latent state computations in these agents, we discovered that the learned state representation combines prediction and observation, weighted by their relative uncertainty, akin to a Kalman filter. These results shed light on the possible rationale for the brain's modular specializations and suggest that artificial systems can use this insight from neuroscience to improve learning and generalization in natural tasks.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)-induced cardiac events are one of the life-threatening infection outcomes of invasive pneumococcal disease. S. pneumoniae has the ability to invade the myocardium and damage cardiomyocytes, however the contribution of the immune response during this process is not fully understood. We previously found that polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) are crucial for host defense against S. pneumoniae lung infection and that extracellular adenosine (EAD) production, by exonucleosidases CD39 and CD73, controlled the anti-bacterial functions of these cells. The objective of this study was to explore the role of PMNs and the EAD-pathway in host cardiac damage during invasive pneumococcal infection. Upon intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection with invasive S. pneumoniae TIGR4 strain, hearts of C57BL/6 mice showed an increased influx of PMNs as determined by flow cytometry. However, the increased PMN numbers failed to contain the bacterial burden in the heart and showed positive correlation with serum levels of the cardiac damage marker Troponin-1. Influx of PMNs into the heart was associated with constant presence of neutrophil degranulation products in the cardiac tissue. Depletion of PMNs prior infection reduced pneumococcal burden in the heart and lowered the Troponin-1 levels thus, indicating their role in cardiac damage. While exploring the mechanisms underlying the damaging PMN response, we found that by 24hpi, there was a significant reduction in the expression of CD39 and CD73 on cardiac PMNs. The role of CD73 in regulating cardiac damage was tested in vivo using CD73-/- mice which had significantly higher bacterial burden and cardiac damage compared to wild type mice despite similar PMN numbers. The role of CD73 expression on PMNs was also tested ex vivo using the HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line which upon S. pneumoniae infection, showed increased cell death in presence of CD73-/- PMNs. Our findings have identified a detrimental role for PMNs in cardiac damage during invasive pneumococcal infection that is in part driven by reduced expression of EAD-producing enzymes in late disease stages.",

The most widely used method of short-read sequencing uses sequencing by synthesis (SBS). Here we perform a study of a novel sequencing technology -- avidity sequencing. In this short note, we compare the performance of imputation from low-pass libraries sequenced on an Element AVITI system (which utilizes avidity sequencing) to those sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (which utilizes SBS) with an SP flow cell for the same set of biological samples across a range of genetic ancestries. We observed dramatically lower duplication rates in the data deriving from the AVITI system compared to the NovaSeq 6000, resulting in higher effective coverage given a fixed number of sequenced bases, and comparable imputation accuracy performance between sequencing chemistries across ancestries. This study demonstrates that avidity sequencing is a viable alternative to the standard SBS chemistries for applications involving low-pass sequencing plus imputation.",
