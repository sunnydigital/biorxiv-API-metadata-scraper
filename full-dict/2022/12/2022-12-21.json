    "abstract": "Recent advances in genome sequencing and assembly techniques have made it possible to achieve chromosome level reference genomes for citrus. Relatively few genomes have been anchored at the chromosome level and/or are haplotype phased, with the available genomes of varying accuracy and completeness. We now report a phased high-quality chromosome level genome assembly for an Australian native citrus species; Citrus australis (round lime) using highly accurate PacBio HiFi long reads, complemented with Hi-C scaffolding. Hifiasm with Hi-C integrated assembly resulted in a 331 Mb genome of C. australis with two haplotypes of nine pseudochromosomes with an N50 of 36.3 Mb and 98.8% genome assembly completeness (BUSCO). Repeat analysis showed that more than 50% of the genome contained interspersed repeats. Among them, LTR elements were the predominant type (21.0%), of which LTR Gypsy (9.8 %) and LTR copia (7.7 %) elements were the most abundant repeats. A total of 29,464 genes and 32,009 transcripts were identified in the genome. Of these, 28,222 CDS (25,753 genes) had BLAST hits and 21,401 CDS (75.8%) were annotated with at least one GO term. Citrus specific genes for antimicrobial peptides, defense, volatile compounds and acidity regulation were identified. This chromosome scale, and haplotype resolved C. australis genome will facilitate the study of important genes for citrus breeding and will also allow the enhanced definition of the evolutionary relationships between wild and domesticated citrus species.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) plays a key role in controlling wakefulness, but the downstream target regions participating in this control process remain unknown. Here, using circuit-specific fiber photometry and single-neuron electrophysiology together with electroencephalogram, electromyogram and behavioral recordings, we find approximately half of SuM neurons that project to the medial septum (MS) are wake-active. Optogenetic stimulation of axonal terminals of SuM-MS projection induces a rapid and reliable transition to wakefulness from NREM or REM sleep, and chemogenetic activation of SuMMS projecting neurons significantly increases wakefulness time and prolongs latency to sleep. Consistently, chemogenetically inhibiting these neurons significantly reduces wakefulness time and latency to sleep. Therefore, these results identify the MS as a functional downstream target of SuM and provide evidence for a causal role for this hypothalamic-septal projection in wakefulness control.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in vaccine development, especially against rapidly evolving viruses, is the ability to focus the immune response toward evolutionarily conserved antigenic regions to confer broad protection. For example, while many broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza have been found to target the highly conserved stem region of hemagglutinin (HA-stem), the immune response to seasonal influenza vaccines is predominantly directed to the immunodominant but variable head region (HA-head), leading to narrow-spectrum efficacy. Here, we first introduce an approach to controlling antigen orientation based on the site-specific insertion of short stretches of aspartate residues (oligoD) that facilitates antigen-binding to alum adjuvants. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach to antigens from the Ebola virus, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza and observe enhanced antibody responses following immunization in all cases. Next, we use this approach to reorient HA in an \"upside down\" configuration, which we envision increases HA-stem exposure, therefore also improving its immunogenicity compared to HA-head. When applied to HA of H2N2 A/Japan/305/1957, the reoriented H2 HA (reoH2HA) on alum induced a stem-directed antibody response that cross-reacted with both group 1 and 2 influenza A HAs. Our results demonstrate the possibility and benefits of antigen reorientation via oligoD insertion, which represents a generalizable immunofocusing approach readily applicable for designing epitope-focused vaccine candidates.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=83 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521291v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185f949org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b132a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@174fcc8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17fb872_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Seasonal influenza vaccines induce a biased antibody response against the variable head of hemagglutinin, whereas conserved epitopes on the stem are a target for universal vaccines.

Strikingly, [~]40% of patients that present with PG have underlying IBD, suggesting shared but unknown pathogenesis mechanisms. Impeding the development of effective treatments for PG is the absence of an animal model that exhibits features of both skin and gut manifestations. This study describes the development of the first experimental drug-induced mouse model of PG with concurrent intestinal inflammation. Topical application of pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors on wounded mouse skin generates skin ulcers enriched in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and pro-inflammatory cellular as well as soluble mediators mimicking human PG. The mice also develop spontaneous intestinal inflammation demonstrated by histologic damage. Further investigations revealed increased circulating immature low-density IL-1{beta} primed granulocytes that undergo enhanced NETosis at inflamed tissue sites supported by increase in circulatory citrullinated histone 3, a marker of aberrant NET formation. Granulocyte depletion dampens the intestinal inflammation in this model, further supporting the notion that granulocytes contribute to the skin-gut crosstalk in PG mice. We anticipate that this novel murine PG model will enable researchers to probe common disease mechanisms and identify more effective targets for treatment for PG patients with IBD.",

    "abstract": "Primary AbstractThe euphotic zone of the surface ocean contains distinct physical-chemical regimes that vary inversely in light and nutrient concentrations as a function of depth. The most numerous phytoplankter of the mid- and low-latitude ocean is the picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, which consists of ecologically distinct subpopulations (i.e., \"ecotypes\"). Ecotypes have different temperature, light and nutrient optima and display distinct relative abundances along gradients of these niche dimensions. As a primary producer, Prochlorococcus fixes and releases organic carbon to neighboring microbes as part of the microbial loop. However, little is known about the specific molecules Prochlorococcus accumulates and releases or how these processes vary among its ecotypes. Here we characterize metabolite diversity of Prochlorococcus by profiling three ecologically-distinct cultured strains: MIT9301, representing a high-light adapted ecotype dominating shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters, MIT0801, representing a low-light adapted ecotype found throughout the euphotic zone and MIT9313, representing a low-light adapted ecotype relatively most abundant at the base of the euphotic zone. In both intracellular and extracellular metabolite profiles, we observe striking differences across strains in the accumulation and release of molecules. Some differences reflect variable genome content across the strains, while others likely reflect variable regulation of genetically-conserved pathways. In the extracellular profiles, we identify molecules that may serve as currencies in Prochlorococcus interactions with neighboring microbes and therefore merit further investigation.\n\nImportanceApproximately half of the annual carbon fixation on Earth occurs in the surface ocean through the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton such as the ubiquitous picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. Ecologically-distinct subpopulations of Prochlorococcus (or ecotypes) are central conduits of organic substrates into the ocean microbiome, thus playing important roles in surface ocean production. By measuring the chemical profile of three cultured ecotype strains, we observed striking differences in the likely chemical impact of Prochlorococcus subpopulations on their surroundings. Subpopulations differ along gradients of temperature, light and nutrient concentrations, suggesting that these chemical differences could affect carbon cycling in different ocean strata and should be considered in models of Prochlorococcus physiology and marine carbon dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The interactions between a host cell and a pathogen can dictate disease outcomes and are important targets for host-directed therapies. Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is a highly antibiotic resistant, rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium that infects patients with chronic lung diseases. Mab can infect host immune cells, such as macrophages, which contribute to its pathogenesis. However, our understanding of initial host-Mab interactions remains unclear. Here, we developed a functional genetic approach to define these host-Mab interactions by coupling a Mab fluorescent reporter with a genome-wide knockout library in murine macrophages. We used this approach to conduct a forward genetic screen to define host genes that contribute to the uptake of Mab by macrophages. We identified known regulators of phagocytosis, such as the integrin ITGB2, and uncovered a key requirement for glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) synthesis for macrophages to efficiently take up Mab. CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of three key sGAG biosynthesis regulators, Ugdh, B3gat3 and B4galt7 resulted in reduced uptake of both smooth and rough Mab variants by macrophages. Mechanistic studies suggest that sGAGs function upstream of pathogen engulfment and are required for the uptake of Mab, but not Escherichia coli or latex beads. Further investigation found that the loss of sGAGs reduced the surface expression, but not the mRNA expression, of key integrins suggesting an important role for sGAGs in modulating surface receptor availability. Together, these studies globally define and characterize important regulators of macrophage-Mab interactions and are a first step to understanding host genes that contribute to Mab pathogenesis and disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEPathogen interactions with immune cells like macrophages contribute to pathogenesis, yet the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain largely undefined. For emerging respiratory pathogens, like Mycobacterium abscessus, understanding these host-pathogen interactions is important to fully understand disease progression. Given that M. abscessus is broadly recalcitrant to antibiotic treatments, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide knockout library in murine macrophages to globally define host genes required for M. abscessus uptake. We identified new macrophage uptake regulators during M. abscessus infection, including a subset of integrins and the glycosaminoglycan synthesis (sGAG) pathway. While ionic characteristics of sGAGs are known to drive pathogen-cell interactions, we discovered a previously unrecognized requirement for sGAGs to maintain robust surface expression of key uptake receptors. Thus, we developed a flexible forward-genetic pipeline to define important interactions during M. abscessus infection and more broadly identified a new mechanism by which sGAGs control pathogen uptake.",

    "abstract": "Stable isotope probing (SIP) facilitates culture-independent identification of active microbial populations within complex ecosystems through isotopic enrichment of nucleic acids. Many SIP studies rely on 16S rRNA sequences to identify active taxa but connecting these sequences to specific bacterial genomes is often challenging. Here, we describe a standardized laboratory and analysis framework to quantify isotopic enrichment on a per-genome basis using shotgun metagenomics instead of 16S rRNA sequencing. To develop this framework, we explored various sample processing and analysis approaches using a designed microbiome where the identity of labeled genomes, and their level of isotopic enrichment, were experimentally controlled. With this ground truth dataset, we empirically assessed the accuracy of different analytic models for identifying active taxa, and examined how sequencing depth impacts the detection of isotopically labeled genomes. We also demonstrate that using synthetic DNA internal standards to measure absolute genome abundances in SIP density fractions improves estimates of isotopic enrichment. In addition, our study illustrates the utility of internal standards to reveal anomalies in sample handling that could negatively impact SIP metagenomic analyses if left undetected. Finally, we present SIPmg, an R package to facilitate the estimation of absolute abundances and perform statistical analyses for identifying labeled genomes within SIP metagenomic data. This experimentally validated analysis framework strengthens the foundation of DNA-SIP metagenomics as a tool for accurately measuring the in situ activity of environmental microbial populations and assessing their genomic potential.\n\nImportanceAnswering the question of  who is eating what? within complex microbial communities is paramount for our ability to model, predict, and modulate microbiomes for improved human and planetary health. This question is often pursued using stable isotope probing to track the incorporation of labeled compounds into cellular DNA during microbial growth. However, with traditional stable isotope methods, it is challenging to establish links between an active microorganisms taxonomic identity and genome composition, while providing quantitative estimates of the microorganisms isotope incorporation rate. Here, we report an experimental and analytical workflow that lays the foundation for improved detection of metabolically active microorganisms and better quantitative estimates of genome-resolved isotope incorporation, which can be used to further refine ecosystem-scale models for carbon and nutrient fluxes within microbiomes.",

Tracing the spread of X. citri disease has been performed using several different typing methods over the years but recent studies using genomic sequencing have been key to understanding evolutionary relationships within the species including fundamental differences between XCC pathotypes.\n\nIn this study we developed a core genome multilocus typing scheme (cgMLST) for X. citri based upon 250 genomes comprising multiple examples of X. citri subsp. citri pathotypes A, A* and Aw, X. citri subsp. malvacearum and X. citri pathovars aurantifolii, fuscans, glycines, malvacearum, mangiferaeindicae, viticola, vignicola and single isolates of X. citri pathovars dieffenbachiae and punicae. This dataset included genomic sequencing of 100 novel XCC isolates. The cgMLST scheme, based upon 1618 core genes across 250 genomes, has been implemented at PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/organisms/xanthomonas-citri/). Grapetree minimum-spanning, and iTOL Neighbour-joining phylogenies generated from cgMLST data resolved almost identical groupings of isolates to a core genome SNP - based neighbour joining phylogeny taking 4 min, 15 min and 36 h respectively. These resolved identical groupings of XCC pathotypes and X. citri subsp. and pathovars.\n\nX. citri cgMLST should prove to be an increasingly valuable resource for the study of this key species of plant pathogenic bacteria.

ULK1 co-localizes with p62 bodies, and directly interacts with p62. This phosphorylation allows KEAP1 to be retained within p62 bodies, activating NRF2. p62S351E/+ mice are phosphomimetic knock-in mice in which Ser351 corresponding to human Ser349 is replaced by Glu. These mice, but not phosphodefective p62S351A/S351A mice, exhibit NRF2 hyperactivation and growth retardation, the latter caused by malnutrition and dehydration due to obstruction of the esophagus and forestomach secondary to hyperkeratosis. p62S351E/+ mice are a phenocopy of systemic Keap1-knockout mice.

Genetic deletion of Socs1 results in unrestrained cytokine signaling and neonatal lethality, characterised by an inflammatory immune infiltrate in multiple organs. Overexpression and structural studies have suggested that the SOCS1 kinase inhibitory region (KIR) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain are important for interaction with and inhibition of the receptor-associated JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases, which initiate downstream signaling. To investigate the role of the KIR and SH2 domain in SOCS1 function, we independently mutated key conserved residues in each domain and analysed the impact on cytokine signaling, and the in vivo impact on SOCS1 function. Mutation of the SOCS1-KIR or SH2 domain had no impact on the integrity of the SOCS box complex, however, mutation within the phosphotyrosine binding pocket of the SOCS1-SH2 domain specifically disrupted SOCS1 interaction with phosphorylated JAK1. In contrast, mutation of the KIR did not affect the interaction with JAK1, but did prevent SOCS1 inhibition of JAK1 autophosphorylation. In human and mouse cell lines, both mutants impacted the ability of SOCS1 to restrain cytokine signaling, and crucially, Socs1-R105A and Socs1-F59A mice displayed a neonatal lethality and excessive inflammatory phenotype similar to SOCS1 null mice. This study defines a critical and non-redundant role for both the KIR and SH2 domain in endogenous SOCS1 function.",

Egg-laying mammals (monotremes) are an important sister clade for understanding mammalian placental evolution, but the env genes in their genomes have yet to be investigated. Here, env-derived open reading frames (env-ORFs) encoding more than 400 amino-acid lengths were searched in the genomes of two monotremes: platypus and echidna. Only two env-ORFs were present in the platypus genome, whereas 121 env-ORFs were found in the echidna genome. The echidna env-ORFs were phylogenetically classified into seven groups named env-Tac1 to -Tac7. Among them, the env-Tac1 group contained only a single gene, and its amino acid sequence showed high similarity to those of the RD114/simian type D retroviruses. Using the pseudotyped virus assay, we demonstrated that the Env-Tac1 protein utilizes echidna sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter type 1 and 2 (ASCT1 and ASCT2) as entry receptors. Moreover, the Env-Tac1 protein caused cell-cell fusion in human 293T cells depending on the expression of ASCT1 and ASCT2. These results illustrate that fusogenic env genes are not restricted to placental mammals, providing insights into the evolution of retroviral genes and the placenta.",

    "abstract": "We present a new approach for predicting functional sequence patterns in mRNA, known as motifs. These motifs play an important role in understanding the mechanisms of the cell life cycle in clinical research and drug discovery. However, many existing neural network models for mRNA event prediction only take the sequence as input, and do not consider the positional information of the sequence. In contrast, motifNet is a lightweight neural network that uses both the sequence and its positional information as input. This allows for the implicit neural representation of the various motif interaction patterns in human mRNA sequences. The model can then be used to interactively generate motif patterns and the positional effect score in mRNA activities. Additionally, motifNet can identify violations of motif patterns in real human mRNA variants that are associated with disease-related cell dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Lexical stress is an essential element of prosody. Mastering this prosodic feature is challenging, especially in a stress-free foreign language for individuals native to a stress-fixed language, a phenomenon referred to as stress deafness. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we elucidated the neuronal underpinnings of stress processing in a stress-free foreign language, and determined the underlying mechanism of stress deafness. Here, we contrasted behavioral and hemodynamic responses revealed by native speakers of a stress-free (German; N = 38) and a stress-fixed (French; N = 47) language while discriminating pairs of words in a stress-free foreign language (Spanish). Consistent with the stress deafness phenomenon, French speakers performed worse than German speakers in discriminating Spanish words based on cues of stress but not of vowel. Whole-brain analyses revealed widespread bilateral networks (cerebral regions including frontal, temporal and parietal areas as well as insular, subcortical and cerebellar structures), overlapping with the ones previously associated with stress processing within native languages. Moreover, our results provide evidence that the structures pertaining to a right-lateralized attention system (i.e., middle frontal gyrus, anterior insula) and the Default Mode Network modulate stress processing as a function of the proficiency level. In comparison to the German speakers, the French speakers activated the attention system and deactivated the Default Mode Network to a stronger degree, reflecting attentive engagement, likely a compensatory mechanism underlying the \"stress-deaf\" brain. The mechanism modulating stress processing argues for a rightward lateralization, indeed overlapping with the location covered by the dorsal stream but remaining unspecific to speech.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein with low mutation rate is the only structural protein not only functioning to package viral genomic RNA, but also manipulating the host-cell machineries, thus representing a key target for drug development. Recent discovery of its liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) not only sheds light on previously-unknown mechanisms underlying the host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction and viral life cycle, but most importantly opens up a new direction for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies/drugs. However, so far the high-resolution mechanism of LLPS of N protein still remains unknown because it is not amenable for high-resolution biophysical investigations. Here we systematically dissected N protein into differential combinations of domains followed by DIC and NMR characterization. We successfully identified N (1-249), which not only gives high-quality NMR spectra, but phase separates as the full-length N protein. The results together decode for the first time: 1) nucleic acid modulates LLPS by dynamic but specific interactions multivalently over both folded NTD/CTD and Arg/Lys residues within IDRs. 2) ATP, mysteriously with concentrations >mM in all living cells but absent in viruses, not only specifically binds NTD/CTD, but also Arg residues within IDRs with Kd of 2.8 mM. 3) ATP dissolves LLPS by competitively displacing nucleic acid from binding the protein. Therefore, ATP and nucleic acid interplay in modulating LLPS by specific competitions for binding over the highly overlapped binding sites. Our study deciphers the mechanism of LLPS of N protein, which is targetable by small molecules. ATP is not only emerging as a cellular factor controlling the host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction, but also provides a lead for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs efficient for different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Fundamentally, our results imply that the mechanisms of LLPS of IDR-containing proteins mediated by ATP and nucleic acids appear to be highly conserved from human to virus.",

    "abstract": "Since its emergence, the Covid19 pandemic has been sustained by a series of transmission waves initiated by new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some of these arise with higher transmissivity and/or increased disease severity. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to examine the modulation of the fundamental interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein and the host cell receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: hACE2) arising from Omicron variant mutations (BA.1 and BA.2) relative to the original wild type strain. We find significant structural differences in the complexes which overall bring the spike protein and its receptor into closer proximity. These are consistent with and attributed to the higher positive charge on the RBD conferred by BA.1 and BA.2 mutations relative to the wild type. However, further differences between sub-variants BA.1 and BA.2 (which have equivalent RBD charges) are also evident: Mutations affect interdomain interactions between the up-chain and its clockwise neighbor chain, resulting in enhanced flexibility for BA.2. Consequently, additional close contacts arise in BA.2 which include binding to hACE2 by a second spike protein monomer, in addition to the up-chain - a motif not found in BA.1. Finally, the mechanism by which the glycans stabilize the up state of the Spike protein differs for the wild type and the Omicrons. We also found the glycan on N90 of hACE2 turns from inhibiting, to facilitating the binding to Omicron spike protein. These structural and electrostatic differences offer further insight into the mechanisms by which viral mutations modulate host cell binding and provide a biophysical basis for evolutionary driving forces.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we and others have shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibodies play a major role in disease severity in COVID-19 by triggering macrophage hyperactivation, disrupting endothelial barrier integrity, and inducing thrombus formation. This hyper-inflammation is dependent on high levels of anti-spike IgG with aberrant Fc tail glycosylation, leading to Fc{gamma} receptor hyper-activation. For development of immune-regulatory therapeutics, drug specificity is crucial to counteract excessive inflammation while simultaneously minimizing inhibition of antiviral immunity. We here developed an in vitro activation assay to screen for small molecule drugs that specifically counteract antibody-induced pathology. We identified that anti-spike induced inflammation is specifically blocked by small molecule inhibitors against SYK and PI3K. We identified SYK inhibitor entospletinib as the most promising candidate drug, which also counteracted anti-spike-induced endothelial dysfunction and thrombus formation. Moreover, entospletinib blocked inflammation by different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Combined, these data identify entospletinib as a promising treatment for severe COVID-19.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521247v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@edb3d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b99dd8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@129ec7corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@165000f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a eukaryotic cell pathway that triggers translational arrest and the formation of stress granules (SGs) in response to various stress signals, including those caused by viral infections. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein has been shown to disrupt SGs, but SARS-CoV-2 interactions with other components of the pathway remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the ISR through activation of the eIF2-kinase PKR while inhibiting a variety of downstream effects. In line with previous studies, SG formation was efficiently inhibited and the induced eIF2 phosphorylation only minimally contributed to the translational arrest observed in infected cells. Despite ISR activation and translational arrest, expression of the stress-responsive transcripts ATF4 and CHOP was not induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Finally, we found variant-specific differences in the activation of the ISR between ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants in that Delta infection induced weaker PKR activation while Omicron infection induced higher levels of p-eIF2 and greatly increased SG formation compared to the other variants. Our results suggest that different SARS-CoV-2 variants can affect normal cell functions differently, which can have an impact on pathogenesis and treatment strategies.",

We demonstrate that prediction error coding through the integration of currently present and expected reinforcement in dopaminergic neurons can serve as a driving force in learning that can, combined with a synaptic homeostasis mechanism, account for experimentally observed features of acquisition and loss of associations in the larva that depend on the intensity of odor and reinforcement and temporal features of their pairing.

    "abstract": "Neural function relies on cellular energy supplies meeting the episodic demands of synaptic activity, but little is known about the extent to which power demands (energy demands per unit time) fluctuate, or the mechanisms that match supply with demand. Here, in individually-identified glutamatergic motor neuron terminals of Drosophila larvae, we leveraged prior macroscopic estimates of energy demand to generate profiles of power demand from one action potential to the next. These profiles show that signaling demands can exceed non-signaling demands 10-fold within milliseconds, and terminals with the greatest fluctuation (volatility) in power demand have the greatest mitochondrial volume and packing density. We elaborated on this quantitative approach to simulate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during activity and drove ATP production as a function of the reciprocal of the energy state, but this canonical feedback mechanism appeared to be unable to prevent ATP depletion during locomotion. Muscle cells possess a phosphagen system to buffer ATP levels but phosphagen systems have not been described for motor nerve terminals. We examined these terminals for evidence of a phosphagen system and found the mitochondria to be heavily decorated with an arginine kinase, the key element of invertebrate phosphagen systems. Similarly, an examination of mouse cholinergic motor nerve terminals found mitochondrial creatine kinases, the vertebrate analogues of arginine kinases. Knock down of arginine kinase in Drosophila resulted in rapid depletion of presynaptic ATP during activity, indicating that, in motor nerve terminals, as in muscle, phosphagen systems play a critical role in matching power supply with demand.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEFailure of metabolic processes to supply neurons with energy at an adequate rate can lead to synaptic dysfunction and cell death under pathological conditions. Using a quantitative approach at fruit fly motor nerve terminals we generated the first temporal profiles of presynaptic power demand during locomotor activity. This approach revealed challenges for the known mechanisms that match cellular power supply to demand. However, we discovered that motor nerve terminals in fruit flies and mice alike are supported by phosphagen systems, more commonly seen in muscles where they store energy and buffer mismatch between power supply and demand. This study highlights an understudied aspect of neuronal bioenergetics which may represent a bulwark against the progression of some neuropathologies.",

The publics knowledge and attitude toward the monkeypox virus (MPXV) influence their adherence to preventive strategies. Therefore, we aimed to assess the general publics knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) of MPXV in Pakistan.\n\nMethodsWe collected data for this cross-sectional study from 1040 participants via an online self-reported questionnaire from 5th July 2022 to 1stAugust 2022. The questionnaire consisted of a total of 29 items in four sections, assessing socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding MPXV. The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS V.25, and factors associated with MPXV knowledge, attitude, and practices were identified by using logistic regression analyses\n\nResultsA total of1040participants were included. 61.4% were male and 57.2% had graduation level education. Only 34.4% had good knowledge about MPXV and 30% were aware of effectiveness of smallpox vaccine against MPXV. 41.7% had positive attitude with 48.6% agreed that it is a fatal disease and 44.6% were in favor of banning travelling from endemic to non-endemic regions.57.7% had good practices and 69.9% would use protective measures if MPXV become an epidemic. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that gender and education significantly impacted knowledge (p<0.05). While monthly income status had a significant impact on attitudes (p<0.05). The practices were correlated positively with gender and education (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionThe majority of study participants had inadequate levels of knowledge, and attitudes regarding MPXV. To prevent the emergence and spread of MPXV in Pakistan, a comprehensive strategic framework for public health education must be established and implemented.",

    "abstract": "In motor control, the brain not only sends motor commands to the periphery, but it also generates concurrent internal signals known as corollary discharge that influence the processing of sensory information around the time of movement. Corollary discharge signals are important for the brain to identify sensory input arising from self-motion and to compensate for it, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings from single neurons in the optic tectum of zebrafish, we discovered an inhibitory synaptic signal which was temporally locked to spontaneous and visually driven swim patterns. This motor-related synaptic signal transiently suppressed tectal output and was appropriately timed to counteract visually driven excitatory input arising from the fishs own motion. High-resolution calcium imaging revealed brief, highly localized post-swim signals in the tectal neuropil, suggesting that corollary discharge enters the tectum in its most superficial layer. Our results demonstrate how spurious visual input is suppressed during self-motion by motor-related phasic inhibition in the tectum. This may help explain perceptual saccadic suppression observed in many species.",

    "abstract": "Sex is one of the most rewarding and motivating behaviours for humans. Endogenous mu-opioid receptor system (MORs) plays a key role in the mammalian reward circuit. Both human and animal experiments suggest the involvements of MORs in human sexual pleasure, yet this hypothesis currently lacks in vivo support. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand [11C]carfentanil, which has high affinity for MORs to quantify endogenous opioid release following orgasm in man. Subjects were scanned twice: Once immediately after reaching an orgasm and once in a baseline state. Haemodynamic activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during penile stimulation from partner. The PET data revealed significant opioid release in hippocampus. Haemodynamic activity in somatosensory and motor cortices as well as hippocampus and thalamus increased during penile stimulation, and thalamic activation was linearly dependent on self-reported sexual arousal. Altogether these data show that endogenous opioidergic activation in the medial temporal lobe is centrally involved in sexual arousal.",

From MRI, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the SN, and tracts between the SN and caudate nucleus, putamen, and DLPFC. Phosphorylated-Ser129--synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry was included to quantify nigral Lewy pathology and dopaminergic degeneration, respectively.\n\nResultsCompared to controls, PD and PDD/DLB showed increased MD of the SN and SN-DLPFC tract, as well as increased FA of the SN-caudate nucleus tract. Both PD and PDD/DLB showed nigral Lewy pathology and dopaminergic loss compared to controls. Increased FA of the SN and SN-caudate nucleus tract was associated with SN dopaminergic loss, while increased MD of the SN-DLPFC tract was associated with increased SN Lewy neurite load.\n\nConclusionsIn PD and PDD/DLB, diffusion MRI captures microstructural alterations of the SN and tracts to the dorsal striatum and DLPFC, which differentially associates with SN dopaminergic degeneration and Lewy neurite pathology.",

    "abstract": "Although in many cases salient stimuli capture attention involuntarily, it has been proposed recently that under certain conditions the bottom-up signal generated by such stimuli can be proactively suppressed. In support of this signal suppression hypothesis, ERP studies have demonstrated that salient stimuli that do not capture attention elicit a distractor positivity (PD), a putative neural index of suppression. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that regularities across preceding search episodes have a large influence on attentional selection. Yet to date, studies in support of the signal suppression hypothesis have largely ignored the role of selection history on the processing of distractors. The current study addressed this issue by examining how electrophysiological markers of attentional selection (N2pc) and suppression (PD) elicited by targets and distractors respectively were modulated when the search target randomly varied instead of being fixed across trials. Results showed that while target selection was unaffected by this manipulation, both in terms of manual response times, as well as in terms of the N2pc component, the PD component was reliably attenuated when the target features varied randomly across trials. This result demonstrates that the distractor PD, which is typically considered the marker of selective distractor processing cannot unequivocally be attributed to suppression only, as it also, at least in part, reflects the upweighting of target features.",

    "abstract": "Evoked neural responses to sensory stimuli have been extensively investigated in humans and animal models both to enhance our understanding of brain function and to aid in clinical diagnosis of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Recording and imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and calcium imaging provide complementary information about different aspects of brain activity at different spatial and temporal scales. Modeling and simulations provide a way to integrate these different types of information to clarify underlying neural mechanisms.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to shed light on the neural dynamics underlying auditory evoked responses by fitting a rate-based model to LFPs recorded via multi-contact electrodes which simultaneously sampled neural activity across cortical laminae. Recordings included neural population responses to best-frequency (BF) and non-BF tones at four representative sites in primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake monkeys. The model considered major neural populations of excitatory, parvalbumin-expressing (PV), and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons across layers 2/3, 4, and 5/6. Unknown parameters, including the connection strength between the populations, were fitted to the data. Our results revealed similar population dynamics, fitted model parameters, predicted equivalent current dipoles (ECD), tuning curves, and lateral inhibition profiles across recording sites and animals, in spite of quite different extracellular current distributions. We found that PV firing rates were higher in BF than in non-BF responses, mainly due to different strengths of tonotopic thalamic input, whereas SOM firing rates were higher in non-BF than in BF responses due to lateral inhibition.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility of the model-fitting approach in identifying the contributions of cell-type specific population activity to stimulus-evoked LFPs across cortical laminae, providing a foundation for further investigations into the dynamics of neural circuits underlying cortical sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Innate defensive responses, while primarily instinctive, must also be flexible and highly adaptive to changes in risk assessment. As such, efficient innate escape behavior requires intricate processing to minimize reaction time while maximizing the success and adaptivity of the action. The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical sensorimotor integration center linking sensory threat information and escape. Adaptive changes in innate escape after learning could take a maladaptive turn after severe stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with long-term maladaptive changes after exposure to traumatic events, related to enhanced threat detection and reaction. Such long-term modifications are thought to involve the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is implicated in integrating learned emotional values into decisions that drive actions and behaviors. Here, in a series of experiments, we establish the crucial physiological role of specific mPFC neurons, exerting influence on the SC both directly and indirectly through the basal ganglia, in threat detection and reaction after adversity.",

    "abstract": "Non-human primates are a critical species for the identification of key biological mechanisms in normal and pathological aging. One of these primates, the mouse lemur, has been widely studied as a model of cerebral aging or Alzheimers disease. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) can be measured with functional MRI. Within specific frequency bands (e.g. the 0.01-0.1 Hz), these amplitudes were proposed to indirectly reflect neuronal activity as well as glucose metabolism. Here, we first created whole brain maps of the mean amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (mALFF) in middle-aged mouse lemurs. Then, we extracted mALFF in old lemurs to identify age-related changes. A high level of mALFF was detected in the temporal cortex (Brodmann area 20), somatosensory areas (Brodmann area 5), insula (Brodmann area 13-6) and the parietal cortex (Brodmann area 7) of healthy middle-aged mouse lemurs. Aging was associated with alteration of mALFF in somatosensory areas (area 5) and the parietal cortex (area 7).\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=159 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521367v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (59K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c9556org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1505c78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e6f3fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c6053_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIWe characterized mean amplitude of fluctuation at low frequencies (mALFF) in mouse lemurs.\nC_LIO_LImALFF was the highest in regions involved in visuo-somatosensory-motor function (Brodmann areas 5, 7, 20) and in more integrative functions (area 13-16).\nC_LIO_LImALFF was affected by aging in regions involved in visuo-somatosensory-motor function (parietal areas 5 and 7).\nC_LIO_LImALFF is a useful marker to investigate age-related cerebral dysfunction in animals.\nC_LI\n\nSignificance StatementO_LIThe amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is expected to reflect neuronal activity.

    "abstract": "Frequency tagging has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for identifying representational-specific neuronal activity in the auditory and visual domains. However, the slow flicker (<30Hz) applied in conventional frequency tagging studies is highly visible and might entrain endogenous neuronal oscillations. Hence, stimulation at faster frequencies that is much less visible and does not interfere with endogenous brain oscillatory activity is a promising new tool. In this study, we set out to examine the optimal stimulation parameters of rapid invisible frequency tagging (RFT/RIFT) with magnetoencephalography (MEG) by quantifying the effects of stimulation frequency, size and position of the flickering patch. Rapid frequency tagging (RFT) using flickers above 50 Hz results in almost invisible stimulation which does not interfere with slower endogenous oscillations; however, the signal is weaker as compared to tagging at slower frequencies so the optimal parameters of stimulation delivery are crucial. The here presented results examining the frequency range between 60Hz and 96Hz suggest that RFT induces brain responses with decreasing strength up to about 84Hz. In addition, even at the smallest flicker patch (2{degrees}) focally presented RFT induces a significant oscillatory brain signal at the stimulation frequency (66Hz); however, the elicited response increases with patch size. While focal RFT presentation elicits the strongest response, off-centre presentations do generally mainly elicit a measureable response if presented below the horizontal midline. The results also revealed considerable individual differences in the neuronal responses of to RFT stimulation. Finally, we discuss the comparison of oscillatory measures (coherence and power) and sensor types (planar gradiometers and magnetometers) in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Based on our extensive findings we set forward concrete recommendations for using rapid frequency tagging in human cognitive neuroscience investigations.",

    "abstract": "Some bacterial resistance mechanisms degrade antibiotics, potentially protecting neighbouring susceptible cells from antibiotic exposure. We do not yet understand how such effects influence bacterial communities of more than two species, which are typical in nature. Here, we used experimental multispecies communities to test the effects of clinically important pOXA-48-plasmid-encoded resistance on community-level responses to antibiotics. We found resistance in one community member reduced antibiotic inhibition of other species, but some benefitted more than others. Further experiments with supernatants and pure-culture growth assays showed the susceptible species profiting most from detoxification were those that grew best at degraded antibiotic concentrations (greater than zero, but lower than the starting concentration). This pattern was also observed on agar surfaces. By contrast, we found no evidence of a role for higher-order interactions or horizontal plasmid transfer in community-level responses to detoxification in our experimental communities. Our findings suggest carriage of an antibiotic-degrading resistance mechanism by one species can drastically alter community-level responses to antibiotics, and the identities of the species that profit most from antibiotic detoxification are predicted by their intrinsic ability to grow at degraded antibiotic concentrations.",

However, the responsible microorganisms and their contributions to methane budget are not clear in deep sea cold seep sediments. Here, we combined geochemistry, muti-omics and numerical modeling to study metal-dependent AOM in methanic cold seep sediments in the northern continental slope of the South China Sea. Geochemical data based on methane concentrations, carbon stable isotope, solid-phase sediment analysis and pore water measurements indicate the occurrence of anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to metal oxides reduction in the methanic zone. The 16S rRNA gene amplicons and transcripts, along with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data suggest that diverse ANME groups actively mediated methane oxidation in the methanic zone either independently or in syntrophy with e.g. ETH-SRB1 as potential metal reducers. Modeling results suggest that the estimated rates of methane consumption via Fe-AOM and Mn-AOM were both 0.3 mol cm-2 yr-1, which account for [~]3% of total CH4 removal in sediments.

    "abstract": "The pacific beetle cockroach, Diploptera punctata, is a viviparous cockroach that produces a milk-like substance to support the growing embryo with a brood sac. The structure of the in vivo grown crystals present in the gut of the embryo showed that the milk-derived crystals are heterogenous and are made of three proteins (called Lili-Mips). Multiple fatty acids could be modeled into the active site, and we hypothesized that each of the three isoforms of the protein bound to a different fatty acid. We previously reported that the recombinantly expressed Lili-Mip2 has a structure similar to the structure of the protein determined from in vivo crystals, and this single isoform also binds to several fatty acids. In this study, we aimed to probe the specificity and affinity of fatty acid binding and test the stability of different isoforms. We show that all the isoforms can bind to different fatty acids with very similar affinities, and the local abundance of a fatty acid determined bound fatty acid ratios. Lili-Mips thermostability is pH dependent, where stability is highest at acidic pH and declines as the pH increases to physiological levels near 7.0. The measurement of the pH in the gut lumen and the gut cells suggests that the pH in the gut is acidic and the pH inside the gut cells is closer to neutral pH. We propose that the protein has evolved to be highly stable in the acidic gut lumen and, when absorbed inside the gut cells, becomes less stable to enable the breakdown of the glycosylated lipo-protein complex to provide essential metabolites for survival and development of the embryo. The different orientations of Phe-98 and Phe-100 control the binding pocket volume and allow the binding of different chain-length fatty acids to bind with similar affinities.",

These proteins must be co-translationally inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane and are synthesized by the highly divergent trypanosomal mitoribosomes, which have a much higher protein to RNA ratio than any other ribosome. Here, we show that the trypanosomal ortholog of the mitoribosome receptor Mba1 (TbMba1) is essential for normal growth of procyclic trypanosomes but redundant in the bloodstream form, which lacks an oxidative phosphorylation system. Proteomic analyses of TbMba1-depleted mitochondria from procyclic cells revealed reduced levels of many components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, most of which belong to the cytochrome c oxidase (Cox) complex, three subunits of which are mitochondrially encoded. However, the integrity of the mitoribosome and its interaction with the inner membrane were not affected. Pulldown experiments showed that TbMba1 forms a dynamic interaction network that includes the trypanosomal Mdm38/Letm1 ortholog and a trypanosome-specific factor that stabilizes the CoxI and CoxII mRNAs. In summary, our study suggests that the function of Mba1 in the biogenesis of membrane subunits of OXPHOS complexes is conserved among yeast, mammalian, and trypanosomes, which belong to two eukaryotic supergroups.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, STING agonists have shown promising results in enhancing tumor immunotherapies. Nanoparticle-based tumor targeting delivery of STING agonists is considered as an important way to improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the side effects of STING agonists. However, how to escape the clearance to nanoparticles by phagocytes in the blood while maintaining the tumor targeting efficiency of nanoparticles is still a big challenge. Herein, cholesterol-deficient membrane from bioengineered T cells overexpressing PD-1 encapsulated STING agonist SR-717 (a.k.a. COMs) was used to treat melanoma. Nanoparticles coated by these membranes displayed remarkably dropped clearance by monocytes in the blood in both animal and human blood comparing with nanoparticles coated by non-modified T cell membrane, while maintaining the high tumor cell targeting efficiency of COMs. In mice melanoma model, intravenous injected COMs successfully delivered SR-717 to tumor and activated STING pathways and the PD-1 on COMs blocked the up-regulated PD-L1 in tumor cells induced by SR-717. As a result, COMs stimulated strong tumor immune responses to inhibit melanoma recurrence when it combined with photothermal therapy (PTT). In summary, this study developed a highly effective bionic system that integrated STING activation and immunotherapy, and provided a simple and effective strategy to enhance performance of cell membrane-coated delivery systems in vivo.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, interactions between the bone marrow (BM) stroma and hematopoietic progenitors contribute to bone-BM homeostasis. Perinatal bone growth and ossification provide a microenvironment for the transition to definitive hematopoiesis; however, mechanisms and interactions orchestrating the development of skeletal and hematopoietic systems remain largely unknown. Here, we establish intracellular O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification as a posttranslational switch that dictates the differentiation fate and niche function of early BM stromal cells (BMSCs). By modifying and activating RUNX2, O-GlcNAcylation promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and stromal IL-7 expression to support lymphopoiesis. In contrast, C/EBP{beta}-dependent marrow adipogenesis and expression of myelopoietic stem cell factor (SCF) is inhibited by O-GlcNAcylation. Ablating O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in BMSCs leads to impaired bone formation, increased marrow adiposity, as well as defective B-cell lymphopoiesis and myeloid overproduction in mice. Thus, the balance of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs is determined by reciprocal O-GlcNAc regulation of transcription factors, which simultaneously shapes the hematopoietic niche.",

    "abstract": "Using 13C6 glucose labeling coupled to GC-MS and 2D 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy, we have obtained a comparative high-resolution map of glucose fate underpinning steady state insulin release and {beta} cell function. In both mouse and human islets, the contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle is similar. Pyruvate-fueling of the TCA cycle is found to be mediated primarily by the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), with only a limited contribution from pyruvate carboxylase (PC). While conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be detected in both species, lactate accumulation via this route is six-fold higher in human islets. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that human {beta} cells specifically express lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) at high levels, in keeping with the phenotype of patients harboring gain-of-function mutations in MCT1/ SLC16A1 (HHF7). Thus, glycolytically-derived acetyl CoA preferentially feeds the TCA cycle in both mouse and human {beta} cells. However, human {beta} cells possess the machinery needed to generate extra-mitochondrial lactate, which might reflect a key mechanism to balance the reducing activity of NADH-producing pathways.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is rapidly increasing within the global population and is one of the leading causes of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for treating T2D and obesity. However, the route of administration of the GLP-1R agonists is currently by injection or high oral dosages of the therapeutic combined with absorption enhancers. Oral delivery of GLP-1R agonists remains the preferred administration route due to convenience and high patient compliance. Thus, strategies to improve the oral delivery of this therapeutic are needed. In this study, we engineered the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii strain to produce Exendin-4, a GLP-1R agonist, in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce the adverse effects of diet-induced obesity in male C57BL/6 mice. The biological efficiency of the secreted Exendin-4 from S. boulardii was characterised ex vivo on isolated pancreatic islets, demonstrating induced insulin secretion. Furthermore, in vivo characterisation of the engineered strain identified a synergistic effect of cold exposure and Sb-Exe4 by successfully inhibiting appetite and promoting body weight loss under cold exposure (8{degrees}C). In addition, the combination of cold and Sb-Exe4 improved the glucose and lipid homeostasis in the mice by increasing the circulating glucagon level and reducing the inflammatory marker TNF-. Our results demonstrate that S. boulardii can be genetically modified to secrete and deliver active therapeutic GLP-1R agonists in the gastrointestinal tract improving the metabolism of the host.",

    "abstract": "Polyphosphates are highly conserved, linear polymers of monophosphates that reside in all living cells. Bacteria produce long chains containing hundreds to thousands of phosphate units, which can interfere with host defense to infection.\n\nHere, we report that intratracheal long-chain polyphosphate administration to C57BL/6J mice resulted in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and influx of Ly6G+ polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid causing a disruption of the physiologic endothelial-epithelial small airway barrier and histologic signs of lung injury. Polyphosphate-induced effects were attenuated after neutrophil depletion in mice. In isolated murine neutrophils, long-chain polyphosphates modulated cytokine release induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria or lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive bacteria. In addition, long-chain polyphosphates induced immune evasive effects in human neutrophils. In detail, long-chain polyphosphates down-regulated CD11b and curtailed the phagocytosis of E. coli particles by neutrophils. Polyphosphates modulated the migration capacity by inducing CD62L shedding resulting in CD62Llow and CD11blow neutrophils. The release of IL-8 induced by LPS was also significantly reduced. Pharmacologic blockade of PI3K with wortmannin antagonized long-chain polyphosphate-induced effects on LPS-induced IL-8 release.\n\nIn conclusion, polyphosphates govern immunomodulation in murine and human neutrophils suggesting polyphosphates as a therapeutic target for bacterial infections to restore innate immune defense.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco smoking doubles the risk of active tuberculosis (TB) and accounts for up to 20% of all active TB cases globally. How smoking promotes lung microenvironments permissive to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth remains incompletely understood. We investigated primary bronchoalveolar lavage cells from current- and never-smokers by performing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry, and functional assays. We observed enrichment of immature inflammatory monocytes in the lungs of smokers compared to non-smokers. These monocytes exhibited phenotypes consistent with recent recruitment from blood, ongoing differentiation, increased activation, and states similar to those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using integrative scRNA-seq and flow cytometry, we identify CD93 as a marker for a subset of these newly recruited smoking-associated lung monocytes and further provide evidence that recruitment of monocytes into the lung is mediated by CCL11 binding to CCR2. We also show that these cells exhibit elevated inflammatory responses upon exposure to Mtb and accelerated intracellular growth of Mtb compared to mature macrophages. This elevated Mtb growth could be inhibited with an anti-inflammatory small molecule, providing a direct connection between smoking-induced pro-inflammatory states and permissiveness to Mtb growth. Our findings suggest a model in which smoking leads to recruitment of immature inflammatory monocytes from the periphery to the lung via CCL11-CCR2 interactions, which results in the accumulation of these Mtb permissive cells in the airway. This work defines how smoking may lead to increased susceptibility to Mtb and identifies novel host-directed therapies to reduce the burden of TB among those who smoke.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInflammatory monocytes are recruited to the airways of smokers where they may contribute to more rapid growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the lungs.",

    "abstract": "Succinate is a potent immune signalling molecule that is present in the mammalian gut and within macrophages. Both of these niches are colonised by the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium during infection. Succinate is a C4-dicarboyxlate that can serve as a source of carbon for bacteria. When succinate is provided as the sole carbon source for in vitro cultivation, Salmonella and other enteric bacteria exhibit a slow growth rate and a long lag phase. This growth inhibition phenomenon was known to involve the sigma factor RpoS, but the genetic basis of the repression of bacterial succinate utilisation was poorly understood. Here, we used an experimental evolution approach to isolate fast-growing mutants during growth of S. Typhimurium on succinate containing minimal medium.\n\nOur approach reveals novel RpoS-independent systems that inhibit succinate utilisation. The CspC RNA binding protein restricts succinate utilisation, an inhibition that is antagonised by high levels of the small regulatory RNA (sRNA) OxyS. We discovered that the Fe-S cluster regulatory protein IscR inhibits succinate utilisation by repressing the C4-dicarboyxlate transporter DctA.\n\nThe RNA chaperone Hfq, the exoribonuclease PNPase and their cognate sRNAs function together to repress succinate utilisation via RpoS induction. Furthermore, the ribose operon repressor RbsR is required for the complete RpoS-driven repression of succinate utilisation, suggesting a novel mechanism of RpoS regulation.\n\nOur discoveries shed light on redundant regulatory systems that tightly regulate the utilisation of succinate. We propose that the control of central carbon metabolism by multiple regulatory systems in Salmonella governs the infection niche-specific utilisation of succinate.",

We further use these comprehensive antigenic profiles to define key structural and evolutionary parameters that are predictive of escape, assess epitope dominance at the population level, and reveal a need for at least two mutations to achieve significant escape from multiple sera. Overall, our data provide the first comprehensive analysis of how polyclonal sera target a non-enveloped viral capsid and help define both immune dominance and escape at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes of high ecological and biotechnological relevance that have been cultivated in laboratories around the world for more than 70 years. Prolonged laboratory culturing has led to multiple microevolutionary events and the appearance of a large number of \"domesticated\" substrains among model cyanobacteria. Despite its widespread occurrence, strain domestication is still largely ignored. In this work we describe Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942-KU, a novel domesticated substrain of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which presents a fast-sedimenting phenotype. Under higher ionic strengths the sedimentation rate increases leading to complete sedimentation in just 12 h. Through whole genome sequencing and gene deletion, we demonstrate that the Group 3 alternative sigma factor F (SigF) plays a key role in cell sedimentation. In addition, sedimentation analysis of an unpiliated mutant and differences in surface hydrophobicity suggest that mutations in SigF lead to significant changes of cell surface structures and, consequentially, to the appearance of a fast-sedimenting phenotype. This work sheds light on the determinants of the planktonic to benthic transitions and provides genetic targets to generate fast-sedimenting strains that could unlock cost-effective cyanobacterial harvesting at scale.",

    "abstract": "Amatoxins are strong inhibitors of RNA polymerase II, and cause cell death. Because of their cytotoxicity they are candidates for anti-cancer drugs, and understanding their structure-activity relationship is crucial. Amatoxins have a rigid bicyclic scaffold which consists of a cyclic octapeptide bridged by cysteine and tryptophan side chain forming a tryptathionine bridge. Here we show the influence of the N-methylation on the amatoxin scaffold by studying Gly5Sar-amanullin with MD simulations and NMR experiments. Since we have shown recently that the amatoxin scaffold allows for two isomeric forms (ansamers), we studied both isomers of Gly5Sar-amanullin. We found that both isomers of Gly5Sar-amanullin form two long-living conformations which is unusual for amatoxins, and that they are differently affected by the N-methylation. The natural Gly5Sar-amanullin forfeits the hydrogen bonds to Gly5 due to the N-methylation, which is expected from existing crystal structures for alpha-amanitin. Our results however indicate that this does not cause more flexibility due to a shift in the hydrogen bond pattern. In the unnatural isomer, we observe an interesting cis-trans-isomerisation of the backbone angles in Trp4 and Gly7, which is enabled by the N-methylation. We expect that our perspective on the effect of N-methylation in amatoxins could be a starting point for further SAR-studies which are urgently needed for the design of better anti-cancer agents.",

We correlated microscopic features of purified human blood eosinophils stimulated for 10 min with IL5 or IL33 with phosphoproteomic changes determined by multiplexed isobaric labeling. IL5 caused phosphorylation of sites implicated in JAK/STAT signaling and localization of pYSTAT3 to nuclear speckles whereas IL33 caused phosphorylation of sites implicated in NF{kappa}B signaling and localization of RELA to nuclear speckles. Phosphosites commonly impacted by IL5 and IL33 were involved in networks associated with cytoskeletal organization and eosinophil adhesion and migration. Many differentially regulated phosphosites were in a diverse set of large proteins--RAB44, a \"large RAB\" associated with crystalloid granules; NHSL2 and VIM that change localization along with the nucleus during polarization; TNFAIP3 vital for control of NF{kappa}B signaling, and SRRM2 and PML that localize, respectively, to nuclear speckles and PML bodies.

    "abstract": "The two clathrin isoforms, CHC17 and CHC22, generate separate vesicles for intracellular transport. CHC17 mediates endocytosis and housekeeping membrane traffic in all cells. CHC22, expressed most highly in skeletal muscle, transports the glucose transporter GLUT4 from the endoplasmic-reticulum-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to an intracellular GLUT4 storage compartment (GSC) from where GLUT4 is mobilized by insulin. Molecular determinants distinguishing the trafficking of CHC22 clathrin from CHC17 within the GLUT4 pathway are defined in this study. The C-terminal trimerization domain of CHC22, but not CHC17, directly binds SNX5, which also binds the ERGIC tether p115. SNX5, and the functionally redundant SNX6, are required for CHC22 localization independently of their participation in the endosomal ESCPE-1 complex. Both the SNX5-BAR domain and an isoform-specific patch on the CHC22 N-terminal domain separately mediate binding to p115, and both interactions are required for CHC22 recruitment. These indirect and direct interactions at each CHC22 terminus are required for GLUT4 traffic to the GSC, defining a dual mechanism regulating the function of CHC22 in glucose metabolism.",

Specifically, the actomyosin remodeling protein, Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) regulates cell differentiation and gene expression in vertebrates biomineralizing cells, yet, little is known on ROCKs role in invertebrates biomineralization. Here we reveal that ROCK controls the formation, growth and morphology of the calcite spicules in the sea urchin larva. ROCK expression is elevated in the sea urchin skeletogenic cells downstream of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signling. ROCK inhibition impairs the organization of F-actin around the spicules, disrupts skeletogenic gene expression and leads to skeletal loss. ROCK inhibition after spicule formation reduces spicule elongation rate and induces ectopic spicule branching. Reduced skeletal growth and enhanced branching are also observed under direct perturbations of the actomyosin network. Similar skeletogenic phenotypes are observed when ROCK is inhibited in a skeletogenic cell culture, indicating that these phenotypes are due to ROCK activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells. We propose that the actomyosin network was employed independently, downstream of distinct GRNs, to regulate biomineral growth and morphology across Eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks in terrestrial animals are encoded by molecular feedback loops involving the negative regulators PERIOD, TIMELESS or CRYPTOCHROME2 and positive transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1/CYCLE. The molecular basis of circatidal ([~]12.4 hour) or other lunar-mediated cycles ([~]15 day, [~]29 day), widely expressed in coastal organisms, is unknown. Disrupting circadian clockworks does not appear to affect lunar-based rhythms suggesting a molecular independence of the two cycles. Nevertheless, pharmacological inhibition of casein kinase 1 (CK1) that targets PERIOD stability in mammals and flies, affects both circadian and circatidal phenotypes in Eurydice pulchra (Ep), the speckled sea-louse. Here we show that these drug inhibitors of CK1 also affect the phosphorylation of EpCLK and EpBMAL1 and disrupt EpCLK-BMAL1-mediated transcription in Drosophila S2 cells, revealing a potential link between the positive circadian regulators and circatidal behaviour. We therefore performed dsRNAi knockdown of Epbmal1 as well as the major negative regulator in Eurydice, Epcry2. Epcry2 and Epbmal1 knockdown disrupted Eurydices circadian phenotypes as expected but in addition, circatidal behaviour was also sensitive to Epbmal1 knockdown. Thus three Eurydice negative circadian regulators, EpCRY2, in addition to EpPER and EpTIM, do not appear to be required for the expression of circatidal behaviour, in contrast to the positive regulator EpBMAL1. We suggest a neurogenetic model whereby the positive circadian regulators BMAL1-CLK are shared between circadian and circatidal mechanisms in Eurydice but circatidal rhythms require a novel, as yet unknown negative regulator.",

    "abstract": "Age is a fundamental aspect of biology that underlies the efficacy of a broad range of functions. Identifying determinants for how quickly or slowly we age will contribute greatly to our understanding of age as a modifier of overall health, particularly to the advancement of therapeutic interventions designed to mitigate or delay age-associated disorders. While much work has been devoted to the study of genetic or pharmacological interventions that extend lifespan, this approach does not necessarily recapitulate the physiological profile of naturally long-lived individuals. Diapause and diapause-like states constitute natural, inducible and evolutionarily conserved examples of lifespan plasticity that are well-suited to serve as physiologically accurate models of longevity. Here, we leveraged a metabolically critical signaling organ in Drosophila, the fat body, to examine diapause-associated transcription in the context of chromatin accessibility and the regulation of lifespan. Through a combination of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, our observations suggest chromatin is globally reorganized in diapause and may assume a poised conformation to facilitate the rapid transcription of pro-development genes upon diapause termination. We found particular significance of GAF, NELF, and RNA polymerase III in this context. Congruently, transcription during diapause appears to favor many processes supporting the maintenance of cellular quiescence and the inhibition of differentiation. Our data are consistent with a model wherein diapause induces cellular quiescence in the fat body, as was additionally supported through fluorescent microscopy and comparison with public ChIP-seq data for developmentally juvenile files. This work opens the possibility that longevity in diapause may be partially determined through a lack of mitogenic signaling from the quiescent niche, concurrent with changes to the hormonal and immunological profiles that skew metabolism towards tissue maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Supporting cell proliferation through nucleotide biosynthesis is an essential requirement for cancer cells. Hence, inhibition of folate-mediated one carbon (1C) metabolism, which is required for nucleotide synthesis, has been successfully exploited in anti-cancer therapy. Here, we reveal that mitochondrial folate metabolism is upregulated in patient-derived leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). We demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial 1C metabolism through impairment of de novo purine synthesis has a cytostatic effect on chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells. Consequently, changes in purine nucleotide levels lead to activation of AMPK signalling and suppression of mTORC1 activity. Notably, suppression of mitochondrial 1C metabolism increases expression of erythroid differentiation markers. Moreover, we find that increased differentiation occurs independently of AMPK signalling and can be reversed through reconstitution of purine levels and reactivation of mTORC1. Of clinical relevance, we identify that combination of 1C metabolism inhibition with imatinib, a frontline treatment for CML patients, decreases the number of therapy-resistant CML LSCs in a patient-derived xenograft model. Our results highlight a novel role for folate metabolism and purine sensing in stem cell fate decisions and leukaemogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a protein kinase complex that plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Loss of adipose mTORC2 reduces lipogenic enzyme expression and de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue. Adipose-specific mTORC2 knockout mice also displays triglyceride accumulation in the liver. However, the mechanism and physiological role of hepatic triglyceride accumulation upon loss of adipose mTORC2 are unknown. Here, we show that loss of adipose mTORC2 increases expression of de novo lipogenic enzymes in the liver, thereby causing accumulation of hepatic triglyceride and hypertriglyceridemia. Simultaneous inhibition of lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue and liver by ablating mTORC2 in both tissues prevented accumulation of hepatic triglycerides and hypertriglyceridemia. However, loss of adipose and hepatic mTORC2 caused severe insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Thus, our findings suggest that increased hepatic lipogenesis is a compensatory mechanism to cope with loss of lipogenesis in adipose tissue, and further suggest that mTORC2 in adipose tissue and liver plays a crucial role in maintaining whole-body energy homeostasis.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521172v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@904812org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b9f43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a507b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19e08a7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Regulation of intracellular sugar homeostasis is maintained by regulation of activities of sugar import and export proteins residing at the tonoplast. We show here that the EARLY RESPONSE TO DEHYDRATION6-LIKE4 protein, being the closest homolog to the proton/glucose symporter ERDL6, resides in the vacuolar membrane. Gene expression and subcellular fractionation studies indicated that ERDL4 was involved in fructose allocation across the tonoplast. Overexpression of ERDL4 increased total sugar levels in leaves, due to a concomitantly induced stimulation of TST2 expression, coding for the major vacuolar sugar loader. This conclusion is supported by the finding that tst1-2 knockout lines overexpressing ERDL4 lack increased cellular sugar levels. ERDL4 activity contributing to the coordination of cellular sugar homeostasis is also indicated by two further observations. Firstly, ERDL4 and TST genes exhibit an opposite regulation during a diurnal rhythm, and secondly, the ERDL4 gene is markedly expressed during cold acclimation representing a situation in which TST activity needs to be upregulated. Moreover, ERDL4-overexpressing plants show larger size of rosettes and roots, a delayed flowering time and increased total seed yield. Consistently, erdl4 knock-out plants show impaired cold acclimation and freezing tolerance along with reduced plant biomass. In summary, we show that modification of cytosolic fructose levels influences plant organ development and stress tolerance.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe activity of the vacuolar sugar porter ERDL4 is important for balanced cytosolic monosaccharide homeostasis and influences plant growth and cold response in Arabidopsis\n\nThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors is: Benjamin Pommerrenig (pommerre@bio.uni-kl.de).",

    "abstract": "Flaviviruses like dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne viruses that cause febrile, hemorrhagic, and neurological diseases in humans, resulting in 400 million infections annually. Due to their co-circulation in many parts of the world, flaviviruses must replicate in the presence of pre-existing adaptive immune responses targeted at serologically closely related pathogens, which can provide protection or enhance disease. However, the impact of pre-existing cross-reactive immunity as a driver of flavivirus evolution, and subsequently the implications on the emergence of immune escape variants, is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated how replication in the presence of convalescent dengue serum drives ZIKV evolution. We used an in vitro directed evolution system, passaging ZIKV in the presence of serum from humans previously infected with DENV (anti-DENV) or serum from DENV-naive patients (control serum). Following five passages in the presence of serum, we performed next-generation sequencing to identify mutations that arose during passaging. We studied two non-synonymous mutations found in the anti-DENV passaged population (E-V355I and NS1-T139A) by generating individual ZIKV mutants and assessing fitness in mammalian cells and live mosquitoes, as well as their sensitivity to antibody neutralization. Both viruses had increased fitness in Vero cells with and without the addition of anti-DENV serum and in human lung epithelial and monocyte cells. In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes--using blood meals with and without anti-DENV serum--the mutant viruses had significantly reduced fitness compared to wild-type ZIKV. These results align with the trade-off hypothesis of constrained mosquito-borne virus evolution. Notably, only the NS1-T139A mutation escaped neutralization, while E-V335I demonstrated enhanced neutralization sensitivity to neutralization by anti-DENV serum, indicating that neutralization escape is not necessary for viruses passaged under cross-reactive immune pressures. Future studies are needed to assess cross-reactive immune selection in humans and relevant animal models or with different flaviviruses.",

Using a select-seq assay, we show that one form of a variational autoencoder (VAE) recapitulates the functional characteristics of natural SH3 domains and classifies fungal SH3 homologs hierarchically by function and phylogeny. Locality in the latent space of the model predicts and extends the function of natural orthologs and exposes amino acid constraints distributed near and far from the SH3 ligand-binding site. The ability of deep generative models to specify orthologous function in vivo opens new avenues for probing and engineering protein function in specific cellular environments.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is essential for responding to infections and subsequent tissue healing. However, chronic unresolved inflammation can become a serious health problem, as exemplified in the joints during Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Why does inflammation persist in RA? The answer could lie with synovial fibroblasts, non-haemopoietic cells that can adopt a pathogenic phenotype that fuels disease progression for years. Critically, targeting local fibroblasts could stop joint inflammation without suppressing systemic immunity. Nevertheless, basic research findings have not been translated to new drugs, perhaps because non-physiological data can be inadvertently generated in 2D cultures. Thus, developing better in vitro platforms is an urgent need in biomedical research. In this work, we sought to understand how distinct 3D environments affect fibroblast-mediated inflammation. Arthritic synovial fibroblasts were expanded and cultured in 2D, 3D rigid scaffolds and engineered hydrogels. The results reveal that SFs are plastic and adopt inflammatory or remission-like phenotypes in response to their surroundings. This work identifies new directions to develop better models for drug testing, and even signposts candidate mechanisms by which to rewire destructive SFs.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a process by which biomacromolecules, particularly proteins, condense into a dense phase that resembles liquid droplets. Dysregulation of LLPS is implicated in disease, yet the relationship between protein conformational changes and LLPS remain difficult to discern. This is due to the high flexibility and disordered nature of many proteins that phase separate under physiological conditions, and their tendency to oligomerise. Here we demonstrate that ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) overcomes these limitations. We used IM-MS to investigate the conformational states of full-length ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) protein, LLPS of which is driven by high salt concentration and reversed by noncovalent interactions with ubiquitin (Ub). IM-MS revealed that UBQLN2 exists as a mixture of monomers and dimers, and that increasing salt concentration causes the UBQLN2 dimers to undergo a subtle shift towards extended conformations. UBQLN2 binds to Ub in 2:1 and 2:2 UBQLN2:Ub complexes which have compact geometries compared to free UBQLN2 dimers. Together, these results suggest that extended conformations of UBQLN2 are correlated with UBQLN2s ability to phase separate. Overall, delineating protein conformations that are implicit in LLPS will greatly increase understanding of the phase separation process, both in normal cell physiology and disease states.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive immature T-cell cancer. Hotspot mutations in JAK-STAT pathway members IL7R, JAK1 and JAK3 were analyzed in depth. However, the role of STAT5A or STAT5B mutations promoting their hyperactivation is poorly understood in the context of T-cell cancer initiation and acute leukemia progression. Importantly, the driver mutation STAT5BN642H encodes the most frequent activating STAT5 variant in T-ALL associated with poor prognosis. Here, we show that hyperactive STAT5 promotes early T-cell progenitor (ETP)-ALL-like cancer in mice and upregulated genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling (TCR), even in absence of surface TCR promoting. Importantly, these genes were also overexpressed in human T-ALL and other STAT5-dependent T-cell cancers. Moreover, human T-ALL cells were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition by dual STAT3/5 degraders or ZAP70 tyrosine kinase blockers. Thus, we define STAT5 target genes in T-ALL that promote pre-TCR signaling mimicry.

We found that hyperactive STAT5 transcribes T-cell-specific kinases or pre-TCR signaling hubs to promote T-ALL. Biomolecular and next-generation-sequencing methods, transgenesis and pharmacologic interference revealed that hyperactive STAT5 is a key oncogenic driver that can be targeted in T-ALL using STAT3/5 or SYK family member tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\nConflict of interestThe authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers based on five-year survival rates. Genes contributing to chemoresistance represent novel therapeutic targets that can improve treatment response. Increased expression of ANGPTL4 in tumors correlates with poor outcomes in pancreatic cancer.\n\nMethodsWe used statistical analysis of publicly available gene expression data (TCGA-PAAD) to test whether expression of ANGPTL4 and its downstream targets, ITGB4 and APOL1, were correlated with patient survival. We measured the impact of ANGPTL4 overexpression in a common pancreatic cancer cell line, MIA PaCa-2 cells, using CRISPRa for overexpression and DsiRNA for knockdown. We characterized global gene expression changes associated with high levels of ANGPTL4 and response to gemcitabine treatment using RNA-sequencing. Gemcitabine dose response curves were calculated on modified cell lines by measuring cell viability with CellTiter-Glo (Promega). Impacts on cell migration were measured using a time course scratch assay.\n\nResultsWe show that ANGPTL4 overexpression leads to in vitro resistance to gemcitabine and reduced survival times in patients. Overexpression of ANGPTL4 induces transcriptional signatures of tumor invasion and metastasis, proliferation and differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis. Analyses revealed an overlapping signature of genes associated with both ANGPTL4 activation and gemcitabine response. Increased expression of the genes in this signature in patient PDAC tissues was significantly associated with shorter patient survival. We identified 42 genes that were both co-regulated with ANGPTL4 and were responsive to gemcitabine treatment. ITGB4 and APOL1 were among these genes. Knockdown of either of these genes in cell lines overexpressing ANGPTL4 reversed the observed gemcitabine resistance and inhibited cellular migration associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ANGPTL4 overexpression.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that ANGPTL4 promotes EMT and regulates the genes APOL1 and ITGB4. Importantly, we show that inhibition of both targets reverses chemoresistance and decreases migratory potential. Our findings have revealed a novel pathway regulating tumor response to treatment and suggest relevant therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "The enhanced cognitive abilities characterizing the human species result from specialized features of neurons and circuits, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we report that the hominid-specific gene LRRC37B encodes a novel receptor expressed in a subset of human cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs). LRRC37B protein localizes at the axon initial segment (AIS), the specialized domain triggering action potentials. LRRC37B ectopic expression in mouse CPNs in vivo leads to reduced intrinsic excitability, a distinctive feature of some classes of human CPNs. At the molecular level, LRRC37B acts as a receptor for the secreted ligand FGF13A and interacts with the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) beta subunit SCN1B, thereby inhibiting the channel function of VGSC, specifically at the AIS. Electrophysiological recordings in adult human cortical slices reveals that endogenous expression of LRRC37B in human CPNs reduces neuronal excitability. LRRC37B thus acts as a species-specific modifier of human cortical neuron function, with important implications for human brain evolution and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic information defines tissue identity and is largely inherited in development through DNA methylation. While studied mostly for mean differences, methylation also encodes stochastic change, defined as entropy in information theory. Analyzing allelespecific methylation in 48 human tissue sample datasets, we find that methylation entropy is associated with specific DNA binding motifs, regulatory DNA, and CpG density. Then applying information theory to 42 mouse embryo methylation datasets, we find that time- and tissue-specific patterns of development are more strongly correlated with methylation entropy than with mean, and methylation entropy is associated with sequence and chromatin features conserved with human. Moreover, methylation entropy is directly related to gene expression variability in development, suggesting a role for epigenetic entropy in developmental plasticity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSocial animals can use the choices made by other members of their groups as cues in decision making. Individuals must balance the private information they receive from their own sensory cues with the social information provided by observing what others have chosen. These two cues can be integrated using decision making rules, which specify the probability to select one or other options based on the quality and quantity of social and non-social information. Previous empirical work has investigated which decision making rules can replicate the observable features of collective decision making, while other theoretical research has derived forms for decision making rules based on normative assumptions about how rational agents should respond to the available information. Here we explore the performance of one commonly used decision making rule in terms of the expected decision accuracy of individuals employing it. We show that parameters of this model which have typically been treated as independent variables in empirical model-fitting studies obey necessary relationships under the assumption that animals are evolutionarily optimised to their environment. We further investigate whether this decision making model is appropriate to all animal groups by testing its evolutionary stability to invasion by alternative strategies that use social information differently, and show that the likely evolutionary equilibrium of these strategies depends sensitively on the precise nature of group identity among the wider population of animals it is embedded within.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge in the use of diffusion MRI to map connectomes in humans, paralleled by a similar increase in processing and analysis choices. Yet these different steps and their effects are rarely compared systematically. Here, in a healthy young adult population (n=294), we characterized the impact of a range of analysis pipelines on one widely studied property of the human connectome; its degree distribution. We evaluated the effects of 40 pipelines (comparing common choices of parcellation, streamline seeding, tractography algorithm, and streamline propagation constraint) and 44 group-representative connectome reconstruction schemes on highly connected hub regions. We found that hub location is highly variable between pipelines. The choice of parcellation has a major influence on hub architecture, and hub connectivity is highly correlated with regional surface area in most of the assessed pipelines ({rho}>0.70 in 69% of the pipelines), particularly when using weighted networks. Overall, our results demonstrate the need for prudent decision-making when processing diffusion MRI data, and for carefully considering how different processing choices can influence connectome organization.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe increasing use of diffusion MRI for mapping white matter connectivity has been matched by a similar increase in the number of ways to process the diffusion data. Here, we assess how diffusion processing affects hubs across 1760 pipeline variations. Many processing pipelines do not show a high concentration of connectivity within hubs. When present, hub location and distribution vary based on processing choices. The choice of probabilistic or deterministic tractography has a major impact on hub location and strength. Finally, node strength in weighted networks can correlate highly with node size. Overall, our results illustrate the need for prudent decision-making when processing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.\n\nCode and data availabilityAll the data used in this study is openly available on Figshare at https://doi.org/10.26180/c.6352886.v1.
