    "abstract": "Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used for measuring functional interactions between brain regions, significantly contributing to our understanding of large-scale brain networks and brain-behavior relationships. Furthermore, idiosyncratic patterns of resting-state connections can be leveraged to identify individuals and predict individual differences in clinical symptoms, cognitive abilities, and other individual factors. Idiosyncratic connectivity patters are thought to persist across task states, suggesting task-based fMRI can be similarly leveraged for individual differences analyses. Here, we tested the degree to which functional interactions occurring in the background of a task during slow event-related fMRI parallel or differ from those captured during resting-state fMRI. We compared two approaches for removing task- evoked activity from task-based fMRI: (1) applying a low-pass filter to remove task- related frequencies in the signal, or (2) extracting residuals from a general linear model (GLM) that accounts for task-evoked responses. We found that the organization of large-scale cortical networks and individuals idiosyncratic connectivity patterns are preserved during task-based fMRI. In contrast, individual differences in connection strength can vary more substantially between rest and task. Compared to low-pass filtering, background connectivity obtained from GLM residuals produced idiosyncratic connectivity patterns and individual differences in connection strength that more resembled rest. However, all background connectivity measures were highly similar when derived from the low-pass filtered signal or GLM residuals, indicating that both methods are suitable for measuring background connectivity. Together, our results highlight new avenues for the analysis of task-based fMRI datasets and the utility of each background connectivity method.",

    "abstract": "FMRI has become a key tool for human neuroscience. At ultra-high field (=> 7 Tesla) it is possible to acquire images with submillimeter spatial precision, which allows examinations of mesoscale functional organization. Studying the brain at this scale does not come without its challenges, however. To tackle some of these challenges, we propose an approach that builds upon task modulations to identical visual stimuli and the simultaneous imaging of distal areas of varying complexity across the cortical hierarchy. Specifically, we record BOLD responses elicited by face stimuli during a stimulus relevant and a stimulus irrelevant task across cortical depths in V1, Occipital Face (OFA) and Fusiform Face area (FFA). We observed that task-related top-down modulations were larger in the inner compared to the outer layers of V1; and in the outer compared to the inner layers in the FFA. Our findings are consistent with animal reports of feedback exchange between deeper and superficial layers and with the notion of apical dendritic amplification as a key mechanism of conscious perception. Our approach showcases the potential of \"laminar-fMRI\" to explore large scale network activity and represents a promising step towards characterizing laminar functional profiles in humans for complex, cognitively meaningful, and socially relevant stimuli such as faces.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong-read sequencing technologies have the potential to overcome the limitations of short reads and provide a comprehensive picture of the human genome. However, it remains hard to characterize repetitive sequences by reconstructing genomic structures at high resolution solely from long reads. Here, we developed a localized assembly method (LoMA) that constructs highly accurate consensus sequences (CSs) from long reads.\n\nMethodsWe first developed LoMA, by combining minimap2, MAFFT, and our algorithm, which classifies diploid haplotypes based on structural variants and constructs CSs. Using this tool, we analyzed two human samples (NA18943 and NA19240) sequenced with the Oxford Nanopore sequencer. We defined target regions in each genome based on mapping patterns and then constructed a high-quality catalog of the human insertion solely from the long-read data.\n\nResultsThe assessment of LoMA showed high accuracy of CSs (error rate < 0.3%) compared with raw data (error rate > 8%) and superiority to the previous study. The genome-wide analysis of NA18943 and NA19240 identified 5,516 and 6,542 insertions ({zeta} 100 bp) respectively. Most insertions ([~]80%) were derived from the tandem repeat and transposable elements. We also detected processed pseudogenes, insertions in transposable elements, and long insertions (> 10 kbp). Further, our analysis suggested that short tandem duplications were association with gene expression and transposons.\n\nConclusionsOur analysis showed that LoMA constructs high-quality sequences from long reads with substantial errors. This study revealed the true structures of insertions with high accuracy and inferred mechanisms for the insertions. Our approach contributes to the future human genome studies.

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that fear memories are consolidated through protein synthesis-dependent changes in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). However, recent studies show that protein synthesis is not required to consolidate the memory of a new dangerous experience when it is similar to a prior experience. Here, we examined whether the protein synthesis requirement for consolidation of the new experience varies with its spatial and temporal distance from the prior experience. In each experiment, rats were conditioned to fear a stimulus (S1, e.g., light) across its pairings with shock in stage 1; and a second stimulus (S2, e.g., tone) that preceded additional S1-shock pairings (S2-S1-shock) in stage 2. The latter stage was followed by a BLA infusion of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide or vehicle. Finally, rats were tested for fear to S2. Critically, protein synthesis in the BLA was not required to consolidate fear to S2 when the two training stages occurred 48 hours apart and in the same context; was required when the two training stages were separated by a 14-day delay or occurred in different contexts; but was again not required when rats were re-exposed to S1 or shock after the delay or in the different context. Thus, protein synthesis in the BLA is not always required to consolidate a new fear memory. Instead, this requirement is determined by the degree of similarity between present and past experiences, the time and place in which those experiences occur, as well as reminders of the past experience.\n\nSignificance StatementProtein synthesis in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) is not required to consolidate the memory of a new dangerous experience when it is similar to a prior experience. This study is significant in showing that: 1) when the new, similar experience occurs after a delay or in a different context, the protein synthesis requirement for its consolidation is reinstated; and 2) the effects of the delay and context shift are reversed by reminding animals of their prior experience. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying memory consolidation are dynamically regulated by similarity/dissimilarity between present and past experiences, the time and place in which those experiences occur, as well as reminders of the past experience.",

    "abstract": "PurposeEvaluating the optical transmission and geometrical aberrations of an intraocular device, namely, the Small-Incision New Generation Implantable Miniature Telescope (SING IMT, Samsara Vision), designed to correct age-related macular degeneration.\n\nMethodsOptical transmission in the spectral range 350-750 nm of the implantable optics was recorded with a fiber-optic spectrometer. Geometrical aberrations were studied by measuring the wavefront of a laser beam after passing through the implantable optics and performing an expansion of the measured wavefront into a Zernike polynomial basis. The study was conducted under in-vitro experimental conditions. A second monofocal intraocular lens (SY60WF, Alcon) was tested and used as reference for assessing the optical quality of the SING IMT device.\n\nResultsSpectroscopy measurements revealed that the SING IMT and monofocal IOL element feature UV-rejection and blue-rejection capabilities, respectively. Wavefront concavity indicated that the SING IMT behaves as a diverging lens with a focal length of approximately -100 mm; Zernike analysis showed that SING IMT has negligible coma, trefoil, astigmatism, and spherical aberrations of any order and along any direction.\n\nConclusionsThe SING IMT exhibited even optical transmission in the whole visible spectrum and curvature capable of magnifying the retinal images without introducing geometrical aberrations, which proves the feasibility of this device as high-quality optical element for imaging. The rigidity of the compound lens of the SING IMT prevents mechanically-induced distortions, an issue encountered with polymeric lenses.\n\nTranslational RelevanceSpectrometry and in vitro wavefront analysis provide evidence supporting the new generation miniaturized telescopic intraocular lens as a favorable option to intraocular implant in age-related macular degeneration.",

    "abstract": "When evolution leads to differences in body size, organs generally scale along. A well-known example of the tight relationship between organ and body size is the scaling of mammalian molar teeth. To investigate how teeth scale during development and evolution, we compared molar development in mouse and rat from initiation through final size. Whereas the linear dimensions of the rat first lower molar are twice that of the mouse molar, their shapes are largely the same. We found that scaling of the molars starts early, and that the rat molar is patterned equally as fast but in a larger size than the mouse molar. Using transcriptomics, we discovered that a known regulator of body size, insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), is more highly expressed in the rat molars compared to the mouse molars. Ex vivo and in vivo mouse models demonstrated that modulation of the IGF pathway reproduces several aspects of the observed scaling process. Furthermore, analysis of IGF1-treated mouse molars and computational modeling indicate that IGF signaling scales teeth by simultaneously enhancing growth and by inhibiting the cusp patterning program, thereby providing a relatively simple mechanism for scaling teeth during development and evolution. Finally, comparative data from shrews to elephants suggest that this scaling mechanism regulates the minimum tooth size possible, as well as the patterning potential of large teeth.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) involves aggregation of amyloid {beta} and tau, neuron loss, cognitive decline, and neuroinflammatory responses. Both resident microglia and peripheral immune cells have been associated with the immune component of AD. However, the relative contribution of resident and peripheral immune cell types to AD predisposition has not been thoroughly explored due to their similarity in gene expression and function. To study the effects of AD associated variants on cis-regulatory elements, we train convolutional neural network (CNN) regression models that link genome sequence to cell type-specific levels of open chromatin, a proxy for regulatory element activity. We then use in silico mutagenesis of regulatory sequences to predict the relative impact of candidate variants across these cell types. We develop and apply criteria for evaluating our models and refine our models using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data. Our models identify many AD-associated variants with a greater predicted impact in peripheral cells relative to microglia or neurons but few with greater predicted impact in microglia and neurons. Our results suggest that peripheral immune cells themselves may mediate a component of AD predisposition and support their use as models to study the effects of AD associated variants. We make our library of CNN models and predictions available as a resource for the community to study immune and neurological disorders.",
