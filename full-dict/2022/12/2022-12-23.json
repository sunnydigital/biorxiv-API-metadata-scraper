    "abstract": "The use of culture independent molecular methods, often referred to as metagenomics, have revolutionized the ability to explore and characterize microbial communities from diverse environmental sources. Most metagenomic workflows have been developed for identification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic community constituents, but tools for identification of plastid genomes are lacking. The endosymbiotic origin of plastids also poses challenges where plastid metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) may be misidentified as low-quality bacterial MAGs. Current tools are limited to classification of contigs as plastid and do not provide further assessment or characterization of plastid MAGs. plastiC is a workflow that allows users to identify plastid genomes in metagenome assemblies, assess completeness, and predict taxonomic association from diverse environmental sources. plastiC is a Snakemake workflow available at https://github.com/Finn-Lab/plastiC. We demonstrate the utility of this workflow with the successful recover of algal plastid MAGs from publicly available lichen metagenomes.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, neural networks have been successful at making predictions from biological sequences, especially in the context of regulatory genomics. As in other fields of deep learning, tools have been devised to extract features such as sequence motifs that can explain the predictions made by a trained network. Here we intend to go beyond explainable machine learning and introduce SEISM, a selective inference procedure to test the association between these extracted features and the predicted phenotype. In particular, we discuss how training a one-layer convolutional network is formally equivalent to selecting motifs maximizing some association score. We adapt existing sampling-based selective inference procedures by quantizing this selection over an infinite set to a large but finite grid. Finally, we show that sampling under a specific choice of parameters is sufficient to characterize the composite null hypothesis typically used for selective inference--a result that goes well beyond our particular framework. We illustrate the behavior of our method in terms of calibration, power and speed and discuss its power/speed trade-off with a simpler data-split strategy. SEISM paves the way to an easier analysis of neural networks used in regulatory genomics, and to more powerful methods for genome wide association studies (GWAS).",

Yet, a major limitation for long-term success of targeted therapy is relapse due to tumor heterogeneity or acquired resistance. Thus, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify prospective resistance mechanisms to pharmacological NOTCH inhibitors and novel targeted combination therapies to efficiently combat T-ALL. Mutational loss of Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) causes resistance to Notch inhibition. PIK3R1 deficiency leads to increased PIK3/Akt signaling which regulates the cell cycle and spliceosome machinery, both at the transcriptional and post-translational level. Moreover, several therapeutic combinations have been identified, where simultaneous targeting of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) and NOTCH proved to be the most efficacious in T-ALL xenotransplantation models.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMutational loss of PIK3R1 induces resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition in T-ALL\nC_LIO_LIPharmacological Notch inhibition synergizes with CDK4/6 inhibitors in T-ALL\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors arising from subepidermal glia. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) individuals may develop thousands of cNFs, greatly affecting their quality of life. cNF growth is governed by the proliferation of NF1(-/-) SCs, highly influenced by the interaction with a NF1(+/-) microenvironment, consisting of fibroblasts (FBs), immune cells, etc. To decompose crosstalk between SCs and the microenvironment we used single cultures and co-cultures of cNF-derived SCs and FBs and identified an expression signature specific to SC-FB interaction. This signature was enriched in genes involved in immune cell migration, that were functionally validated by secretion analysis of SC-FB co-cultures, suggesting a role of SC-FB crosstalk in immune cell recruitment. The signature also captured components of different developmental signaling pathways, among them, the cAMP elevator G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68). Activation of Gpr68 by Ogerin reduced the viability and proliferation of cNF-derived SCs and SC-FB co-cultures. Moreover, Ogerin in combination with the MEKi Selumetinib induced loss of viability, SC differentiation, and death. These results were corroborated using an iPSC-derived 3D neurofibromasphere model. The unbalancing of the Ras and cAMP pathways by combining a MEKi and a cAMP elevator arises as a potential treatment for cNFs.",

Here we use single-cell analysis to define the epidermal and cortical cell populations that respond to and facilitate rhizobium infection. We then identify high-confidence nodulation gene candidates based on their specific expression in these populations, pinpointing genes stably associated with infection across genotypes and time points. We show that one of these, which we name SYMRKL1, encodes a protein with an ectodomain predicted to be nearly identical to that of SYMRK and is required for normal infection thread formation.

Previous studies revealed components of the molecular network controlling RCD, including different proteases. However, the identity, the proteolytic network as well as molecular components involved in the initiation and execution of distinct plant RCD processes, still remain largely elusive. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome, proteome and N-terminome of Z. mays leaves treated with the Xanthomonas effector avrRxo1, the mycotoxin Fumonisin B1 (FB1), or the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) to dissect plant cellular processes related to cell death and plant immunity. We found highly distinct and time-dependent biological processes being activated on transcriptional and proteome levels in response to avrRxo1, FB1 and SA. A correlation analysis of the transcriptome and proteome identified general, as well as trigger-specific markers for cell death in Z. mays. We found that proteases, particularly papain-like cysteine proteases, are specifically regulated during RCD. Collectivley, this study characterizes distinct RCD responses in Z. mays and provides a framework for the mechanistic exploration of components involved in the initiation and execution of cell death.",

    "abstract": "TIR domains are NAD-degrading enzymes that function during immune signaling in prokaryotes, plants, and animals. In plants, most TIR domains are incorporated into intracellular immune receptors. In Arabidopsis, TIR-derived small molecules bind and activate EDS1 heterodimers, which in turn activate RNLs, a class of cation channel-forming immune receptors. RNL activation drives cytoplasmic Ca2+ influx, transcriptional reprogramming, pathogen resistance and host cell death. We screened for mutants that suppress an RNL activation mimic allele and identified a TIR-containing immune receptor, SADR1. Despite functioning downstream of an auto-activated RNL, SADR1 is not required for defense signaling triggered by other tested TIR-containing immune receptors. SADR1 is required for defense signaling initiated by some trans-membrane pattern recognition receptors and contributes to the unbridled spread of cell death in lesion simulating disease 1. Together with RNLs, SADR1 regulates defense gene expression at infection site borders, likely in a non-autonomous manner. RNL mutants that cannot sustain this pattern of gene expression are unable to prevent disease spread beyond localized infection sites, suggesting that this pattern corresponds to a pathogen containment mechanism. SADR1 potentiates RNL-driven immune signaling partially through the activation of EDS1, but also partially independently of EDS1. We studied EDS1-independent TIR function using nicotinamide, an NADase inhibitor. We observed decreased defense induction from trans-membrane pattern recognition receptors and decreased calcium influx, pathogen growth restriction and host cell death following intracellular immune receptor activation. We demonstrate that TIR domains can potentiate calcium influx and defense and are thus broadly required for Arabidopsis immunity.",

    "abstract": "In plants, age-related resistance (ARR) refers to a gain of disease resistance during shoot or organ maturation. ARR associated with vegetative phase change, a transition from juvenile to adult stage, is a widespread agronomic trait affecting resistance against multiple pathogens. How innate immunity in a plant is differentially regulated during successive stages of shoot maturation is unclear. In this work, we found that Arabidopsis thaliana showed ARR against its bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 during vegetative phase change. The timing of the ARR activation was associated with a temporal drop of miR156 level. A systematic inspection of the loss- and gain-of-function mutants of 11 SPL genes revealed that a subset of SPL genes, notably SPL2, SPL10, and SPL11, activated ARR in adult stage. The immune function of SPL10 was independent of its role in morphogenesis. Furthermore, the SPL10 mediated an age-dependent augmentation of the salicylic acid (SA) pathway partially by direct activation of PAD4. Disrupting SA biosynthesis or signaling abolished the ARR against Pto DC3000. Our work demonstrated that the miR156-SPL10 module in Arabidopsis is deployed to operate immune outputs over developmental timing.\n\nSignificanceAge-associated change of immunity is a widespread phenomenon in animals and plants. How organisms integrate immune maturation into a developmental clock is a fundamental question. Heterochronic microRNAs are key regulators of developmental timing. We found that a conserved heterochronic microRNA (miRNA) in Arabidopsis, microRNA156, regulates the timing of age-related resistance associated with a transition from the juvenile to the adult vegetative phase. The coordination between developmental maturation and gain of disease resistance is achieved through miR156-controlled SPL transcription factors with distinct functions. A subset of SPL transcription factors promoted resistance by directly activating key genes in defense signaling. This work bridges the knowledge gap between vegetative development and age-related resistance. Pinpointing mechanisms of the developmental regulation on immunity may pave a way for unlocking the age limit on plant immunity and lay a foundation to applications in the precision agriculture.",

However, the RPPA approach is highly dependent on antibody reliability and approximately one third of the antibodies used in the TCGA are deemed to be somewhat less reliable. Here, we assess the impact of antibody reliability on observed mRNA-protein correlations. We find that, in general, proteins measured with less reliable antibodies have lower observed mRNA-protein correlations. This is not true of the same proteins when measured using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, in cell lines, we find that when the same protein is quantified by both mass spectrometry and RPPA, the overall correlation between the two measurements is lower for proteins measured with less reliable antibodies. Overall our results reinforce the need for caution in using RPPA measurements from less reliable antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic changes can bring insight into gene regulatory mechanisms associated with disease pathogenicity, including chronicity and increased vulnerability. To date, we are yet to identify genes sensitive to epigenetic regulation that contribute to the maintenance of chronic pain and with an epigenetic landscape indicative of the susceptibility to persistent pain. Such genes would provide a novel opportunity for better pain management, as their epigenetic profile could be targeted for the treatment of chronic pain or used as an indication of vulnerability for prevention strategies. Here, we investigated the epigenetic profile of the gene FKBP5 for this potential, using targeted bisulphite sequencing in rodent pre-clinical models of chronic and latent hypersensitive states. The FKBP5 promoter DNA methylation (DNAm) signature in the CNS was significantly different between models of persistent pain and there was a significant correlation between CNS and peripheral blood FKBP5 DNAm, indicating that further exploration of FKBP5 promoter DNAm as a biomarker of chronic pain pathogenic origin is warranted. We also found that maternal separation, which promotes the persistency of inflammatory pain in adulthood, was accompanied by long-lasting reduction in FKBP5 DNAm, suggesting that FKPB5 DNAm profile may indicate the increased vulnerability to chronic pain in individuals exposed to trauma in early life. Overall, our data demonstrate that the FKBP5 promoter DNAm landscape brings novel insight into the differing pathogenic origins of chronic pain, may be able to diagnose and stratify patients, and predict the susceptibility to chronic pain.",

However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a discrete border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct connectivity patterns: While pmEC showed increased connectivity preferentially with the default mode network, the alEC exhibited increased connectivity with regions in the dorsal attention and salience networks. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.",

    "abstract": "Visuospatial attention is not a monolithic process and can be divided into different functional systems. In this framework, exogenous attention reflects the involuntary orienting of attention resources following a salient event, whereas endogenous attention corresponds to voluntary orienting based on the goals and intentions of individuals. Previous work shows that these attention processes map onto distinct functional systems, yet evidence suggests that they are not fully independent. In the current work, we investigated the differential and overlapping effects of exogenous and endogenous attention on visual processing. We combined spatial cueing of visuospatial attention, electroencephalography (EEG), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine where and when the effects of exogenous and endogenous attention were maximally different and maximally similar. Critically, MVPA provided new insights by examining whether classifiers trained to decode the cueing effect for one attention process (e.g., exogenous attention) can successfully decode the cueing effect for the other attention process (e.g., endogenous attention). These analyses uncovered differential and overlapping effects between exogenous and endogenous attention. Next, we combined principal component analyses, single-trial event-related potentials, and mediation analysis to determine whether these effects facilitate perception, as indexed by the behavioral spatial cueing effects of exogenous and endogenous attention. This approach revealed that three EEG components shape the cueing effects of exogenous and endogenous attention at various times after target onset. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive account about how overlapping and differential processes of endogenous and exogenous relate to perceptual facilitation in the context of visuospatial attention.\n\nSignificance StatementTop-down and bottom-up attention represent separate functional systems in the brain. Previous research suggests, however, that they are not fully independent, and can interfere with each other. In the present study, the authors use machine learning techniques and recordings of brain activity to investigate differences and similarities between top-down and bottom-up attention during the visual processing of stimuli. This approach allowed them to explore how top-down and bottom-up attention processes facilitate perception. Their results show that top-down and bottom-up attention operate differently as early as 100ms after the onset of a target. In contrast, they operate similarly 200ms after the target onset. Most importantly, these effects are directly related to the participants perceptual behavior. In sum, our study shows that top-down and bottom-up attention support the perception of stimuli through overlapping and distinct spatio-temporal brain patterns.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are maternally transmitted bacteria that are utilized for arboviral disease prevention. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and viral blocking, two characteristics that make Wolbachia suitable for vector control, both depend on bacterial infection prevalence and density. Although numerous mosquito species naturally harbor Wolbachia, the prevalence of Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti varies from minimal to absent. The absence of natural Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti is considered advantageous for novel Wolbachia transinfection because interference caused by incompatible Wolbachia strains will not occur. In this study, we screened for Wolbachia density in 429 individual Ae. aegypti collected from Metropolitan Manila, Philippines using locally designed primers to determine whether primer compatibility improves Wolbachia detection in naturally infected Ae. aegypti. We also investigated the effects of host sex and Wolbachia strain on Wolbachia density. We found a high Wolbachia prevalence for 16S rRNA (40%) and wsp (62%) markers. Relative Wolbachia densities ranged from -3.840 to 2.710 for 16S rRNA and from -4.020 to 1.810 for wsp, and these relative densities were higher among male mosquitoes than female mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the Ae. aegypti were clustered into supergroup B, with 63% (142/226) of these sequences representing a unique strain referred to here as \"wAegML,\" which exhibited a significantly lower density in Ae. aegypti than the other two Wolbachia strains detected (wAegB/wAlbB and wAlbA) as well as a higher density in male Ae. aegypti than in females. Overall, locally designed primers improved Wolbachia detection in naturally infected Ae. aegypti. The unique strain wAegML occurs at a low density and is related to the use of wAlbB in mass-release programs; therefore, it is unlikely to interfere with such programs. Further studies on natural Wolbachia infection in Ae. aegypti combining methodological and biological factors are warranted to help resolve current conflicts in the field.",

    "abstract": "The cohesin complex regulates higher order chromosome architecture through maintaining sister chromatid cohesion and folding chromatin by active DNA loop extrusion. Impaired cohesin function underlies a heterogeneous group of genetic syndromes and is associated with cancer. Here, by using synthetic lethality CRISPR screens in isogenic human cell lines defective of specific cohesion regulators, we mapped the genetic dependencies induced by absence of DDX11 or ESCO2. The obtained high confidence synthetic lethality networks are strongly enriched for genes involved in DNA replication and mitosis and support the existence of parallel sister chromatid cohesion establishment pathways. Among the hits, we identified the chromatin binding, BRCT-domain containing protein PAXIP1 as a novel cohesin regulator. Depletion of PAXIP1 severely aggravated cohesion defects in ESCO2 defective cells, leading to mitotic cell death. PAXIP1 promoted the global chromatin association of cohesin, independent of DNA replication, a function that could not be explained by indirect effects of PAXIP1 on transcription or the DNA damage response. Cohesin regulation by PAXIP1 required its binding partner PAGR1 and a conserved FDF motif in PAGR1. Similar motifs were previously found in multiple cohesin regulators, including CTCF, to mediate physical interactions with cohesin. PAXIP1 co-localizes with cohesin on multiple genomic loci, including at active gene promoters and enhancers. Together, this study identifies the PAXIP1-PAGR1 complex as a novel regulator of cohesin occupancy on chromatin. Possibly, this role in cohesin regulation is also relevant for previously described functions of PAXIP1 in transcription, immune cell maturation and DNA repair.",

    "abstract": "The {gamma}-tubulin complex ({gamma}TuC) is a widely conserved microtubule nucleator, but some of its components GCP4-6. Here, we identified two {gamma}TuC-associated proteins in C. elegans, namely GTAP-1 and -2, for which apparent orthologs were detected only in the genus Caenorhabditis. Their centrosomal localization was interdependent. In early C. elegans embryos, whereas the conserved {gamma}TuC component MZT-1/MOZART1 was essential for the localization of centrosomal {gamma}-tubulin, depletion of GTAP-1 and/or -2 caused up to 50% reduction of centrosomal {gamma}-tubulin and precocious disassembly of spindle poles during mitotic telophase. In the adult germline, GTAP-1 and GTP-2 contributed to the efficient recruitment of {gamma}TuC to the plasma membrane. Depletion of GTAP-1, but not GTAP-2, severely disrupted both the microtubule array and the honeycomb-like structure in the adult germline.\n\nWe propose that GTAP-1 and -2 are unconventional components of {gamma}TuC that contribute to the organization of both centrosomal and non-centrosomal microtubules by targeting the {gamma}TuC to specific subcellular sites in a tissue-specific manner.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTHaruta et al. show that GTAP-1 and -2, two unconventional components of the {gamma}-tubulin complex ({gamma}TuC) in C. elegans, contribute to targeting the {gamma}TuC to embryonic centrosomes and germ-cell membrane in adults.",

    "abstract": "Both temperature and community complexity are known to affect trophic interaction strength (TIS), but whether their effect is additive or not is as yet an open question. Here we used a 2-predator/3-prey system consistently occurring in avocado orchards to explore the effects of increasing warming and community complexity on the strength of predator:prey trophic interactions. The two predator species differed in their diet breath (a carnivore and an omnivore) and the prey types included a herbivore, heterospecific juvenile predators, and/or pollen. Overall, analyses revealed multiplicative effects of community complexity and both temperature and predator diet breath on the net predator:prey(s) TIS. Indeed, warming led to increased TIS in the community with omnivore as top predator, but only in absence of its preferred food source. When the carnivore was the top predator, in contrast, higher temperatures led to TIS being more negative, but only for the IGprey. We conclude that sources of context dependence in specific systems need to be identified to unveil effects of warming on communities.",

We aim to identify which areas have the highest diversity of vascular plant genera, and which areas have the highest deforestation risk. Combining these findings we highlight priority regions for research and conservation.\n\nLocationNew Guinea\n\nTime period1900-2021\n\nTaxa studiedTracheophyta (Vascular plants)\n\nMethodsWe obtained collection records and environmental variables and prepared a cost-distance map of New Guinea to indicate accessibility. We modelled the joint distribution of 1,156 genera with the  HO_SCPLOWMSCC_SCPLOW package in R to predict biodiversity across space, accounting for collection bias. We combined these results with a genus-level phylogenetic tree to predict phylogenetic endemism. We then modelled deforestation risk with the  R-INLA package, using forest clearance data and variables including cost-distance. We compared actual and predicted deforestation, and made predictions for 2021-25. Finally, we developed a combined measure of predicted biodiversity plus deforestation risk.\n\nResultsA mean Spearmans rank correlation of 0.462 was obtained on five-fold cross-validation of the genus biodiversity model; bias-correction shifted the predicted distribution of biodiversity towards western New Guinea, but had less effect on estimates of phylogenetic endemism.\n\nPredictions of relative deforestation probability were accurate over 5 and 10 years (Spearman values 0.66 and 0.71). We postulate a  deforestation debt to explain the persistence in accuracy. Over time, the areas which survive early deforestation gradually become more rewarding targets and the proportion of at-risk forest lost to clearance accumulates.\n\nMain conclusionsWe present a method for rapid assessment of biodiversity and deforestation risk in data-deficient tropical forest regions. Areas of high predicted biodiversity such as the Merauke and Jayapura lowlands are at high near-term risk from commercial deforestation, requiring urgent interventions to record and preserve threatened species.",

Eumaeus-Zamia interactions have been mainly characterized for species distributed in North and Central America. However, host plant use by the southern Eumaeus clade remains largely unknown, precluding a comprehensive study of co-evolution between the genera. Here, we combine fieldwork with museum and literature surveys to expand herbivory records for Eumaeus from 21 to 38 Zamia species. We inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny of Eumaeus to test for distinct macroevolutionary scenarios of host plant conservatism and co-evolution. We found remarkable coincidence between Eumaeus and Zamia diversification, with the butterfly stem group diverging at the same time as the most recent radiation of Zamia in the Miocene. Cophylogenetic reconciliation analyses show a strong cophylogenetic signal between cycads and their butterfly herbivores. Bipartite model-based approaches indicate that this is because closely related Zamia species are used by the same Eumaeus species, suggesting host plant resource tracking by the butterfly herbivores. Our results highlight a case of tight evolution between Eumaeus butterflies and cycads, pointing to the generality of correlated evolution and phylogenetic tracking in plant-herbivore interactions across seed plants.",

    "abstract": "Viruses evolve in infected host populations, and host population dynamics affect viral evolution. RNA viruses with a short duration of infection and a high peak viral load, such as and SARS-CoV-2, are maintained in human populations. By contrast, RNA viruses characterized by a long infection duration and a low peak viral load (e.g., borna disease virus) can be maintained in nonhuman populations, and why the persistent viruses evolved has been rarely explored. Here, using a multi-level modeling approach including both individual-level virus infection dynamics and population-scale transmission, we consider virus evolution based on the host environment, specifically, the effect of the contact history of infected hosts. We found that, with a highly dense contact history, viruses with a high virus production rate but low accuracy are likely to be optimal, resulting in a short infectious period with a high peak viral load. In contrast, with a low-density contact history, viral evolution is toward low virus production but high accuracy, resulting in long infection durations with low peak viral load. Our study sheds light on the origin of persistent viruses and why acute viral infections but not persistent virus infection tends to prevail in human society.",

    "abstract": "The development of CRISPR genetic screening tools has improved functional genomics, as these tools enable precise genomic editing, provide broad access to genomic regions beyond protein-coding genes, and have fewer off-target effects than other functional genomics modalities, allowing for novel applications with smaller library sizes compared to prior technologies. Pooled functional genomics screens require high cellular coverage per perturbation to accurately quantify phenotypes and average out phenotype-independent variability across the population. While more compact libraries have decreased the number of cells needed for a given screen, the cell coverage required for large-scale CRISPR screens still poses technical hurdles to screen in more challenging systems, such as iPSC-derived and primary cells. A major factor that influences cell coverage is screening library uniformity, as larger variation in individual guide RNA abundance requires higher cell coverage to reliably measure low-abundance guides. In this work, we have systematically optimized guide RNA cloning procedures to decrease bias. We implement these protocols to demonstrate that CRISPRi screens using 10-fold fewer cells than the current standard provides equivalent statistically significant hit-calling results to screens run at higher coverage, opening the possibility of conducting genome-wide and other large-scale CRISPR screens in technically challenging models.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold2 achieved a breakthrough in protein structure prediction through the end-to-end deep learning method, which can predict nearly all single-domain proteins at experimental resolution. However, the prediction accuracy of full-chain proteins is generally lower than that of single-domain proteins because of the incorrect interactions between domains. In this work, we develop an inter-domain distance prediction method, named DeepIDDP. In DeepIDDP, we design a neural network with attention mechanisms, where two new inter-domain features are used to enhance the ability to capture the interactions between domains. Furthermore, we propose a data enhancement strategy termed DPMSA, which is employed to deal with the absence of co-evolutionary information on targets. We integrate DeepIDDP into our previously developed domain assembly method SADA, termed SADA-DeepIDDP. Tested on a given multi-domain benchmark dataset, the accuracy of SADA-DeepIDDP inter-domain distance prediction is 11.3% and 21.6% higher than trRosettaX and trRosetta, respectively. The accuracy of the domain assembly model is 2.5% higher than that of SADA.

    "abstract": "Cancer is an evolutionary process involving the accumulation of somatic mutations in the genome. The tumors evolution is known to be highly influenced by specific somatic mutations in so-called cancer driver genes. Cancer progression models are computational tools used to infer the interactions among cancer driver genes by analyzing the pattern of absence/presence of mutations in different tumors of a cohort. In an abundance of subclonal mutations, discarding the heterogeneity of tumors and investigating the interrelations among the driver genes solely based on tumor-level data can result in misleading interpretations. In this paper, we introduce a computational approach to infer cancer progression models from the clone-level data gathered from a cohort of tumors. Our method leverages the rich clone-level data to identify the patterns of interactions among cancer driver genes and produce significantly more robust and reliable cancer progression models. Using a novel efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm, our method provides outstanding scalability to the rapidly increasing size of available datasets. Using an extensive set of synthetic data experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our inference method in recovering the generative progression models. Finally, we present our analysis of two sub-types of lung cancer using biological multi-regional bulk data.",

    "abstract": "The effects of moisture content (MC) and storage temperature (ST) on seed longevity have been modeled for many species. In contrast, our understanding on the combined effects of MC and ST on dormancy release (DR) in \"dry\" orthodox seeds is still insufficient to build robust predictive models. We used freshly harvested, dormant sunflower achenes to explore the effects of MC (4-10%) in combination with a wide range of ST (-18{degrees}C to +30{degrees}C) on DR dynamics, embryo responsiveness to abscisic acid (ABA) and deterioration indicators. Storage temperatures allowing full DR were inversely related to achene MC, ranging from >25{degrees}C for MC4% to sub-zero temperatures for MC10%, resembling a phase diagram. Rates of DR were plotted along a RH gradient. Combinations of MCxST optimal for DR were between ca. 40-60%RH. Increasing RH from 60 to 80% inhibited DR. Higher RH>80-85% promoted partial DR together with rapid ageing. We suggest that reactions promoting full DR are favored alongside a physical (glassy) transition and are not oxidative. We propose biophysical coordinates to guide future studies on the mechanisms involved in DR, but also to develop predictive models useful to define post-harvest conditions that maximize sunflower seed quality.\n\nHighlights{square} The effects of moisture content (MC) and storage temperature (ST) on dormancy release and deterioration were investigated in sunflower achenes using a factorial design.\n{square}Dormancy release was promoted by MCxST combinations in equilibrium with a RH between 40 and 60% and was delayed outside this range.\n{square}Storage temperatures optimal for dormancy release were inversely related to achene MC, ranging from >25{degrees}C for MC4% to sub-zero temperatures for MC10%, resembling a phase diagram.\n{square}Dormancy release and ageing are promoted within distinct, non-overlapping regions along the RH gradient supporting different types of reactions for each process.",

However, little is known about how the host antimicrobial peptide repertoire is adapted to its microbiome. Here we characterize the function and evolution of the Diptericin antimicrobial peptide family of Diptera. Using mutations affecting the two Diptericins (Dpt) of Drosophila melanogaster, we reveal the specific role of DptA for the pathogen Providencia rettgeri and DptB for the gut mutualist Acetobacter. Strikingly, presence of DptA- or DptB-like genes across Diptera correlates with the presence of Providencia and Acetobacter in their environment. Moreover, DptA- and DptB-like sequence predicts host resistance against infection by these bacteria across the genus Drosophila. Our study explains the evolutionary logic behind the bursts of rapid evolution of an antimicrobial peptide family, and reveals how the host immune repertoire adapts to changing microbial environments.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria are prevalent in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of diverse plant species where they help to enhance tolerance of plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we show that the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and methyljasmonate (MeJA) alter growth, development and specialized metabolism of Streptomyces. Challenge of Streptomyces coelicolor with JA or MeJA led to strongly enhanced production of the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin. JA is toxic to Streptomycetaceae, whereby members of the genus Streptacidiphilus are generally more sensitive than streptomycetes. As a defensive response, extensive amino acid conjugation of JA was observed; the most prevalent conjugation was with glutamine (Gln), while conjugates with Val, Tyr, Phe and Leu/Ile were identified after longer exposure to JA. Synthetic JA conjugates failed to activate antibiotic production and had strongly reduced toxicity, strongly suggesting that conjugation inactivates JA and serves to detoxify the hormone. Thus, for the first time we provide evidence that plant hormones modulate growth, development and secondary metabolism of streptomycetes, whereby amino acid conjugation serves as a defense strategy by the bacteria to circumvent plant hormone toxicity.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicroorganisms that live on or inside plants greatly influence plant health. Streptomycetes are considered to have an important role in defense against plant diseases, but the mechanisms through which they protect plants are currently not fully understood. It has been suggested that streptomycetes respond to changes in the plants physiology, among others by producing protective molecules; however, little is known of the signal transduction from plant to bacterium. We here demonstrate that the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and methyljasmonate (MeJA) directly influence the life cycle of streptomycetes by modulating antibiotic synthesis and promoting faster development. Moreover, the plant hormones specifically stimulate the synthesis of the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor. Jasmonic acid is then modified in the cell by amino acid conjugation, which reduces the bioactivity of the hormone and thus quenches the signal. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported previously. Collectively, these results suggest a relationship between plant physiological changes and the response of streptomycetes in multiple ways.",

    "abstract": "Environmental health and microbiome can affect poultry production in a variety of ways. Poor environmental conditions can lead to increased stress, disease, and mortality in poultry, resulting in reduced production. Poor environmental conditions can also reduce the diversity of microbial populations in the poultry microbiome, which can lead to an increased risk of disease and reduced production. Finally, microorganisms in the environment can be introduced to the poultry microbiome, which can increase the risk of disease and reduce production. Additionally, poultry production can have significant impacts on the environmental microbiome. Poultry farming can alter soil and water microbiomes through pollution from manure and other agricultural runoff. These changes can lead to increased concentrations of certain microbes as well as an altered balance between beneficial microorganisms. In this study, we investigated the changes in the microbiome profiles of commercial and backyard broiler farming systems at different time points. To explore the microbiome profiles, fecal, soil, litter samples, and swabs from feeders and waterers were collected three times over the production period from a single flock. Each backyard farm was sampled at three time points: 10, 31, and 52 days of production and days 10, 24, and 38 of production in commercial farms. Statistical and network analyses were performed using DADA2 and MicrobiomeAnalyst platforms. Our results show marked differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, and relative abundance of taxa between commercial and backyard farms over time. The observed species index significantly differed between the backyard and commercial farms for the soil, litter, and waterer samples. In addition, the fecal samples from backyard farms were found to have more Firmicutes, Bacteriodota, Desulfobacteria, Synergitota, Fusobacteriota, and Campilobacterota. Moreover, clustering showed different patterns in commercial and backyard farms with distinct marker taxa for each production system. Furthermore, the microbiome profiles of commercial and backyard farms evolved differently over time.",

    "abstract": "Many types of differentiated cells can reenter the cell cycle upon injury or stress. The mechanisms underlying this cell plasticity are still poorly understood. Here we investigated cell plasticity regulation using a zebrafish model, in which a population of differentiated epithelial cells are reactivated under a physiological context. We observed a robust and sustained increase in mitochondrial membrane potential in reactivated cells. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations show that elevated mitochondrial metabolism and ATP synthesis are critical for cell reactivation. Elevated mitochondrial metabolism increases mitochondrial ROS levels, which induces Sgk1 expression in the mitochondria. Deletion and inhibition of Sgk1 in zebrafish abolished cell reactivation. Similarly, ROS-dependent mitochondrial expression of SGK1 promotes S phase entry in human breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, Sgk1 coordinates mitochondrial activity with ATP synthesis by modulating F1Fo-ATP synthase phosphorylation. These findings suggest a conserved intramitochondrial signaling loop regulating epithelial cell renewal.\n\nOne sentence highlightThis study reports a new intramitochondrial signaling loop regulating epithelial cell renewal.",

    "abstract": "Plants mitochondrial genomes (mitogenome) evolve in a hard-to-predict fashion. To reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of land plant mitogenomes, we, here, filled the last major mitogenomic gap within land plants by assembling the mitogenomes of the leptosporangiate ferns Azolla filiculoides and Pteridium revolutum and, secondly, analyzed the mitogenomic evolutionary regime shifts across land plants. By testing various Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stabilizing selection models in an a priori-free analysis of five selected mitogenomic traits, we observed 71 evolutionary regime shifts across 218 land plant species. These shifts can lead to genomic convergence, in which certain traits such as size, GC content, and the proportion of non-coding DNA converge, or non-converging regimes, which are characterized by exceptional paths of genomic evolution such as extreme GC content or size. We also found that non-seed plants have a slightly, but significantly, higher rate of synonymous substitutions across all gene classes than seed plants, and that ferns differ significantly in the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes compared with other non-seed and seed plants. This pattern matches an outstandingly high rate of RNA editing in the small but repeat-rich mitogenomes of leptosporangiate ferns. In sum, our study highlights the considerable changes in mito-chromosomal architecture that occur during land plant evolution and suggests that these changes may be related to increases in error-prone repair mechanisms. Further study of underrepresented plant groups such as ferns and lycophytes is needed to understand the mechanisms and dominating forces behind the evolutionary dynamics and the mitogenomic inflation syndrome.\n\nSignificance StatementOur study provides new insights into the complexity and diversity of land plant mitogenome evolution and reveals that they take many turns of molecular evolutionary directions across 218 land plant species. Our results have the potential to inform future research in this area and to advance our understanding of the mitogenomic inflation syndrome during plant evolution.",

    "abstract": "Parasites with complex lifecycles often manipulate the phenotype of their intermediate hosts to increase the probability of transmission to their definitive hosts. Infection with Anomotaenia brevis, a cestode that uses Temnothorax nylanderi ants as intermediate hosts, leads to a multiple-fold extension of host lifespan and to changes in behaviour, morphology, and colouration. The mechanisms behind these changes are unknown, as is whether the increased longevity is achieved through parasite manipulation. Here we demonstrate that the parasite releases proteins into its host with functions that might explain the observed changes. These parasitic proteins make up a substantial portion of the proteome of the hosts haemolymph, and thioredoxin peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, two antioxidants, exhibited the highest abundances among them. The largest part of the secreted proteins could not be annotated, indicating they are either novel or severely altered during recent coevolution to function in host manipulation. We also detected shifts in the hosts proteome with infection, in particular an overabundance of vitellogenin-like-A in infected ants, a protein that regulates division of labour in Temnothorax ants, which could explain the observed behavioural changes. Our results thus point at two different strategies likely employed by this parasite to manipulate its host - by secretion of proteins with immediate influence on the hosts phenotype and by altering the hosts translational activity. Our findings reveal the intricate molecular interplay required to influence the phenotype of a host and shed light on potential signalling pathways and genes involved in parasite-host communication.",

    "abstract": "Transgenerational genetic effects are defined as the effects of untransmitted parental alleles on the phenotype of their offspring. Well-known transgenerational genetic effects, in humans and other mammals, are the effects of a parental genotype on the nurturing ability of the parents, coined \"genetic nurture\". However, there exist examples of transgenerational genetic effects in model organisms that are independent of nurturing effects and support the epigenetic transmission of a memory of the parental genotype possibly mediated by small RNA species. To test whether such transgenerational epigenetic effects might exist in mammals, we generated 833 isogenic C57BL/6J (B6) mice that differed only by the presence in the genome of their sire of one copy of four A/J chromosomes (MMU 15, 17, 19 or X). We measured 25 anatomical traits and performed RNA-Seq on five distinct tissues (heart, liver, pituitary, whole embryo, and placenta). There was no evidence of a significant effect from untransmitted A/J sire chromosome alleles, whether on anatomical traits or gene expression level. We observed an effect on Mid1 expression levels in multiple tissues, but this was shown to be due to a de novo mutation that occurred in one of the sire lines. We conclude that transgenerational epigenetic memory of non-transmitted paternal alleles - if it exists - is uncommon in mice and likely other mammals.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlining forage production and its biomass nutritive quality at the omics level is crucial for boosting the output of high-quality dry matter per unit of land. Despite the advent of multiple omics integration for the study of biological systems in major crops, investigations on forage species are still scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to combine multi-omics from grass hybrids by prioritizing omic features based on the reconstruction of interacting networks and assessing their relevance in explaining economically important phenotypes. Transcriptomic and NMR-based metabolomic data were used for sparse estimation via the fused graphical lasso, followed by modularity-based gene expression and metabolite-metabolite network reconstruction, node hub identification, omic-phenotype association via pairwise fitting of a multivariate genomic model, and machine learning-based prediction study. Analyses were jointly performed across two data sets composed of family pools of hybrid ryegrass (Lolium perenne x L. multiflorum) and Festulolium loliaceum (L. perenne x Festuca pratensis), whose phenotypes were recorded for eight traits in field trials across two European countries in 2020/21. Our results suggest substantial changes in gene co-expression and metabolite-metabolite network topologies as a result of genetic perturbation by hybridizing L. perenne with another species within the genus relative to across genera. However, conserved hub genes and hub metabolomic features were detected between pedigree classes, some of which were highly heritable and displayed one or more significant edges with agronomic traits in a weighted omics-phenotype network. In spite of tagging relevant biological molecules as, for example, the light-induced rice 1 (LIR1), hub features were not necessarily better explanatory variables for omics-assisted prediction than features stochastically sampled. The use of the graphical lasso method for network reconstruction and identification of biological targets is discussed with an emphasis on forage grass breeding.",

Therefore, we aimed to clarify the function of GRK5 in pancreatic {beta} cells.\n\nMethodsWe generated a novel pancreatic {beta} cell-specific GRK5 knockout mass ({beta}GRK5 KO) and evaluated glucose tolerance and metabolic changes by body weight measurement, oral glucose tolerance test, and insulin tolerance test. The number of pancreatic {beta} cells was quantified by immunohistochemistry. Glucose loading and Ca2+ imaging was performed on isolated islets to evaluate insulin secretory capacity. To elucidate the mechanism of {beta}GRK5 on {beta} cell mass regulation, we performed RNA-seq of isolated islets and identified the signaling pathways that could be regulated by GRK5. Furthermore, in vitro experiments were conducted using human islets and mouse {beta}GRK5 KO islets to clarify the direct effects of GRK5 on these pathways.\n\nResults{beta}GRK5 KO islets showed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, but no change in body weight or insulin resistance, suggesting that the main cause of impaired glucose tolerance is impaired insulin secretion. Isolated islets showed no abnormalities in insulin secretory capacity or changes in calcium influx, but histologically showed a decrease in {beta} cell mass. Consistent with the decreased {beta} cell mass in {beta}GRK5 KO, the cell cycle inhibitor gene Cdkn1a was upregulated in {beta}GRK5 KO islets; this phenocopies the {beta}SOX4 KO. Furthermore, we found that Grk5 positively regulates facultative increases in {beta} cell mass through activity-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC5 and subsequent transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Nr4a1, Fosb, Junb, Arc, Egr1 and Srf.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that GRK5 is associated with type 2 diabetes through regulation of {beta} cell mass. GRK5 could become a potential target of cell therapy to preserve functional {beta} cells during the progression towards frank diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that mice lacking the protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1 BKO) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) have induction of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which promotes fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) secretion as a batokine. FGF21 increases metabolic rates at baseline conditions but is dispensable for the resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO) reported in OPA1 BKO mice [1]. To determine alternative mediators of this phenotype, we performed transcriptome analysis, which revealed increased levels of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in BAT. To determine if ATF4 induction was mediated by the protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and to evaluate the contribution of GDF15 to the resistance to DIO, we selectively deleted PERK or GDF15 in OPA1 BKO mice. Mice lacking both OPA1 and PERK in BAT had preserved induction of ATF4. Importantly, simultaneous deletion of OPA1 and GDF15 partially reversed the resistance to diet-induced obesity and abrogated the improvements in glucose tolerance. Furthermore, GDF15 mediated cold-induced thermogenesis, likely via sympathetic activation of iWAT. Taken together, our data indicate that PERK is dispensable for ATF4 induction, but GDF15 contributes to the resistance to DIO, and is required for glucose homeostasis and thermoregulation in OPA1 BKO mice.",

    "abstract": "The family of Geminiviridae consists of more than 500 circular single-stranded (ss) DNA viral species that can infect numerous dicot and monocot plants. Geminiviruses replicate their genome in the nucleus of a plant cell, taking advantage of the hosts DNA replication machinery. For converting their DNA into double-stranded DNA, and subsequent replication, these viruses rely on host DNA polymerases. However, the priming of the very first step of this process, i.e. the conversion of incoming circular ssDNA into a dsDNA molecule, has remained elusive for almost 30 years. In this study, sequencing of melon (Cucumis melo) accession K18 carrying the Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) recessive resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) in chromosome 11, and analyses of DNA sequence data from 100 melon genomes, showed a conservation of a shared mutation in the DNA Primase Large subunit (PRiL) of all accessions that exhibited resistance upon a challenge with ToLCNDV. Silencing of (native) Nicotiana benthamiana PriL and subsequent challenging with three different geminiviruses showed a severe reduction in titers of all three viruses, altogether emphasizing an important role of PRiL in geminiviral replication. A model is presented explaining the role of PriL during initiation of geminiviral DNA replication, i.e. as a regulatory subunit of primase that generates an RNA primer at the onset of DNA replication in analogy to DNA Primase-mediated initiation of DNA replication in all living organisms.",

Modulation of cortico-striatal circuits has been suggested as a mechanism of action. To gain mechanistic insight, we monitored neuronal activity in cortico-striatal regions in a mouse model for compulsive behavior, while systematically varying clinically-relevant parameters of internal-capsule DBS. DBS showed dose-dependent effects on both brain and behavior: An increasing, yet balanced, number of excited and inhibited neurons was recruited, scattered throughout cortico-striatal regions, while compulsive grooming decreased. Such neuronal recruitment did not alter basic brain function such as resting-state activity, and only occurred in awake animals, indicating a dependency on network activity. In addition to these widespread effects, we observed specific involvement of the medial orbitofrontal cortex in therapeutic outcomes, which was corroborated by optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insight into how DBS exerts its therapeutic effects on compulsive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Human functional brain connectivity can be temporally decomposed into states of high and low cofluctuation, defined as coactivation of brain regions over time. Rare states of particularly high cofluctuation have been shown to reflect fundamentals of intrinsic functional network architecture and to be highly subject-specific. However, it is unclear whether such network-defining states also contribute to individual variations in cognitive abilities - which strongly rely on the interactions among distributed brain regions. By introducing CMEP, a new eigenvector-based prediction framework, we show that as few as 16 temporally separated time frames (< 1.5% of 10min resting-state fMRI) can significantly predict individual differences in intelligence (N = 263, p < .001). Against previous expectations, individuals network-defining time frames of particularly high cofluctuation do not predict intelligence. Multiple functional brain networks contribute to the prediction, and all results replicate in an independent sample (N = 831). Our results suggest that although fundamentals of person-specific functional connectomes can be derived from few time frames of highest connectivity, temporally distributed information is necessary to extract information about cognitive abilities. This information is not restricted to specific connectivity states, like network-defining high-cofluctuation states, but rather reflected across the entire length of the brain connectivity time series.",

    "abstract": "Drug combinations present a powerful strategy to tackle antimicrobial resistance, but have not been systematically tested in many bacterial species. Here, we used an automated high-throughput setup to profile [~] 8000 combinations between 65 antibacterial drugs in three Gram-positive species: the model species, Bacillus subtilis and two prominent pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thereby, we recapitulate previously known drug interactions, but also identify ten times more interactions than previously reported in the pathogen S. aureus, including two synergies that were also effective in multi-drug resistant clinical S. aureus isolates in vitro and in vivo. Interactions were largely species-specific and mostly synergistic for drugs targeting the same cellular process, as observed also for Gram-negative species1. Yet, the dominating synergies are clearly distinct between Gram-negative and Gram-positive species, and are driven by different bottlenecks in drug uptake and vulnerabilities of their cell surface structures. To further explore interactions of commonly prescribed non-antibiotic drugs with antibiotics, we tested 2728 of such combinations in S. aureus, detecting a plethora of unexpected antagonisms that could compromise the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments in the age of polypharmacy. We uncovered even more synergies than antagonisms, some of which we could demonstrate as effective combinations in vivo against multi-drug resistant clinical isolates. Among them, we showed that the antiaggregant ticagrelor interferes with purine metabolism and changes the surface charge of S. aureus, leading to strong synergies with cationic antibiotics. Overall, this exemplifies the untapped potential of approved non-antibacterial drugs to be repurposed as antibiotic adjuvants.

    "abstract": "Biodosimetry can be used to estimate the fluence of a reactor by determining its ability to inactivate a challenge organism. Especially for small-scale flow-through reactors, inconsistent procedures are reported for bacterial cells. This study aims to develop a standardized, simple procedure for bacterial biodosimetry in flow-through UV systems with relevant biofilm forming bacteria in order to evaluate biofouling control by UV. In particular, the challenge organism, the type of experimental setup and the execution of single steps during biodosimetry with bacterial cells can cause largely deviating results. Since previous work was restricted to model organism, which are not relevant for biofouling, we critically reevaluated all reported steps for the biofilm forming Aquabacterium citratiphilum and identified three main factors for biodosimetry reproducibility in flow-through systems: Protractions of cells from negative controls can heavily impact inactivation efficacy, but can be reduced by ordering samples by decreasing fluence. Further, to avoid photo repair, samples must be processed under red light only. Lastly, biofilm forming bacteria can strongly absorb on plastic labware, which requires counter measures in form of special labware and the addition of surfactants. Overall, the developed protocol provides a biodosimetry standardization for bacterial cells of flow-through systems, facilitating reproducibility and transferability of results between studies that use bacterial cells as challenge organism.\n\nSynopsisBiodosimetry is used to characterize performance of flow-through ultraviolet reactors, but artifacts can occur if not addressed properly.",

    "abstract": "In oocyte biology the zona pellucida has long been known to operate three extracellular functions, namely, encasing the oocytes in ovarian follicles, mediating sperm-oocyte interaction and preventing premature embryo contact with maternal epithelia. The present study uncovers a fourth function that is fundamentally distinct from the other three, being critical for embryonic cell survival. Intriguingly, the three proteins of the mouse zona pellucida (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3) were found abundantly present also inside the embryo four days after fertilization, as shown by mass spectrometry, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Trim-away-mediated knockdown of ZPs in fertilized oocytes resulted in various grades of embryopathy: knockdown of ZP1 impeded blastocyst expansion, knockdown of ZP2 hampered the 2nd zygotic cleavage, while knockdown of ZP3 hampered the 1st zygotic cleavage - unlike the overexpression. Transcriptome analysis of ZP3-knockdown embryos pointed at defects of cytoplasmic translation in the context of embryonic genome activation. This conclusion was supported by reduced protein synthesis in the ZP3-knockdown and by the lack of cleavage arrest when knockdown was postponed from the 1-cell to the late 2-cell stage. These data place constraints on the long-standing notion that the zona pellucida proteins only operate in the extracellular space. We postulate that such noncanonical localization of ZP3 reflect novel roles in the embryos interior during the oocyte-to-embryo transition in mice.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=171 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521410v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18c0ca2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19168aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f784forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143c4b7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neural crest cells are multipotent cells that delaminate from the neuroepithelium, migrating to distant destinations throughout the embryo. Aberrant migration has severe consequences, such as congenital disorders. While animal models have improved our understanding of neural crest anomalies, the in vivo contributions of actin-based protrusions are still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that murine neural crest cells use lamellipodia and filopodia in vivo. Using neural crest-specific knockouts or inhibitors, we show that the serine-threonine kinase, Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3), and the cytoskeletal regulator, Lamellipodin (Lpd), are required for lamellipodia formation whilst preventing focal adhesion maturation. We consequently identified Lpd as a novel substrate of GSK3 and found that phosphorylation of Lpd favours Lpd interactions with the Scar/WAVE complex (lamellipodia formation) at the expense of Ena/VASP protein interactions (adhesion maturation and filopodia formation). All together, we provide an improved understanding of cytoskeletal regulation in mammalian neural crest migration, which has general implications for neural crest anomalies and cancer.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521694v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef8e9eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c3a87org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e67e8corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e269c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mutation rates vary widely along genomes and across inheritance systems. This suggests that complex traits - resulting from the contributions of multiple determinants - might be composite in terms of the underlying mutation rates. Here we investigate through mathematical modeling whether such an heterogeneity may drive changes in a traits architecture, especially in fluctuating environments where phenotypic instability can be beneficial. We first identify a convexity principle, related to the shape of the traits fitness function, setting conditions under which composite architectures should be adaptive or, conversely and more commonly, should be selected against. Simulations reveal, however, that applying this principle to realistic evolving populations requires taking into account pervasive epistatic interactions that take place in the system. Indeed, the fate of a mutation affecting the architecture depends on the (epi)genetic background, itself depending upon the current architecture in the population. We tackle this problem by borrowing the adaptive dynamics framework from evolutionary ecology - where it is routinely used to deal with such resident/mutant dependencies - and find that the principle excluding composite architectures generally prevails. Yet, the predicted evolutionary trajectories will typically depend on the initial architecture, possibly resulting in historical contingencies. Finally, by relaxing the large population size assumption, we unexpectedly find that not only the strength of selection on a traits architecture, but also its direction, depend on population size, revealing a new occurrence of the recently coined phenomenon of  sign inversion.",

    "abstract": "Chargaffs second parity rule (PR-2), where the complementary base and k-mer contents are matching within the same strand of a double stranded DNA (dsDNA), is a phenomenon that invited many explanations. The strict compliance of nearly all nuclear dsDNA to PR-2 implies that the explanation should also be similarly adamant. In this work, we revisited the possibility of mutation rates driving PR-2 compliance. Starting from the assumption-free approach, we constructed kinetic equations for unconstrained simulations. The results were analysed for their PR-2 compliance by employing symbolic regression and machine learning techniques. We arrived to a generalised set of mutation rate interrelations in place in most species that allow for their full PR-2 compliance. Importantly, our constraints explain PR-2 in genomes out of the scope of the prior explanations based on the equilibration under mutation rates with simpler no-strand-bias constraints. We thus reinstate the role of mutation rates in PR-2 through its molecular core, now shown, under our formulation, to be tolerant to previously noted strand biases and incomplete compositional equilibration. We further investigate the time for any genome to reach PR-2, showing that it is generally earlier than the compositional equilibrium, and well within the age of life on Earth.",

Both symbionts were tested in combinations with two common fungus-garden weeds (Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium commune) and the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana in two-choice experiments. Behavioural repellence was found in many, but not all combinations. Larvae and adult females showed an opposite reaction towards the entomopathogen, whereas for Aspergillus sp., neither provoked repellence nor attraction of larvae and adult females, if R. canadensis was used as lure. Our results validate a response of both larvae and adult ambrosia beetles towards other fungal volatiles. Their decision to confront a potential threat or preferably to avoid it could be subject to a more complex context.",

    "abstract": "Spindles are composed of microtubules that must nucleate at the right place and time during mitosis. Spindle microtubule nucleation is regulated by the GTPase Ran, which, through importin-{beta}, releases a gradient of spindle assembly factors (SAFs) centered at chromosomes. Branching MT nucleation generates most spindle MTs and requires the augmin complex. In Xenopus laevis, Ran can control branching through the SAF TPX2, TPX2 is non-essential in other organisms. Thus, how Ran regulates branching MT nucleation in the absence of TPX2 is unknown. Here, we use in vitro pulldowns and TIRF microscopy to show that augmin is itself a SAF. Augmin directly interacts with both importins through two nuclear localization sequences on the Haus8 subunit, which overlap the MT binding site. Moreover, Ran controls localization of augmin to MTs in both Xenopus egg extract and in vitro. By uncovering that RanGTP directly regulates augmin, we demonstrate how Ran controls branching MT nucleation and, thereby, spindle assembly and cell division.",

    "abstract": "The cell cycle checkpoint kinase Mec1ATR and its integral partner Ddc2ATRIP are vital for the DNA damage and replication stress response. Mec1-Ddc2  senses single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by being recruited to the ssDNA binding Replication Protein A (RPA) via Ddc2. In this study, we show that a DNA-damage induced phosphorylation circuit modulates checkpoint recruitment and function. We demonstrate that Ddc2-RPA interactions modulate the association between RPA and ssDNA and that Rfa1-phosphorylation aids in the further recruitment of Mec1-Ddc2. We also uncover an underappreciated role for Ddc2 phosphorylation that enhances its recruitment to RPA-ssDNA that is important for the DNA damage checkpoint in yeast. The crystal structure of a phosphorylated Ddc2 peptide in complex with its RPA interaction domain provides molecular details of how checkpoint recruitment is enhanced, which involves Zn2+. Using electron microscopy and structural modelling approaches, we propose that Mec1-Ddc2 complexes can form higher order assemblies with RPA when Ddc2 is phosphorylated. Together, our results provide insight into Mec1 recruitment and suggest that formation of supramolecular complexes of RPA and Mec1-Ddc2, modulated by phosphorylation, would allow for rapid clustering of damage foci to promote checkpoint signalling.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521831v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@139e23corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133d6e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6198b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1709a73_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIRfa1-S178 phosphorylation promotes Ddc2 recruitment and Ddc2-RPA complexes modulate RPA-ssDNA behaviour.\nC_LIO_LIDdc2 phosphorylation enhances Mec1-Ddc2 recruitment and is important for the DNA damage checkpoint in yeast.\nC_LIO_LIStructure of a Ddc2:RPA complex shows phosphorylation-dependent higher order assemblies stabilised by Zn2+.\nC_LIO_LIWe propose a Mec1-Ddc2 recruitment strategy that allows fast accumulation of Mec1-Ddc2 through DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and promotes autophosphorylation.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microfluidics can split samples into thousands or millions of partitions such as droplets or nanowells. Partitions capture analytes according to a Poisson distribution, and in diagnostics, the analyte concentration is commonly calculated with a closed-form solution via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Here, we present a generalization of MLE with microfluidics, an extension of our previously developed Sparse Poisson Recovery (SPoRe) algorithm, and an in vitro demonstration with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of the new capabilities that SPoRe enables. Many applications such as infection diagnostics require sensitive detection and broad-range multiplexing. Digital PCR coupled with conventional target-specific sensors yields the former but is constrained in multiplexing by the number of available measurement channels (e.g., fluorescence). In our demonstration, we circumvent these limitations by broadly amplifying bacteria with 16S ddPCR and assigning barcodes to nine pathogen genera using only five nonspecific probes. Moreover, we measure only two probes at a time in multiple groups of droplets given our two-channel ddPCR system. Although individual droplets are ambiguous in their bacterial content, our results show that the concentrations of bacteria in the sample can be uniquely recovered given the pooled distribution of partition measurements from all groups. We ultimately achieve stable quantification down to approximately 200 total copies of the 16S gene per sample, enabling a suite of clinical applications given a robust upstream microbial DNA extraction procedure. We develop new theory that generalizes the application of this framework to a broad class of realistic sensors and applications, and we prove scaling rules for system design to achieve further expanded multiplexing. This flexibility means that the core principles and capabilities demonstrated here can generalize to most biosensing applications with microfluidic partitioning.",

Thus, a human lung alveolar interstitium chip was developed to imitate key alveolar microenvironmental factors including: an electrospun nanofibrous membrane as the analogue of the basement membrane for co-culture of epithelial cells with fibroblasts embedded in 3D collagenous gels; physiologically relevant interstitial matrix stiffness; interstitial fluid flow; and 3D breathing-like mechanical stretch.

    "abstract": "DNA sequencing data continues to progress towards longer reads with increasingly lower sequencing error rates. We focus on the critical problem of mapping, or aligning, low-divergence sequences from long reads (PacBio HiFi) to a reference genome, which poses challenges in terms of accuracy and computational resources when using cutting-edge read mapping approaches that are designed for all types of alignments. A natural idea would be to optimize efficiency with longer seeds to reduce the probability of extraneous matches; however, contiguous exact seeds quickly reach a sensitivity limit. We introduce mapquik, a novel strategy that creates accurate longer seeds by anchoring alignments through matches of k consecutively-sampled minimizers (k-min-mers) and only indexing k-min-mers that occur once in the reference genome, thereby unlocking ultra-fast mapping while retaining high sensitivity. We demonstrate that mapquik significantly accelerates the seeding and chaining steps -- fundamental bottlenecks to read mapping -- for both the human and maize genomes with > 96% sensitivity and near-perfect specificity. On the human genome, mapquik achieves a 30x speed-up over the state-of-the-art tool minimap2, and on the maize genome, a 350x speed-up over minimap2, making mapquik the fastest mapper to date. These accelerations are enabled not only by minimizer-space seeding but also a novel heuristic [O](n) pseudo-chaining algorithm, which improves over the long-standing [O](n log n) bound. Minimizer-space computation builds the foundation for achieving real-time analysis of long-read sequencing data.",

While this observation is absolutely stunning, it is very hard to pinpoint structural details to elements of the maps. In order to bridge the gap between observation and explanation, we designed a tool that refines an ensemble of structures into all the maps from variability analysis. Using this bundle of structures, it is easy to spot variable parts of the structure, as well as the parts that are not moving. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations highlight the fact that the movements follow the same directions, albeit with different amplitudes. Ligand can also be investigated using this method.

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic replicative helicase CMG centrally orchestrates the replisome and leads the way at the front of replication forks1. Understanding the motion of CMG on the DNA is therefore key to our understanding of DNA replication. In vivo, CMG is assembled and activated through a cell-cycle-regulated mechanism involving 36 polypeptides that has been reconstituted from purified proteins in ensemble biochemical studies2,3. Conversely, single-molecule studies of CMG motion have thus far4-6 relied on pre-formed CMG assembled through an unknown mechanism upon overexpression of individual constituents7,8. Here, we report the first activation at the single-molecule level of CMG fully reconstituted from purified yeast proteins and the quantification of its motion. We observe that CMG can move on DNA in two ways: by unidirectional translocation and by diffusion. We demonstrate that CMG preferentially exhibits unidirectional translocation in the presence of ATP, whereas it preferentially exhibits diffusive motion in the absence of ATP. We also demonstrate that nucleotide binding halts diffusive CMG. Taken together, our findings support a mechanism by which nucleotide binding allows newly assembled CMG to engage with the DNA within its central channel without melting it, halting its diffusion and facilitating the initial DNA melting required to initiate DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Human memory is selective and not all experiences are remembered. Both monetary rewards/incentives and curiosity have been found to motivate and facilitate learning by dopaminergic midbrain projections to the hippocampus during encoding. In this study, we examined potential brain mechanisms during early consolidation period that jointly or independently contribute to these facilitating effects. Participants (N = 50) watched 36 videos of magic tricks and rated their \"subjective feelings of curiosity\" while the availability of extrinsic incentives was manipulated between groups. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired before, during, and after learning, and memory for magic tricks was assessed one week after. Our analysis focused on the change in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the dopaminergic midbrain and the anterior hippocampus, a dopaminergic consolidation mechanism previously reported in the context of extrinsically motivated learning. Changes in RSFC were correlated with behavioural measures of learning, i.e., the total number of items encoded and the curiosity-driven memory benefit. We found that brain-behaviour correlations differed depending on the availability of extrinsic incentives. More specifically, the correlation between the total number of items encoded and RSFC change was significantly different in the incentivised compared to the control group. The curiosity-driven memory benefit, however, did not correlate with changes in RSFC in either of the groups. In sum, this suggests that curiosity-motivated learning might be supported by different consolidation mechanisms compared to extrinsically motivated learning and that extrinsic incentives influence consolidation mechanisms supporting learning.\n\nKey pointsO_LIA new curiosity-motivated incidental encoding paradigm was used to investigate how dopaminergic consolidation mechanisms support learning and whether this is further influenced by the availability of monetary incentives.\nC_LIO_LIChanges in resting-state functional connectivity between the dopaminergic midbrain and the anterior hippocampus, a dopaminergic consolidation mechanism, predicted learning outcomes significantly differently if monetary incentives were available.\nC_LIO_LIThese results might suggest that learning motivated by curiosity might rely on different neural mechanisms during early consolidation than learning motivated by monetary incentives.\nC_LI",

To address potential representational dynamics, we probed the mutual information between M1 signals recorded across the cortical sheet and electromyography (EMG) activity from a set of muscles while a macaque monkey performed planar reaches. Here, we demonstrated that the spatial organization of the M1 encoding was in fact quite dynamic throughout the course of a reaching movement such that a given cortical site maximally encoded different muscles at different times. Despite these rapid representational changes, a proximal-to-distal gradient of the upper limb representation was preserved particularly close to movement onset. Representation was most stable close to movement onset, with characteristic topographic maps, possibly serving functional needs.

In the current study we tested the hypothesis that increasing the salience of environmental cues would be most effective in improving impulse control, as assessed in a stop-signal task, in subjects with low environmental susceptibility as indexed by low pre-stimulus EEG alpha power. In addition, we anticipated that an external-reward intervention improves performance during a Go/No go task, especially in individuals with low task-induced motivation as indexed by low theta/ beta power ratios. High salience of stop signals enhanced stopping performance but there was no difference in responsivity to the salience intervention between participants with high and low EEG alpha power. Individuals with low theta/ beta power ratios responded more accurately when rewards were at stake. Together these results suggest that increasing the salience of external cues may help impulse control in general, whereas the effectiveness of external-reward interventions is higher in individuals with low task-induced motivation.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control deficits are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and may explain how reminders of past traumatic events intrude upon daily experiences of people who have experienced trauma. Lateralized somatomotor beta-band desynchronization, an electrophysiological signature of controlled movement, indexes the downstream output of cognitive control processes. Recent evidence suggests that somatomotor beta activity does not manifest as rhythmic oscillations, but instead as discrete and stochastic burst-like events. Here, we quantified the rates of lateralized somatomotor beta bursts (beta burst rates; BBR) evoked during a flanker cognitive control paradigm among United States military veterans from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom (OEF/OIF) who show varying degrees of PTSD. We found BBR reflected both response direction and conflict monitoring during processing of stimuli that evoked response conflict. Impaired behavioral performance and increased peri-response BBR were related to greater posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS). Critically, increased BBR mediated the link between PTSS and decreased conflict monitoring accuracy. Results suggest that poor cognitive control in PTSS reflects a failure to adaptively disinhibit target motor representations, rather than a failure to inhibit distractor representations. Thus, BBR reveal limited representation of target stimuli as a primary contributor to impaired cognitive control in PTSD. Because BBR were robustly associated with behavioral performance and exhibited high statistical reliability the index may carry utility for appraising individual differences in cognitive control in other brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Axon integrity is essential for functional connectivity in the nervous system. The degeneration of stressed or damaged axons is a common and sometimes initiating event in neurodegenerative disorders. Cellular factors that preserve axon integrity have an important influence on the fate of a damaged axon. Stathmin-2 (Stmn2) is an axon maintenance factor that is depleted in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and replenishment of Stmn2 can restore neurite outgrowth in diseased neurons. Stathmins have a well-documented role in microtubule dynamics during neurodevelopment, yet mechanisms responsible for Stmn2-mediated axon maintenance in injured neurons are not known. We demonstrate that membrane association of Stmn2 is critical for its axon-protective activity. Axonal enrichment of Stmn2 is driven by palmitoylation as well as tubulin interaction. We discover that another Stathmin, Stmn3, co-migrates with Stmn2-containing vesicles and undergoes regulated degradation through DLK-JNK signaling. The Stmn2 membrane targeting domain is both necessary and sufficient for localization to a specific vesicle population and confers sensitivity to DLK-dependent degradation. Our findings reveal a broader role for DLK in tuning the local abundance of palmitoylated Stathmins in axon segments. Moreover, palmitoylation is a critical component of Stathmin-mediated axon protection and defining the Stmn2-containing vesicle population will provide important clues toward mechanisms of axon maintenance.",

    "abstract": "In the retina, microglia are resident immune cells that are essential for retinal development and function. Retinal microglia play a central role in mediating pathological degeneration in diseases such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, age-related neurodegeneration, ischemic retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy. Current models of mature human retinal organoids (ROs) derived from iPS cell (hiPSC) do not contain resident microglia integrated into retinal layers. Increasing cellular diversity in ROs by including resident microglia would more accurately represent the native retina and better model diseases in which microglia play a key role. In this study, we develop a new 3D in vitro tissue model of microglia-containing retinal organoids by co-culturing ROs and hiPSC-derived macrophage precursor cells (MPCs). We optimized the parameters for successful integration of MPCs into retinal organoids. We then reproducibly integrate MPCs into ROs where they develop into mature microglia (iMG) as seen by 1) migration to the appropriate anatomical locations; 2) development of a mature resting morphology; and 3) expression of mature microglial markers. We show that while in the ROs, MPCs migrate to the equivalent of the outer plexiform layer where retinal microglia cells reside in healthy retinal tissue. While there, they develop a mature morphology characterized by small cell bodies and long branching processes which is only observed in vivo. During this maturation process these microglia cycle through an activated phase followed by a stable mature phase characterized by cell-type specific microglia markers Tmem119 and P2ry12. This co-culture system may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of retinal diseases involving retinal microglia and for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Clinical interpretation of copy number variants (CNVs) is a complex process that requires skilled clinical professionals. General recommendations have been recently released to guide the CNV interpretation based on predefined criteria to uniform the decision process. Several semiautomatic computational methods have been proposed to recommend appropriate choices, relieving the clinicians from the tedious search in vast genomic databases. We have developed and evaluated such a tool called MarCNV and tested it on CNV records collected from the ClinVar database. Alternatively, the emerging machine learning-based tools, such as the recently published ISV (Interpretation of Structural Variants), showed promising ways of even fully automated predictions using wider characterization of affected genomic elements. Such tools utilize features that are additional to ACMG criteria, thus, they have the potential to significantly improve and/or provide supportive evidence for accurate CNV classification. Since both approaches contribute to evaluation of CNVs clinical impact, we propose a combined solution in the form of a decision support tool based on automated ACMG guidelines (MarCNV) supplemented by a machine learning-based pathogenicity prediction (ISV) for classification of CNVs. We provide evidence that such a combined approach is able to reduce the number of uncertain classifications and reveal potentially incorrect classifications using automated guidelines. CNV interpretation using MarCNV, ISV, and combined approach is available for non-commercial use at https://predict.genovisio.com/.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPacBio high fidelity (HiFi) sequencing reads are both long (15-20 kb) and highly accurate (>Q20). Because of these properties, they have revolutionised genome assembly leading to more accurate and contiguous genomes. In eukaryotes the mitochondrial genome is sequenced alongside the nuclear genome often at very high coverage. A dedicated tool for mitochondrial genome assembly using HiFi reads is still missing.\n\nResultsMitoHiFi was developed within the Darwin Tree of Life Project to assemble mitochondrial genomes from the HiFi reads generated for target species. The input for MitoHiFi is either the raw reads or the assembled contigs, and the tool outputs a mitochondrial genome sequence fasta file along with annotation of protein and RNA genes. Variants arising from heteroplasmy are assembled independently, and nuclear insertions of mitochondrial sequences are identified and not used in organellar genome assembly. MitoHiFi has been used to assemble 374 mitochondrial genomes (369 from 12 phyla and 39 orders of Metazoa and from 6 species of Fungi) for the Darwin Tree of Life Project, the Vertebrate Genomes Project and the Aquatic Symbiosis Genome Project. Inspection of 60 mitochondrial genomes assembled with MitoHiFi for species that already have reference sequences in public databases showed the widespread presence of previously unreported repeats.\n\nConclusionsMitoHiFi is able to assemble mitochondrial genomes from a wide phylogenetic range of taxa from Pacbio HiFi data. MitoHiFi is written in python and is freely available on github (https://github.com/marcelauliano/MitoHiFi). MitoHiFi is available with its dependencies as a singularity image on github (ghcr.io/marcelauliano/mitohifi:master).",

    "abstract": "I.During morphogenesis, epithelial monolayers actively alter their shape to create future body parts of the animal; this makes the epithelium one of the most active and critical structures in early animal development. Even though epithelial cells exist and move in three dimensions, mathematical models frequently describe them as merely two-dimensional. However, recent imaging technology has begun to reveal pertinent dynamics in the third dimension of the tissue. With the importance of the third dimension in mind, we have developed a self-sculpting, three-dimensional model of epithelia whose dynamics are driven by active forces on its surface. We present a first, fundamental study for a reduced version of epithelia that investigates how surface forces affect its internal dynamics. Our model captures the 3D slab-like geometry of epithelia, viscoelasticity of tissue response, fluid surroundings, and driving from active surface forces. We represent epithelial tissue as a thick slab, a 3D continuum comprised of a Stokes fluid with an extra viscoelastic stress. Employing this model, we present both analytical and numerical solutions of the system and make quantitative predictions about cell shapes, cell dynamics, and the tissues response to surface force in a three-dimensional setting. In particular, we elucidate the initiation of ventral furrow invagination and T1 transitions in Drosophila embryogenesis. In the former, we demonstrate the importance of fluid and geometric surroundings to drive invagination. In the latter, we show the limitations of surface forces alone to drive T1 transitions.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Preclinical studies to research and validate therapeutic interventions for CVD often depend on two-dimensional histological surveys. The use of light sheet fluorescent microscopy together with optical clearing methods amenable to immunofluorescent staining are recent advances, all of which deliver detailed three-dimensional rendering of vessels. This offers the ability to describe and quantify features critical in CVD models, specifically, atherosclerotic plaque burden in atherosclerotic animal models. The main challenge for this approach remains the lengthy, hands-on, analysis time. Labkit is a user-friendly Fiji plugin that applies a machine-learning algorithm to create three-dimensional renderings from large microscopy data. The application of this plugin is expected to decrease the hands-on analysis time required to generate accurate volumetric renderings of atherosclerotic plaque burden in athero-prone mice. For analysis, Ldlr -/- (C57/Bl6) mice aged 6-8 weeks were fed a high-fat diet for 15 weeks to allow the development of atherosclerotic plaque along the aorta. Aged-matched chow-fed C57/Bl6 mice were used as athero-free controls. Aortic roots were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or oil red o stains, and later imaged and analyzed using ImageJ. AdipoClear and immunolabeling together with light-sheet fluorescent microscopy allowed for three-dimensional visualization. Both Imaris software v9.9.1 and the built-in bridge to ImageJ/Labkit were used to quantify the plaque burden in the mice manually or automatically, respectively. Our findings indicate that Labkit offers an effective and user-friendly platform for the segmentation of atherosclerotic plaque in aortas.",

    "abstract": "The investigation of spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has recently been extended from the brain to the spinal cord, where it has stimulated interest from a clinical perspective. A number of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated robust functional connectivity between the time series of BOLD fluctuations in bilateral dorsal horns and between those in bilateral ventral horns, in line with the functional neuroanatomy of the spinal cord. A necessary step prior to extension to clinical studies is assessing the reliability of such resting-state signals, which we aimed to do here in a group of 45 healthy young adults at the clinically prevalent field strength of 3T. When investigating connectivity in the entire cervical spinal cord, we observed fair to good reliability for dorsal-dorsal and ventral-ventral connectivity, whereas reliability was poor for within- and between-hemicord dorsal-ventral connectivity. Considering how prone spinal cord fMRI is to noise, we extensively investigated the impact of distinct noise sources and made two crucial observations: removal of physiological noise led to a reduction in functional connectivity strength and reliability - due to the removal of stable and participant-specific noise patterns - whereas removal of thermal noise considerably increased the detectability of functional connectivity without a clear influence on reliability. Finally, we also assessed connectivity within spinal cord segments and observed that while the pattern of connectivity was similar to that of whole cervical cord, reliability at the level of single segments was consistently poor. Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of reliable resting-state functional connectivity in the human spinal cord even after thoroughly accounting for physiological and thermal noise, but at the same time urge caution if focal changes in connectivity (e.g. due to segmental lesions) are to be studied, especially in a longitudinal manner.",

    "abstract": "Autophagosome formation is the hallmark of macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) and requires the covalent conjugation of LC3 proteins (or Atg8 in yeast) to the amino headgroup of PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) lipids. Atg3 is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step of this reaction by transferring LC3 from an LC3-Atg3 intermediate to PEs in targeted membranes. Here, we determine the solution structure of human Atg3 (hAtg3) and demonstrate that the catalytically important regions of hAtg3 are conformationally dynamic. Furthermore, we reveal that these regions and hAtg3s N-terminal membrane curvature-sensing amphipathic helix concurrently interact with the membrane. These structural studies indicate that hAtg3 exploits a multifaceted membrane-association mechanism to position its catalytic center at the membrane surface and to bring the reaction substrates of LC3 and PE lipids to proximity for effective LC3-PE conjugation. In addition, our studies demonstrate that the interaction of the His266 residue with the membrane is primarily responsible for hAtg3s pH-dependent activity. Our investigations advance an emerging concept that the interactions of Atg3 with the highly curved membrane rims of the phagophore spatially regulate autophagosome biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Adipocytes regulate tissues through production of adipokines that can act both locally and systemically. Adipocytes also have been found to play a critical role in regulating the healing process. To better understand this role, we developed a 3D human adipocyte spheroid system that has an adipokine profile similar to in vivo adipose tissues. Previously, we found that conditioned medium from these spheroids induces human dermal fibroblast conversion into highly contractile, collagen producing myofibroblasts through a transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-{beta}1) independent pathway. Here, we sought to identify how mature adipocytes signal to dermal fibroblasts through adipokines to induce myofibroblast conversion. By using molecular weight fractionation, heat inactivation, and lipid depletion, we determined mature adipocytes secrete a factor that is 30-100 kDa, heat labile, and lipid associated that induces myofibroblast conversion. We also show that depletion of the adipokine adiponectin, which fits those physiochemical parameters, eliminates the ability of adipocyte conditioned media to induce fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion. Interestingly, native adiponectin secreted by cultured adipocytes consistently elicited a stronger level of -SMA expression than exogenously added adiponectin. Thus, adiponectin secreted by mature adipocytes induces fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion and may lead to a phenotype of myofibroblasts distinct from TGF-{beta}1 induced myofibroblasts.",

It separates ions according to their size and shape in the gas phase. Here, we set out to investigate the effect of 22 different post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the collision cross section (CCS) of peptides. In total, we analyzed [~]4700 pairs of matching modified and unmodified peptide ions by trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS). Linear alignment based on spike-in reference peptides resulted in highly reproducible CCS values with a median coefficient of variation of 0.3%. On a global level, we observed a redistribution in the m/z vs. ion mobility space for modified peptides upon changes in their charge state. Pairwise comparison between modified and unmodified peptides of the same charge state revealed median shifts in CCS between - 1.1% (lysine formylation) and +4.5% (O-GlcNAcylation). In general, increasing modified peptide masses were correlated with higher CCS values, in particular within homologous PTM series. However, investigating the ion populations in more detail, we found that the change in CCS can vary substantially for a given PTM depending on the gas phase structure of its unmodified counterpart. In conclusion, our study shows PTM- and sequence-specific effects on the cross section of peptides, which could be further leveraged for proteome-wide PTM analysis.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of neurological diseases with impaired motor functioning of the upper extremities are accompanied by impairments of somatosensory functioning, which are often undescribed but can provide crucial information for diagnostics, treatment selection, and follow-up. Therefore, a reliable description of the functional representation of the digits in the somatosensory cortex would be a highly valuable, but currently lacking, tool in the clinical context. Task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of passive tactile stimulation provides an indirect, but valid description of the layout of the digit map in the primary somatosensory cortex. However, to fulfill the specific requirements for clinical application, the presently established approaches need to be adapted and subsequently assessed for feasibility and retest reliability, in order to provide informative parameters for the description of the evoked digit activations. Accordingly, the present high-field 3T fMRI study compares the performance of two established digit mapping designs - travelling wave (TW) and blocked design (BD) - for passive tactile stimulation of the five digits, adapted to reduce the time requirements to just below 15 minutes. To be able to assess the retest reliability unaffected by any clinical conditions, the study was performed on neurotypical participants. The results show that both stimulation designs evoke significant and distinct activation clusters in the primary somatosensory cortex of all participants for all five digits. The average spatial locations of the center of gravities across participants show the common succession of distinct digit representation along the central sulcus. The cortical extent elicited activation, which is generally larger for the thumb and the index finger, also shows comparable average values across the two approaches. Less overlap of activation between neighboring digits was obtained in BD, consistent with the distinct single digit neuronal representations. A high retest reliability was obtained for the location of the digit activation, displaying stable center of gravity locations across sessions for both stimulation designs. This is contrasted by only medium to low retest reliability for the extent and overlap of the digit activations, indicating discrepancies across sessions. These results demonstrate the capacity of shortened fMRI digit mapping approaches (both TW and BD) to obtain the full layout of single digit cortical activations on the level of the individual, which together with the high reliability of the location of the digit representation over time indicates both approaches are clinically applicable.",
