    "abstract": "Natural selection is commonly assumed to act on extensive standing genetic variation. Yet, accumulating evidence highlights the role of mutational processes creating this genetic variation: to become evolutionarily successful, adaptive mutants must not only reach fixation, but also emerge in the first place, i.e. have a high enough mutation rate relative to the population size.\n\nHere, we use numerical simulations to investigate how mutational biases impact our ability to observe rare mutational pathways in the laboratory and to predict outcomes in experimental evolution. We find the number of available mutations and the unevenness of their mutation rates to increase, sometimes impractically, the experimental effort required to discover all of them. Thus, most experimental studies lack power to directly observe the full range of adaptive mutations.\n\nModelling mutation rates as a distribution, we show that a substantially larger target size ensures that a pathway mutates more commonly. Therefore, we predict that commonly mutated pathways are conserved between closely related species, contrary to rare pathways. This approach formalizes our proposal that most mutations have a lower mutation rate than the average mutation rate measured experimentally. We suggest that the extent of genetic variation is overestimated when based on the average mutation rate.",

    "abstract": "Mollusca is the second-largest animal phylum with over 100,000 species among eight distinct taxonomic classes. Across 1000 living species in the class Polyplacophora, chitons have a relatively constrained morphology but with some notable deviations. Several genera possess \"shell eyes\", true eyes with a lens and retina that are embedded within the dorsal shells, which represent the most recent evolution of animal eyes. The phylogeny of major chiton clades is mostly well established, in a set of superfamily and higher-level taxa supported by various approaches including multiple gene markers, mitogenome-phylogeny and phylotranscritomic approaches as well as morphological studies. However, one critical lineage has remained unclear: Schizochiton was controversially suggested as a potential independent origin of chiton shell eyes. Here, with the draft genome sequencing of Schizochiton incisus (superfamily Schizochitonoidea) plus assembly of transcriptome data from other polyplacophorans, we present phylogenetic reconstructions using both mitochondrial genomes and phylogenomic approaches with multiple methods. Phylogenetic trees from mitogenomic data are inconsistent, reflecting larger scale confounding factors in molluscan mitogenomes. A consistent robust topology was generated with protein coding genes using different models and methods. Our results support Schizochitonoidea is a sister group to other Chitonoidea in Chitonina, in agreement with established classification. This suggests that the earliest origin of shell eyes is in Schizochitonoidea, which were also gained secondarily in other genera in Chitonoidea. Our results have generated a holistic review of the internal relationship within Polyplacophora, and a better understanding on the evolution of Polyplacophora.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between ecological processes and the evolutionary dynamics of quantitative traits in natural systems remains a major challenge. Two main theoretical frameworks are used to address this question, adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics, both of which have strengths and limitations and are often used by distinct research communities to address different questions. In order to make progress, new theoretical developments are needed that integrate these approaches and strengthen the link to empirical data. Here, we discuss a novel theoretical framework that bridges the gap between quantitative genetics and adaptive dynamics approaches. \"Oligomorphic dynamics\" can be used to analyse eco-evolutionary dynamics across different time scales and extends quantitative genetics theory to account for multimodal trait distributions, the dynamical nature of genetic variance, the potential for disruptive selection due to ecological feed-backs, and the non-normal or skewed trait distributions encountered in nature. Oligomorphic dynamics explicitly takes into account the effect of environmental feedback, such as frequency- and density-dependent selection, on the dynamics of multi-modal trait distributions and we argue it has the potential to facilitate a much tighter integration between eco-evolutionary theory and empirical data.",

    "abstract": "Variation in political preferences is increasingly understood to stem from both environmental influences and genetics. Research has argued that a possible pathway for genetic effects on ideology is via cognitive performance, showing a genetic overlap between the traits. Yet, an unambiguous link between cognitive performance and economic policy preferences remains elusive, with results ranging from negative to positive effects on economic conservatism. In this study, I argue that this heterogeneity reflects an underlying gene-by-environment interaction. I depart from the assumption that cognitive performance, rather than being directly connected to a set of policy preferences, influences the capacity to correctly optimize those preferences. Combined with insights from standard models in political economics, this leads to the proposal that genetics associated with cognitive performance should cause more left-wing economic preferences if you grow up in relative poverty, but more right-wing preferences if you grow up in relative affluence. Utilizing variation in a polygenic index of cognitive performance within dizygotic twin pairs, coupled with unique register data on economic conditions for both the twins, their parents, and their childhood neighborhood, I show that the effect of the PGI on a finegrained measure of economic conservatism is zero on average, but indeed sizable and sign-discordant by class background. To my knowledge, this represents the first sign-discordant GxE finding for a socially relevant outcome, which has implications for future social science research using PGIs.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed the effects of walking freely in Virtual Reality (VR) compared to walking in the real-world on dynamic balance and postural control. For this purpose nine male and twelve female healthy participants underwent standard 3D gait analysis while walking randomly in a real laboratory and in a room-scale overground VR environment resembling the real laboratory. The VR was delivered to participants by a head-mounted-display which was operated wirelessly and calibrated to the real-world. Dynamic balance was assessed with three outcomes: the Margin of Stability (MOS) in the anteroposterior (AP-MOS) and mediolateral (ML-MOS) directions at initial-contact, the relationship between the mediolateral Center of Mass (COM) position and acceleration at mid-stance with subsequent step width, and trunk kinematics during the entire gait cycle. We observed increased mediolateral (ML) trunk linear velocity variability, an increased coupling of the COM position and acceleration with subsequent step width, and a decrease in AP-MOS while walking in VR, but no change in ML-MOS when walking in VR. We conclude that walking in VR results in a less reliable optical flow, indicated by increased mediolateral trunk kinematic variability, which seems to be compensated by the participants by slightly reweighing sensorimotor input and thereby consciously tightening the coupling between the COM and foot placement to avoid a loss of balance. Our results are particularly valuable for future developers who want to use VR to support gait analysis and rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic clustering is a versatile method to control protein activity in living cells, tissues, and organisms. Here we show that the BcLOV4 photoreceptor both clusters and translocates to the plasma membrane in response to blue light, representing a new class of light-dependent behavior. We demonstrate that dual translocation and clustering can be harnessed for novel single-component optogenetic tools, including for activation of the entire family of epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1-4) tyrosine kinases. We further find that clustering and membrane translocation are causally linked. Stronger clustering increased the magnitude of translocation and downstream signaling, increased sensitivity to light by ~3-4-fold, and decreased the expression levels needed for strong signal activation. Thus light-induced clustering of BcLOV4 provides a strategy to generate a new class of optogenetic tools and to enhance existing ones.",

    "abstract": "Mandible subcondylar fractures have very high complication rate, yet there is no consensus in a suitable plate design for optimal patient outcomes. The present study is aimed at understanding the subcondylar fracture fixation by comparing load transfer in intact and reconstructed fractured mandibles with five different plates: single mini, trapezoid, lambda, strut, and double-mini plates under the complete mastication cycle. Under contralateral molar occlusion (LMOL), the single mini plate resulted in the highest strains. On the contrary, during ipsilateral molar clenching (RMOL), the tensile and compressive strain distributions were found to be reversed, with the tensile strains at the posterior border resulting in lesser strain in reconstructed mandible with single mini plate. Owing to the reduced strains in the reconstructed mandibles, the contralateral molar clenching task is preferred during the immediate post-surgery period for patients. Under this contralateral molar clenching, the peak von Mises stresses in the plate decreased with increase in the number of screws. Furthermore, the presence of two arms seems beneficial to neutralise the tensile and compressive strains across load cases. Consequently, double mini and trapezoid plates were found to perform better as compared to single mini plate during the entire mastication cycle for subcondylar fracture fixation.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGenerative models for protein sequences are important for protein design, mutational effect prediction and structure prediction. In all of these tasks, the introduction of models which include interactions between pairs of positions has had a major impact over the last decade. More recently, many methods going beyond pairwise models have been developed, for example by using neural networks that are in principle able to capture interactions between more than two positions from multiple sequence alignments. However, not much is known about the inter-dependency patterns between positions in these models, and how important higher-order interactions involving more than two positions are for their performance. In this work, we introduce the notion of mean dimension for generative models for protein sequences, which measures the average number of positions involved in interactions when weighted by their contribution to the total variance in log probability of the model. We estimate the mean dimension for different model classes trained on different protein families, relate it to the performance of the models on mutational effect prediction tasks and also trace its evolution during training. The mean dimension is related to the performance of models in biological prediction tasks and can highlight differences between model classes even if their performance in the prediction task is similar. The overall low mean dimension indicates that well-performing models are not necessarily of high complexity and encourages further work in interpreting their performance in biological terms.",

    "abstract": "Covalent drug discovery, in particular targeting reactive cysteines, has undergone a resurgence over the past two decades, demonstrated by recent clinical successes of covalent inhibitors for high-priority cancer targets. Reactive cysteine profiling, first pioneered by the Cravatt lab, has emerged in parallel as a powerful approach for proteome-wide on- and off-target profiling. Thus far however, structural analysis of liganded cysteines has been restricted to experimentally determined protein structures. We combined AlphaFold-predicted amino acid side chain accessibilities for >95% of the human proteome with a meta-analysis of thirteen public cysteine profiling datasets, totalling 40,070 unique cysteine residues, revealing accessibility biases in sampled cysteines primarily dictated by warhead chemistry. Analysis of >3.5 million cysteine-fragment interactions further suggests that exposed cysteine residues are preferentially targeted by elaborated fragments and drug-like compounds. We finally propose a framework for benchmarking coverage of ligandable cysteines in future cysteine profiling approaches, considering both selectivity for high-priority residues and quantitative depth. All analysis and produced resources (freely available at www.github.com/TateLab) are readily extendable to reactive amino acids beyond cysteine, and related questions in chemical biology.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) imaging with high-throughput is invaluable to fast and high-precision profiling in a wide range of biomedical applications. However, prevalent SR methods require sophisticated acquisition devices and specific imaging control, and may cost a fairly long time on a single field-of-view. These essentially increase the construction difficulty, including challenges in imaging throughput, system establishment, and automation. Using the natural photophysics of fluorescence, fluctuation-based microscopy techniques can routinely break the diffraction limit with no need for additional optical components, but its long acquisition time still poses a challenge for high-throughput imaging or visualizing transient organelle dynamics. Here, we propose an SR method based on the Auto-Correlation with two-step Deconvolution (SACD) that reduces the number of frames required by maximizing the detectable fluorescence fluctuation behavior in each measurement, with further removal of tunable parameters by a Fourier ring correlation analysis. It only needs 20 frames for twofold lateral and axial resolution improvements, while the SR optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) needs more than 1000 frames. By capturing raw images for [~]10 minutes, we record an SR image with [~]128 nm resolution that contains 2.4 gigapixels covering an area of [~]2.0 mm x 1.4 mm, including more than 2,000 cells. Beyond that, by applying continuity and sparsity joint constraint, the Sparse deconvolution-assisted SACD enables 4D live-cell SR imaging of events such as mitochondrial fission and fusion. Overall, as an open-sourced module, we anticipate SACD can offer direct access to SR, which may facilitate the biology studies of cells and organisms with high-throughput and low-cost.",

The mesoscopic dynamics of these assemblies have been widely characterized, but their behavior at the molecular scale has remained more elusive.

The dense phase is 1000 times more concentrated and has 300 times higher bulk viscosity than the dilute phase. However, single-molecule spectroscopy in individual droplets reveals that the polypeptide chains are remarkably dynamic, with sub-microsecond reconfiguration times. We rationalize this behavior with large-scale all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations, which reveal an unexpectedly similar short-range molecular environment in the dense and dilute phases, suggesting that local biochemical processes and interactions can remain exceedingly rapid in phase-separated systems.",

At the same time, NS2B also involves in remodeling the NS3 protease structure. In isolation, we previously proved the NS2B cytosolic domain (residues 49-95) as a disordered type peptide conformation. Further, this study investigated the overall dynamics of NS2B full-length protein. Our Alphafold2 structure modeling system revealed surprising similarities between selected flavivirus NS2B proteins. This similarity reflects that the NS2B protein across flavivirus is conserved fold-wise. The MD simulation of Zika virus NS2B full-length protein shows that the cytosolic domain as a part of full-length protein is a disorder region supporting our previous experimental finding, which suggests the disordered nature of the cytosolic domain in isolation. Since the cytosolic domain of NS2B is essential for protease activity, we have also investigated the folding and dynamics of the NS2B cytosolic domain (residues 49-95) that shows the disorder to alpha helix transition in TFE. On the other hand, in the presence of SDS, macromolecular crowder like ficoll and PEG do not induce secondary structural change.

However, what makes a tumor cell respond to signaling cues differently from a normal cell is not well understood. In the Drosophila ovarian follicle cells, apicobasal-polarity loss induces heterogenous epithelial multilayering. When exacerbated by oncogenic-Notch expression, this multilayer displays an increased consistency in the occurrence of morphologically distinguishable cells adjacent to the polar follicle cells. Polar cells release the Jak-STAT ligand Unpaired (Upd), in response to which, neighboring polarity-deficient cells exhibit a precursor-like transcriptomic state. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we discovered the ectopic activation of the Snail-family transcription factor Escargot (Esg) in these cells. We also characterized similar relationship between Upd and Esg during early follicular development, where the establishment of polarity determines follicle-cell differentiation.

    "abstract": "An active metabolite of buprenorphine (BUP), called norbuprenorphine (NorBUP), is implicated in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome when BUP is taken during pregnancy. Therefore, reducing or eliminating metabolism of BUP to NorBUP is a novel strategy that will likely lower total fetal exposure to opioids and thus improve offspring outcomes. Precision deuteration alters pharmacokinetics of drugs without altering pharmacodynamics. Here, we report the synthesis and testing of deuterated buprenorphine (BUP-D2). We determined opioid receptor affinities of BUP-D2 relative to BUP with radioligand competition receptor binding assays, and the potency and efficacy of BUP-D2 relative to BUP to activate G-proteins via opioid receptors with [35S]GTP{gamma}S binding assays in homogenates containing the human mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors. The antinociceptive effects of BUP-D2 and BUP were compared using the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in rats. Blood concentration versus time profiles of BUP, BUP-D2, and NorBUP were measured in rats following intravenous BUP-D2 or BUP injection. The synthesis provided a 48% yield and the product was [&ge;]99% deuterated. Like BUP, BUP-D2 had sub-nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors. BUP-D2 also activated opioid receptors and induced antinociception with equal potency and efficacy as BUP. The maximum concentration and the area under the curve of NorBUP in the blood of rats that received BUP-D2 were over 19- and 10-fold lower, respectively, than in rats that received BUP. These results indicate that BUP-D2 retains key pharmacodynamic properties of BUP and resists metabolism to NorBUP and therefore holds promise as an alternative to BUP.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520120v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ada60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@76f7d0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@878228org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@723131_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesInflammatory myopathy or myositis is a heterogeneous family of immune-mediated diseases including dermatomyositis (DM), antisynthetase syndrome (AS), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can also cause myositis (ICI-myositis). This study was designed to define gene expression patterns in muscle biopsies from patients with ICI-myositis.\n\nMethodsBulk RNA sequencing was performed on 200 muscle biopsies (35 ICI-myositis, 44 DM, 18 AS, 54 IMNM, 16 IBM, and 33 normal muscle biopsies) and single nuclei RNA sequencing was performed on 22 muscle biopsies (7 ICI-myositis, 4 DM, 3 AS, 6 IMNM, and 2 IBM).\n\nResultsUnsupervised clustering defined three distinct transcriptomic subsets of ICI-myositis: ICI-DM, ICI-MYO1, and ICI-MYO2. ICI-DM included patients with DM and anti-TIF1{gamma} autoantibodies who, like DM patients, overexpressed type 1 interferon-inducible genes. ICI-MYO1 patients had highly inflammatory muscle biopsies and included all patients that developed co-existing myocarditis. ICI-MYO2 was composed of patients with predominant necrotizing pathology and low levels of muscle inflammation. The type 2 interferon pathway was activated both in ICI-DM and ICI-MYO1. Unlike the other types of myositis, all three subsets of ICI-myositis patients overexpressed genes involved in the IL6 pathway.\n\nConclusionsWe identified three distinct types of ICI-myositis based on transcriptomic analyses. The IL6 pathway was overexpressed in all groups, the type I interferon pathway activation was specific for ICI-DM, the type 2 IFN pathway was overexpressed in both ICIDM and ICI-MYO1, and only ICI-MYO1 patients developed myocarditis.",

    "abstract": "In most eukaryotes, the number of meiotic crossovers (COs) is limited to 1-3 per chromosome, which are prevented from occurring close to one another by CO interference. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an exception to this general rule, lacks CO interference and seems to have the highest CO number per chromosome. However, global CO frequency was indirectly estimated in this species, raising doubts about this exceptional recombination level. Here, we used an innovative strategy to directly determine COs genome-wide in S. pombe. We confirm the absence of crossover interference and reveal the presence of co-variation in CO number across chromosomes within tetrads, suggesting that a limiting pro-CO factor varies stochastically between meiocytes. CO number per chromosome varies linearly with chromosome size, with the three chromosomes having, on average, 15.9, 12.5, and 7.0 COs, respectively. This is significantly lower than previous estimates but reinforces S. pombes exceptional status as the eukaryote with the highest CO number per chromosome described to date and among the species with the highest rate of COs per unit of DNA.",

    "abstract": "A commercial breeding programme in Atlantic salmon utilises a four-year generation interval with four parallel breeding populations. In this study, we develop a computer simulation of a salmon breeding programme and explore the impact of gene flow between the parallel year groups on the accuracy of genomic prediction within and between breeding lines. We simulated four parallel lines for 10 discrete generations with random selection and different mixing rates between parallel year groups. The genetic distance between fish (as a measure of diversity) and the accuracy of estimated genomic breeding values were used as criteria of comparison. With no mixing the genetic distance increased between populations, the genetic variation within populations decreased and there was no increase in accuracy when combining data across populations. Even a low percentage of mixing decreased the genetic distance between populations and increased the genetic variation within populations. The higher the percentage of mixing the faster the lines became more similar. The accuracy of prediction climbed as the percentage of mixing increased. The increase in accuracy from the combined evaluation approach compared to the within evaluation approach was greater with an increased percentage of mixing. In conclusion, if there is no gene flow between populations the lines drift apart and there is no value in combining information across populations for genomic breeding value prediction. Only a low amount of mixing between lines brings the lines closer together and facilitates the use of information across lines to improve breeding value prediction. Optimising gene flow between lines should be an integral part of salmon breeding programme design.",

    "abstract": "The Pahenu2 mutation in C57BL/6J mice is a well characterized model for studying phenylketonuria (PKU), with Pahenu2 homozygotes displaying heightened blood phenylalanine and other characteristics of PKU. Pahenu2 homozygous females do not successfully rear young on any conventional diet due to their disease status. The most commonly used successful breeding strategy is crossing Pahenu2 heterozygous females with homozygous mutant males; producing litters of 50% homozygous and 50% heterozygous animals. In many treatment studies the heterozygous pups produced are not useable, but add to experimental costs and total animals used. To this end our lab created a dietary regimen with reduced phenylalanine and increased large neutral amino acid content, enabling homozygous mating. Phenylalanine levels in homozygous females and males on the new diet are significantly lower than that of homozygous females and males on traditional diets (p = 1.35x10-4 and p = 1.5x10-5 respectively). Litters born to Pahenu2 homozygous mothers on this diet demonstrate no significant difference in litter size compared to litters born to heterozygous mothers (p > 0.75). No observable defects were noted in litters born from homozygous crosses. This dietary regimen enables litter production of 100% Pahenu2 homozygous animals for investigators who wish to rapidly expand their Pahenu2 mouse colony size or do not require heterozygous littermate controls in their PKU studies.",

    "abstract": "Unless some dedicated treatments are applied, virome shotgun sequencing will only reveal the double stranded DNA (dsDNA) content of a given sample. However bacterial virus genomes often consist of a circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule. Pre-treatment and amplification of DNA with the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) method allows to convert the ssDNA to ds DNA, but it introduces an over-representation of these circular ssDNA genomes. A more recent alternative consists in using an xGen kit, which permits the ligation of adaptators directly to sheared DNA. However, this kit is expensive, and the sonication step might shear ssDNA more efficiently than dsDNA, therefore introducing another bias in virome sequencing. This prompted us to search for an alternative method of DNA preparation for the sequencing of mixed ssDNA and dsDNA viromes. We present here this new method based on the use of the T7 DNA polymerase (T7pol), which is easy to implement and cheap, and compare it to MDA with 30 minutes incubation time (sMDA) and to the direct shearing of DNA without prior conversion of ssDNA to dsDNA. All samples were then prepared with the xGen kit. We found that sMDA overamplifies with 2 to 8.6-fold excess compared to input phage particles, which was less than reported for the full time, 90 minutes MDA treatment. In contrast, the T7pol method led to the under-representation (1.3 to 8.2-fold) of these genomes, and was overall a better reflection of input phage cocktails, compared to the other methods. We conclude a T7pol pre-treatment is a good alternative to MDA for the shotgun sequencing of viromes.",

    "abstract": "The resilience of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) to a high mutational pressure depends, in part, on negative purifying selection in the germline. A paradigm in the field has been that such selection, at least in part, takes place in primordial germ cells (PGCs). Specifically, Floros et al. (Nature Cell Biology 20: 144-51) reported an increase in the synonymity of mtDNA mutations (a sign of purifying selection) between pooled early-stage and late-stage PGCs. We re-analyzed Floros et al. pooled PGC data and noticed that their mutational dataset was significantly contaminated with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) derived from a nuclear sequence of mtDNA origin (NUMT) located on chromosome 5. Contamination was caused by co-amplification of the NUMT sequence by cross-specific PCR primers. Importantly, when we removed NUMT-derived SNVs, the evidence of purifying selection was abolished. In addition to pooled PGCs, Floros et al. reported the analysis of single late-stage PGCs, which were amplified with different sets of PCR primers that cannot amplify the NUMT sequence. Accordingly, we found no NUMT-derived SNVs among single PGCs mutations. Interestingly, single PGC mutations show a decrease of synonymity with increased intracellular mutant fraction. This pattern is incompatible with predominantly negative selection. This suggests that germline selection of mtDNA mutations is a complex phenomenon and that the part of this process that takes place in PGCs may be predominantly positive. However counterintuitive, positive germline selection of detrimental mtDNA mutations has been reported previously and potentially may be evolutionarily advantageous.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system has the extraordinary ability to produce a broad range of immunoglobulins that can bind a wide variety of antigens. During adaptive immune responses, activated B cells duplicate and undergo somatic hypermutation in their B-cell receptor (BCR) genes, resulting in clonal families of diversified B-cells that can be related back to a common ancestor. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the high-throughput characterization of B-cell repertoires, however, the accurate identification of clonally related BCR sequences remains a major challenge. In this study, we compare three different clone identification methods on both simulated and experimental data, and investigate their impact on the characterization of B-cell diversity. We find that different methods may lead to different clonal definitions, which in turn can affect the quantification of clonal diversity in repertoire data. Interestingly, we find the Shannon entropy to be overall the most robust diversity index in regard to different clonal identification. Our analysis also suggests that the traditional germline gene alignment-based method for clonal identification remains the most accurate when the complete information about the sequence is known, but that alignment-free methods may be preferred for shorter read length.

    "abstract": "Cancer patients experience cachexia, which is characterized by extensive skeletal muscle wasting that worsens the quality of life and increases mortality. Currently, there are no approved treatments that can effectively counteract cancer cachexia. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are essential for maintaining tissue perfusion, nutrient supply, and preventing inappropriate transmigration of immune cells into the tissue. However, little is known about the role of the muscle vasculature in cancer cachexia. We hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle mediates cancer cachexia. Using transgenic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mice and a tissue clearing and high-resolution 3D-tissue imaging approach, we found that the loss of skeletal muscle vascular density precedes the loss of muscle mass. Importantly, we show that cancer cachexia patients exhibit significantly decreased muscle vascular density and severe muscle atrophy when compared to non-cancer patients. Unbiased single cell transcriptomic analyses of the muscle endothelium unveiled a unique EC population present in cachexia muscles. Increased circulating Activin-A suppresses the expression of the transcriptional co-activator PGC1 in the muscle endothelium, thus disrupting junctional integrity in the vasculature and increasing vascular leakage. Conversely, restoration of endothelial-specific PGC1 prevented the decreased vascular density and muscle loss observed in tumor-bearing mice. Our study suggests that EC-PGC1 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the skeletal muscle vascular barrier and that restoring muscle endothelial function could be a valuable therapeutic approach to prevent or reverse cancer cachexia.",

To discern mechanisms that aid in the adaptation to external pH, we grew plants on media with pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8.5. Growth was severely restricted at pH 4.5 and above pH 6.5, and associated with decreasing chlorophyll levels at alkaline pH. Bicarbonate treatment worsened plant performance, suggesting effects that differ from those exerted by pH as such. Transcriptional profiling of roots subjected to short-term transfer from optimal (pH 5.5) to alkaline (pH 7.5) media unveiled a large set of differentially expressed genes that were partially congruent with genes affected by low pH, bicarbonate and nitrate, but showed only a very small overlap with genes responsive to the availability of iron. Further analysis of selected genes disclosed pronounced responsiveness of their expression over a wide range of external pH values. Alkalinity altered the expression of various proton/anion co-transporters, possibly to recalibrate cellular proton homeostasis. Co-expression analysis of pH-responsive genes identified a module of genes encoding proteins with putative functions in the regulation of root growth, which appears to be conserved in plants subjected to low pH or bicarbonate. Our analysis provides an inventory of pH-sensitive genes and allows comprehensive insights into processes that are orchestrated by external pH.",

    "abstract": "Primary myelofibrosis is an untreatable age-related disorder of haematopoiesis in which a break in the crosstalk between progenitor Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) and neighbouring mesenchymal stem cells causes HSCs to rapidly proliferate and migrate out of the bone marrow. 90% of patients harbour mutations in driver genes that all converge to overactivate hematopoietic JAK-STAT signalling, which is thought to be critical for disease progression, as well as microenvironment modification induced by chronic inflammation. The trigger to the initial event is unknown but dysregulated thrombopoietin (TPO) and Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signalling are hypothesised to initiate chronic inflammation which then disrupts stem cell crosstalk. Using a systems biology approach, we have constructed an inter and intracellular logical model that captures JAK-STAT signalling and key crosstalk channels between haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells. The aim of the model is to decipher how TPO and TLR stimulation can perturb the bone marrow microenvironment and dysregulate stem cell crosstalk. The model predicted conditions in which the disease was averted and established for both wildtype and ectopically JAK mutated simulations. The presence of TPO and TLR are both required to disturb stem cell crosstalk and result in the disease for wildtype. TLR signalling alone was sufficient to perturb the crosstalk and drive disease progression for JAK mutated simulations. Furthermore, the model predicts the probability of disease onset for wildtype simulations that matches clinical data. These predictions might explain why patients who test negative for the JAK mutation can still be diagnosed with PMF, in which continual exposure to TPO and TLR receptor activation may trigger the initial inflammatory event that perturbs the bone marrow microenvironment and induce disease onset.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements constitute nearly half of the mammalian genome and play important roles in genome evolution. While a multitude of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms exist to silence transposable elements, control of transposition in vivo remains poorly understood. MOV10, an RNA helicase, is a potent inhibitor of mobilization of retrotransposons and retroviruses in cell culture assays. Here we report that MOV10 restricts LINE1 retrotransposition in mice. Although MOV10 is broadly expressed, its loss causes only incomplete penetrance of embryonic lethality, and the surviving MOV10-deficient mice are healthy and fertile. Biochemically, MOV10 forms a complex with UPF1, a key component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, and primarily binds to the 3UTR of somatically expressed transcripts in testis. Consequently, loss of MOV10 results in an altered transcriptome and a modest upregulation of two LINE1 families in testis. Analyses using a LINE1 reporter transgene reveal that loss of MOV10 leads to increased LINE1 retrotransposition in somatic and reproductive tissues from both embryos and adult mice. Moreover, the degree of LINE1 retrotransposition inhibition is dependent on the Mov10 gene dosage. Furthermore, MOV10 deficiency reduces reproductive fitness over successive generations. Our findings demonstrate that MOV10 attenuates LINE1 retrotransposition in a dosage-dependent manner in mice.\n\nAuthor summaryTransposable elements (TEs), including L1 and SINEs, are abundant in the genome and play important roles in evolution, development, and diseases. While TEs propagate in individuals and across generations, the host organism needs to suppress them, resulting in an ongoing arms race between TEs and the host genome. L1, a retrotransposon, accounts for about 17% of the mammalian genome. L1 encodes two proteins, which bind to the L1 transcript to form L1 ribonucleoprotein particles. L1 proliferates in the genome via retrotransposition. A multitude of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms exist to suppress TEs, however, retrotransposition of TEs remains poorly understood. L1 ribonucleoprotein particles are associated with a large number of host proteins, one of which is the MOV10 RNA helicase. MOV10 exhibits anti-viral activities against retroviruses such as HIV-1. In cultured cells, MOV10 is a potent inhibitor of retrotransposition of L1, SINEs, and IAP. Although MOV10 is expressed in a broad range of tissues, loss of MOV10 causes only incomplete penetrance of embryonic lethality. The viable MOV10-deficient mice are grossly normal and fertile. Importantly, analyses using a L1 transgene reporter reveal that MOV10 inhibits L1 retrotransposition in both somatic tissues and reproductive tissues in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Therefore, MOV10 functions as a host restriction factor for L1 and possibly other transposable elements in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Abundance surveys are a common and practical technique to estimate plant or animal densities. Methods used to conduct these surveys often require jointly estimating uncertainty in both counts and detection probability. The estimation of detection probability requires additional measurements that take time, potentially reducing the efficiency of the survey for high-density populations. We conducted quadrat, removal, and distance surveys of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in three central Minnesota lakes and used an efficiency measure to help compare survey designs. Survey efficiency depended on both the survey design and the population density. The efficiency of survey designs that required estimates of detection probabilities (relative to designs that did not) decreased with density, leading to a change in the most efficient survey design at high densities. These results demonstrate that the best survey design may be context-specific, requiring some prior knowledge of the underlying population density and the cost/time needed to collect additional information for estimating detection probabilities.",

    "abstract": "1Zoonotic pathogens spread by wildlife continue to spill into human populations and threaten human lives. A potential way to reduce this threat is by vaccinating wildlife species that harbor pathogens that are infectious to humans. Unfortunately, even in cases where vaccines can be distributed en masse as edible baits, achieving levels of vaccine coverage sufficient for pathogen elimination is rare. Developing vaccines that self-disseminate may help solve this problem by magnifying the impact of limited direct vaccination. Although models exist that quantify how well these self-disseminating vaccines will work when introduced into temporally stable wildlife populations, how well they will perform when introduced into populations with pronounced seasonal population dynamics remains unknown. Here we develop and analyze mathematical models of fluctuating wildlife populations that allow us to study how reservoir ecology, vaccine design, and vaccine delivery interact to influence vaccine coverage and opportunities for pathogen elimination. Our results demonstrate that the timing of vaccine delivery can make or break the success of vaccination programs. As a general rule, the effectiveness of self-disseminating vaccines is optimized by introducing after the peak of seasonal reproduction when the number of susceptible animals is near its maximum.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes maintain separate protein translation systems for nuclear and organellar genes, including distinct sets of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs). In animals, mitochondrial-targeted aaRSs are expressed at lower levels and are less conserved in sequence than cytosolic aaRSs involved in translation of nuclear mRNAs, likely reflecting lower translational demands in mitochondria. In plants, translation is further complicated by the presence of plastids, which share most aaRSs with mitochondria. In addition, plant mitochondrial tRNA pools have a dynamic history of gene loss and functional replacement by tRNAs from other compartments. To investigate the consequences of these distinctive features of translation in plants, we analyzed sequence evolution in angiosperm aaRSs. In contrast to previously studied eukaryotic systems, we found that plant organellar and cytosolic aaRSs exhibit only a small difference in expression levels, and organellar aaRSs are slightly more conserved than cytosolic aaRSs. We hypothesize that these patterns result from high translational demands associated with photosynthesis in mature chloroplasts. We also investigated aaRS evolution in Sileneae, an angiosperm lineage with extensive mitochondrial tRNA replacement and aaRS retargeting. We predicted positive selection for changes in aaRS sequence resulting from these recent changes in subcellular localization and tRNA substrates but found little evidence for accelerated sequence divergence. Overall, the complex tripartite translation system in plant cells appears to have imposed more constraints on the long-term evolutionary rates of organellar aaRSs compared to other eukaryotic lineages, and plant aaRS protein sequences appear largely robust to more recent perturbations in subcellular localization and tRNA interactions.",

    "abstract": "Teeth are one of the most studied hard tissues in vertebrates. Their structure, composition and shape are related to dietary specialization in many species. At first glance, snake teeth all look similar; conical, sharp, curved. Yet, snakes, like other vertebrates, have very diverse diets that may have affected their shape. We compared the morphology of the teeth of 63 species that cover both the phylogenetic and dietary diversity of snakes. We predicted that prey properties play a role in shaping snakes teeth along with their feeding behavior. Limblessness combined to the peculiar feeding behavior of snakes impose strong functional constraints on their teeth, especially during arboreal or aquatic feeding. Our results show that prey hardness, foraging substrate and the main feeding constraint are drivers of tooth shape, size, and curvature. We highlight two main morphotypes: long, slender, curved with a thin layer of hard tissue for snakes that need a good grip on their prey and short, stout, less curved teeth in snakes that eat hard or long prey. Our study demonstrates the diversity of tooth morphology in snakes and the need to investigate the underlying functional implications to better understand the evolution of teeth in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "While population biobanks have dramatically expanded opportunities for genomewide association studies (GWAS), these large-scale analyses bring new statistical challenges. A key bottleneck is that phenotypes of interest are often partially missing. For example, phenotypes derived from specialized imaging modalities are often only measured for a subset of the cohort. Fortunately, biobanks contain surrogate phenotype information, in the form of routinely collected clinical data, that can often be leveraged to build machine learning (ML) models that accurately predict missing values of the target phenotype. However, simply imputing the missing values of the target phenotype can invalidate subsequent statistical inference. To address this significant barrier, we introduce SynSurr, an approach that jointly analyzes an incompletely observed target phenotype together with its predicted value from an ML model. As the ML model can combine or synthesize multiple sources of evidence to infer the missing phenotypic values, we refer to its prediction as a \"synthetic surrogate\" for the target phenotype. SynSurr estimates the same effect size as a standard GWAS of the target phenotype, but does so with increased power when the synthetic surrogate is correlated with the target phenotype. Unlike classical imputation, SynSurr does not require that the synthetic surrogate is obtained from a correctly specified generative model, only that it is correlated with the target outcome. SynSurr is also computationally feasible at biobank scale and has been implemented in the open source R package SurrogateRegression. In a genome-wide ablation analysis of 2 well-studied traits from the UK Biobank (UKBB), SynSurr consistently recovered more of the associations present in the full sample than standard GWAS using the observed target phenotypes. When applied to 6 incompletely measured body composition phenotypes from the UKBB, SynSurr identified 15.6 times as many genome-wide significant associations than standard GWAS, on average, and did so at 2.9 times the level of significance. These associations were highly enriched for biologically relevant gene sets and overlapped substantially with known body composition associations from the GWAS catalog.",

    "abstract": "RAD54 family DNA translocases partner with RAD51 recombinases to ensure stable genome inheritance, exhibiting biochemical activities both in promoting recombinase removal and in stabilizing recombinase association with DNA. Understanding how such disparate activities of RAD54 paralogs align with their biological roles is an ongoing challenge. Here we investigate the in vivo functions of C. elegans RAD54 paralogs RAD-54.L and RAD-54.B during meiotic prophase, revealing distinct contributions to the dynamics of RAD-51 association with DNA and to the progression of meiotic double-strand break repair (DSBR). While RAD-54.L is essential for RAD-51 removal from meiotic DSBR sites to enable recombination progression, RAD-54.B is largely dispensable for meiotic DSBR. However, RAD-54.B is required to prevent hyperaccumulation of RAD-51 on unbroken DNA during a key meiotic sub-stage when protein kinase CHK-2 is active. Moreover, DSB-independent hyperaccumulation of RAD-51 foci in the absence of RAD-54.B is RAD-54.L-dependent, revealing a hidden activity of RAD-54.L in promoting promiscuous RAD-51 association that is antagonized by RAD-54.B. We propose a model wherein a division of labor among RAD-54 paralogs allows germ cells to ramp up their capacity for efficient homologous recombination that is crucial to successful meiosis while counteracting potentially deleterious effects of unproductive RAD-51 association with unbroken DNA.",

    "abstract": "Changing patterns of weather and climate are limiting breeders ability to conduct trials in the same environments in which their released varieties will be grown 7-10 years later. Flowering time plays a crucial role in determining regional adaptation, and mismatch between flowering time and environment can substantially impair yield. Different approaches based on genetic markers or gene expression can be used to predict flowering time before conducting large scale field evaluation and phenotyping. The more accurate prediction of a trait using genetic markers could be hindered due to all the intermediate steps (i.e. transcription, translation, epigenetic modification, and epistasis among others) connecting the trait and their genetic basics. The use of some intermediate steps as predictors could improve the accuracy of the model. Here, we are using two public gene expression (RNA-Seq) data-sets from 14-day-old-maize-seedling roots and whole-seedling tissue at v1 stage (10 day after planting) for which flowering data (days to anthesis and days to silking expressed in growing degree days) and genetic markers were also available to test the predictability of flowering time. In total, 20 different combinations between phenotypic and gene expression data-sets were evaluated. To explore prediction accuracy a random forest model was trained with the expression values of 44,303 gene models hosted in the current B73 maize reference version 5 and then the feature importance was scored based on the decrease in root mean squared error. Later several random forest models with different subsets of the most important features (genes) were trained, and this process was repeated ten times. Results from these analyses show a curve in the prediction accuracy, with an increase in the prediction accuracy as the top most important genes were added. The maximum accuracy was attained when 500 genes for whole-seedling and 100 genes for root gene expression data were used in the analysis, and thereafter adding more genes lead to a decrease in the prediction accuracy. The highest prediction accuracy using the top-most important genes was higher than that of using randomly selected whole-genome 400,000 SNPs. Finally, we described the genes controlling flowering time by looking at the most important genes in the Random forest model with the expression data from all genes. We further found MADS-transcription factor 69 (Mads69) using whole-seedling gene expression and the MADS-transcription factor 67 (Mads67) using root gene expression data, both genes previously described with effect on flowering time. Here, we aim to demonstrate the potential of selecting and using the expression of most informative genes to predict a complex trait, also to demonstrate the robustness and limitations of this analysis by using phenotypic data-sets from different environments.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is used as a bridge-to-heart transplantation for end-stage failing Fontan patients with single-ventricle (SV) circulation. Donor shortage and complexity of the single-ventricle circulation physiology demands novel circulatory support systems and alternative solutions. An out-of-the-box circulation concept in which the left and right ventricles are switched with each other inspired a novel bi-ventricle MCS configuration for the \"failing\" Fontan patients. In the proposed configuration, the systemic circulation is maintained by a conventional mechanical ventricle assist device while the venous circulation is delegated to the native SV. This approach spares the SV and puts it to a new use at the right-side providing the most needed venous flow pulsatility. To analyze its feasibility and performance, 8 realistic Fontan circulation scenarios have been studied via a multi-compartmental lumped parameter cardiovascular model (LPM). Model is developed specifically for simulating the SV circulation and validated against pulsatile mock-up flow loop measurements for the ideal (Fontan), failed (VD) and assisted Fontan (PVR-cmcs) scenarios. The proposed surgical configuration maintained the cardiac index (3-3.5 l/min/m2) providing a normal mean systemic arterial pressure. For a failed SV with low ejection fraction (EF=26%), representing a typical systemic failure, proposed configuration introduced a venous/pulmonary pulsatility of [~]28 mmHg and a drop of 2 mmHg in central venous pressure (CVP) with acceptable pulmonary artery pressures (17.5 mmHg). In the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) failure model, it provided approximately 5 mmHg drop in CVP with venous/pulmonary pulsatility reaching [~]22 mmHg. For high PVR failure case with a healthy SV (EF = 44%) pulmonary hypertension is likely to occur, indicating a need for precise functional assessment of the failed-ventricle before it is considered for the proposed arrangement. Comprehensive in vitro and in silico results encourage this concept as an economical alternative to the conventional bi-ventricle MCS pending animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation is a critical process that determines cell fate and disease. One of the challenges in understanding transcriptional regulation is that there is no easy way to infer the main regulators from gene expression data. Many existing methods focus on estimating the activity of individual transcription factors (TFs) using static TF-gene interaction databases, but regulomes are often altered in different cell types and disease conditions. To address this problem, we developed a new algorithm - Transcriptional Inference using Gene Expression and Regulatory data (TIGER) - that leverages Bayesian matrix factorization to simultaneously infer TF regulomes and transcription factor (TF) activities from RNA-seq data. We show that, when applied to yeast, A375, and MCF7 TF knock-out datasets, TIGER can provide more accurate predictions than comparable methods. The application to single-cell RNA-seq data reveals TIGERs potential for uncovering cell differentiation mechanisms. Our results reinforce the importance of incorporating context-specific regulation when studying the mechanisms driving disease in different cell types.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal multi-dimensional biological datasets are ubiquitous and highly abundant. These datasets are essential to understanding disease progression, identifying subtypes, and drug discovery. Discovering meaningful patterns or disease pathophysiologies in these datasets is challenging due to their high dimensionality, making it difficult to visualize hidden patterns. Several methods have been developed for dimensionality reduction, but they are limited to cross-sectional datasets. Recently proposed Aligned-UMAP, an extension of the UMAP algorithm, can visualize high-dimensional longitudinal datasets. In this work, we applied Aligned-UMAP on a broad spectrum of clinical, imaging, proteomics, and single-cell datasets. Aligned-UMAP reveals time-dependent hidden patterns when color-coded with the metadata. We found that the algorithm parameters also play a crucial role and must be tuned carefully to utilize the algorithms potential fully.\n\nAltogether, based on its ease of use and our evaluation of its performance on different modalities, we anticipate that Aligned-UMAP will be a valuable tool for the biomedical community. We also believe our benchmarking study becomes more important as more and more high-dimensional longitudinal data in biomedical research becomes available.\n\nHighlights- explored the utility of Aligned-UMAP in longitudinal biomedical datasets\n- offer insights on optimal uses for the technique\n- provide recommendations for best practices\n\n\nIn BriefHigh-dimensional longitudinal data is prevalent yet understudied in biological literature. High-dimensional data analysis starts with projecting the data to low dimensions to visualize and understand the underlying data structure. Though few methods are available for visualizing high dimensional longitudinal data, they are not studied extensively in real-world biological datasets. A recently developed nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, Aligned-UMAP, analyzes sequential data. Here, we give an overview of applications of Aligned-UMAP on various biomedical datasets. We further provide recommendations for best practices and offer insights on optimal uses for the technique.",

    "abstract": "Unlike the Carnot heat engine efficiency published in 1824, an isothermal efficiency derived from thermodynamics and information theory can be applied to biological systems. The original approach by Pierce and Cutler in 1959 to derive the isothermal efficiency equation came from Shannons channel capacity of 1949 and from Felkers 1952 determination of the minimum energy dissipation needed to gain a bit. In 1991 and 2010 Schneider showed how the isothermal efficiency equation can be applied to molecular machines and that this can be used to explain why several molecular machines are 70% efficient. Surprisingly, some macroscopic biological systems, such as whole ecosystems, are also 70% efficient but it is hard to see how this could be explained by a thermodynamic and molecular theory. The thesis of this paper is that the isothermal efficiency can be derived without using thermodynamics by starting from a set of independent Gaussian distributions. This novel derivation generalizes the isothermal efficiency equation for use at all levels of biology, from molecules to ecosystems.",

While cell line engineering and bioprocess optimization have yielded high protein titers of some recombinant proteins, many proteins remain difficult to express. Here, we decipher the factors influencing yields in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as they produce 2165 different proteins from the human secretome. We demonstrate that variation within our panel of proteins cannot be explained by transgene mRNA abundance. Analyzing the expression of the 2165 human proteins with machine learning, we find that protein features account for only 15% of the variability in recombinant protein yield. Meanwhile, transcriptomic signatures account for 75% of the variability across 95 representative samples. In particular, we observe divergent signatures regarding ER stress and metabolism among the panel of cultures expressing different recombinant proteins. Thus, our study unravels the factors underlying the variation on recombinant protein production in CHO and highlights transcriptomics signatures that could guide the rational design of CHO cell systems tailored to specific proteins.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionised cancer treatment. However, not all cancer patients benefit, and current stratification strategies based primarily on PD1 status and mutation burden is far from perfect. We hypothesised that high activation of an innate response relative to the adaptive response may prevent proper tumour neoantigen identification and decrease the specific anticancer response, both in the presence and absence of immunotherapy. To investigate this, we obtained transcriptomic data from three large publicly available cancer datasets, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF), and a recently published cohort of metastatic bladder cancer patients treated with immunotherapy.\n\nTo analyse immune infiltration into bulk tumours, we developed an RNAseq-based model based on previously published definitions to estimate the overall level of infiltrating innate and adaptive immune cells from bulk tumour RNAseq data. From these, the adaptive-to-innate immune ratio (A/I ratio) was defined.\n\nA meta-analysis of 32 cancer types from TCGA overall showed improved overall survival in patients with an A/I ratio above median (Hazard ratio (HR) females 0.73, HR males 0.86, P < 0.05). Of particular interest, we found that the association was different for males and females for eight cancer types, demonstrating a gender bias in the relative balance of the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. For patients with metastatic disease, we found that responders to immunotherapy had a significantly higher A/I ratio than non-responders in HMF (P = 0.036) and a significantly higher ratio in complete responders in a separate metastatic bladder cancer dataset (P = 0.022).\n\nOverall, the adaptive-to-innate immune ratio seems to define separate states of immune activation, likely linked to fundamental immunological reactions to cancer. This ratio was associated with improved prognosis and improved response to immunotherapy, demonstrating potential relevance to patient stratification. Furthermore, by demonstrating a significant difference between males and females that associates with response, we highlight an important gender bias which likely has direct clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Probiotics, including yogurt commonly containing bacteria of the Lactobacillus group, are widely used to promote microbiome health and to prevent gastrointestinal or other infections, especially in the setting of antibiotic use. Rarely, however, Lactobacillus bacteria have caused invasive or severe infections in patients. In this report, we present a patient with fatal Lacticaseibacillus bacteremia and endocarditis who frequently consumed yogurt. Whole genome sequencing identified the patients bloodstream isolate as Lacticaseibacillus (formerly Lactobacillus) rhamnosus, and sequencing of Lactobacillus isolates from selected commercial yogurt preparations revealed one isolate nearly identical to the patients isolate, differing by only one nucleotide (adenine to guanine substitution leading to a M1A amino acid change in the start codon of the nrdR gene). To place these sequences into broader context of L. rhamnosus strains, we compared them to 602 L. rhamnosus genome sequences publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information repository. Both isolates belonged to a clade, identified in this report as clade YC, composed of mostly gastrointestinal isolates from healthy individuals, some of which also differed by only a single nucleotide from the patients isolate. Members of clade YC had only rarely been previously identified in invasive infections. In summary, the Lacticaseibacillus strain causing this patients infection may have originated from a commercial dairy product or from the commensal flora of his gastrointestinal tract. This study demonstrates that whole genome sequencing may be insufficient to reliably determine the source of invasive infections caused by L. rhamnosus.\n\nIMPORTANCEActive culture and probiotic foods and supplements are often used to promote gut health. Though largely considered safe for human consumption, there are rare reports of severe infections linked to bacterial species used in these products. Using whole genome sequencing, we examined a case of fatal infection with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus in the patients blood. By comparing the bacterial genome sequence from the patient to strains cultured from 4 commercial yogurt samples and 602 publicly available sequences of L. rhamnosus from around the world, we found that it was nearly identical to one of the yogurt strains and equally similar to other strains from both probiotics and healthy individuals gastrointestinal tracts. These findings show that even with whole genome sequencing it can be difficult to determine the source of an invasive L. rhamnosus infection, whether from recent consumption of a probiotic or dairy product versus from the gastrointestinal microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Rotavirus replication takes place in the viroplasms, cytosolic inclusions that allow the synthesis of virus genome segments and their encapsidation in the core shell followed by the addition of the second layer of the virion. The viroplasms are composed of several viral proteins, including NSP5, which is the main building block. Microtubules, lipid droplets, and miRNA-7 are among the host components recruited in viroplasms. To investigate the relationship between rotavirus proteins and host components of the viroplasms, we performed a pull-down assay of lysates from rotavirus-infected cells expressing NSP5-BiolD2. Subsequent tandem mass spectrometry identified all eight subunits of the TRiC complex, a cellular chaperonin responsible for folding at least 10% of the cytosolic proteins. Our validated results show that TRiC is recruited in viroplasms and specifically surrounds newly formed double-layered particles (DLPs). Chemical inhibition of TRiC and silencing of its subunits drastically reduced virus progeny production. Interestingly, TRiC-inhibited RV-infected cells lacked triple-layered particles (TLPs) but harbored empty DLPs. Through sequence-specific direct RNA nanopore sequencing, we show that TRiC is critical for RV replication by controlling dsRNA genome segment synthesis, particularly (-)ssRNA. Moreover, TRiC associates and regulates the folding of VP2, a cofactor allowing dsRNA synthesis. This study provides in-cell culture evidence of the regulatory mechanism by which dsRNA genome segment replication is controlled and coordinated in the rotavirus viroplasms.\n\nImportanceThe replication of rotavirus takes place in cytosolic inclusions termed viroplasms. In these inclusions, the eleven double-stranded RNA genome segments are synthesized and packaged individually into the newly generated virus particles. In this study, we show for the first time that the TRiC complex, a cellular chaperonin responsible for the folding of at least 10% of the cytosolic proteins, is a component of viroplasms and is required for the synthesis of the viral (-)ssRNA. Specifically, TRiC interacts and assists in folding VP2, the cofactor involved in RNA replication. Our study adds a new component to the current model of rotavirus replication, where TRiC is recruited in viroplasm to assist replication.",

    "abstract": "Methylated DNA adenines (6mA) are an important epigenetic modification in bacteria that affect varied cell processes like replication, stress response, and pathogenesis. While much work has been done characterizing the influence of 6mA on specific loci, very few studies have examined the evolutionary dynamics of 6mA over long time scales. Utilizing third-generation sequencing technology, we produced a detailed analysis of 6mA methylation across the Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655 genome. 6mA levels were consistently high across GATC sites; however, we identified regions where 6mA is decreased, particularly in intergenic regions, especially around the -35 promoter element, and within cryptic prophages and IS elements. We further examined 6mA in WT and methyl-directed mismatch repair-knockout (MMR-) populations after 2400 generations of experimental evolution. We find that, after evolution, MMR-populations acquire significantly more epimutations resulting in a genome-wide decrease in 6mA methylation. Here, clones from evolved MMR-populations display non-deterministic sets of epimutations, consistent with reduced selection on these modifications. Thus, we show that characterization of 6mA in bacterial populations is complementary to genetic sequencing and informative for molecular evolution.",

    "abstract": "The genus Hanseniaspora is characterized by some of the smallest genomes among budding yeasts. These fungi are primarily found on plant surfaces and in fermented products and represent promising biocontrol agents against notorious fungal plant pathogens. In this work, we identify a Hanseniaspora meyeri isolate that shows strong antagonism against the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum as a pantothenate auxotroph. Furthermore, strong biocontrol activity in vitro required both pantothenate and biotin in the growth medium. We show that the H. meyeri isolate APC 12.1 can obtain the vitamin from plants and other fungi. The underlying reason for the auxotrophy is the lack of key pantothenate biosynthesis genes, but at least six genes encoding putative pantothenate transporters are present in the genome. By constructing and using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain, we identified one Hanseniaspora transporter, out of the six candidate proteins, that conferred pantothenate uptake activity to S. cerevisiae. Pantothenate auxotrophy is rare and has only been described in a few bacteria and in S. cerevisiae strains that were isolated from sake. Such auxotrophic strains may seem an unexpected and unlikely choice as potential biocontrol agents, but they may be particularly competitive in their ecological niche and their specific growth requirements are an inherent biocontainment strategy preventing uncontrolled growth in the environment. Auxotrophic strains such as the H. meyeri isolate APC 12.1 may thus represent a new strategy for developing biocontrol agents that will be easier to register than prototrophic strains, which are normally used for such applications.\n\nSignificance StatementAs a precursor of the essential coenzyme CoA, pantothenate is present in all organisms. Plants, bacteria and fungi are known to synthesize this vitamin, while animals must obtain it through their diet. Pantothenate auxotrophy has not been described in naturally occurring, environmental fungi and is an unexpected property for an antagonistic yeast. Here, we report that yeasts from the genus Hanseniaspora lack key enzymes for pantothenate biosynthesis and identify a transporter responsible for the acquisition of pantothenate from the environment. Hanseniaspora isolates are strong antagonists of fungal plant pathogens. Their pantothenate auxotrophy is a natural biocontainment feature that could make such isolates interesting candidates for new biocontrol approaches and allow easier registration as plant protection agents compared to prototrophic strains.",

The role of mammalian cytoplasmic 3-5 exonuclease DIS3L at the organismal level remained unknown. Herein we established knock-in and knock-out mouse models to study DIS3L functions in mice. DIS3L is indeed a subunit of the cytoplasmic exosome complex, which disruption leads to severe embryo degeneration and death in mice soon after implantation. These changes could not be prevented by supplementing extraembryonic tissue with functional DIS3L through the construction of chimeric embryos. Preimplantation Dis3l-/- embryos were unaffected in their morphology and ability to produce functional embryonic stem cells showing that DIS3L is not essential for cell viability. There were also no major changes in the transcriptome level for both embryonic stem cells and blastocysts, as revealed by RNA sequencing experiments. Notably, however, DIS3L knock-out led to inhibition of the global protein synthesis. These results point to the essential role of DIS3L in mRNA quality control pathways crucial for proper protein synthesis during embryo development.",

The rate at which this process occurs, might depend on the epigenetic state of the genome and vary between, or even within, cell types.

Replication speed is not constant but increases during S-phase of the cell cycle. Using genetic and pharmacological perturbations we are able to alter this acceleration of replication and conclude that DNA damage inflicted by the process of transcription limits the speed of replication during early S-phase. In late S-phase, during which less transcription occurs, replication accelerates and approaches its maximum speed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between a species feeding strategy and its environment (trophic ecology) is critical to assess environmental requirements and improve management policies. However, measuring trophic interactions remains challenging. Among the available methods, quantifying the plant composition of a species diet indicates how species use their environment and their associated niche overlap. Nevertheless, most studies focusing on herbivore trophic ecology ignore the influence that landscape variability may have. Here, we explored how landscape variability influences diet composition through niche overlap. We used eDNA metabarcoding to quantify the diet composition of two large herbivores of the Bialowieza Forest, Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and European bison (Bison bonasus) to investigate how increasing habitat quality (i.e. higher abundance of deciduous forage species) and predation risk (i.e. density of wolf in the area) influence their diet composition and niche partitioning. Our findings indicate diet composition is non-homogeneous across the landscape, both within and between species. Red deer showed greater diet variability and lower niche overlap within species compared to bison. We detected a reduction of niche overlap for red deer with increasing predation risk, leading to more dissimilar diets, suggesting their feeding behaviour is affected by wolf presence. This correlation was not found for bison, which are rarely predated by wolf. Higher habitat quality was associated with higher niche overlap only within bison, probably due to their suboptimal feeding strategy as browsers. These results show the importance of integrating environment-induced diet variation in studies aimed at determining the landscape usage or niche overlap of a species. Niche overlap can therefore be a powerful tool for inferring predation risk for red deer, and estimating predator abundance or its perception. This approach has enormous potential for wildlife management in areas where predator estimates are unknown or difficult to quantify.",

    "abstract": "1.Organoids are in vitro model systems generated from tissues. Organoids express specific physiological functions associated with their original tissue location and they express tissue-segment-specific genes. The aim of this study was to culture pig organoids from different areas of intestinal segments: duodenum, ileum (with or without Peyers Patches (PP)), and colon, to investigate the resemblance with the in vivo tissues and variability of multiple adjacent sampling sites based on histology and transcriptome profiles. The transcriptome profiles of the in vivo tissues and the derived organoids showed high resemblance for all intestinal segments. For the transcriptomic cluster analysis it was shown that it is important to use tissue important genes to shown the resemble between tissue and their derived organoids. The transcriptome profiles clearly separated the intestinal segments, and samples of the same segment from adjacent tissue locations showed high transcriptome profile similarity. Ileum samples with and without PP were also separated. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes from PP compared with non-PP suggested the importance of several aspects of cell cycle progression regulation, including DNA metabolism, chromatin organization, regulation of mitotic stage progression, and regulation of inflammation. Based primarily on the transcriptomics results, we conclude that organoids reflect the sampled intestinal segment and that organoids derived from adjacent sampling sites in an intestinal tissue segment showed low variability. The results from the ileum indicate that organoids have potential to study intestinal innate immune processes.",

    "abstract": "Caenorhabditis nematodes form an excellent model for studying how the mode of reproduction affects genetic diversity, as some species reproduce via outcrossing whereas others can self-fertilize. Currently, chromosome-level patterns of diversity and recombination are only available for self-reproducing Caenorhabditis, making the generality of genomic patterns across the genus unclear given the profound potential influence of reproductive mode. Here we present a whole-genome diversity landscape, coupled with a new genetic map, for the outcrossing nematode C. remanei. We demonstrate that the genomic distribution of recombination in C. remanei, like the model nematode C. elegans, shows high recombination rates on chromosome arms and low rates toward the central regions. Patterns of genetic variation across the genome are also similar between these species, but differ dramatically in scale, being 10-fold greater for C. remanei. Historical reconstructions of variation in effective population size over the past million generations echo this difference in polymorphism. Evolutionary simulations demonstrate how selection, recombination, mutation, and selfing shape variation along the genome, and that multiple drivers can produce patterns similar to those observed in natural populations. Convolutional neural networks demonstrate the potential for classifying distinct evolutionary scenarios in simulated populations. Distinguishing these forces confidently with the empirical data, however, will benefit from larger population genomic samples from multiple populations and consideration of an even more extensive training set of simulations.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of sphingolipids, especially sphingosines, in the lysosomes is attributed to the pathogenesis of several lysosomal storage diseases. In search for a lysosomal protein that mediates the release of sphingosines, we identified SPNS1 which shares the highest homology to SPNS2, a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter. We generated knockout cells and mice for Spns1 and employed lipidomics and metabolomics to identify SPNS1 ligands. We found that knockouts of Spns1 resulted in the accumulation of sphingolipids, including sphingosines in embryonic brains and cell lines. These results suggest that deficiency of SPNS1 affects the clearance of sphingolipids in lysosomes. Biochemical assays demonstrated that sphingosines released from lysosomes required SPNS1. Furthermore, by performing a comprehensive analysis of metabolites from livers of postnatal Spns1 knockout mice (gSpns1-cKO), we detected a striking accumulation of lysoglycerophospholipids including LPC, LPE, LPG, and lysoplasmalogens. Interestingly, the release of these lysoglycerophospholipids also required SPNS1. Global knockout of Spns1 (gSpns1-KO) resulted in embryonic lethality between E12.5-E13.5 with developmental defects. Postnatal deletion of Spns1 in mice caused lipid accumulation in the lysosomes and pathological conditions reminiscent of lysosomal storage diseases. These results reveal a critical molecular role of SPNS1 as a transporter for lysosphingolipids and lysoglyerophospholipids from the lysosomes and link its physiological functions with lysosomal storage diseases.\n\nSignificancePhospholipids, including glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, are delivered to the lysosomes for recycling. The hydrolysis of these lipids by lysosomal enzymes generates the corresponding lysoglycerophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine and lysosphingolipids, such as sphingosine, which are believed to be exported out of the lysosomes for recycling in the cytoplasm. However, it is unknown how these lysophospholipids are released from the lysosomes. The current study utilized genetic knockout models in combination with mass spectrometry analysis of complex phospholipids and sphingolipids to characterize the roles of an orphan lysosomal transporter, namely SPNS1. These findings show that deficiency of SPNS1 results in the accumulation of lysophospholipids in cells and animal tissues and that the transporter is required to transport both lysoglycerophospholipids and lysosphingolipids out of the lysosomes. SPNS1 is critical for early development in mice. Ablation of SPNS1 at postnatal life causes pathological conditions reminiscent of lysosomal storage diseases in mice. These findings reveal the molecular functions of SPNS1 as a lysophospholipid transporter and provide a foundation for studying the transport of these lysolipids in lysosomal storage diseases.",

We first synthesized a library of polyacrylamide-based copolymer hydrogels and implanted them into the subcutaneous space of mice to evaluate their biocompatibility. We sought to discover copolymer hydrogel formulations eliciting less fibrous capsule formation and lower overall inflammation than gold standard materials such as PEG and polyzwitterions. The top performing copolymer hydrogel materials were then shown to improve the biocompatibility of a commonly used medical material, PDMS. Lastly, we applied the leading hydrogel coating to the catheter tips of insulin pumps.

However, empirical approaches for identifying novel engineering targets are laborious and time-consuming. Here, we established a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening platform for CHO-K1 cells with 111,651 guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting 21,585 genes using a virus-free recombinase-mediated cassette exchange-based gRNA integration method. Using this platform, we performed a positive selection screening under hyperosmotic stress conditions and identified 180 genes whose perturbations conferred resistance to hyperosmotic stress in CHO cells. Functional enrichment analysis identified hyperosmotic stress responsive gene clusters, such as tRNA wobble uridine modification and signaling pathways associated with cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we validated 32 top-scoring candidates and observed a high rate of hit confirmation, demonstrating the potential of the screening platform. Knockout of the novel target genes, Zfr and Pnp, in monoclonal antibody (mAb)-producing recombinant CHO (rCHO) cells and bispecific antibody (bsAb)-producing rCHO cells enhanced their resistance to hyperosmotic stress, thereby improving mAb and bsAb production. Overall, the collective findings demonstrate the value of the screening platform as a powerful tool to investigate the functions of genes associated with hyperosmotic stress and to discover novel targets for rational cell engineering on a genome-wide scale in CHO cells.",

    "abstract": "Lipid membranes play an essential role in biology, acting as host matrices for biomolecules like proteins and facilitating their functions. Their structures, and structural responses to physiologically relevant interactions, i.e. with membrane proteins, provide key information for understanding biophysical mechanisms. Hence, there is a crucial need of methods to understand the effects of membrane host molecules on the lipid bilayer structure. Here, we present a purely experimental method for obtaining the absolute scattering length density (SLD) profile and the area per lipid of liposomal bilayers, by aiding the analysis of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data with the volume of bare headgroups obtained from fast (20-120s) grazing incidence off-specular scattering (GIXOS) data from monolayers of the same model membrane lipid composition. The GIXOS data experimentally demonstrate that the variation of the bare headgroup volume upon lipid packing density change is small enough to allow its usage as a reference value without knowing the lipid packing stage in a bilayer. This approach also bares the advantage that the reference volume is obtained at the same aqueous environment as used for the model membrane bilayers. We demonstrate the validity of this method using several typical membrane compositions, as well as one example of a phospholipid membrane with an incorporated transmembrane peptide. This methodology allows to obtain absolute scale values rather than relative scale by using solely X-ray-based instrumentation, retaining a similar resolution of SAXS experiments. The presented method has high potential to understand structural effects of membrane proteins on the biomembrane structure.",

Inducing ferroptosis is a promising approach to treat therapy resistant cancer. Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) promotes ferroptosis resistance in cancer by generating the antioxidant form of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ). Despite the important role of FSP1, few molecular tools exist that target the CoQ-FSP1 pathway. Exploiting a series of chemical screens, we identify several structurally diverse FSP1 inhibitors. The most potent of these compounds, ferroptosis sensitizer 1 (FSEN1), is an uncompetitive inhibitor that acts selectively through on target inhibition of FSP1 to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis. Furthermore, a synthetic lethality screen reveals that FSEN1 synergizes with endoperoxide-containing ferroptosis inducers, including dihydroartemisinin, to trigger ferroptosis. These results provide new tools that catalyze the exploration of FSP1 as a therapeutic target and highlight the value of combinatorial therapeutic regimes targeting FSP1 and additional ferroptosis inducers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious work has shown considerable laboratory variability of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) classification, efflux ratio in intestinal cell lines and cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-metabolism pathways. Such variability and inconsistency create uncertainty in predictions of human clinical pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic optimization process and is a problem when developing corresponding in silico methods.\n\nObjectives and MethodologyOne objective of the study was to quantify the degree of laboratory inconsistency for BCS II-classing, MDR-1 and CYP3A4 substrate specificity (substrate/non-substrate). Another objective was to predict BCS II-classing, MDR-1 and CYP3A4 substrate specificity using in silico methodology and compare results to laboratory data/classifications.\n\nResults and Discussion27 BCS II-classified drugs (with non-contradictory BCS-classing in various sources) were found. 17 (63 %) had an in vivo fraction absorbed (fa) of [&ge;]90 % and belong to in vivo BCS I. With in silico methodology, 74 % correct BCS-classing was reached for the same set of compounds. The mean prediction error for fa was 1.2-fold. MDR-1 and CYP3A4 substrate specificities were collected for 346 and 808 compounds, respectively. For MDR-1, 143 of the compounds had reported data in at least two studies, and out of these, 49 (34 %) and 18 (13 %) had contradictory (reported as both substate and non-substrate) and uncertain substrate specificities, respectively. For CYP3A4, 42 (9.8 %) out of 427 compounds showed inconsistency between laboratories. With in silico methodology, MDR-1 and CYP3A4 classification predictions were incorrect for 13 and 15 % of compounds.\n\nConclusionThe results show considerable variability/inconsistency for BCS II-classing (63 % inconsistency between BCS II-classing and in vivo fa) and MDR-1 (34 % inconsistency between sources) and CYP3A4 (10 % inconsistency between sources) substrate specificities. Corresponding estimates obtained with in silico methodology are 22, 13 and 15 %, respectively, demonstrating the power and applicability of such technology.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are exceedingly common, but little is known about their diversity let alone how they behave in extreme environments, and whether viruses facilitate adaptation of their hosts to harsh conditions. To enhance understanding of these understudied viral-host interactions, we created a catalog of viruses through analysis of metagenomes from 50 unialgal but nonaxenic Cyanobacteria cultures with 47 cultures representing various terrestrial habitats, including desert soil and rock surfaces, tropical soil, and vernal pools. These cultures represent low diversity microbial consortia dominated by the terrestrial Cyanobacteria and its associated cyanosphere microbiome containing heterotrophic microbes. We identified viral sequences in metagenomes, grouped these into viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) and then placed vOTUs into viral clusters (VCs). We also calculated vOTU relative abundance and predicted possible bacterial hosts. In total we predicted 814 viral sequences representing 726 vOTUs. We assigned putative taxonomy to 72 of the 814 putative viral sequences; these were distributed into 15 VCs -- mostly assigned to the recently abolished Caudovirales order (now Caudoviricetes class) of viruses. We found that nonaxenic cultures were dominated by unclassified and unclustered viral sequences. Furthermore, we predicted putative bacterial hosts for 211 vOTUs, with the majority of viruses predicted to infect a Proteobacteria (now Pseudomonadota) host, and only 3 vOTUs predicted to infect a Cyanobacteria host. Overall, these results are consistent with the notion that both viruses and Cyanobacteria in extreme environments are underrepresented in reference datasets. This work increases knowledge of viral diversity and sets a foundation for future work on viruses associated with terrestrial Cyanobacteria and their heterotroph associates, such as connecting specific viruses to critical cycling processes and investigating their metabolic functions.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years it is observed an increased interest for oleaginous microorganisms in the perspective to produce microbial oils of great commercial interest through the consumption of low/zero cost substrates. In this paper, the physiology of the fungus Umbelopsis isabellina growing on blends of glycerol and glucose was investigated. In all experiments the fungus completely consumed glucose and produced satisfactory quantities of biomass containing reserve lipids in high percentages. However, glycerol concentration in the growth medium was negatively correlated to glucose assimilation rate, mainly during the balanced-growth phase. Nevertheless, at high initial concentrations, glycerol was partially consumed and seemed to contribute positively to the suppression of lipid degradation. Following the discovery of this complex regulatory mechanism regarding glucose and glycerol co-assimilation, the activity of three key-enzymes namely aldolase, glycerol kinase and glycerol dehydrogenase, which are implicated in glycerol and glucose assimilation, was investigated. The experiments revealed a clear preference of the fungus for glucose over glycerol. On the other hand, storage polysaccharides are degraded instead of storage lipid at the late oleaginous phase for maintenance purpose. These new biochemical features will enable the design of appropriate growth media for the co-fermentation of these two substrates by U. isabellina with the aim to maximize lipid accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Host-microbe interactions constitute dynamical systems that can be represented by mathematical formulations that determine their dynamic nature. Dynamical interactions can be categorized as deterministic, stochastic, or chaotic. Knowing the type of dynamical interaction is essential for understanding the system under study. Very little experimental work has been done to determine the dynamical characteristics of host-microbe interactions and its study poses significant challenges. The most straightforward experimental outcome involves an observation of time to death upon infection. However, in measuring this outcome, the internal parameters and dynamics of each host-microbe interaction are hidden from the experimentalist. To investigate whether a time-to-death (time to event) dataset provides adequate information for searching for chaotic signatures, we first determined our ability to detect chaos in simulated data sets of time-to-event measurements and successfully distinguished the time-to-event distribution of a chaotic process from a comparable stochastic one. To do so, we introduced an inversion measure to test for a chaotic signature in time-to-event distributions. Next, we searched for chaos in time-to-death of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas entomophila, respectively. We found suggestions of chaotic signatures in both systems, but caution that our results are still preliminary and highlight the need for more fine-grained and larger data sets in determining dynamical characteristics. If validated, the occurrence of chaos in host-microbe interactions would have important implications for the occurrence and outcome of infectious diseases, the reproducibility of experiments in the field of microbial pathogenesis and the prediction of future microbial threats.\n\nImportanceIs microbial pathogenesis a predictable scientific field? At a time when we are dealing with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) there is intense interest in knowing about the epidemic potential of other microbial threats and new emerging infectious diseases. To know whether microbial pathogenesis will ever be a predictable scientific field requires knowing whether a host-microbe interaction follows deterministic, stochastic, or chaotic dynamics. If randomness and chaos are absent from virulence, there is the hope for prediction in the future regarding the outcome of microbe-host interactions. Chaotic systems are inherently unpredictable although it is possible to generate short-term probabilistic models, as is done in applications of stochastic processes and machine learning to weather forecasting. Information on the dynamics of a system is also essential for understanding the reproducibility of experiments, a topic of great concern in biological sciences. Our study finds preliminary evidence for chaotic dynamics in infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Measuring telomere length (TL) with high precision is challenging. Currently there is insufficient understanding of the causes of variation in measurement precision, particularly for qPCR-based measurement. To better understand how DNA extraction protocols and laboratory-specific analytical factors influence qPCR-based TL measurement precision, we conducted a multi-laboratory study involving four labs and six DNA extraction protocols assaying the same blinded human whole blood samples. DNA extraction protocols differed in underlying principles (magnetic beads, salting out, silica membrane) and commercial kits. A fifth lab performed Telomere Restriction Fragment (TRF) analysis using Southern Blot technique with one DNA extraction protocol. All labs performed TL measurement using their standard procedures on two sets of fifty double blinded samples. Data was sent to a central point for unblinding and statistical analyses. Precision was quantified using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Correlations with TRF measurements were also calculated. Repeated qPCR-based measurements of the same DNA extraction yielded ICC values ranging from 0.24 to 0.94. ICC values calculated over measurements of repeated DNA extractions were on average 0.23 lower and ranged from 0.02 to 0.83. The latter ICC estimates more strongly predicted the association between qPCR- and Southern blot-based measurements across the protocol / lab combinations (R2=0.56 vs. R2=0.93). We conclude that ICC calculated over measurements on repeated DNA extractions reliably indicates measurement precision, while ICC calculated over multiple measurements of the same DNA extraction overestimates measurement precision. Variation in ICC was driven by variation between laboratories, with few consistent DNA extraction protocol effects. Values of DNA integrity and purity generally characterized as reflecting high sample quality, (e.g. OD 260/280 of 1.8 and OD 260/230 of 2.0) were associated with qPCR-based measurement precision, but did not always predict higher ICCs.",

    "abstract": "1.Alternative transcription increases transcriptome complexity by expression of multiple transcripts per gene and thus fine tunes cellular identity and function. Annotation and quantification of transcripts at complex loci using short-read sequencing is non-trivial. Recent long-read sequencing methods such as those from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences aim at overcoming these problems by sequencing full length transcripts. Activation of BAT thermogenesis involves major transcriptomic remodelling and positively affects metabolism via increased energy expenditure and endocrine factors. Here we comprehensively benchmark features of ONT long-read sequencing protocols compared to Illumina shortread sequencing assessing alignment characteristics, gene and transcript detection and quantification, differential gene and transcript expression, transcriptome reannotation and differential transcript usage (DTU). We find that ONT sequencing is superior to Illumina for transcriptome reassembly and reduces the risk of false-positive events due to the ability to unambiguously map reads to transcripts, at the expense of statistical power for calling differentially expressed features. We identified novel isoforms of genes undergoing DTU in cold-activated BAT including Cars2, Adtrp, Acsl5, Scp2, Aldoa and Pde4d, validated by RT-qPCR. Finally, we provide a reannotation of the murine iBAT transcriptome as a valuable resource for researchers interested in the molecular biology underlying the regulation of BAT.",

    "abstract": "Timely detection of persistent and emerging pathogens is critical to controlling disease spread, particularly in high-density populations with increased contact between individuals and limited-to-no ability to quarantine. Standard molecular diagnostic tests for surveying pathogenic microbes have provided the sensitivity needed for early detection, but lag in time-to-result leading to delayed action. On-site diagnostics alleviate this lag, but current technologies are less sensitive and adaptable than lab-based molecular methods. Towards the development of improved on-site diagnostics, we demonstrated the adaptability of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification-CRISPR coupled technology for detecting DNA and RNA viruses that have greatly impacted shrimp populations worldwide; White Spot Syndrome Virus and Taura Syndrome Virus. Both CRISPR-based fluorescent assays we developed showed similar sensitivity and accuracy for viral detection and load quantification to real-time PCR. Additionally, both assays specifically targeted their respective virus with no false positives detected in animals infected with other common pathogens or in certified specific pathogen-free animals.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is one of the most valuable aquaculture species in the world but has suffered major economic losses from outbreaks of White Spot Syndrome Virus and Taura Syndrome Virus. Rapid detection of these viruses can improve aquaculture practices by enabling more timely action to be taken to combat disease outbreaks. Highly sensitive, specific, and robust CRISPR-based diagnostic assays such as those developed here have the potential to revolutionize disease management in agriculture and aquaculture helping to promote global food security.",

    "abstract": "Transgenesis is an essential technique for any genetic model. Tol2-based transgenesis paired with Gateway-compatible vector collections has transformed zebrafish transgenesis with an accessible, modular system. Here, we established several next-generation transgenesis tools for zebrafish and other species to expand and enhance transgenic applications. To facilitate gene-regulatory element testing, we generated Gateway middle entry vectors harboring the small mouse beta-globin minimal promoter coupled to several fluorophores, CreERT2, and Gal4. To extend the color spectrum for transgenic applications, we established middle entry vectors encoding the bright, blue-fluorescent protein mCerulean and mApple as an alternative red fluorophore. We present a series of p2A peptide-based 3 vectors with different fluorophores and subcellular localizations to co-label cells expressing proteins of interest. Lastly, we established Tol2 destination vectors carrying the zebrafish exorh promoter driving different fluorophores as a pineal gland-specific transgenesis marker active prior to hatching and through adulthood. exorh-based reporters and transgenesis markers also drive specific pineal gland expression in the eye-less cavefish (Astyanax). Together, our vectors provide versatile reagents for transgenesis applications in zebrafish, cavefish, and other models.",

    "abstract": "Cellular mechanotransduction plays a central role in fibroblast activation during fibrotic disease progression, leading to increased tissue stiffness and reduced organ function. While the role of epigenetics in disease mechanotransduction has begun to be appreciated, there is little known about how substrate mechanics, particularly the timing of mechanical inputs, regulate epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and chromatin reorganization during fibroblast activation. In this work, we engineered a hyaluronic acid hydrogel platform with independently tunable stiffness and viscoelasticity to model normal (storage modulus, G [~] 0.5 kPa, loss modulus, G [~] 0.05 kPa) to increasingly fibrotic (G [~] 3.5 and 8 kPa, G [~] 0.05 kPa) lung mechanics. Human lung fibroblasts exhibited increased spreading and nuclear localization of myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) with increasing substrate stiffness within 1 day, with these trends holding steady for longer cultures. However, fibroblasts displayed time-dependent changes in global DNA methylation and chromatin organization. Fibroblasts initially displayed increased DNA methylation and chromatin decondensation on stiffer hydrogels, but both of these measures decreased with longer culture times. To investigate how culture time affected the responsiveness of fibroblast nuclear remodeling to mechanical signals, we engineered hydrogels amenable to in situ secondary crosslinking, enabling a transition from a compliant substrate mimicking normal tissue to a stiffer substrate resembling fibrotic tissue. When stiffening was initiated after only 1 day of culture, fibroblasts rapidly responded and displayed increased DNA methylation and chromatin decondensation, similar to fibroblasts on static stiffer hydrogels. Conversely, when fibroblasts experienced later stiffening at day 7, they showed no changes in DNA methylation and chromatin condensation, suggesting the induction of a persistent fibroblast phenotype. These results highlight the time-dependent nuclear changes associated with fibroblast activation in response to dynamic mechanical perturbations and may provide mechanisms to target for controlling fibroblast activation.",

    "abstract": "Coupling between the fluctuations of DNA and its surroundings consisting of water and ions in solution remains poorly understood and relatively less investigated as compared to proteins. Here, with the help of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical mechanical analyses, we explore the dynamical coupling between DNA, water, and counterions through correlations among respective energy fluctuations in both double (ds-) and single-stranded (ss-) DNA solutions. Fluctuations in the collective DNA-Water and DNA-Ion interaction energies are found to be strongly anti-correlated across all the systems. The fluctuations of DNA self-energy, however, are weakly coupled to DNA-water and DNA-ion interactions in ds-DNA. An enhancement of the DNA-water coupling is observed in ss-DNA, where the system is less rigid. All the interaction energies exhibit 1/f noise in their energy power spectra with surprisingly prominent bimodality in the DNA-water and DNA-ion fluctuations. The nature of the energy spectra appears to be indifferent to the relative rigidity of the DNA. We discuss the role of the observed correlations in ion-water motions on a DNA duplex in the experimentally observed anomalous slow dielectric relaxation and solvation dynamics, and in furthering our understanding of the DNA energy landscape.\n\nTOC GRAPHIC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520228v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@806797org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@110c9corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1531566org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1fe12_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Maturation of functional liquid-like biomolecular condensates into solid-like aggregates has been linked to the onset of several neurodegenerative disorders. Low-complexity aromatic-rich kinked segments (LARKS) contained in numerous RNA-binding proteins can promote aggregation by forming inter-protein {beta}-sheet fibrils that accumulate over time and ultimately drive the liquid-to-solid transition of the condensates. Here, we combine atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with sequence-dependent coarse-grained models of various resolutions to investigate the role of LARKS abundance and position within the amino acid sequence in the maturation of condensates. Remarkably, proteins with tail-located LARKS display much higher viscosity over time than those in which the LARKS are placed towards the center. Yet, at very long timescales, proteins with a single LARKS--independently of its location--can still relax and behave as high viscous liquids. However, phase-separated condensates of proteins containing two or more LARKS become kinetically trapped due to the formation of percolated {beta}-sheet networks that display gel-like behaviour. Furthermore, as a work case example, we demonstrate how shifting the location of the LARKS-containing low-complexity domain of FUS protein towards its center effectively precludes the accumulation of {beta}-sheet fibrils in FUS-RNA condensates, maintaining functional liquid-like behaviour without ageing.",

    "abstract": "The search for new approaches in cancer therapy requires a mechanistic understanding of cancer vulnerabilities and anti-cancer drug mechanisms of action. Problematically, some effective therapeutics target cancer vulnerabilities that we do not understand and have poorly defined mechanisms of anti-cancer activity. One such drug is decitabine, which is a frontline therapeutic approved for the treatment of high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine is thought to kill cancer cells selectively via inhibition of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, but the genes and mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we apply an integrated multiomics and CRISPR functional genomics approach to identify genes and processes associated with response to decitabine in AML cells. Our integrated multiomics approach reveals RNA dynamics are key regulators of DNA hypomethylation induced cell death. Specifically, regulation of RNA decapping, splicing and RNA methylation emerge as critical regulators of decitabine killing. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of decitabine anti-cancer activity in treatment of AML and identify combination therapies which could potentiate decitabine anti-cancer activity.",

    "abstract": "Digestive Chagas disease (DCD) is an enteric neuropathy caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection. There is a lack of evidence on the mechanism of pathogenesis and rationales for treatment. We used a mouse model that recapitulates key clinical manifestations to study how infection dynamics shape DCD pathology, and the impact of treatment with the front-line drug benznidazole. Curative treatment at 6 weeks post-infection resulted in sustained recovery of GI transit function, whereas sub-curative treatment led to infection relapse and gradual return of DCD symptoms. Neuro-immune gene expression profiles shifted from chronic inflammation to a tissue repair signature after cure, accompanied by increased glial cell activity and regenerative neurogenesis in the myenteric neuronal plexus. Delaying treatment until 24 weeks post-infection led to a partial reversal of the DCD phenotype, suggesting the accumulation of permanent tissue damage over the course of chronic infection. Our study shows that murine DCD pathogenesis is sustained by chronic T. cruzi infection and is not an inevitable consequence of acute stage denervation. The risk that irreversible enteric neuromuscular tissue damage and dysfunction will develop highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment. Finally, these findings support the concept of treating asymptomatic T. cruzi infected individuals with benznidazole to prevent DCD development.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revolutionized our understanding of the genetics of complex diseases, such as osteoporosis; however, the challenge has been converting associations to causal genes. Studies have demonstrated the utility of transcriptomics data in linking disease-associated variants to genes; though for osteoporosis, few population transcriptomics datasets have been generated on bone or bone cells, and an even smaller number have profiled individual cell-types. To begin to evaluate approaches to address this challenge, we profiled the transcriptomes of bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) cultured under osteogenic conditions, a popular model of osteoblast differentiation and activity, from five Diversity Outbred (DO) mice using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). The goal of the study was to determine if BMSCs could serve as a model for the generation of cell-type specific transcriptomic profiles of mesenchymal lineage cells derived from large populations of mice to inform genetic studies. We demonstrate that dissociation of BMSCs from a heavily mineralized matrix had little effect on viability or their transcriptomic signatures. Furthermore, we show that BMSCs cultured under osteogenic conditions are diverse and consist of cells with characteristics of mesenchymal progenitors, marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs), osteoblasts, osteocyte-like cells, and immune cells. Importantly, all cells were nearly identical from a transcriptomic perspective to cells isolated directly from bone. We also demonstrated the ability to multiplex single cells and subsequently assign cells to their \"mouse-of-origin\" using demultiplexing approaches based on genotypes inferred from coding SNPs. We employed scRNA-seq analytical tools to confirm the biological identity of profiled cell-types. SCENIC was used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and we showed that identified cell-types show GRNs expected of osteogenic and pre-adipogenic lineage cells. Further, CELLECT analysis showed that osteoblasts, osteocyte-like cells, and MALPs captured a significant component of BMD heritability. Together, these data suggest that BMSCs cultured under osteogenic conditions coupled with scRNA-seq can be used as a scalable and biologically informative model to generate cell-type specific transcriptomic profiles of mesenchymal lineage cells in large mouse, and potentially human, populations.",
