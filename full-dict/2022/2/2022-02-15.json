    "abstract": "ObjectiveMonoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (Mogat1), a lipogenic enzyme that converts monoacylglycerol to diacylglycerol, is highly expressed in adipocytes and may regulate lipolysis by re-esterifying fatty acids released during times when lipolytic rates are low. However, the role of Mogat1 in regulating adipocyte fat storage during differentiation and diet-induced obesity is relatively understudied.\n\nMethodsHere we generated adipocyte-specific Mogat1 knockout mice and subjected them to a high-fat diet to determine the effects of Mogat1 deficiency on diet-induced obesity. We also used Mogat1 floxed mice to develop preadipocyte cell lines wherein Mogat1 could be conditionally knocked out to study adipocyte differentiation in vitro.\n\nResultsIn preadipocytes, we found that Mogat1 knockout at the onset of preadipocyte differentiation prevented the accumulation of glycerolipids and reduced the differentiation capacity of preadipocytes. However, the loss of adipocyte Mogat1 did not affect weight gain or fat mass induced by high-fat diet in mice. Furthermore, loss of Mogat1 in adipocytes did not affect plasma lipid or glucose concentrations or insulin tolerance.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest Mogat1 may play a role in adipocyte differentiation in vitro but not adipose tissue expansion in response to nutrient overload in mice.\n\nSTUDY IMPORTANCEO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIAdipose tissue expansion through adipocyte precursor cell differentiation is critical for proper lipid storage during nutrient overload.\nC_LIO_LIMonoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (Mogat1), a lipogenic enzyme, is highly induced during adipocyte differentiation of human and mouse precursor cells and is reduced in patients with obesity and metabolic dysfunction.\nC_LI\n\nWhat does this study add?O_LIMogat1 deletion during early adipocyte differentiation reduces differentiation capacity, adipogenic gene expression and lowers glycerolipid content of differentiated adipocytes.\nC_LIO_LIAdipocyte Mogat1 expression is dispensable for adiposity and metabolic outcomes high-fat fed mice and suggests compensation from other glycerolipid synthesis enzymes.\nC_LI\n\nHow might these results change the direction of research?O_LIUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms of glycerolipid metabolism healthy adipose tissue expansion.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "O_LIBiological invasions are key to understanding major ecological processes that determine the formation of novel interactions. Flower visitation to alien species may be facilitated by co-flowering natives if they share similar floral traits with the latter. However, if competition for pollinators is important, flower visitation to alien species may be higher if they have traits different from those of native species. We tested whether flower visitation to alien plants depended on phylogenetic relatedness and floral similarity to native plants.\nC_LIO_LIIn a field experiment, we simulated invaded communities by adding potted alien plants into co-flowering native communities. We recorded flower visitation to pairs of 34 alien and 20 native species totalling 151 species combinations for 3,068 hours.\nC_LIO_LIFlower visitation to alien species was highest when they had intermediate floral trait distances to native species, and either low or high phylogenetic distances. The alien plants received more similar flower-visitor groups to natives when they had low phylogenetic and either low or high floral trait distances to native plants.\nC_LIO_LIThe non-linear patterns between flower visitation and similarity of the alien and native species suggest that an interplay of facilitation and competition simultaneously drives the formation of novel plant-pollinator interactions. The shapes of the relationships of phylogenetic and floral trait distances with flower visitation to alien plants were contrasting, possibly due to different strengths of phylogenetic signal among traits.\nC_LIO_LIWe provide experimental evidence for the effects of relatedness and functional similarity to native plants on flower visitation of alien plants.

    "abstract": "Climate change is imposing drier atmospheric and edaphic conditions on temperate forests. Here, we investigated how deep soil (down to 300 cm) water extraction contributed to the provision of water in the Fontainebleau-Barbeau temperate oak forest over two years, including the 2018 record drought. Deep water provision was key to sustain canopy transpiration during drought, with layers below 150 cm contributing up to 60% of the transpired water in August 2018, despite their very low density of fine roots. We further showed that soil databases used to parameterize ecosystem models largely underestimated the amount of water extractable from the soil by trees, due to a considerable underestimation of the tree rooting depth. The consensus database established for France gave an estimate of 207 mm for the soil water holding capacity (SWHC) at Fontainebleau-Barbeau, when our estimate based on the analysis of soil water content measurements was 1.9 times as high, reaching 390{+/-}17 mm. Running the CASTANEA forest model with the database-derived SWHC yielded a 350 gC m-2 y-1 average underestimation of annual gross primary productivity under current climate, reaching up to 700 gC m-2 y-1 under climate change scenario RCP8.5. It is likely that the strong underestimation of SWHC that we show at our site is not a special case, and concerns a large number of forest sites. Thus, we argue for a generalisation of deep soil water content measurements in forests, in order to improve the estimation of SWHC and the simulation of the forest carbon cycle in the current context of climate change.\n\nHighlightsO_LIForest-atmosphere carbon exchanges remained insensitive to record drought.\nC_LIO_LIDeep soil (150-300 cm) provisioned up to 60% of the water transpired by the forest during drought.\nC_LIO_LISoil databases were underestimating soil water holding capacity by a factor of two.\nC_LIO_LISimulated forest productivity is strongly sensitive to soil water holding capacity parameter.\nC_LIO_LIDeep soil water content measurements are urgently needed to correctly estimate the soil water holding capacity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Point mutations and structural variants directly disrupting the coding sequence of MEF2C have been associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), while recent studies have also implicated altered noncoding regulation of MEF2C expression in NDDs. However, the impact of haploinsufficiency of MEF2C on neurodevelopmental pathways and synaptic processes is not well understood, nor are the complex mechanisms that govern regulation of MEF2C. To explore the transcriptional and functional changes associated with coding and noncoding structural variants, we generated an allelic series of 204 isogenic iPSC-derived neuronal cell lines harboring CRISPR-engineered mutations that directly delete predominant isoforms of MEF2C, as well as deletions to the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin loops encompassing MEF2C. We then performed systematic profiling of mutation-specific alterations to transcriptional signatures, regulatory interactions, chromatin contacts, and electrophysiological effects. Our analyses reveal that direct deletion of MEF2C causes differential expression of genes enriched for neurodevelopmental and synaptic-associated pathways, accompanied by a significant reduction in synaptic firing and synchrony in neurons. By contrast, we observe robust buffering against MEF2C regulatory disruption upon deletion of a distal 5q14.3 TAD and loop boundary; however, homozygous loss of proximal loop boundary resulted in significant down-regulation of MEF2C expression and significantly reduced electrophysiological activity that was comparable to direct MEF2C disruption. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the functional impact of MEF2C haploinsufficiency in human-derived neural models and highlight the complex interactions of gene regulation and chromatin topology that challenge a priori regulatory predictions of structural variant disruption to three-dimensional genome organization.",

    "abstract": "Structural arrangement of a bacterial chromosome varies widely between closely related species and can result in significant phenotypic outcomes. The appearance of large-scale chromosomal inversions that are symmetric relative to the dnaA gene (usually linked to oriC, the origin of replication) has been previously observed; however, the overall prevalence of replication-associated structural rearrangements (RASRs) in bacteria and their causal mechanisms are currently unknown. The decreased cost of full-length genome sequencing has led to a rapidly growing collection of complete genomes spanning multiple different clades, therefore allowing an opportunity to examine chromosomal inversions in the context of species spanning diverse phylogenetic classifications. Here we systematically identify the locations of large, chromosomal inversions in species with multiple complete sequenced genomes using the Refseq and Genbank NCBI databases to investigate potential mediating biological mechanisms. Out of the 239 species available with 10 or more complete genomes, 206 contained sequences with at least one large ([&ge;]50Kb) inversion in their set of within-species sequence comparisons. We observed 73.4% of the 127,161 large inversions were centered at a point within 10% proportionate distance to the annotated dnaA gene, which is often nearby the origin of replication. Inversions offset from the annotated dnaA sequence were generally confirmed to be centered on the actual origin of replication. Equidistant breakpoints from the replication origin and prevalence of flanking repeats provide evidence that the breaks that are formed during the replication process are then repaired to opposing positions. We also found a strong relationship between the later stages of replication and the range in variation of distance from symmetry, suggesting that replication fork arrest may be a mechanistic cause for the asymmetry in some inversions.",

    "abstract": "Promiscuous post-translational modification (PTM) enzymes often display non-obvious substrate preferences by acting on diverse yet well-defined sets of peptides and/or proteins. Thorough understanding of substrate fitness landscapes for promiscuous PTM enzymes is important because they play key roles in many areas of contemporary science, including natural product biosynthesis, molecular biology and biotechnology. Here, we report the development of an integrated platform for accurate profiling of substrate preferences for PTM enzymes. The platform features a combination of i) mRNA display with next generation sequencing as an ultrahigh throughput technique for data acquisition and ii) deep learning for data analysis. The high accuracy (>0.99 in each of two studies) and generalizability of the resulting deep learning models enables comprehensive analysis of enzymatic substrate preferences. The models can be utilized to quantify fitness across sequence space, map modification sites, and identify important amino acids in the substrate. To benchmark the platform, we perform substrate specificity profiling of a Ser dehydratase (LazBF) and a Cys/Ser cyclodehydratase (LazDEF), two enzymes from the lactazole biosynthesis pathway. In both studies, our results point to highly complex enzymatic preferences, which, particularly for LazBF, cannot be reduced to a set of simple rules. The ability of the constructed models to dissect and analyze such complexity suggests that the developed platform can facilitate the wider study of PTM enzymes.",

In contrast, the placement of the repressive histone modification, H3K27me3, by BASP1 does require BASP1 lipidation.

We find that [~]50% of BASP1 target genes show lipidation-dependent chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression.

Here, we report that KLP-12, a C. elegans kinesin-4 ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, is essential for proper length control of C. elegans axons, and its motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in vitro. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin, which represents the high-resolution structural snapshot of inhibition state of microtubule-end dynamics, revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin. Comparison with the KIF5B-tubulin and KIF2C-tubulin complexes, which represent the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends, respectively, showed the curvature of tubulin introduced by KLP-12 is in between them. Taken together, KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VOC) contains fifteen mutations on the receptor binding domain (RBD), evading most neutralizing antibodies from vaccinated sera. Emerging evidence suggests that Omicron breakthrough cases are associated with substantially lower antibody titers than other VOC cases. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, using a novel geometric deep-learning model, we discovered that the antigenic profile of Omicron RBD is distinct from the prior VOCs, featuring reduced antigenicity in its remodeled receptor binding sites (RBS). To substantiate our deep-learning prediction, we immunized mice with different recombinant RBD variants and found that the Omicrons extensive mutations can lead to a drastically attenuated serologic response with limited neutralizing activity in vivo, while the T cell response remains potent. Analyses of serum cross-reactivity and competitive ELISA with epitope-specific nanobodies revealed that the antibody response to Omicron was reduced across RBD epitopes, including both the variable RBS and epitopes without any known VOC mutations. Moreover, computational modeling confirmed that the RBS is highly versatile with a capacity to further decrease antigenicity while retaining efficient receptor binding. Longitudinal analysis showed that this evolutionary trend of decrease in antigenicity was also found in hCoV229E, a common cold coronavirus that has been circulating in humans for decades. Thus, our study provided unprecedented insights into the reduced antibody titers associated with Omicron infection, revealed a possible trajectory of future viral evolution and may inform the vaccine development against future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Here we report the first experimental validation of the possibility for obtaining immune milk with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from vaccinated cow and goat using recombinant protein human vaccine, ZF-UZ-VAC2001. In the period of two weeks after first vaccination, we detected the neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus in the blood serum of vaccinated animals. The neutralizing activity, in its peak on the 21st days after receiving the third dose (77th day from first dose), was effective in Neutralization Test using a live SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells, even after 120-fold serum titration. Colostrum of the first day after 3rd dose vaccinated cow after calving had a greater activity to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 compared to colostrum of subsequent three days (4.080 {micro}g/ml vs 2.106, 1.960 and 1.126 {micro}g/ml), goat milk (1,486 {micro}g/ml), and cow milk (0.222 {micro}g/ml) in MAGLUMI(R) SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay. We observed a positive correlation of receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG antibodies between the serum of actively immunized cow and milk-feeding calf during the entire course of vaccination (r = 0.95, p = 0.027). We showed an optimal regime for immune milk pasteurization at 62.5{degrees}C for 30 min, which retained specific neutralizing activity to SARS-CoV-2, potentially useful for passive immunization against coronavirus infection threats.",

    "abstract": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen commonly repurposed for genetic modification of crops. Despite its versatility, it remains inefficient at transferring DNA to many hosts, including to animal cells. Like many pathogens, physical contact between A. tumefaciens and host cells promotes infection efficacy. Thus, improving the strength and specificity of A. tumefaciens to target cells has the potential for enhancing DNA transfer for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes. Here we demonstrate a methodology for engineering genetically-encoded exogeneous adhesins at the surface of A. tumefaciens. We identified an autotransporter gene we named Aat, that is predicted to show canonical {beta}-barrel and passenger domains. We engineered the {beta}-barrel scaffold and linker (Aat{beta}) to display synthetic adhesins susceptible to rewire A. tumefaciens to alternative host targets. As a proof of concept, we leveraged the versatility of a VHH domain to rewire A. tumefaciens adhesion to yeast and mammalian hosts displaying a GFP target receptor. Finally, to demonstrate how synthetic A. tumefaciens adhesion can improve transfer to host cells, we showed improved protein translocation into HeLa cells using a sensitive split luciferase reporter system. Engineering A. tumefaciens adhesion has therefore a strong potential in generating complex heterogeneous cellular assemblies and in improving DNA transfer efficiency against non-natural hosts.",

    "abstract": "In parallel with vaccination, oral antiviral agents are highly anticipated to act as countermeasures for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Oral antiviral medication demands not only high antiviral activity but also target specificity, favorable oral bioavailability, and high metabolic stability. Although a large number of compounds have been identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, few have proven to be effective in vivo. Here, we show that oral administration of S-217622, a novel inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, also known as 3C-like protease), decreases viral load and ameliorates the disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. S-217622 inhibited viral proliferation at low nanomolar to sub-micromolar concentrations in cells. Oral administration of S-217622 demonstrated eminent pharmacokinetic properties and accelerated recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamster recipients. Moreover, S-217622 exerted antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including the highly pathogenic Delta variant and the recently emerged Omicron variant. Overall, our study provides evidence that S-217622, an antiviral agent that is under evaluation in a phase II/III clinical trial, possesses remarkable antiviral potency and efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and is a prospective oral therapeutic option for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpidemiological surveillance relies on microbial strain typing, which defines genomic relatedness among isolates to identify case clusters and their potential sources. No consensus exists on the choice of thresholds of genomic relatedness to define clusters. While a priori defined thresholds are often applied, outbreak-specific features such as pathogen mutation rate and duration of source contamination should be considered.\n\nMethodsWe developed a forward model of bacterial evolution to simulate mutation within a population diversifying at a specific mutation rate, with specific outbreak duration and sample isolation dates. Based on the resulting expected distribution of genetic distances we define a threshold beyond which isolates are considered as not part of the outbreak. We additionally embedded the model into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference framework to estimate, from data including sampling dates or isolates genetic variation, the most credible mutation rate or time since source contamination.\n\nFindingsA simulation study validated the model over realistic durations and mutation rates. When applied to 16 published datasets describing foodborne outbreaks, our framework consistently identified outliers. Appropriate thresholds for grouping cases were obtained for 14 outbreaks. For the remaining two outbreaks, re-estimation of the duration of outbreak lead to updated threshold values and was more likely, given our model, to result in the observed genetic distances.\n\nInterpretationWe propose an evolutionary approach to the  single strain conundrum by defining the genetic threshold based on individual outbreak properties. The framework provides an informed estimation of the likelihood of a cluster given the samples epidemiological and microbiological context. This forward model, applicable to foodborne or environmental-source single point case clusters or outbreaks, will be useful for epidemiological surveillance and to guide control measures.\n\nFundingThis work was supported financially by the MedVetKlebs project, a component of European Joint Programme One Health EJP, which has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 773830. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published between database inception and April 3, 2021, with the term (threshold OR cut-off OR genetic relatedness) AND (outbreak) AND (cgMLST OR wgMLST OR SNPs) AND (microbial OR bacteria OR bacterial OR pathogen). We found 222 related articles. Most studies define a fixed SNP threshold that relate outbreak strains based on previous observations. One original study identifies outbreak clusters based on transmission events. However, it relies on strong assumptions about molecular clock and transmission processes.\n\nAdded value of this studyOur study describes a new method based on a forward Wright-Fisher model to find the most credible genetic distance threshold. This method is fast and simple to use with only few assumptions, informed by outbreak duration and pathogen mutation rate. By using SNP or cgMLST pairwise distances and sample collection dates of the outbreak of interest, the algorithm provides context-based guidance to separate outbreak strains from outliers.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe fast and easy method developed here enables to move away from a priori defined thresholds. Defining clusters more accurately based on the specific features of outbreaks, and the ability to estimate outbreak duration, will provide the needed precision for epidemiological surveillance and should contribute to leverage molecular epidemiology data more efficiently for the purpose of uncovering contamination sources.\n\nData Availability StatementAll data and code used for this manuscript is available online at https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/BEBP.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFatty acids are the building blocks of complex lipids essential for living organisms. In mosquitoes, fatty acids are involved in cell membrane production, energy conservation and expenditure, innate immunity, development, and reproduction. Fatty acids are synthesized by a multifunctional enzyme complex called fatty acid synthase (FAS). Several paralogues of FAS were found in the Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) mosquito. However, the molecular characteristics and the expression of some of these paralogues have not been investigated.\n\nMethodsGenome assemblies of Ae. aegypti were analyzed and orthologues of human FAS were identified. Phylogenetic analysis and in silico molecular characterization were performed to identify the functional domains of the Ae. aegypti FAS (AaFAS). Quantitative analysis and loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine the significance of different AaFAS transcripts in various stages of development, expression following different diets and the impact of AaFAS on dengue virus, serotype 2 (DENV2) infection and transmission.\n\nResultsWe identified seven putative FAS genes in the Ae. aegypti genome assembly, based on nucleotide similarity to the FAS proteins (tBLASTn) of humans, other mosquitoes and invertebrates. Bioinformatics and molecular analyses suggested that only five of the FAS genes produce mRNA and therefore represent complete gene models. Expression levels of AaFAS varied among developmental stages and between male and female Ae. aegypti. Quantitative analyses revealed that expression of AaFAS1, the putative orthologue of the human FAS, was highest in adult females. Transient knockdown (KD) of AaFAS1 did not induce a complete compensation by other AaFAS genes but limited DENV2 infection of Aag2 cells in culture and the midgut of the mosquito.\n\nConclusionAaFAS1 is the predominant AaFAS in the adult mosquitoes. It has the highest amino acid similarity to human FAS and contains all enzymatic domains typical of human FAS. AaFAS1 also facilitated DENV2 replication in both cell culture and in mosquito midguts. Our data suggest that AaFAS1 may play a role in transmission of dengue viruses, and could represent a target for intervention strategies.",

While key features have been revealed for avian influenza A virus (AIV) in waterfowl of the Northern Hemisphere, the role of host phylogeny has received limited attention. Herein, we analysed 12339 oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and 10826 serum samples collected over 11 years from wild birds in Australia. As well as describing species-level differences in prevalence and seroprevalence, we reveal that host phylogeny is a key driver in susceptibility. We confirm the role of age in AIV seroprevalence and viral prevalence. Seasonality effects appear less pronounced than in the Northern Hemisphere, while annual variations are potentially linked to El Nino- Southern Oscillation. Taken together, our study provides new insights into evolutionary ecology of AIV in its avian hosts, defining distinctive processes on the continent of Australia and expanding our understanding of AIV globally.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation boosts the availability of electron acceptors in the intestinal lumen creating a favorable niche for pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. However, the mechanisms linking intestinal inflammation-mediated changes in luminal metabolites and pathogen expansion remain unclear. Here, we show that mucosal inflammation induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) infection and chemical colitis results in increased intestinal levels of the amino acid aspartate. The S. Tm and E. coli genomes encode an aspartate ammonia-lyase (aspA) which converts aspartate into fumarate, an alternative electron acceptor. S. Tm and pathogenic E. coli used aspA-dependent fumarate respiration for growth in the murine gut only during inflammation. Such growth advantage was abolished in the gut of germ-free mice. However, mono-association of gnotobiotic mice with members of the classes Bacteroidia and Clostridia restored the benefit of aspartate utilization to the pathogens. Our findings demonstrate the role of microbiota-derived amino acids in driving respiration-dependent Enterobacteriaceae expansion during colitis.",

    "abstract": "The viruses that infect bacteria, bacteriophages (or phages), possess numerous genes of unknown function. Genetic tools are required to understand their biology and enhance their efficacy as antimicrobials. Pseudomonas aeruginosa jumbo phage {Phi}KZ and its relatives are a broad host range phage family that assemble a proteinaceous \"phage nucleus\" structure during infection. Due to the phage nucleus, DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas is ineffective against this phage and thus there are currently no reverse genetic tools for this family. Here, we develop a DNA phage genome editing technology using the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13a enzyme as a selection tool, an anti-CRISPR gene (acrVIA1) as a selectable marker, and homologous recombination. Precise insertion of foreign genes, gene deletions, and the addition of chromosomal fluorescent tags into the {Phi}KZ genome were achieved. Deletion of phuZ, which encodes a tubulin-like protein that centers the phage nucleus during infection, led to the mispositioning of the phage nucleus but surprisingly had no impact on phage replication, despite a proposed role in capsid trafficking. A chromosomal fluorescent tag placed on gp93, a proposed \"inner body\" protein in the phage head revealed a protein that is injected with the phage genome, localizes with the maturing phage nucleus, and is massively synthesized around the phage nucleus late in infection. Successful editing of two other phages that resist DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems [OMKO1 ({Phi}KZ-like) and PaMx41] demonstrates the flexibility of this method. RNA-targeting Cas13a system holds great promise for becoming a universal genetic editing tool for intractable phages. This phage genetic engineering platform enables the systematic study of phage genes of unknown function and the precise modification of phages for use in a variety of applications.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/480438v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b1b4a6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cb0e08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1064217org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dcfbb5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The recent development of prime editing (PE) genome engineering technologies has the potential to significantly simplify the generation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based disease models. PE is a multi-component editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair (HDR) of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs (ngRNAs) improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared to transfecting the prime editing components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinsons disease in hPSCs.",

GPRC6A functions as a master regulator of energy metabolism and sex hormone production. Based on homology to the related receptors mGluR5 and CaSR, GPRC6As multiple ligand specificity is likely based on an orthosteric ligand binding site in the bilobed Venus fly trap (VFT) domain together with two positive allosteric modulator (PAM) sites, one in the VFT and the other in the 7TM domain. Here, we show that Ocn acts as a PAM for GPRC6A by binding to a site in the VFT that is distinct from the orthosteric site for calcium and L-amino acids. In agreement with this finding, alternatively spliced GPRC6A isoforms 2 and 3, which lack regions of the VFT, and mutations in the predicted Ocn binding site, K352E and H355P, prevent Ocn activation of GPRC6A. These observations provide a structural framework for understanding the ability of multiple distinct classes of compounds to activate GPRC6A and set the stage to develop novel small molecules to activate and inhibit this receptor.",

Here we examined the changes in the landscape of transcription start sites (TSSs) and alternative promoter (AP) usage and their impact on the translatome in TCL1-driven chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our findings revealed a marked elevation of APs in CLL cells from E{micro}-Tcl1 transgenic mice, which are particularly enriched with intragenic promoters that generate N-terminally truncated or modified proteins. Intragenic promoter activation is mediated by (i) loss of function of  closed chromatin epigenetic regulators due to the generation of inactive N-terminally modified isoforms or reduced expression; (ii) upregulation of transcription factors, including c-Myc, targeting the intragenic promoters and associated enhancers. Exogenous expression of Tcl1 in MEFs is sufficient to induce intragenic promoters of epigenetic regulators and promote c- Myc expression. We further found a dramatic translation downregulation of transcripts bearing CNY cap-proximal tri-nucleotides, reminiscent of cells undergoing metabolic stress. These findings uncovered the role of Tcl1 oncogenic function in altering promoter usage and mRNA translation in leukemogenesis.",

This limits our ability to characterize cell-fate decision processes that are key for development, immune response, tissue homeostasis, and many other biological functions. It is therefore important to separate the contributions from signal and noise in single-cell measurements. Addressing this issue rigorously requires deconvolving the noise distribution from the signal, but approaches in that direction are still limited. Here we present a non-parametric Bayesian formalism that performs such a deconvolution efficiently on multidimensional measurements, in a way that allows us to estimate confidence intervals. We use the approach to study the expression of the mesodermal transcription factor Brachyury in mouse embryonic stem cells undergoing differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila cellularization is a special form of cleavage that converts syncytial embryos into cellular blastoderms by partitioning the peripherally localized nuclei into individual cells. An early event in cellularization is the recruitment of non-muscle myosin II (\"myosin\") to the basal tip of cleavage furrows, where myosin forms an interconnected basal array before reorganizing into individual cytokinetic rings. The initial recruitment and organization of basal myosin are regulated by a cellularization-specific gene, dunk, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Through a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified anillin (Scraps in Drosophila), a conserved scaffolding protein in cytokinesis, as the primary binding partner of Dunk. We show that Dunk regulates the localization of anillin at the cleavage furrows during early cellularization and functionally interacts with anillin in regulating basal myosin. Furthermore, we show that anillin colocalizes with myosin since the onset of cellularization and is required for the initial recruitment and maintenance of myosin at the basal array, prior to the well-documented function of anillin in regulating cytokinetic ring assembly. Based on these results, we propose that Dunk regulates myosin recruitment and organization during early cellularization by interacting with and regulating anillin.",

    "abstract": "Microbial interactions are expected to modulate microbial diversity, but whether they inhibit or stimulate further diversity in complex microbial communities, and how, remains poorly understood. By assembling microbial communities in multiple identical habitats with a single limiting nutrient, here we provide direct evidence for the role of microbial niche construction and cross-feeding in driving a positive relationship between community diversity and focal lineage diversity in microbial communities. Combining these experiments with simulations, we show that this positive relationship is not inevitable but depends on the underlying metabolic structure of by-product secretions and uptake between different taxonomic levels.",

    "abstract": "Although long-read sequencing can often enable chromosome-level reconstruction of genomes, it is still unclear how one can routinely obtain gapless assemblies. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, other than the reference accession Col-0, all other accessions de novo assembled with long-reads until now have used PacBio continuous long reads (CLR). Although these assemblies sometimes achieved chromosome-arm level contigs, they inevitably broke near the centromeres, excluding megabases of DNA from analysis in pan-genome projects. Since PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) reads circumvent the high error rate of CLR technologies, albeit at the expense of read length, we compared a CLR assembly of accession Ey15-2 to HiFi assemblies of the same sample performed by five different assemblers starting from subsampled data sets, allowing us to evaluate the impact of coverage and read length. We found that centromeres and rDNA clusters are responsible for 71% of contig breaks in the CLR scaffolds, while relatively short stretches of GA/TC repeats are at the core of >85% of the unfilled gaps in our best HiFi assemblies. Since the HiFi technology consistently enabled us to reconstruct gapless centromeres and 5S rDNA clusters, we demonstrate the value of the approach by comparing these previously inaccessible regions of the genome between two A. thaliana accessions.",

The Shigella flexneri effector OspI targets the host Ubc13 and modifies this enzyme by deamidation of Gln100 into Glu100. This modification inhibits the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-catalyzed ubiquitination and diacylglycerol-CBM (CARD-Bcl10- Malt1)-TRAF6-NF-{kappa}B signal activation. We have previously reported the wild-type OspI crystal structure, but the catalytic triad does not form the canonical active site. Here, the crystal structure of OspI with a C62S mutation was determined at a resolution of 2.2 [A]. This C62S mutant structure provided the active site conformation with the catalytic site of OspI.",

    "abstract": "Fungi of the genus Trichoderma have been marketed for the control of crop pests, weeds, and diseases. However, some Trichoderma species may produce toxic secondary metabolites; the existence of these compounds in bioformulated products, along with their relative risk, should receive due attention to ensure human safety. In this study, we investigated the in vitro antagonistic potential of T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 as a biocontrol agent against F. xylarioides and the associated antagonistic mechanism with bioactive substances. Swiss albino mice were used to evaluate the in vivo toxicity and pathogenicity of T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 methanolic crude extracts and spore suspensions, respectively, in a preliminary safety assessment for use as biofungicides. Metabolite profiling of the crude extracts were performed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The agar diffusion assay of the crude extracts from both T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 were the most effective at a concentration of 200g/mL, causing 62.5%, and 74.3% inhibition, respectively. A GC-MS analysis of crude extracts from both bioagents identified 23 volatile secondary metabolites classified as alcohols, acids, sesquiterpenes, ketones and aromatic compounds. The oral administration of crude extracts (doses of 600, 1200, 2000 and 5000 mg/kg body weight) and spore suspensions (doses of 1 x 106, 1 x 107, 1 x 108 and 1 x 109 spores/mL) to female Swiss albino mice over 14 days did not show any significant signs of toxicity, mortality or changes to body weight. The highest dose, 5000 mg/kg, can be used to determine the no observed effect level of crude extracts and spore suspensions of T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 when calculating safety margins. It can be concluded that these two Trichoderma species can serve as a biocontrol agents against F. xylarioides and the mechanism for this function was due to the secondary metabolites with effective bioactive substance. Moreover, the tested spore suspensions and crude extracts were not pathogenic or toxic, respectively, when administered to Swiss albino mice at various doses.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of the conformation and primary structure of an epitope to overall antigen-antibody interaction (AAI) at denatured, native or formalin fixed (FF) state were compared using six randomly chosen commercial antibodies using Quantitative Dot Blot (QDB) method. AAIs at native and FF states were found ranged 1.3 [~] 10.2 and 0.5 [~] 45.4 folds, respectively, over those at denatured state in cellular and tissue lysates. Using two antibodies against different epitopes of PYGL protein, we showed that PYGL levels in several types of tissues and cell lines were highly correlated (r=0.99 from Pearson, p<0.0001, n=25) when measured with these two antibodies at native state. Yet, one antibody was found to be nonspecific with one type of these tissues using Western blot analysis. These observations suggested that the conformation of an epitope may serve as dominant contributor of overall AAI at native state in general, regardless of linear or conformational epitopes. In many cases, it would override nonspecific interactions formed at denatured state to challenge Western blot analysis as a validation tool for antibodies intended for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ELISA.",

    "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is an emerging human pathogen associated with a number of intestinal conditions including colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Screening for gut-derived strains that exhibit anti-F. nucleatum activity revealed Streptococcus salivarius DPC6487 as a strain of interest. Whole genome sequencing analysis of DPC6487 resulted in the identification of a gene predicted to encode a novel nisin variant designated nisin G. The structural nisin G peptide differs from the prototypical nisin A with respect to seven amino acids (Ile4Tyr, Ala15Val, Gly18Ala, Asn20His, Met21Leu, His27Asn and His31Ile), including differences that have not previously been associated with a natural nisin variant. The nisin G gene cluster consists of nsgGEFABTCPRK with transposases encoded between the nisin G structural gene (nsgA) and nsgF. The cluster lacked an equivalent to the nisI immunity determinant. S. salivarius DPC6487 exhibited a narrower spectrum of activity compared to the nisin A producer, Lactococcus lactis NZ9700, when assessed through deferred antagonism-based assays. Such narrow spectrum activity is desirable as it is less likely to lead to collateral damage to gut commensals.\n\nUltimately, this is the first report of a nisin variant produced by a representative of a species that is frequently a focus for probiotic development. The production of this bacteriocin by a gut-derived S. salivarius and its narrow spectrum activity against F. nucleatum indicates that this strain merits further attention to determine its potential for probiotic-related applications.",
