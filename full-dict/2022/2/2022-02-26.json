    "abstract": "IntroductionFive year survival of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains low. Current murine models may not adequately mimic human PC and can be too small for medical device development. A large animal PC model could address these issues. We induced and characterized pancreatic tumors in Oncopigs (transgenic swine with a somatic floxed cassette containing KRASG12D and TP53R167H).\n\nMethodsOncopigs underwent injection of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre) +/- interleukin 8 (IL-8) into one of the main pancreatic ducts (induction procedure). Subjects were necropsied after [&le;]10 week, followed by histological analysis, cytokine expression analysis, exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of resultant tumors.\n\nResultsFourteen Oncopigs underwent the induction procedure; ten (71%) had gross tumor within three weeks, one of these subjects expired suddenly and the other 9 required premature euthanasia secondary to lack of oral intake. At necropsy all of ten of these subjects had gastric outlet obstruction secondary to pancreatic tumor and phlegmon. Two Oncopigs underwent a control injection (no AdCre) and four WT littermates of the Oncopigs underwent AdCre injection without notable effect. Exome and transcriptome analysis of the porcine pancreatic tumors revealed similarity with the molecular signatures and pathways of human PC.\n\nConclusionOncopigs with ductal injection of AdCre developed pancreatic tumor in a short period of time with molecular characteristics similar to human PC. While further optimization and validation of this porcine PC model would be beneficial, it is anticipated that this model will be useful for focused research and development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for PC.",

    "abstract": "Phase is the most fundamental physical quantity when we study an oscillatory time series. There are many tools aiming to estimate phase, most of them are developed based on the analytic function model. Unfortunately, this approach might not be suitable for modern signals with intrinsic nonstartionary structure, including multiple oscillatory components, each with time-varying frequency, amplitude, and non-sinusoidal oscillation, e.g., biomedical signals. Specifically, due to the lack of consensus of model and algorithm, phases estimated from signals simultaneously recorded from different sensors for the same physiological system from the same subject might be different. This fact might challenge reproducibility, communication, and scientific interpretation and thus we need a standardized approach with theoretical support over a unified model. In this paper, after summarizing existing models for phase and discussing the main challenge caused by the above-mentioned intrinsic nonstartionary structure, we introduce the adaptive non-harmonic model (ANHM), provide a definition of phase called fundamental phase, which is a vector-valued function describing the dynamics of all oscillatory components in the signal, and suggest a time-varying bandpass filter (tvBPF) scheme based on time-frequency analysis tools to estimate the fundamental phase. The proposed approach is validated with a simulated database and a real-world database with experts labels, and it is applied to two real-world databases, each of which has biomedical signals recorded from different sensors, to show how to standardize the definition of phase in the real-world experimental environment. Specifically, we report that the phase describing a physiological system, if properly modeled and extracted, is immune to the selected sensor for that system, while other approaches might fail. In conclusion, the proposed approach resolves the above-mentioned scientific challenge. We expect its scientific impact on a broad range of applications.",

    "abstract": "We develop a model of latch-mediated spring actuated (LaMSA) systems relevant to comparative biomechanics and bioinspired design. The model contains five components: two motors (muscles), a spring, a latch, and a load mass. One motor loads the spring to store elastic energy and the second motor subsequently removes the latch, which releases the spring and causes movement of the load mass. We develop open-source software to accompany the model, which provides an extensible framework for simulating LaMSA systems. Output from the simulation includes information from the loading and release phases of motion, which can be used to calculate kinematic performance metrics that are important for biomechanical function. In parallel, we simulate a comparable, directly actuated system that uses the same motor and mass combinations as the LaMSA simulations. By rapidly iterating through biologically relevant input parameters to the model, simulated kinematic performance differences between LaMSA and directly actuated systems can be used to explore the evolutionary dynamics of biological LaMSA systems and uncover design principles for bioinspired LaMSA systems. As proof of principle of this concept, we compare a LaMSA simulation to a directly actuated simulation that includes a either Hill-type force-velocity trade-off or muscle activation dynamics, or both. For the biologically-relevant range of parameters explored, we find that the muscle force-velocity trade-off and muscle activation have similar effects on directly actuated performance. Including both of these dynamic muscle properties increases the accelerated mass range where a LaMSA system outperforms a directly actuated one.",

    "abstract": "Native Americans domesticated maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) from lowland teosinte parviglumis (Zea mays ssp.parviglumis) in the warm Mexican southwest and brought it to the highlands of Mexico and South America where it was exposed to lower temperatures that imposed strong selection on flowering time. Phospholipids are important metabolites in plant responses to low-temperature and phosphorus availability, and have been suggested to influence flowering time. Here, we combined linkage mapping with genome scans to identify High PhosphatidylCholine 1 (HPC1), a gene that encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme, as a major driver of phospholipid variation in highland maize. Common garden experiments demonstrated strong genotype-by-environment interactions associated with variation at HPC1, with the highland HPC1 allele leading to higher fitness in highlands, possibly by hastening flowering. The highland maize HPC1 variant resulted in impaired function of the encoded protein due to a polymorphism in a highly conserved sequence. A meta-analysis across HPC1 orthologs indicated a strong association between the identity of the amino acid at this position and optimal growth in prokaryotes. Mutagenesis of HPC1 via genome editing validated its role in regulating phospholipid metabolism. Finally, we showed that the highland HPC1 allele entered cultivated maize by introgression from the wild highland teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana and has been maintained in maize breeding lines from the Northern US, Canada and Europe. Thus, HPC1 introgressed from teosinte mexicana underlies a large metabolic QTL that modulates phosphatidylcholine levels and has an adaptive effect at least in part via induction of early flowering time.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people globally and continues to undergo evolution. Emerging variants can be partially resistant to vaccine induced immunity and therapeutic antibodies, emphasizing the urgent need for accessible, broad-spectrum therapeutics. Here, we report a comprehensive study of ensovibep, the first trispecific clinical DARPin candidate, that can simultaneously engage all three units of the spike protein trimer to potently inhibit ACE2 interaction, as revealed by structural analyses. The cooperative binding of the individual modules enables ensovibep to retain inhibitory potency against all frequent SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, as of February 2022. Moreover, viral passaging experiments show that ensovibep, when used as a single agent, can prevent development of escape mutations comparably to a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Finally, we demonstrate that the very high in vitro antiviral potency also translates into significant therapeutic protection and reduction of pathogenesis in Roborovski dwarf hamsters infected with either the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type or the Alpha variant. In this model, ensovibep prevents fatality and provides substantial protection equivalent to the standard of care mAb cocktail. These results support further clinical evaluation and indicate that ensovibep could be a valuable alternative to mAb cocktails and other treatments for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The human myocardium is a mechanically active tissue typified by anisotropic organization of the resident cells (cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (cFBs)) and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Upon ischemic injury, the anisotropic tissue is replaced by disorganized scar tissue, eventually resulting in loss of coordinated contraction. Efforts to re-establish tissue anisotropy in the injured myocardium are hampered by a lack of understanding on how CM and/or cFB structural organization is affected by the two major physical cues inherent in the myocardium: ECM organization and cyclic mechanical strain. Herein, we investigate the singular and combined effect of ECM (dis)organization and cyclic strain in a 2D human in vitro co-culture model of the myocardial microenvironment. We show that (an)isotropic ECM protein patterning can guide the orientation of CMs and cFBs, both in mono- and co-culture. Subsequent application of uniaxial cyclic strain - mimicking the local anisotropic deformation of beating myocardium - causes no effect when applied parallel to the anisotropic ECM. However, when cultured on isotropic substrates, cFBs, but not CMs, orient away from the direction of cyclic uniaxial strain (strain avoidance). In contrast, CMs show strain avoidance via active remodeling of their sarcomeres only when co-cultured with at least 30% cFBs. Paracrine signaling or N-cadherin-mediated communication between CMs and cFBs were no contributing factors, but our findings suggest that the mechanoresponsive cFBs provide structural guidance for CM orientation and elongation. Our study therefore highlights a synergistic mechanobiological interplay between CMs and cFBs in shaping tissue organization, which is of relevance for regenerating functionally organized myocardium.",

    "abstract": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are prototypical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), members of a large family of seven transmembrane receptors mediating a wide variety of extracellular signals. We show here, for the first time in a GPCR, that the carboxyl terminal fragment of the muscarinic M2 receptor, comprising the transmembrane regions 6 and 7 (M2tail), is expressed by virtue of an internal ribosome entry site located in the third intracellular loop. Single cell imaging reveals that M2tail, whose expression is upregulated in cells undergoing integrated stress response, does not follow the normal route to the plasma membrane, but is almost exclusively sorted to the mitochondria inner membrane: here it controls oxygen consumption, cell proliferation and the formation of reactive oxygen species by reducing oxidative phosphorylation. Crispr/Cas9 editing of the key methionine where cap-independent translation begins in human induced pluripotent stem cells, reveals the physiological role of this process in influencing cell proliferation and oxygen consumption at the endogenous level. The expression of the C-terminal domain of a GPCR, capable of regulating mitochondrial function, constitutes a hitherto unknown mechanism notably unrelated to its canonical signalling function as a GPCR at the plasma membrane. This work thus highlights a potential novel mechanism thar cells may use for controlling their metabolism under variable environmental conditions, notably as a negative regulator of cell respiration.",

    "abstract": "Vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) leads with high frequency to congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), whose worst outcome is microcephaly. However, the mechanisms of congenital ZIKV neurodevelopmental pathologies, including direct cytotoxicity to neural progenitor cells (NPC), placental insufficiency, and immune responses, remain incompletely understood. At the cellular level, microcephaly typically results from death or insufficient proliferation of NPC or cortical neurons. NPCs replicate fast, requiring efficient DNA damage responses to ensure genome stability. Like congenital ZIKV infection, mutations in the polynucleotide 5-kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP) gene, which encodes a critical DNA damage repair enzyme, results in recessive syndromes often characterized by congenital microcephaly with seizures (MCSZ). We thus tested whether there were any links between ZIKV and PNKP.\n\nHere we show that two PNKP phosphatase inhibitors or PNKP knockout inhibited ZIKV replication. PNKP relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells, co-localizing with the marker of ZIKV replication factories (RF) NS1 and resulting in functional nuclear PNKP depletion. Although infected NPC accumulated DNA damage, they failed to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. ZIKV also induced activation of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 complexes, which trigger unscheduled mitotic entry. Inhibition of CDK1 activity inhibited ZIKV replication and the formation of RF, supporting a role of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 in RF morphogenesis. In brief, ZIKV infection induces mitotic catastrophe resulting from unscheduled mitotic entry in the presence of DNA damage. PNKP and CycA/CDK1 are thus host factors participating in ZIKV replication in NPC, and pathogenesis to neural progenitor cells.\n\nSignificanceThe 2015-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil and subsequent international epidemic revealed the strong association between ZIKV infection and congenital malformations, mostly neurodevelopmental defects up to microcephaly. The scale and global expansion of the epidemic, the new ZIKV outbreaks (Kerala state, India, 2021), and the potential burden of future ones pose a serious ongoing risk. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms resulting in microcephaly remain incompletely understood. Here we show that ZIKV infection of neuronal progenitor cells results in cytoplasmic sequestration of an essential DNA repair protein itself associated with microcephaly, with the consequent accumulation of DNA damage, together with an unscheduled activation of cytoplasmic CDK1/Cyclin A complexes in the presence of DNA damage. These alterations result in mitotic catastrophe of neuronal progenitors, which would lead to a depletion of cortical neurons during development.",

Ticks lack genes encoding upstream components that initiate the IMD pathway. Despite this deficiency, core signaling molecules are present and functionally restrict tick-borne pathogens. The molecular events preceding activation remain undefined. Here, we show that the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) initiates the IMD network in Ixodes scapularis ticks. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress receptor, IRE1, is phosphorylated in response to tick-borne bacteria, but does not splice the mRNA encoding XBP1. Instead, through protein modeling and reciprocal pulldowns, we show that Ixodes IRE1 complexes with TRAF2. Disrupting IRE1-TRAF2 signaling blocks IMD pathway activation and diminishes the production of reactive oxygen species. Through in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo techniques we demonstrate that the UPR-IMD pathway circuitry limits the Lyme disease-causing spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and the rickettsial agents Anaplasma phagocytophilum and A. marginale (anaplasmosis).

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe rapid and accurate identification of a minimal-size core set of representative microbial species plays an important role in the clustering of microbial community data and interpretation of clustering results. However, the huge dimensionality of microbial metagenomics datasets is a major challenge for the existing methods such as Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) models. In the framework of the existing methods, the computational burden of identifying a small number of representative species from a large number of observed species remains a challenge.\n\nResultsWe proposed a novel framework to improve the performance of the widely used DMM approach by combining three ideas: (i) we extended the finite DMM model to an infinite case by considering Dirichlet process mixtures and estimating the number of clusters as a random variables; (ii) we proposed an indicator variable to identify representative operational taxonomic units that substantially contribute to the differentiation among clusters; and (iii) to address the computational burden of high-dimensional microbiome data, we proposed a stochastic variational inference, which approximates the posterior distribution using a controllable distribution called variational distribution, and stochastic optimization algorithms for fast computation. Using the proposed method, stochastic variational variable selection (SVVS), we analyzed the root microbiome data collected in our soybean field experiment, the human gut microbiome data from three published datasets of large-scale case-control studies and the healthy human microbiome data from the Human Microbiome Project.\n\nConclusionsSVVS demonstrated a better performance and significantly faster computation than those of the existing methods in all cases of testing datasets. In particular, SVVS is the only method that can analyze massive high-dimensional microbial data with more than 50,000 microbial species and 1,000 samples. Furthermore, recent microbiome studies have suggested that selection of the microbial species used as a core set is important.",

    "abstract": "The downregulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellar motility is a key event in biofilm formation, host-colonization, and the formation of microbial communities, but the external factors that repress motility are not well understood. Here, we report that under swarming conditions, swarming motility can be repressed by cells that are non-motile due to the absence of a flagellum or flagellar rotation. Non-swarming cells, due to mutations that prevent either flagellum biosynthesis or rotation, present at 5% of the total population suppressed swarming of wild-type cells under the conditions tested in this study. Non-swarming cells required functional type IV pili and the ability to produce Pel exopolysaccharide to suppress swarming by the flagellated wild type. In contrast, flagellated cells required only type IV pili, but not Pel production, in order for swarming to be repressed by non-flagellated cells. We hypothesize that interactions between motile and non-motile cells may enhance the formation of sessile communities including those involving multiple genotypes, phenotypically-diverse cells, and perhaps other species.\n\nImportanceOur study shows that, under the conditions tested, a small population of non-swarming cells can impact the motility behavior of the larger population. The interactions that lead to the suppression of swarming motility require type IV pili and a secreted polysaccharide, two factors with known roles in biofilm formation. These data suggest that interactions between motile and non-motile cells may enhance the transition to sessile growth in populations and promote interactions between cells with different genotypes.",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing appreciation recently that mutagenic processes can be studied through the lenses of mutational signatures, which represent characteristic mutation patterns attributed to individual mutagens. However, the causal link between mutagens and observed mutation patterns remains not fully understood, limiting the utility of mutational signatures. To gain insights into these relationships, we developed a network-based method, named GO_SCPLOWENEC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW that constructs a directed network among genes and mutational signatures. The approach leverages a sparse partial correlation among other statistical techniques to uncover dominant influence relations between the activities of network nodes. Applying GO_SCPLOWENEC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW to cancer data sets, we uncovered important relations between mutational signatures and several cellular processes that can shed light on cancer related mutagenic processes. Our results are consistent with previous findings such as the impact of homologous recombination deficiency on a clustered APOBEC mutations in breast cancer. The network identified by GO_SCPLOWENEC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW also suggest an interaction between APOBEC hypermutation and activation of regulatory T Cells (Tregs) and a relation between APOBEC mutations and changes in DNA conformation. GO_SCPLOWENEC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW also exposed a possible link between the SBS8 signature of unknown aetiology and the nucleotide excision repair pathway. GO_SCPLOWENEC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW provides a new and powerful method to reveal the relation between mutational signatures and gene expression.\n\nGO_SCPLOWENEC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW is freely available at https://github.com/ncbi/GeneSigNet.",

    "abstract": "Multiple mutations have been seen to undergo convergent evolution in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. One such evolution occurs in Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants at three amino acid positions K417, E484, and N501 in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. We examined the physical mechanisms underlying the convergent evolution of three mutations K417T/E484K/N501Y by delineating the individual and collective effects of mutations on binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, protein stability and expression. Our results show that each mutation serves a distinct function that improves virus fitness supporting its positive selection, even though individual mutations have deleterious effects that make them prone to negative selection. Compared to the wild-type, K417T escapes Class 1 antibodies, has increased stability and expression; however, it has decreased receptor binding. E484K escapes Class 2 antibodies; however, it has decreased receptor binding, stability and expression. N501Y increases receptor binding; however, has decreased stability and expression. When these mutations come together, the deleterious effects are mitigated due to the presence of compensatory effects. Triple mutant K417T/E484K/N501Y has increased receptor binding, escapes both Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies, and has similar stability and expression as that of the wild-type. These results show the implications of presence of multiple mutations on virus evolution that enhance viral fitness on different fronts by balancing both positive and negative selection and improves the chances of selection of mutations together.",

    "abstract": "COVID 19 is the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; SC2) which has caused a world-wide pandemic with striking morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of SC2 strains demonstrated impressive genetic variability and many of these viral variants are now defined as variants of concern (VOC) that cause enhanced transmissibility, decreased susceptibility to antibody neutralization or therapeutics and or the ability to induce severe disease. Currently, the delta ({delta}) and omicron (o) variants are particularly problematic based on their impressive and unprecedented transmissibility and ability to cause break through infections. The delta variant also accumulates at high concentrations in host tissues and has caused waves of lethal disease. Because studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) stimulates ACE2 and Spike (S) priming proteases that mediate SC2 infection, studies were undertaken to determine if interventions that target CHI3L1 are effective inhibitors of SC2 viral variant infection. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 augments epithelial cell infection by pseudoviruses that express the alpha, beta, gamma, delta or omicron S proteins and that the CHI3L1 inhibitors anti-CHI3L1 and kasugamycin inhibit epithelial cell infection by these VOC pseudovirus moieties. Thus, CHI3L1 is a universal, VOC-independent therapeutic target in COVID 19.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of deep-time biodiversity typically rely on statistical methods to mitigate the impacts of sampling biases in the fossil record. However, these methods are limited by the spatial and temporal scale of the underlying data. Here we use a spatially explicit mechanistic model, based on neutral theory, to test hypotheses of early tetrapod diversity change during the late Carboniferous and early Permian, critical intervals for the diversification of vertebrate life on land. Our neutral simulations suggest, in contrast to previous studies, that increases in early tetrapod diversity were not driven by local endemism following the  Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse. We show that apparent changes in face-value diversity can instead be explained by variation in sampling intensity through time. Our results further demonstrate the importance of accounting for sampling biases in analyses of the fossil record and demonstrate the vast potential of mechanistic models, including neutral models, for testing hypotheses in palaeobiology.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is replacing Delta, the most prevalent variant worldwide from the beginning of 2021 until early 2022. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible and responsible for a new worldwide COVID-19 wave. Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (wild type, WT) and the Omicron variant of concern. Structural analyses reveal that the SpikeOmicron presents more conformational flexibility than SpikeWT, mainly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such flexibility results in a broader spectrum of different conformations for SpikeOmicron, whereby the RBD can more easily visit an up-conformational state. We reported how the mutations in this variant may influence the intra- and inter-protomer contacts caused by conformational flexibility of the NTD. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the differences in conformational flexibility between SpikeOmicron and SpikeWT may explain the observed gains in infectivity, immune system evasion and transmissibility in this novel variant.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "The demand of consumers for naturality of food with minimal processing was forced to the scientists for the discovery of non-thermal plasma which is now an emerging technology for the preservation and decontamination of highly perishable food such as milk. In this study, the microbial and physicochemical characteristics of plasma bubbling of raw cow milk were analysed and a comparison of boiled raw cow milk, commercially available pasteurised and UHT milk was observed. Again, shelf-life study was experimented for the plasma bubbling of milk with respect to raw cow milk sample (control). The plasma bubbling was generated at a voltage (200V), the flow rate of air 10 litres/hour (L/h) and applied to fresh cow milk for 5, 10, and 15 minutes (min) of time interval with 100 mL of the sample volume at room temperature. A significant reduction was observed in coliform and yeast at 200V, 10L/h, 15 min time interval of treatment. The pH of the milk was increased significantly to 6.85 after exposure to plasma bubbling. Whereas, a decreasing value was noticed in total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acid (TA) with respect to time given by the plasma bubbling. Further a nondetrimental effect was observed for the nutrient content of plasma bubbling of milk. The result of the study indicates that plasma bubbling at (200V, 10L/h,100mL,15 min) treatment improves the quality of milk. This study shows that indirect dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) (plasma bubbling) may offer an effective microbial reduction without affecting the quality attributes. The plasma bubbling processing is an initiative for cow raw milk pasteurisation, which could have a future perspective on industrial food applications.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are multicellular communities of microbial cells that grow on natural and synthetic surfaces. They have become the major cause for hospital-acquired infections because once they form, they are very difficult to eradicate. Nanotechnology offers a new approach to fight biofilm-associated infections. Here, we report on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with antibacterial ligand epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and the formation of lysozyme protein corona on AgNPs as shown by UV-Vis, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism analyses. We further tested the activity of EGCG-AgNPs and their lysozyme bioconjugates on the viability of Bacillus subtilis cells and biofilm formation. Our results showed that, although EGCG-AgNPs presented no antibacterial activity on planktonic Bacillus subtilis cells, they inhibited B. subtilis biofilm formation at concentrations larger than 40 nM and EGCG-AgNP-lysozyme bioconjugates inhibited biofilms at concentrations above 80 nM. Cytotoxicity assays performed with human cells showed a reverse trend, where EGCG-AgNPs barely affected human cell viability, while EGCG-AgNP-lysozyme bioconjugates severely hampered viability. Our results therefore demonstrate that EGCG-AgNPs may be used as non-cytotoxic antibiofilm agents.",

    "abstract": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons are critical for the function of mature cortical inhibitory circuits. Most of these neurons are enwrapped by a specialized extracellular matrix structure (ECM) called perineuronal net (PNN), which can regulate their synaptic input. In this study, we investigated the relationship between PNNs, parvalbumin interneurons and synaptic distribution on these cells in the adult primary visual cortex (V1) of quadruple knockout mice deficient for the ECM molecules brevican, neurocan, tenascin-C and tenascin-R. We used super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to analyze PNN structure and associated synapses. Additionally, we examined parvalbumin and calretinin interneuron populations. We observed a reduction in the number of PNN-enwrapped cells and a clear disorganization of the PNN structure in the quadruple knockout V1. This was accompanied by an imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory synapses with a reduction of inhibitory and an increase of excitatory synaptic elements along the PNNs. Also, the number of parvalbumin interneurons was reduced in the quadruple knockout, while calretinin interneurons, which do not wear PNNs did not display differences in number. Interestingly, we found the transcription factor Otx2 homeoprotein positive cell population also reduced. Otx2 is crucial for parvalbumin and PNN maturation and a positive feedback loop between these parameters has been described. Collectively, these data indicate an important role of brevican, neurocan, tenascin-C and tenascin-R in regulating the interplay between PNNs, inhibitory interneurons, synaptic distribution as well as Otx2 in the V1.",

    "abstract": "In economic decision-making individuals choose between items based on their perceived value. For both humans and nonhuman primates, these decisions are often carried out while shifting gaze between the available options. Recent studies in humans suggest that these shifts in gaze actively influence choice, manifesting as a bias in favor of the items that are viewed first, viewed last, or viewed for the overall longest duration in a given trial. This suggests a mechanism that links gaze behavior to the neural computations underlying value-based choices. In order to identify this mechanism, it is first necessary to develop and validate a suitable animal model of this behavior. To this end, we have created a novel value-based choice task for macaque monkeys that captures the essential features of the human paradigms in which gaze biases have been observed. Using this task, we identified gaze biases in the monkeys that were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in humans. In addition, the monkeys gaze biases were well-explained using a sequential sampling model framework previously used to describe gaze biases in humans--the first time this framework has been used to assess value-based decision mechanisms in nonhuman primates. Together, these findings suggest a common mechanism that can explain gaze-related choice biases across species, and open the way for mechanistic studies to identify the neural origins of this behavior.",

We asked if the PRP could be reframed to encompass organisms both large and small. We used a synthetic review of recent advances in arid land microbial autoecology combined with a mathematically explicit theoretical model. Preserving the PRPs original core of adaptations by reserve building, the model considers differential organismal strategies to manage these reserves. It proposes a gradient of organisms according to their reserve strategies, from nimble responders (NIRs) to torpid responders (TORs). It predicts how organismal fitness depends on pulse regimes and reserve strategies thus explaining organismal diversification and distribution. After accounting for scaling phenomena and redefining the microscale meaning of aridity, it becomes patent that the PRP is applicable to microbes, and that this modified PRP represents an inclusive theoretical framework working across life-forms.",

Inspired by field theory in physics, we provide a different method called Genomic Informational Field Theory (GIFT). In contrast to GWAS, GIFT assumes that the phenotype is measured precisely enough and/or the number of individuals in the population is too small to permit the creation of categories. To extract information, GIFT uses the information contained in the cumulative sums difference of gene microstates between two configurations: (i) when the individuals are taken at random without information on phenotype values, and (ii) when individuals are ranked as a function of their phenotypic value. The difference in the cumulative sum is then attributed to the emergence of phenotypic fields. We demonstrate that GIFT recovers GWAS, that is, Fishers theory, when the phenotypic fields are linear (first order). However, unlike GWAS, GIFT demonstrates how the variance of microstate distribution density functions can also be involved in genotype-phenotype associations when the phenotypic fields are quadratic (second order). Using genotype-phenotype simulations based on Fishers theory as a toy model, we illustrate the application of the method with a small sample size of 1000 individuals.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease in wheat that causes million dollars of wheat yield losses annually in the U.S.A. Recently we demonstrated that wheat carry FHB susceptible genes and knocking out the susceptible gene increased FHB resistance, which suggests that manipulating susceptible genes using gene editing may open a new avenue to create new sources of FHB resistance. However, wheat genome editing uses gene transformation to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 and gRNA into plants, and most wheat genotypes are not suitable for transformation due to low rates of callus induction and regeneration, therefore it cannot be used in practical wheat breeding. In this study, we developed a new Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated gRNA delivery system that does not need the gene transformation and tissue culture and it can be used in any genotypes for gene function validation and editing. We used this system edited the susceptible allele of Fhb1, a major FHB resistance gene. We demonstrated that the edited trait is heritable in different genetic backgrounds and knocking out Fhb1 susceptible allele improved FHB resistance in wheat. We also modified system to improve editing efficiency by using floral dip agroinfiltration and adding RNA mobility sequences to the gRNA in the viral vectors. We believe this work will facilitate wheat FHB resistance research and gene editing in cereal crops and will benefit cereal crop researchers and breeders worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Autophagosomes are double-membraned vesicles that traffic harmful or unwanted cellular macromolecules to the vacuole for recycling. Although autophagosome biogenesis has been extensively studied, mechanisms of autophagosome maturation, i.e., delivery and fusion with the vacuole, remain largely unknown in plants. Here, we have identified an autophagy adaptor, CFS1, that directly interacts with the autophagosome marker ATG8 and localizes on both membranes of the autophagosome. Autophagosomes form normally in Arabidopsis thaliana cfs1 mutants, but their delivery to the vacuole is disrupted. CFS1s function is evolutionarily conserved in plants as it also localizes to the autophagosomes and plays a role in autophagic flux in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. CFS1 regulates autophagic flux by connecting autophagosomes with the ESCRT-I component VPS23, leading to the formation of amphisomes. Disrupting the VPS23-CFS1 interaction affects autophagic flux and renders plants sensitive to starvation stress. Altogether, our results reveal a deeply conserved mechanism of vacuolar delivery in plants that is mediated by amphisomes.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic cysts are fluid-filled lesions in the liver that are estimated to occur in 5% of the population. They may cause hepatomegaly and abdominal pain. Progression to secondary fibrosis, cirrhosis, or cholangiocarcinoma can lead to morbidity and mortality. Previous studies of patients and rodent models have associated hepatic cyst formation with increased proliferation and fluid secretion in cholangiocytes, which are partially due to impaired primary cilia. Congenital hepatic cysts are thought to originate from faulty bile duct development, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In a forward genetic screen, we identified a zebrafish mutant that develops hepatic cysts during larval stages. Cyst formation in these mutants is not due to changes in biliary cell proliferation, bile secretion, or impairment of primary cilia. Instead, time-lapse live imaging data showed that the mutant biliary cells failed to form interconnecting bile ducts because of defects in motility and protrusive activity. Accordingly, immunostaining revealed an excessive and disorganized actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in the mutant biliary cells. By whole-genome sequencing, we determined that the cystic phenotype in the mutant was caused by a missense mutation in the furinb gene which encodes a proprotein convertase. The mutation alters Furinb localization and causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The cystic phenotype could be suppressed by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid and exacerbated by treatment with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin. The mutant livers also exhibited increased mTOR signaling and treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin partially blocked cyst formation by reducing ER stress. Our study has established a novel vertebrate model for studying hepatic cystogenesis and illustrated the role of ER stress in the disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "ATR kinase is a central regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle checkpoints. ATR kinase inhibitors (ATRis) combine with radiation to generate CD8+ T cell-dependent responses in mouse models of cancer. We show that ATRis induce CDK1-dependent origin firing across active replicons in CD8+ T cells activated ex vivo while simultaneously decreasing the activity of rate-limiting enzymes for nucleotide biosynthesis. These pleiotropic effects of ATRi induce deoxyuridine (dU) contamination in genomic DNA, R loops, RNA-DNA polymerase collisions, and type-1 interferons (IFN-1). Remarkably, thymidine rescues ATRi-induced dU contamination, cell death, and IFN-1 expression in proliferating CD8+ T cells. Thymidine also rescues ATRi-induced cancer cell death. We propose that ATRi-induced dU contamination contributes to dose-limiting leukocytopenia and inflammation in the clinic and CD8+ T cell dependent anti-tumor responses in mouse models. We conclude that ATR is essential to limit dU contamination in genomic DNA and IFN-1 expression.",

ITPA loss-of-function causes inosine di- and triphosphate accumulation in vivo and an elevated (deoxy)inosine content in DNA and RNA, as well as salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, early senescence and upregulation of transcripts associated with immunity and senescence. Cadmium-induced oxidative stress leads to more ITP in the wildtype, and this effect is enhanced in itpa mutants, suggesting that ITP originates from ATP deamination.\n- ITPA is part of a molecular protection system, preventing accumulation of (d)ITP, its usage for nucleic acid synthesis, and probably nucleic acid stress leading to SA accumulation, stress gene induction and early senescence.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of photosystem II (PSII) requires the participation of assembly proteins that facilitate the step-wise association of its protein and pigment components into a functional complex capable of oxidizing water and reducing plastoquinone. We previously identified one such factor, the membrane-bound rubredoxin RBD1, but its precise role remains unknown in part due to the inability of the 2pac mutant strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which lacks RBD1, to accumulate PSII. Here, we show that decreased PSII accumulation in 2pac is due to increased proteolytic degradation. Inactivating the thylakoid membrane FtsH protease in the 2pac mutant background led to an increase in the abundance of PSII subunits and their integration into higher molecular weight complexes, including PSII dimers, capable of sustaining photoautotrophic growth. Dark- and low light-grown 2pac ftsh1-1 both accumulated a 23-kD fragment of the D1 protein, a marker typically associated with structural changes resulting from photodamage or photoinhibition. We introduced a HIS-tagged version of the PsbH protein into the 2pac ftsh1-1 background to purify and examine PSII. We found no detectable changes with respect to cofactor composition relative to the wild-type, leading to us to propose a model in which RBD1 promotes the proper folding of D1, possibly via delivery or reduction of the non-heme iron during PSII assembly. Our results demonstrate that introduction of the ftsh1-1 mutation into mutants defective in the biogenesis of thylakoid membrane complexes can allow for the accumulation and study of aberrant complexes that would otherwise be degraded due to their high protease sensitivity.",

We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from THD patients that were differentiated into dopaminergic neurons (DAn) and compared with control-DAn from healthy individuals and gene-corrected isogenic controls. Consistent with patients, THD iPSC-DAn displayed lower levels of DA metabolites and reduced TH expression, when compared to controls. Moreover, THD iPSC-DAn showed abnormal morphology, including reduced total neurite length and either an abnormal TH proximodistal gradient (THDA), or neurite arborization defects (THDB). Treatment of THD-iPSC-DAn with L-Dopa rescued the neuronal defects and disease phenotype only in THDA-DAn. Interestingly, L-Dopa treatment at the stage of neuronal precursors could prevent the alterations in THDB-iPSC-DAn, thus suggesting the existence of a critical developmental window in THD.

Whether tPBM can modulate brain activity and thereby enhance working memory (WM) capacity in humans remains unclear. In this study, we delivered double-blind and sham-control tPBM with different wavelengths to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 90 healthy participants and conducted four electroencephalography (EEG) experiments to investigate whether individual visual working memory capacity and related neural response could be modulated. We found that 1064 nm tPBM applied to the right PFC has both a substantial impact on visual working memory capacity and occipitoparietal contralateral delay activity (CDA), no matter orientation or color feature of the memorized objects. Importantly, the CDA set-size effect during the retention mediated the effect between 1064 nm tPBM and subsequent WM performance. However, these behavioral benefits and the corresponding changes of CDA set-size effect were absent with tPBM at 852 nm wavelength or with the stimulation on the left PFC. Our findings provide converging evidence that 1064 nm tPBM applied on the right PFC can improve visual working memory capacity, as well as explain the individuals electrophysiological changes about behavioral benefits.",

However, ultrastructural morphological and mechanistic data examining the human keratinocyte-nociceptor interface are sparse. We investigated this exact interface in human skin applying super-resolution array tomography, expansion microscopy, and structured illumination microscopy. We show keratinocyte ensheathment of nociceptors and connexin 43 plaques at keratinocyte-nociceptor contact sites in healthy native skin. We further derived a fully human co-culture system, modeling ensheathment and connexin 43 plaques in vitro. Unraveling human intraepidermal nerve fiber ensheathment and interaction sites marks a milestone in research at the neuro-cutaneous unit.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCognitive flexibility encompasses the ability to efficiently shift focus and forms a critical component of goal-directed attention. The neural substrates of this process are incompletely understood in part due to difficulties in sampling the involved circuitry.\n\nMethodsStereotactic intracranial recordings that permit direct resolution of local-field potentials from otherwise inaccessible structures were employed to study moment-to-moment attentional activity in children with epilepsy during the performance of an attentional set-shifting task. A combined deep learning and model-agnostic feature explanation approach was used to analyze these data and decode attentionally-relevant neural features. Connectomic profiling of highly predictive attentional nodes was further employed to examine task-related engagement of large-scale functional networks.\n\nResultsThrough this approach, we show that beta/gamma power within executive control, salience, and default mode networks accurately predicts single-trial attentional performance. Connectomic profiling reveals that key attentional nodes exclusively recruit dorsal default mode subsystems during attentional shifts.\n\nConclusionsThe identification of distinct substreams within the default mode system supports a key role for this network in cognitive flexibility and attention in children. Furthermore, convergence of our results onto consistent functional networks despite significant inter-subject variability in electrode implantations supports a broader role for deep learning applied to intracranial electrodes in the study of human attention.\n\nFundingNo funds supported this specific investigation.

    "abstract": "Signalling by the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) or by the Death Receptors (DR) represents cellular stress pathways frequently activated towards pro-tumoral outputs in cancer. Experimental evidence has highlighted functional links between the UPR and the DR TRAIL-R1/2. Herein, we demonstrate that the UPR sensor IRE1 controls the expression of CD95/Fas, another DR, and its cell death-inducing ability. Whereas CD95 is not a general determinant of ER stress-induced cell death, IRE1 RNase activity inhibition increased CD95 expression and exacerbated CD95L-induced cell death in glioblastoma (GB) and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cell lines. In accordance, CD95 mRNA was identified as a target of Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay of RNA (RIDD). Moreover, CD95 expression is elevated in TNBC and GB human tumours exhibiting low RIDD activity. Surprisingly, CD95 expression is also lower in XBP1s-low human tumour samples. We show that IRE1 RNase inhibition led to CD95 expression attenuation and reduced CD95-mediated hepatic toxicity in mice. In addition, overexpression of XBP1s increased CD95 expression and sensitized GB and TNBC cells to CD95L-induced cell death. Overall, these results demonstrate the tight IRE1-mediated control of CD95-dependent cell death signals in a dual manner through both RIDD and XBP1s, and they identify a novel, pharmacologically actionable link between IRE1 and CD95 signalling.",

Here, we hold semi-suspended cultured human neutrophils in patch-clamp whole-cell mode to find that calcium mobilisation induced by stimulating one neutrophil can trigger an NMDA receptor-driven membrane current and calcium signal in neighbouring neutrophils. We employ an enzymatic-based imaging assay to image, in real time, glutamate release from neutrophils induced by glutamate released from their neighbours.

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small lipid membrane-bound structures that are secreted by all cells, and play a central role in cellular communication. EVs are released from skeletal muscle during exercise, but the effects of contractile activity on skeletal muscle-derived EVs (Skm-EVs) are poorly understood due to the challenges in distinguishing Skm-EVs derived from exercising muscle in vivo. To specifically characterize Skm-EVs, C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes, and electrically paced (3h/day x 4days @14V, C-PACE EM, IonOptix) to mimic chronic exercise in vitro. EVs were isolated from conditioned media from control and stimulated myotubes using differential ultracentrifugation. Isolated EVs were characterized biophysically (size, zeta potential, yield, protein markers and by transmission electron microscopy; TEM). Chronic stimulation increased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis such as MitoTracker Red staining, cytochrome c oxidase activity and expression of cytochrome c (p<0.05, N=7-8) in stimulated vs. non-stimulated myotubes. The average size of EVs from chronically stimulated myotubes (CS-EVs, 132 nm) was 26% smaller than control (CON-EVs, 178 nm) (p<0.05, N=8). Size distribution analysis revealed that CS-EVs were enriched with 100-150 nm sized small EVs, while CON-EVs were largely composed of 200-250 nm sized vesicles (p<0.05, main interaction effect, N=8). TEM confirmed the presence of round-shaped vesicles of about 30-100 nm with an intact lipid bilayer in CON-EVs and CS-EVs. Zeta potential was 27% lower in CS-EVs vs. CON-EVs (p<0.05, N=8), and total EV protein yield remained unchanged between groups. Protein-based EV characterization showed that both CON-EVs/CS-EVs were CD81+ but CD63-, and expressed hallmark cytosolic proteins recovered in EVs: Tsg101, Flotillin-1, HSP70, and Alix. CD81 and HSP70 expression increased in CS-EVs vs. CON-EVs (p<0.05, N=9). We evaluated if chronic stimulation affected whole cell expression of transmembrane and cytosolic proteins used in EV origin/purity analysis. CD63 and ApoA1 were reduced with chronic stimulation in myotube lysates (p<0.05, N=7), whereas Tsg101, CD81, Flotillin-1 and HSP70 levels remained constant. Taken together, our study revealed that chronic stimulation triggers the release of more stable, smaller sized EVs, enriched with transmembrane and cytosolic protein markers of small EVs, and are CD81+/CD63-indicating the origin of these EVs might be ectosomal rather than endosomal. The upstream signaling cascades that regulate biogenesis of EVs with chronic stimulation, and whether skeletal muscle-EVs are released through endosomal or ectosomal pathways remains to be elucidated. Our findings support the role of chronic contractile activity in the modulation of EV biophysical characteristics. Whether this affects biological cargo recruitment into CS-EVs, and their subsequent biological activity remains to be established.",

    "abstract": "Upon intracellular recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I-like proteins interact with MAVS at peroxisomes and mitochondria, inducing its oligomerization and the downstream production of direct antiviral effectors. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is able to specifically evade this antiviral response, via its antiapoptotic protein vMIA. Besides suppressing the programmed cell death of infected cells, vMIA inhibits the antiviral signalling at mitochondria by inducing the organelles fragmentation, consequently hindering the interaction between MAVS and the endoplasmic reticulum protein STING. Here, we demonstrate that vMIA interferes with the peroxisomal antiviral signalling via a distinct mechanism that is independent of the organelles morphology and does not affect STING. vMIA interacts with MAVS at peroxisomes and inhibits its oligomerization, restraining downstream signalling, in an MFF-dependent manner. This study also demonstrates that vMIA is totally dependent on the organelles fission machinery to induce peroxisomal fragmentation, while this dependency is not observed at mitochondria. Furthermore, although we demonstrate that vMIA is also able to inhibit MAVS oligomerization at mitochondria, our results indicate that this process, such as the whole vMIA-mediated inhibition of the mitochondrial antiviral response, is independent of MFF. These observed differences in the mechanisms of action of vMIA towards both organelles, likely reflect their intrinsic differences and roles throughout the viral infection.\n\nThis study uncovers specific molecular mechanisms that may be further explored as targets for antiviral therapy and highlights the relevance of peroxisomes as platforms for antiviral signalling against HCMV.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease which to-date incurable. The major cause of death is dilated cardiomyopathy, however the pathogenesis is unclear as existing cellular and animal models do not fully recapitulate the human disease phenotypes. In this study, we generated cardiac organoids from patient-derived pluripotent stem cells (DMD-CO) and isogenic-corrected controls (DMD-Iso-CO) and studied if DMD-related cardiomyopathy and disease progression occur in the organoids upon long-term culture (up to 93 days). Histological analysis showed that DMD-CO lacks initial proliferative capacity, displayed a progressive loss of -sarcoglycan localization and high stress in endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, the cardiomyocyte deteriorated over time, and fibrosis and adipogenesis were observed in DMD-CO. RNA sequencing analysis confirmed a distinct transcriptomic profile in DMD-CO which were associated with functional enrichment in hypertrophy/dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, adipogenesis and fibrosis pathways. Moreover, five miRNAs were identified to be crucial in this dysregulated gene network. In conclusion, we generated patient-derived cardiac organoid model that displayed DMD-related cardiomyopathy and disease progression phenotypes in long-term culture. We envision the feasibility to develop a more complex, realistic and reliable in vitro 3D human cardiac-mimics to study DMD-related cardiomyopathies.",

Reference datasets, however, are predominantly constructed from single-cell RNA-seq data, and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce  bridge integration, a method to harmonize singlecell datasets across modalities by leveraging a multi-omic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multi-omic dataset comprises an element in a  dictionary, which can be used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. We demonstrate that our procedure can accurately harmonize transcriptomic data with independent single cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to substantially improve computational scalability, and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach aims to broaden the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitate comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.\n\nAvailabilityInstallation instructions, documentations, and vignettes are available at http://www.satijalab.org/seurat",

    "abstract": "Most pathogenic bacteria require ferrous iron (Fe2+) in order to sustain infection within hosts. The ferrous iron transport (Feo) system is the most highly-conserved prokaryotic transporter of Fe2+, but its mechanism remains to be fully characterized. Most Feo systems are composed of two proteins: FeoA, a soluble SH3-like accessory protein and FeoB, a membrane protein that translocates Fe2+ across a lipid bilayer. Some bacterial feo operons encode FeoC, a third soluble, winged-helix protein that remains enigmatic in function. We previously demonstrated that select FeoC proteins bind O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] clusters via Cys residues, leading to the proposal that some FeoCs could sense O2 to regulate Fe2+ transport. However, not all FeoCs conserve these Cys residues, and FeoC from the causative agent of cholera (Vibrio cholerae) notably lacks any Cys residues, precluding cluster binding. In this work, we determined the NMR structure of VcFeoC, which is monomeric and conserves the helix-turn-helix domain seen in other FeoCs. In contrast, however, the structure of VcFeoC reveals a truncated winged {beta}-sheet in which the cluster-binding domain is notably absent. To test the interactions of VcFeoC with VcFeoB, we used NMR to demonstrate that these proteins interact in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a Kd of ca. 25 M. Finally, using homology modeling, we predicted the structure of VcNFeoB and used docking to identify an interaction site with VcFeoC, which is confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. These findings provide the first atomic-level structure of VcFeoC and contribute to a better understanding of its role vis-a-vis FeoB.",

    "abstract": "Acylsugars are defensive, trichome-synthesized sugar esters produced in plants across the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. Although assembled from simple metabolites and synthesized by a relatively short core biosynthetic pathway, tremendous within- and across-species acylsugar structural variation is documented across the family. To advance our understanding of the diversity and the synthesis of acylsugars within the Nicotiana genus, trichome extracts were profiled across the genus coupled with transcriptomics-guided enzyme discovery and in vivo and in vitro analysis. Differences in the types of sugar cores, numbers of acylations, and acyl chain structures contributed to over 300 unique annotated acylsugars throughout Nicotiana. Placement of acyl chain length into a phylogenetic context revealed that an unsaturated acyl chain type was detected in a few closely-related species. A comparative transcriptomics approach identified trichome-enriched Nicotiana acuminata acylsugar biosynthetic candidate enzymes. > 25 acylsugar variants could be produced in a single enzyme assay with four acylsugar acyltransferases (NacASAT1-4) together with structurally diverse acyl-CoAs and sucrose. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry screening of in vitro products revealed the ability of these enzymes to make acylsugars not present in Nicotiana plant extracts. In vitro acylsugar production also provided insights into acyltransferase acyl donor promiscuity and acyl acceptor specificity as well as regiospecificity of some ASATs. This study suggests that promiscuous Nicotiana acyltransferases can be used as synthetic biology tools to produce novel and potentially useful metabolites.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYAnalysis of Nicotiana glandular trichome metabolites and BAHD acyltransferases revealed diverse sucrose and glucose based acylesters.",

    "abstract": "Proteins need to selectively interact with specific targets among a multitude of similar molecules in the cell. But despite a firm physical understanding of binding interactions, we lack a general theory of how proteins evolve high specificity. Here, we present such a model that combines chemistry, mechanics and genetics, and explains how their interplay governs the evolution of specific protein-ligand interactions. The model shows that there are many routes to achieving molecular discrimination - by varying degrees of flexibility and shape/chemistry complementarity - but the key ingredient is precision. Harder discrimination tasks require more collective and precise coaction of structure, forces and movements. Proteins can achieve this through correlated mutations extending far from a binding site, which fine-tune the localized interaction with the ligand. Thus, the solution of more complicated tasks is enabled by increasing the protein size, and proteins become more evolvable and robust when they are larger than the bare minimum required for discrimination. The model makes testable, specific predictions about the role of flexibility and shape mismatch in discrimination, and how evolution can independently tune affinity and specificity. Thus, the proposed theory of specific binding addresses the natural question of \"why are proteins so big?\". A possible answer is that molecular discrimination is often a hard task best performed by adding more layers to the protein.",

    "abstract": "The bioactive lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) acts via five different subtypes of S1P receptors (S1PR) - S1P1-5. S1P5 is predominantly expressed in nervous and immune systems, regulating the egress of natural killer cells from lymph nodes and playing a role in immune and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as carcinogenesis. Several S1PR therapeutic drugs have been developed to treat these diseases; however, they lack receptor subtype selectivity, which leads to side effects. In this article, we describe a 2.2 [A] resolution room temperature crystal structure of the human S1P5 receptor in complex with a selective inverse agonist determined by serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-Ray Free Electron Laser (PAL-XFEL) and analyze its structure-activity relationship data. The structure demonstrates a unique ligand-binding mode, involving an allosteric subpocket, which clarifies the receptor subtype selectivity and provides a template for structure-based drug design. Together with previously published S1PR structures in complex with antagonists and agonists, the new S1P5-inverse agonist structure sheds light on the activation mechanism and reveals structural determinants of the inverse agonism in the S1PR-family.",

Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure at 2.9 [A] from Rhodobaca bogorensis strain LBB1. RCs are surrounded by 30 antennas and incorporate protein Y and PufX. RCs are stably connected by PufX, which self-interacts, electrostatically attracts cytochrome c2 (cyt c2) and forms extensive networks with co-factors.

    "abstract": "Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that has been associated with degenerative disorders, autoimmune processes, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. To better understand the biochemical mechanisms of necroptosis cell death regulation, we constructed a detailed biochemical model of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necroptosis based on known molecular interactions. Intracellular protein levels, used as model inputs, were quantified using label-free mass spectrometry, and the model was calibrated using Bayesian parameter inference to experimental protein time course data from a well-established necroptosis-executing cell line. The calibrated model accurately reproduced the dynamics of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), an established necroptosis reporter. A dynamical systems analysis identified four distinct modes of necroptosis signal execution, which can be distinguished based on rate constant values and the roles of the deubiquitinating enzymes A20 and CYLD in the regulation of RIP1 ubiquitination. In one case, A20 and CYLD both contribute to RIP1 deubiquitination, in another RIP1 deubiquitination is driven exclusively by CYLD, and in two modes either A20 or CYLD acts as the driver with the other enzyme, counterintuitively, inhibiting necroptosis. We also performed sensitivity analyses of initial protein concentrations and rate constants and identified potential targets for modulating necroptosis sensitivity among the biochemical events involved in RIP1 ubiquitination regulation and the decision between complex II degradation and necrosome formation. We conclude by associating numerous contrasting and, in some cases, counterintuitive experimental results reported in the literature with one or more of the model-predicted modes of necroptosis execution. Overall, we demonstrate that a consensus pathway model of TNF-induced necroptosis can provide insights into unresolved controversies regarding the molecular mechanisms driving necroptosis execution for various cell types and experimental conditions.",

This was associated with the accumulation of metabolically activated, immunostimulatory cytokine- and extracellular matrix-secreting multipotent stromal cells, which had potential to differentiate into preadipocytes. Concomitantly, mAT became infiltrated with Th2 lymphocytes that took up long-term residence and responded to signals from stromal cells by producing stromal cell-stimulating cytokines, including Amphiregulin. Signals delivered by Amphiregulin to stromal cells were required for immunity to infection. Our findings reveal intricate intercellular communication between Th2 cells and adipocyte progenitors and link immunity to intestinal infection to T cell-dependent effects on the adipocyte lineage.",

Compared to other CD4+ T cell subsets, npTh17 cells share accessible chromatin programs with Tregs, and pTh17 cells have an intermediate profile spanning features of npTh17 cells and Th1 cells. Integrating single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq, we inferred self-reinforcing and mutually exclusive regulatory networks controlling the different cell states and predicted transcription factors (TFs) shaping the chromatin landscape of Th17 cell pathogenicity. We validated one novel TF, BACH2, which promotes immunomodulatory npTh17 programs and restrains pro-inflammatory Th1-like programs in Th17 cells and showed genetic evidence for protective variants in the human BACH2 locus associated with multiple sclerosis. Our work uncovered mechanisms that regulate Th17 heterogeneity, revealed shared regulatory programs with other CD4+ T cell subsets, and identified novel drivers of Th17 pathogenicity as potential targets to mitigate autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Using a recently introduced efficient mass spectrometry-based approach we monitored individual donors IgG1 clonal responses in molecular detail, examining SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein-specific IgG1 repertoires. We monitored the plasma clonal IgG1 profiles of 8 donors (4 male and 4 female) who had recently experienced an infection by either the wild type Wuhan Hu-1 virus or one of 3 VOCs (Alpha, Beta and Gamma). In these donors we charted the full plasma IgG1 repertoires as well as the IgG1 repertoires targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer as antigen. We observed that shortly after infection in between <0.1% to almost 10% of all IgG1 antibody molecules present in plasma did bind to the spike protein. Each donor displayed a unique plasma IgG1 repertoire, but also each donor displayed a unique and polyclonal antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein variants. Our analyses revealed that certain clones exhibit (alike) binding affinity towards all four tested spike-protein variants, whereas other clones displayed strong unique mutant-specific affinity. We conclude that each infected person generates a unique polyclonal response following infection, whereby some of these clones can bind multiple viral variants, whereas other clones do not display such cross-reactivity. In general, by assessing IgG1 repertoires following infection it becomes possible to identify and select fully matured human plasma antibodies that target specific antigens, and display either high specificity or cross-reactivity versus mutated versions of the antigen, which will aid in selecting antibodies that may be developed into biotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has evolved variants with substitutions in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that impact its affinity for ACE2 receptor and recognition by antibodies. These substitutions could also shape future evolution by modulating the effects of mutations at other sites--a phenomenon called epistasis. To investigate this possibility, we performed deep mutational scans to measure the effects on ACE2 binding of all single amino-acid mutations in the Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Eta variant RBDs. Some substitutions, most prominently N501Y, cause epistatic shifts in the effects of mutations at other sites, thereby shaping subsequent evolutionary change. These epistatic shifts occur despite high conservation of the overall RBD structure. Our data shed light on RBD sequence-function relationships and facilitate interpretation of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",

    "abstract": "The current classification of the phylum Firmicutes (new name, Bacillota) features eight distinct classes, six of which include known spore-forming bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis, sporulation involves up to 500 genes, many of which do not have orthologs in other bacilli and/or clostridia. Previous studies identified about 60 sporulation genes of B. subtilis that were shared by all spore-forming members of the Firmicutes. These genes are referred to as the sporulation core or signature although many of these are found also in genomes of non-spore-formers. Using an expanded set of 180 firmicute genomes from 160 genera, including 76 spore-forming species, we investigated the conservation of the sporulation genes, in particular, seeking to identify lineages that lack some of the genes from the conserved sporulation core. The results of this analysis confirmed that many small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASPs), spore coat proteins, and germination proteins, which were previously characterized in bacilli, are missing in spore-forming members of Clostridia and other classes of Firmicutes. A particularly dramatic loss of sporulation genes was observed in the spore-forming members of the families Planococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae. Fifteen species from diverse lineages were found to carry skin (sigK-interrupting) elements of different sizes that all encoded SpoIVCA-like recombinases but did not share any other genes. Phylogenetic trees built from concatenated alignments of sporulation proteins and ribosomal proteins showed similar topology, indicating an early origin and subsequent vertical inheritance of the sporulation genes.\n\nIMPORTANCEMany members of the phylum Firmicutes (Bacillota) are capable of producing endospores, which enhance the survival of important Gram-positive pathogens that cause such diseases as anthrax, botulism, colitis, gas gangrene, and tetanus. We show that the core set of sporulation genes, defined previously through genome comparisons of several bacilli and clostridia, is conserved in a wide variety of spore-formers from several distinct lineages of Firmicutes. We also detect widespread loss of sporulation genes in many organisms, particularly within families Planococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae. Members of these families, such as Lysinobacillus sphaericus and Clostridium innocuum, could be excellent model organisms for studying sporulation mechanisms, such as engulfment, formation of the spore coat, and spore germination.",

    "abstract": "Sewage water from around the world contains an abundance of short plasmids, a number of which harbor antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). The global dynamics of plasmid-derived antimicrobial resistance and functions is only starting to be unveiled. Here, we utilized a previously created dataset of 159,332 assumed small plasmids from 24 different globally collected sewage samples. We investigated the detailed phylogeny as well as the interplay between their protein domains, ARGs, and predicted bacterial host genera to help understand the global sewage plasmidome dynamics.\n\nA total of 58,429 circular elements carried genes encoding for plasmid-related features, and MASH distance analyses showed a very high degree of diversity. A single very diverse cluster of 520 predicted Acinetobacter plasmids was predominant among the European sewage water.\n\nBased on functional domain network analysis, we identified three groups of plasmids, mainly replication and mobilization domains. However, these backbone domains were not exclusive to any given group. Acinetobacter was the dominant host genus among theta-replicating plasmids at these size ranges. They contained a reservoir of the macrolide resistance gene pair msr(E) and mph(E). Macrolide resistance genes were the most common resistance genes in sewage plasmidomes and found in the largest number of unique plasmids.\n\nWhile msr(E) and mph(E) were limited to Acinetobacter, erm(B) was disseminated among a range of Firmicutes plasmids, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, highlighting a potential reservoir of antibiotics resistance for these pathogens from around the globe.\n\nImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is a global threat to human health inhibiting our ability to treat infectious diseases. This study utilizes sewage water plasmidomes to identify plasmid-derived features, and highlights antimicrobial resistance genes, particularly macrolide resistance to be abundant in sewage water plasmidomes in Firmicutes and Acinetobacter hosts. The emergence of macrolide resistance in these bacteria hints that macrolide selective pressure exists in sewage water, and that the resident bacteria readily can acquire macrolide resistance via small plasmids.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is a double-stranded (ds)RNA virus which encapsidates its 10 genome segments within a double-layered viral particle. Reovirus infection triggers an antiviral response in host cells which serves to limit viral replication. This antiviral response is initiated by recognition of the incoming viral genome by host sensors present in the cytoplasm. However, how host sensors gain access to the reovirus genome is unclear as this dsRNA is protected by the viral particle proteins throughout infection. To initiate infection, reovirus particles are endocytosed and the outer viral particle layer is disassembled through the action of host proteases. This disassembly event is required for viral escape into the cytoplasm to begin replication. We show that even after disassembly is complete, endosomal proteases are required to induce an immune response to reovirus. Additionally, counter to dogma, our data demonstrate at least some viral dsRNA genome is exposed and detectable during entry. We hypothesize that some proportion of reovirus particles remain trapped within endosomes, allowing for the breakdown of these particles and release of their genome. We show that rapidly uncoating mutants escape the endosome more rapidly and induce a diminished immune response. Further, we show that particles entering through dynamin-independent pathways evade detection by host sensors. Overall, our data provide new insight into how genomes from entering reovirus particles are detected by host cells.\n\nIMPORTANCEViruses must infect host cells to replicate, often killing the host cell in the process. However, hosts can activate defenses to limit viral replication and protect the organism. To trigger these host defenses to viral infections, host cells must first recognize they are infected. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is a model system used to study host-virus interactions. This study identifies aspects of host and virus biology which determine the capacity of host cells to detect infection. Notably, entry of reovirus into host cells plays a critical role in determining the magnitude of immune response triggered during infection. Mutants of reovirus which can enter cells more rapidly are better at avoiding detection by the host. Additionally, reovirus can enter cells through multiple routes. Entry through some of these routes also helps reovirus evade detection.",

    "abstract": "Investigations of cellular responses to viral infection are commonly performed on mixed populations of infected and uninfected cells or using single-cell RNA sequencing, leading to inaccurate and low-resolution gene expression interpretations. Here, we performed deep polyA+ transcriptome analyses and novel RNA profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells, sorted based on the expression of the viral spike (S) protein. Infection caused a massive reduction in mRNAs and lncRNAs, including transcripts coding for antiviral factors, such as interferons (IFN). This absence of IFN signaling probably explained the poor transcriptomic response of bystander cells co-cultured with S+ ones. NF-{kappa}B pathway and the inflammatory response escaped the global shutoff in S+ cells. Functional investigations revealed the proviral function of the NF-{kappa}B pathway and the antiviral activity of CYLD, a negative regulator of the pathway.

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanism of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latent infection and reactivation in neurons requires the use of model systems. However, establishing a quiescent infection in cultured neurons is problematic as infectious virus released from any productively infected neuron can superinfect the cultures. Here, we describe a new reporter virus, HSV-1 Stayput-GFP, that is defective for cell-to-cell spread and can be used to model latency and reactivation at the single neuron level. Importantly, quiescent infection of neurons with Stayput-GFP can be established without the use of a viral DNA replication inhibitor. The establishment of a quiescent state requires a longer time frame than previous models of HSV latency using DNA replication inhibitors. This results in a decreased ability of the virus to reactivate, and the use of multiple reactivation triggers is required. Using this system, we demonstrate that an initial Phase I wave of lytic gene expression occurs independently of histone demethylase activity and viral DNA replication but is dependent on the neuronal cell stress protein, DLK. Progression into the later, Phase II wave of reactivation, characterized by detectable late viral protein synthesis and a requirement for histone demethylase activity, is also observed with the Stayput-GFP model system. These data demonstrate that the two waves of viral gene expression following HSV-1 reactivation are independent of secondary infection and occur when latent infections are established in the absence of a viral DNA replication inhibitor.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) enters a latent infection in neurons and periodically reactivates. Reactivation manifests as a variety of clinical symptoms. Studying latency and reactivation in vitro is invaluable, allowing the molecular mechanisms behind both processes to be targeted by therapeutics that reduce the clinical consequences. Here, we describe a novel in vitro model system using a cell-to-cell spread defective HSV-1, known as Stayput-GFP, which allows for the study of latency and reactivation at the single neuron level. We anticipate this new model system will be an incredibly valuable tool for studying the establishment and reactivation of HSV-1 latent infection in vitro. Using this model, we find that initial reactivation events are dependent on cellular stress kinase DLK, but independent of histone demethylase activity and viral DNA replication. Our data therefore demonstrate the essential role of DLK in mediating a wave of lytic gene expression unique to reactivation.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sub-variants BA.1 and BA.2 have become the dominant variants worldwide due to enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. In response to the rise of BA.1 and BA.2, two recent studies by Liu et al. and Iketani et al. provide a detailed analysis of loss of therapeutic antibody potency through evaluation of escape by pseudotyped viruses harboring BA.1 and BA.2 receptor binding domain (RBD) point mutations. Surprisingly, Liu et al. and Iketani et al. observed a profoundly broad escape effect for the individual mutations S371L and S371F. This result cannot be explained by known escape mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and conflicts with existing computational and experimental escape measurements for S371 mutations performed on monomeric RBD. Through an examination of these conflicting datasets and a structural analysis of the antibodies assayed by Liu et al. and Iketani et al., we propose a mechanism to explain S371L/F escape according to a perturbation of spike trimer conformational dynamics that has not yet been described for any SARS-CoV-2 escape mutation.

HES3 overexpression is predictive of reduced overall survival in patients with fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, a pediatric cancer that resembles immature and undifferentiated skeletal muscle. However, the mechanisms of HES3 cooperation in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma are unclear and are likely related to her3/HES3s role in neurogenesis. To investigate HES3s function during development, we generated a zebrafish CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of her3, the zebrafish ortholog of HES3. Loss of her3 is not embryonic lethal and adults exhibit expected Mendelian ratios. Embryonic her3 zebrafish mutants are significantly smaller than wildtype and a subset present with lens defects as adults. Transcriptomic analysis of her3 mutant embryos indicates that genes involved in organ development, such as pctp and grinab, are significantly downregulated. Further, differentially expressed genes in her3 knockout embryos are enriched for HOX and SOX10 motifs. Several cancer-related gene pathways are impacted, including the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases. Altogether, this new model is a powerful system to study her3/HES3-mediated neural development and its misappropriation in cancer contexts.\n\nSummary StatementHere, we generate and characterize a zebrafish her3/HES3 knockout to elucidate the functional role of her3/HES3, a transcriptional repressor, in neural development and tumorigenic processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSequencing viruses in many specimens is hindered by excessive background material from hosts, microbiota, and environmental organisms. Consequently, enrichment of target genomic material is necessary for practical high-throughput viral genome sequencing. Hybridization probes are widely used for enrichment in many fields, but their application to viral sequencing faces a major obstacle: it is difficult to design panels of probe oligo sequences that broadly target many viral taxa due to their rapid evolution, extensive diversity, and genetic hypervariability. To address this challenge, we created ProbeTools, a package of bioinformatic tools for generating effective viral capture panels, and for assessing coverage of target sequences by probe panel designs in silico. In this study, we validated ProbeTools by designing a panel of 3,600 probes for subtyping the hypervariable haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genome segments of avian-origin influenza A viruses (AIVs). Using in silico assessment of AIV reference sequences and in vitro capture on egg-cultured viral isolates, we demonstrated effective performance by our custom AIV panel and ProbeTools suitability for challenging viral probe design applications.\n\nResultsBased on ProbeTools in silico analysis, our panel provided broadly inclusive coverage of 14,772 HA and 11,967 NA reference sequences. 90% of these HA and NA references sequences had 90.8% and 95.1% of their nucleotide positions covered in silico by the panel respectively. We also observed effective in vitro capture on a representative collection of 23 egg-cultured AIVs that included isolates from wild birds, poultry, and humans and representatives from all HA and NA subtypes. 42 of 46 HA and NA segments had over 98.3% of their nucleotide positions significantly enriched by our custom panel. These in vitro results were further used to validate ProbeTools in silico coverage assessment algorithm; 89.2% of in silico predictions were concordant with in vitro results.\n\nConclusionsProbeTools generated an effective panel for subtyping AIVs that can be deployed for genomic surveillance, outbreak prevention, and pandemic preparedness. Effective probe design against hypervariable AIV targets also validated ProbeTools design and coverage assessment algorithms, demonstrating their suitability for other challenging viral capture applications.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication is a major source of genomic innovation in all eukaryotes, with large proportions of genes being the result of either small-scale (SSD) or genome-wide duplication (WGD) events. In the model unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, of which nearly one third of the genome corresponds to gene duplicates, the two modes of duplication have been shown to follow different evolutionary fates, with SSD genes being more prone to acquire novel functionalities (neofunctionalization) and WGD more likely to retain different parts of the original ancestral function (subfunctionalization). Having previously described aspects of functional compartmentalization for the genes of S. cerevisiae, in this work we set out to investigate the existence of positional preferences of gene duplicates. We found that SSD and WGD genes are organized in distinct gene clusters that are, furthermore, segregated, occupying different regions, with SSD being more peripheral and WGD more centrally positioned close to centromeric chromatin.\n\nDuplicate gene clusters differ from the rest of the genome in terms of gene size and spacing, gene expression variability and regulatory complexity. What is more interesting, some of these properties are also shared by singleton genes residing in duplicate-rich regions in a position-dependent manner. Our analysis further reveals particular chromatin architectures in the promoters of duplicate genes, which are generally longer, with less pronounced nucleosome-free regions, strong structural constraints and a larger number of regulatory elements. Such structural features appear to be important for gene evolution as we find SSD gene-pair co-expression to be strongly associated with the similarity of nucleosome positioning patterns.\n\nWe propose that specific regions of the yeast genome provide a favourable environment for the generation and maintenance of small-scale gene duplicates. The existence of such genomic \"niches\" is supported by the enrichment of these regions in singleton genes bearing similarities with gene \"relics\", remnants of recent duplications that have reverted to single gene status. Our findings provide a valuable framework for the study of genomic innovation and suggest taking into account positional preferences in the study of gene emergence and fixation in experimentally and naturally evolving populations.",

Robust iS-methadoneSnFR responses in human sweat and saliva and mouse serum enable diagnostic uses.

    "abstract": "Single stranded breaks (SSBs) are the most frequent DNA lesions threatening genomic integrity. A highly kinked DNA structure in complex with human PARP-1 led to the proposal that SSB sensing in Eukaryotes relies on dynamics of both the broken DNA double helix and PARP-1s multi-domain organization. Here, we directly probe this fundamental yet poorly understood process at the single-molecule level. Quantitative SM-FRET and structural ensemble calculations reveal how PARP-1 binding converts DNA SSBs from a largely unperturbed conformation into the highly kinked state. Binding of the second N-terminal zinc finger yields an intermediate DNA conformation that can be recognized by the first zinc finger. Thus, the data is inconsistent with a conformational selection model, instead an induced fit mechanism via a multi-domain assembly cascade drives SSBs sensing. Interestingly, a clinically used PARP-1 inhibitor niraparib shifts the equilibrium towards the unkinked state, whereas the inhibitor EB47 stabilizes the kinked state.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) are comprised of vesicles budding from cell membranes and smaller intracellular vesicles shed by cells. EV play a role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and support tumor progression. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a carboxypeptidase function, frequently associated with poor clinical prognosis in prostate cancer (PCa). We previously identified an oncogenic PSMA signaling function in prostate cancer. Others demonstrated that EV isolated from the plasma of patients with high-grade PCa carry PSMA, but so far no pathophysiological effect has been associated with PSMA-bearing EV. Here we demonstrate that EV from PCa cells are able to transfer PSMA and its functionality to cells in the TME. The consequence of that EV-mediated PSMA transfer is an acute to long-term increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), angiogenin, pro-angiogenic and pro-lymphangiogenic mediators and increased 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP-1) phosphorylation in tumors. We compare EV from PCa cells with or without PSMA expression to address the role of PSMA-bearing EV in promoting pro-tumoral changes in the TME using classical molecular biology and novel molecular imaging approaches.",

    "abstract": "AimsA robust immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was developed to detect lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) expression by immune cells (ICs) in tumor tissues. LAG-3 is an immuno-oncology target with demonstrable clinical benefit, and there is a need for a standardized, well-characterized assay to measure its expression. This study aims to describe LAG-3 scoring criteria and present the specificity, sensitivity, analytical precision, and reproducibility of this assay.\n\nMethodsThe specificity of the assay was investigated by antigen competition and with LAG3 knockout cell lines. A melanin pigment removal procedure was implemented to prevent melanin interference in IHC interpretation. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human melanoma samples with a range of LAG-3 expression levels were used to assess the sensitivity and analytical precision of the assay with a [&ge;]1% cutoff to determine LAG-3-positivity. Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility were evaluated with 60 samples in intralaboratory studies and 70 samples in interlaboratory studies.\n\nResultsThe LAG-3 IHC method demonstrated performance suitable for analysis of LAG-3 IC expression in clinical melanoma samples. The pretreatment step effectively removed melanin pigment that could interfere with interpretation. LAG-3 antigen competition and analysis of LAG3 knockout cell lines indicated that the 17B4 antibody clone binds specifically to LAG-3. The intrarun repeatability, interday, interinstrument, interoperator, and interreagent lot reproducibility demonstrated a high scoring concordance (>95%). The interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility and overall interlaboratory and intralaboratory reproducibility also showed high scoring concordance (>90%).\n\nConclusionsWe have demonstrated that the assay reliably assesses LAG-3 expression in FFPE human melanoma samples by IHC.\n\nKey messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSLymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on immune cells that limits T-cell activity and is being actively explored as a target for immunotherapy.\n\nWhat this study addsAn immunohistochemistry assay was developed to detect the LAG-3 protein in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tumor tissue specimens. This study describes scoring criteria and shows the specificity, sensitivity, analytical precision, and reproducibility of this assay as an aid to determine LAG-3 expression in melanoma patients using a [&ge;]1% expression on immune cells threshold.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policyThe study describes a key immuno-oncology checkpoint immunohistochemistry assay that is robust and suitable for clinical trials.

We have analyzed the exercise physiology of mice deficient in ANT1, demonstrating a peripheral limitation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. Upon exercise, lack of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ (NAD+) results in a substrate limitation and stalling of the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration. Treatment of ANT1-deficient mice with nicotinamide riboside increased NAD+ levels in skeletal muscle and improved the exercise capacity and mitochondrial respiration.

    "abstract": "Intramuscular vaccines have greatly reduced hospitalization and death due to severe COVID-19. However, most countries are experiencing a resurgence of infection driven predominantly by the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. In response, booster dosing of COVID-19 vaccines has been implemented in many countries to address waning immunity and reduced protection against the variants. However, intramuscular boosting fails to elicit mucosal immunity and therefore does not solve the problem of persistent viral carriage and transmission, even in patients protected from severe disease. In this study, two doses of stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P)-based intramuscular vaccine adjuvanted with Alum/CpG1018, MVC-COV1901, were used as a primary vaccination series, followed by an intranasal booster vaccination with nanoemulsion (NE01)-adjuvanted S-2P vaccine in a hamster model to demonstrate immunogenicity and protection from viral challenge. Here we report that this vaccination regimen resulted not only in the induction of robust immunity and protection against weight loss and lung pathology following challenge with SARS-CoV-2, but also led to increased viral clearance from both upper and lower respiratory tracts. Our findings showed that intramuscular MVC-COV1901 vaccine followed by a booster with intranasal NE01-adjuvanted vaccine promotes protective immunity against both viral infection and disease, suggesting that this immunization protocol may offer a solution in addressing a significant, unmet medical need for both the COVID-19 and future pandemics.",

Disruption of the gut-brain axis (GBA) has been implicated in autism, with dozens of cross-sectional microbiome and other omic studies revealing autism-specific profiles along the GBA albeit with little agreement in composition or magnitude. To explore the functional architecture of autism, we developed an age and sex-matched Bayesian differential ranking algorithm that identified autism-specific profiles across 10 cross-sectional microbiome datasets and 15 other omic datasets, including dietary patterns, metabolomics, cytokine profiles, and human brain expression profiles. The analysis uncovered a highly significant, functional architecture along the GBA that encapsulated the overall heterogeneity of autism phenotypes. This architecture was determined by autism-specific amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism profiles predominantly encoded by microbial species in the genera Prevotella, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Desulfovibrio, and was mirrored in brain-associated gene expression profiles and restrictive dietary patterns in individuals with autism. Pro-inflammatory cytokine profiling and virome association analysis further supported the existence of an autism-specific architecture associated with particular microbial genera. Re-analysis of a longitudinal intervention study in autism recapitulated the cross-sectional profiles, and showed a strong association between temporal changes in microbiome composition and autism symptoms. Further elucidation of the functional architecture of autism, including of the role the microbiome plays in it, will require deep, multi-omic longitudinal intervention studies on well-defined stratified cohorts to support causal and mechanistic inference.",

Here, we present the results of proteomic and glycoproteomic studies of breast milk (colostrum and mature milk) from mothers with confirmed COVID-19. All colostrum samples exhibited significantly upregulated immune-related proteins, especially whey proteins with antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2, and increased glycosylation levels and heterogeneity at those proteins. Such adaptive differences in milk from COVID-19 mothers tend to fade in mature milk from the same mothers one month postpartum.

    "abstract": "Parallel evolution is common in nature and provides one of the most compelling examples of rapid environmental adaptation. In contrast to the recent burst of studies addressing genomic basis of parallel evolution, integrative studies linking genomic and phenotypic parallelism are scarce. Edaphic islands of toxic serpentine soils provide ideal systems for studying rapid parallel adaptation in plants, imposing strong, spatially replicated selection on recently diverged populations. We leveraged threefold independent serpentine adaptation of Arabidopsis arenosa and combined reciprocal transplants, ion uptake phenotyping, and available genome-wide polymorphisms to test if parallelism is manifested to a similar extent at both genomic and phenotypic levels. We found pervasive phenotypic parallelism in functional traits yet with varying magnitude of fitness differences that was congruent with neutral genetic differentiation between populations. Limited costs of serpentine adaptation suggest absence of soil-driven trade-offs. On the other hand, the genomic parallelism at the gene level was significant, although relatively minor. Therefore, the similarly modified phenotypes e.g., of ion uptake arose possibly by selection on different loci in similar functional pathways. In summary, we bring evidence for the important role of genetic redundancy in rapid adaptation involving traits with polygenic architecture.",

    "abstract": "Aided by extensive protein mutations, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant overtook the previously dominant Delta variant and rapidly spread around the world. It was shown to exhibit significant resistance to current vaccines and evasion from neutralizing antibodies. It is therefore critical to investigate the Omicron mutations trajectories. In this study, a literature search of published articles and SARS-CoV-2 databases was conducted, We explored the full list of mutations in Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 lineages. We described in detail the prevalence and occurrence of the mutations across variants, and how Omicron differs from them. We used GISAID as our primary data source, which provides open-access to genomics data of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in addition to epidemiological and geographical data. We examined how these mutations interact with each other, their co-occurrence and clustering. Our study offers for the first time a comprehensive description of all mutations with a focus on non-spike mutations and demonstrated that mutations in regions other than the Spike (S) genes are worth investigating further. Our research established that the Omicron variant has retained some mutations reported in other SARS-CoV-2 variants, yet many of its mutations are extremely rare in other variants and unique to Omicron. Some of these mutations have been linked to the transmissibility and immune escape of the virus, and indicate a significant shift in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The most likely theories for the evolution of the Omicron variant were also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular bacterium Wolbachia inhibits virus replication and is being harnessed around the world to fight mosquito-borne diseases through releases of mosquitoes carrying the symbiont. Wolbachia strains vary in their ability to invade mosquito populations and suppress viruses in part due to differences in their density within the insect and associated fitness costs. Using whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrate the existence of two variants in wAlbB, a Wolbachia strain being released in natural populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The two variants display striking differences in genome architecture and gene content. Differences in the presence/absence of 49 genes between variants include genes located in prophage regions and others potentially involved in controlling the symbionts density. Importantly, we show that these genetic differences correlate with variation in wAlbB density and its tolerance to heat stress, suggesting that different wAlbB variants may be better suited for field deployment depending on local environmental conditions. Finally, we found that the wAlbB genome remained stable following its introduction in a Malaysian mosquito population. Our results highlight the need for further genomic and phenotypic characterization of Wolbachia strains in order to inform ongoing Wolbachia-based programmes and improve the selection of optimal strains in future field interventions.\n\nImportanceDengue is a viral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that threatens around half of the world population. Recent advances in dengue control involve the introduction of Wolbachia bacterial symbionts with antiviral properties into mosquito populations which can lead to dramatic decreases in the incidence of the disease. In light of these promising results, there is a crucial need to better understand the factors affecting the success of such strategies, in particular the choice of Wolbachia strain for field releases and the potential for evolutionary changes. Here we characterized two variants of a Wolbachia strain used for dengue control that differ at the genomic level and in their ability to replicate within the mosquito. We also found no evidence for the evolution of the symbiont within the two years following its deployment in Malaysia. Our results have implications for current and future Wolbachia-based health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination of NEMO by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is essential for activating the canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway. While the NZF1 domain of the HOIP subunit of LUBAC recognizes the NEMO substrate, it is unclear how it cooperates with the catalytic domains in the ubiquitination process. Here, we report a crystal structure of NEMO in complex with HOIP NZF1 and linear diubiquitin chains, in which the two proteins bind to distinct sites on NEMO. Moreover, the NZF1 domain simultaneously interacts with NEMO and Ile44 surface of a proximal ubiquitin from a linear diubiquitin chain, where the C-term tail of the ubiquitin is in the proximity of the NEMO ubiquitination site (Lys285). We further propose a model for the linear ubiquitination of NEMO by HOIP. In the model, NZF1 binds the monoubiquitinated NEMO and recruits the catalytic domains to the ubiquitination site, thereby ensuring site-specific ubiquitination of NEMO.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for the prevention and/or treatment of viral infections. One caveat of their use is the ability of viruses to evolve resistance to antibody binding and neutralization. Computational strategies to predict which mutations will result in antibody resistance would be invaluable because current methods for identifying potential escape mutations are labor intensive and system-biased. Respiratory syncytial virus is an important pathogen for which monoclonal antibodies against the fusion (F) protein are used to prevent severe disease in high-risk infants. In this study, we used an approach that combines molecular dynamics simulations with FoldX to estimate changes in free energy in F protein folding and binding to the motavizumab antibody upon each possible amino acid change. We systematically selected 8 predicted escape mutations and tested them in an infectious clone. Consistent with our F protein stability predictions, replication-effective viruses were observed for each selected mutation. Six of the eight variants showed increased resistance to neutralization by motavizumab. Flow cytometry was used to validate the estimated (model-predicted) effects on antibody binding to F. Using surface plasmon resonance, we determined that changes in the on-rate of motavizumab binding were responsible for the reduced affinity for two novel escape mutations. Our study empirically validates the accuracy of our molecular modeling approach and emphasizes the role of biophysical protein modeling in predicting viral resistance to antibody-based therapeutics that can be used to monitor the emergence of resistant viruses and to design improved therapeutic antibodies.\n\nImportanceRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe disease in young infants, particularly those with heart or lung diseases or born prematurely. As no vaccine is currently available, monoclonal antibodies are used to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk infants. While it is known that RSV evolves to avoid recognition by antibodies, screening tools that can predict which changes to the virus will lead to antibody resistance are greatly needed.",
