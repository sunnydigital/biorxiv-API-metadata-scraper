    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHMaintenance of cardiac function involves a regulatory loop in which electrical excitation causes the heart to contract through excitation-contraction coupling (ECC),1 and the mechanical state of the heart directly affects its electrical activity through mechano-electric coupling (MEC).2 However, in pathological states such as acute ischaemia that alter early or late electro-mechanical coordination (i.e., disturbances in ECC or repolarisation-relaxation coupling, RRC), MEC may contribute to the initiation and / or sustenance of arrhythmias (mechano-arrhythmogenesis).3 The molecular identity of specific factor(s) underlying mechano-arrhythmogenesis in acute ischaemia, however, remain undefined.4 By rapid stretch of rabbit single left ventricular cardiomyocytes, we show that upon ATP-sensitive potassium channel-induced alterations of RRC, overall vulnerability to mechano-arrhythmogenesis is increased, with mechano-sensitive5-11 transient receptor potential kinase ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels12 acting as the molecular driver through a Ca2+-mediated mechanism. Specifically, TRPA1 activation drives stretch-induced excitation and creates a substrate for self-sustained arrhythmias, which are maintained by increased cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. This TRPA1-dependent mechano-arrhythmogenesis involves microtubules, and can be prevented by block of TRPA1 or buffering of [Ca2+]i. Thus, in cardiac pathologies with disturbed RRC dynamics and / or augmented TRPA1 activity, TRPA1 may represent an anti-arrhythmic target with untapped therapeutic potential.13-17",

    "abstract": "A dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine response is characteristic of severe coronavirus infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, yet our understanding of the underlying mechanism responsible for this imbalanced immune response remains incomplete. Processing bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules that control innate immune responses by mediating the constitutive decay or suppression of mRNA transcripts, including many that encode proinflammatory cytokines. PB formation promotes turnover or suppression of cytokine RNAs, whereas PB disassembly corresponds with the increased stability and/or translation of these cytokine RNAs. Many viruses cause PB disassembly, an event that can be viewed as a switch that rapidly relieves cytokine RNA repression and permits the infected cell to respond to viral infection. Prior to this report, no information was known about how human coronaviruses (hu CoVs) impacted PBs. Here, we show SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold hu CoVs, OC43 and 229E, induced PB loss. We screened a SARS-CoV-2 gene library and identified that expression of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2 was sufficient to mediate PB disassembly. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that N protein-mediated PB loss correlated with elevated RNA for PB-localized transcripts encoding TNF and IL-6. Ectopic expression of the N proteins from five other human coronaviruses (OC43, MERS, 229E, NL63 and SARS-CoV-1) did not cause significant PB disassembly, suggesting that this feature is unique to SARS-CoV-2 N protein. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-mediated PB disassembly contributes to enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production observed during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIDH1/2-mutant gliomas are primary brain tumors for which curative treatments are lacking. Mutant IDH-dependent 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) accumulation leads to DNA and histone hypermethylation. Based on this distinct phenotype, we interrogated epigenetic dependencies of IDH-mutant glioma that can be targeted therapeutically.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a chemical screen targeting chromatin modifiers in patient derived IDH1-mutant GBM cells. We investigated mechanisms of action of compound hits and their combinations through cell-based functional assays, live-cell imaging, Western blot, CRISPR knockout, RNA-seq and ChIP experiments. The therapeutic concept was validated in vivo using chemical inhibitors GSK-J4 and Belinostat in an orthotopic GBM model.\n\nResultsWe identified the H3K27me3 demethylase (KDM6) inhibitor GSK-J4 and histone deacetylase inhibitor Belinostat as potent, genotype-selective agents against IDH1-mutant glioma. RNA-sequencing on paired wild-type and IDH1R132H cells revealed inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and activation of cellular stress in IDH1R132H cells, which were reversible with a mutant IDH1 inhibitor. GSK-J4 caused further repression of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes through H3K27me3 deposition and exacerbated the ATF4-mediated integrated stress response. Belinostat inhibited anti-apoptotic pathways through activation of TGF-{beta} signaling and induced cell cycle arrest. Together, the GSK-J4 and Belinostat combination activated DDIT3/CHOP-dependent apoptosis in IDH1-mutant cells and extended survival in an IDH1-mutant orthotopic model in vivo.\n\nConclusionsThese results provide a possible therapeutic approach that exploits epigenetic vulnerabilities of IDH-mutant gliomas.\n\nKey points- Combination of GSK-J4 and Belinostat selectively targets IDH1-mutant cells.\n- GSK-J4 downregulates cholesterol biosynthesis and activates an ATF4-mediated stress response.\n- Belinostat activates the TGF{beta} pathway, induces G2/M arrest and inhibits anti-apoptotic pathways.\n\n\nImportance of the studyIDH1/2 genes are frequently mutated in low grade glioma and secondary glioblastoma. These tumors exhibit a distinct epigenomic signature with increased DNA and histone methylation; therefore, identifying and exploiting their epigenetic vulnerabilities may lead to effective therapies. We discovered that targeting of KDM6A/6B together with HDACs provides a promising therapeutic approach for IDH1-mutant glioma.",

    "abstract": "Declarative memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval require the integration of elements encoded in widespread cortical locations. The mechanism whereby such  binding of different components of mental events into unified representations occurs is unknown. The  binding-bysynchrony theory proposes that distributed encoding areas are bound by synchronous oscillations enabling enhanced communication. However, evidence for such oscillations is sparse. Brief high-frequency oscillations ( ripples) occur in the hippocampus and cortex, and help organize memory recall and consolidation. Here, using intracranial recordings in humans, we report that these ~70ms duration 90Hz ripples often couple (within {+/-}500ms), co-occur ([&ge;]25ms overlap), and crucially, phase-lock (have consistent phase-lags) between widely distributed focal cortical locations during both sleep and waking, even between hemispheres. Cortical ripple co-occurrence is facilitated through activation across multiple sites, and phaselocking increases with more cortical sites co-rippling. Ripples in all cortical areas co-occur with hippocampal ripples but do not phase-lock with them, further suggesting that cortico-cortical synchrony is mediated by cortico-cortical connections. Ripple phase-lags vary across sleep nights, consistent with participation in different networks. During waking, we show that hippocampo-cortical and cortico-cortical co-ripples increase preceding successful delayed memory recall, when binding between the cue and response is essential. Ripples increase and phase-modulate unit firing, and co-ripples increase high-frequency correlations between areas, suggesting synchronized unit-spiking facilitating information exchange. Co-occurrence, phasesynchrony, and high-frequency correlation are maintained with little decrement over very long distances (25cm). Hippocampo-cortico-cortical co-ripples appear to possess the essential properties necessary to support binding-by-synchrony during memory retrieval, and perhaps generally in cognition.\n\nSignificance StatementDifferent elements of a memory, or any mental event, are encoded in locations distributed across the cortex. A prominent hypothesis proposes that widespread networks are integrated with bursts of synchronized high-frequency oscillations called  ripples, but evidence is limited. Here, using recordings inside the human brain, we show that ripples occur simultaneously in multiple lobes in both cortical hemispheres, and the hippocampus, generally during sleep and waking, and especially during memory recall. Ripples phase-lock local cell firing, and phase-synchronize with little decay between locations separated by up to 25cm, enabling long-distance integration. Indeed, co-rippling sites have increased correlation of very high-frequency activity which reflects cell firing. Thus, ripples may help bind information across the cortex in memory and other mental events.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects over 20 million people globally. Notably, schizophrenia is associated with decreased density of dendritic spines and decreased levels of D-serine, a co-agonist required for opening of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). We hypothesized that lowered D-serine levels associated with schizophrenia would enhance ion flux-independent signaling by the NMDAR, driving destabilization and loss of dendritic spines. We tested our hypothesis using the serine racemase knockout (SRKO) mouse model, which lacks the enzyme for D-serine production. We show that activity-dependent spine growth is impaired in SRKO mice, but can be acutely rescued by exogenous D-serine. Moreover, we find a significant bias of synaptic plasticity toward spine shrinkage in the SRKO mice as compared to wild-type littermates. Notably, we demonstrate that enhanced ion flux-independent signaling through the NMDAR contributes to this bias toward spine destabilization, which is exacerbated by an increase in synaptic NMDARs in hippocampal synapses of SRKO mice. Our results support a model in which lowered D-serine levels associated with schizophrenia enhance ion flux-independent NMDAR signaling and bias toward spine shrinkage and destabilization.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora species cause diseases in a large variety of plants and represent a serious agricultural threat, leading, every year, to multibillion dollar losses. Infection occurs when these biflagellated zoospores move across the soil at their characteristic high speed and reach the roots of a host plant. Despite the relevance of zoospore spreading in the epidemics of plant diseases, characteristics of individual swimming of zoospores have not been fully investigated. It remains unknown about the characteristics of two opposite beating flagella during translation and turning, and the roles of each flagellum on zoospore swimming. Here, combining experiments and modeling, we show how these two flagella contribute to generate thrust when beating together, and identify the mastigonemes-attached anterior flagellum as the main source of thrust. Furthermore, we find that turning involves a complex active process, in which the posterior flagellum temporarily stops, while the anterior flagellum keeps on beating and changes its pattern from sinusoidal waves to power and recovery strokes, similar to Chlamydomonass breaststroke, to reorient its body to a new direction. Our study is a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the spreading of plant pathogens motile forms, and shows that the motility pattern of these biflagellated zoospores represents a distinct eukaryotic version of the celebrated \"run-and-tumble\" motility class exhibited by peritrichous bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality and is hypothesized to contribute to PCa aggressiveness and disparities in African American populations. The prostate epithelium was recently shown to express megalin, an endocytic receptor that internalizes globulin-bound hormones, which suggests regulation of prostate hormone levels, in contrast to the free hormone hypothesis. Here, we demonstrated that megalin imports testosterone bound to sex hormone-binding globulin into prostate cells. Prostatic loss of Lrp2 (megalin) in a mouse model resulted in reduced prostate testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. Megalin expression was regulated and suppressed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) in cell lines, patient-derived prostate epithelial cells, and prostate tissue explants, indicating a negative feedback loop. In patent samples, the relationships between hormones support this feedback mechanism, as prostatic DHT levels are higher in African American men and are inversely correlated with serum 25D status. Megalin levels are reduced in localized PCa by the Gleason grade and in patients with future disease recurrence. Our findings suggest that the free hormone hypothesis should be revisited for testosterone and highlight the impact of vitamin D deficiency on prostate androgen levels, which are known drivers of PCa. Thus, we revealed a mechanistic link between vitamin D and PCa disparities observed in African Americans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn light of the frequent development of therapeutic resistance in cancer treatment, there is a strong need for personalized model systems representing patient tumor heterogeneity, while enabling parallel drug testing and identification of appropriate treatment responses in individual patients. Using ovarian cancer as a prime example of a heterogeneous tumor disease with complex microenvironment and high recurrence rates, we developed a 3D preclinical ovarian cancer model comprised of patient-derived microtumors (PDM) and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for identification of treatment vulnerabilities and validation of anti-cancer drug efficacy using immunohistochemistry, immune cell phenotyping, functional assays and protein profiling analyses.\n\nMethodsPDM and TILs were isolated from fresh primary ovarian cancer tissue specimen using mechanical disruption and limited enzymatic digestion and were subsequently cultured in suspension in defined media in the absence of serum. The heterogeneous cellular composition of isolated PDM as well as autologous TILs was analyzed by FFPE immunohistochemistry and multi-color flow cytometry, respectively. For in-depth protein profiling of PDM we established Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analyses of >110 total and phospho-proteins. Treatment efficacy in response to chemotherapeutics as well as immunotherapeutic compounds was assessed in PDM and PDM-TIL co-cultures using a functional viability assay in microplate format.\n\nResultsThe enzymatic digestion of primary ovarian cancer tissue and suspension culture in defined serum-free media allowed fast and efficient recovery of patient-derived microtumors (PDM). Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated histopathological comparability of ovarian cancer PDM with corresponding patient tumor tissue. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA)-based analyses of >110 total and phospho-proteins enabled the identification of patient-specific sensitivities to standard, platinum-based therapy and thereby the prediction of potential treatment-responders. Finally, combining PDM and autologous TILs for individual efficacy testing of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment demonstrated the potential for patient-specific enhancement of cytotoxic TIL activity by this therapeutic approach.\n\nConclusion3D patient-derived ovarian cancer microtumors represent a preclinical, ex vivo tumor model that reflects intertumoral heterogeneity and represent the cellular complexity of individual patient tumors. Combining protein pathway analysis and anti-cancer drug efficacy testing of PDM enables drug mode-of-action analyses and therapeutic sensitivity prediction within a clinically relevant time frame after surgery. Follow-up studies in larger cohorts are currently under way to further evaluate the applicability of this platform to support clinical decision-making and personalizing cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Microbial pangenomes vary across species; their size and structure are determined by genetic diversity within the population and by gene loss and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Many bacteria are associated with eukaryotic hosts where the host colonization dynamics may impact bacterial genome evolution. Host-associated lifestyle has been recognized as a barrier to HGT in parentally transmitted bacteria. However, pangenome evolution of environmentally acquired symbionts remains understudied, often due to limitations in symbiont cultivation. Using high-resolution metagenomics, here we study pangenome evolution of two co-occurring endosymbionts inhabiting Bathymodiolus brooksi mussels from a single cold seep. The symbionts, sulfur-oxidizing (SOX) and methane-oxidizing (MOX) gamma-proteobacteria, are environmentally acquired at an early developmental stage and individual mussels may harbor multiple strains of each species. We found differences in the accessory gene content of both symbionts across individual mussels, which are reflected by differences in symbiont strain composition. Compared to core genes, accessory genes are enriched in functions involved in genome integrity. We found no evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer between both symbionts. A comparison between the symbiont pangenomes revealed that the MOX population is less diverged and contains fewer accessory genes, supporting that the MOX association with B. brooksi is more recent than that of SOX. Our results show that the pangenomes of both symbionts evolved mainly by vertical inheritance. We conclude that environmentally transmitted symbionts that associate with individual hosts over their lifetime show features of narrow symbioses, where the frequency of HGT is constrained.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a protein that catalyzes the reverse transcription of telomere elongation. TERT is also expected to play a noncanonical role beyond telomere lengthening since it localizes not only in the nucleus but also in mitochondria, where telomeres do not exist. Several studies have reported that mitochondrial TERT regulates apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. However, there remains controversy about whether mitochondrial TERT promotes or inhibits apoptosis, mainly due to the lack of information on changes in the TERT distribution in individual cells over time. Here we simultaneously detected apoptosis and TERT localization after oxidative stress in individual HeLa cells by live-cell tracking. This tracking revealed that the stress-induced accumulation of TERT in mitochondria caused apoptosis but that the accumulation positively correlated with the time until cell death. The results suggest a new model in which mitochondrial TERT has two opposing effects at different stages of apoptosis: it predetermines apoptosis at the first stage of cell-fate determination but also delays apoptosis at the second stage. Because these distinct effects respectively support both sides of the controversy regarding the role of mitochondrial TERT in apoptosis, our model integrates two opposing hypotheses. Furthermore, detailed statistical analysis of TERT mutations, which have been predicted to inhibit TERT transport to mitochondria, revealed that these mutations suppress apoptosis independent of the mitochondrial localization of TERT. Together, these results indicate that the non-canonical functions of TERT affect a wide range of pathways.",

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the primary sensor of cellular energy in eukaryotes. However, the genetic regulation of vertebrate aging by AMPK remains poorly understood. Here, we manipulate energy levels in the turquoise killifish by mutating APRT, a key enzyme in AMP biosynthesis. These manipulations produced a male-specific lifespan extension and restored metabolic plasticity. Exploring the observed sex differences using an integrated omics approach implicated the mitochondria as an important player. Mechanistically, APRT regulated mitochondrial functions and AMPK activity, mimicking energy starvation in heterozygous cells. A fasting-like state was also detected, particularly in heterozygous males, which leads to resistance to high-fat diet. Finally, life-long intermittent fasting eliminated the male-specific longevity benefits mediated by the APRT mutation. These observations identify the AMP/AMPK axis as a sex-specific regulator of vertebrate longevity and metabolic health.",

The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes, and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We present GenomeTrackSig as an extension to the TrackSig R package to construct regional signature profiles using optimal segmentation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 257 genomes contain at least one of 54 recurrent changepoints shared by seven or more genomes of the same tumor type. Five recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type and some, but not all, are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside on the luminal surface of the airways and alveoli, ensuring proper gas exchange by ingesting cellular debris and pathogens, and regulating inflammatory responses. Therefore, understanding the heterogeneity and diverse roles played by AMs, interstitial macrophages (IMs), and recruited monocytes is critical for treating airway diseases. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 113,213 bronchoalveolar lavage cells from four healthy and three uninflamed cystic fibrosis subjects and identified FOLR2+SELENOP+ and SPP1+PLA2G7+ IMs, monocyte subtypes, and dendritic cell 1 (DC1), DC2, migDCs, plasmacytoid DCs, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and four AM superclusters (families) based on the expression of IFI27 and APOC2 genes. These 4 AM families have at least eight distinct functional members (subclusters) named after their differentially expressed gene(s): IGF1, CCL18, CXCL5, Cholesterol, Chemokine, Metallothionein, Interferon and small-cluster AMs. Interestingly, the Chemokine cluster further divides with each subcluster selectively expressing a unique combination of chemokines. One of the most striking observations, besides the heterogeneity, is the conservation of AM family members in relatively equal ratio across all AM superclusters and individuals. Transcriptional data and TotalSeq technology were used to investigate cell surface markers that distinguish resident AMs from recruited monocytes. Lastly, other AM datasets were projected onto our dataset. Similar AM superclusters and functional subclusters were observed, along with changes in AM subclusters in individuals infected with COVID-19. Overall, functional specializations of the AM subclusters suggest that there are highly regulated AM niches with defined programming states, highlighting a clear division of labor.\n\nSummary BlurbThere are at least 14 AM subtypes; their frequency, along with other immune cells, are highly conserved across individuals suggesting a specific niche exists for each leukocyte population.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478325v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9fd85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b33a9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cddcaeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1535215_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton is a central mediator between mechanical force and cellular phenotype. In tendon, it is speculated that mechanical stress deprivation regulates gene expression by filamentous (F-) actin destabilization. However, the molecular mechanisms that stabilize tenocyte F-actin networks remain unclear. Tropomyosins (Tpms) are master regulators of F-actin networks. There are over 40 mammalian Tpm isoforms, with each isoform having the unique capability to stabilize F-actin sub-populations. Thus, the specific Tpm(s) expressed by a cell defines overall F-actin organization. Here, we investigated F-actin destabilization by stress deprivation of tendon and tested the hypothesis that stress fiber-associated Tpm(s) stabilize tenocyte F-actin to regulate cellular phenotype. Stress deprivation of mouse tail tendon fascicles downregulated tenocyte genes (collagen-I, tenascin-C, scleraxis, -smooth muscle actin) and upregulated matrix metalloproteinase-3. Concomitant with mRNA modulation were increases in DNAse-I/Phallodin (G/F-actin) staining, confirming F-actin destabilization by tendon stress deprivation. To investigate the molecular regulation of F-actin stabilization, we first identified the Tpms expressed by mouse tendons. Tendon cells from different origins (tail, Achilles, plantaris) express three isoforms in common: Tpm1.6, 3.1, and 4.2. We examined the function of Tpm3.1 since we previously determined that it stabilizes F-actin stress fibers in lens epithelial cells. Tpm3.1 associated with F-actin stress fibers in native and primary tendon cells. Inhibition of Tpm3.1 depolymerized F-actin, leading to decreases in tenogenic expression, increases in chondrogenic expression, and enhancement of protease expression. These expression changes by Tpm3.1 inhibition are consistent with tendinosis progression. A further understanding of F-actin stability in musculoskeletal cells could lead to new therapeutic interventions to prevent alterations in cellular phenotype during disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying animal behavior is important for many branches of biological research. Current computational tools for behavioral quantification typically rely on a few pre-defined, simplified features to identify a behavior. However, such an approach restricts the information used and the tools applicability to a limited range of behavior types or species. Here we report a new tool, LabGym, for quantifying animal behaviors without such limitations. Combining a novel approach for effective evaluation of animal motion with customizable convolutional recurrent networks for capturing spatiotemporal details, LabGym provides holistic behavioral assessment and accurately identify user-defined animal behaviors without restrictions on behavior types or animal species. It then provides quantitative measurements of each behavior, which quantify the behavior intensity and the body kinematics during the behavior. LabGym requires neither any intermediate step for processing features that causes information loss nor programming knowledge from users for post-hoc analysis. It tracks multiple animals simultaneously in various experimental settings for high-throughput and versatile analysis. It also provides users a way to generate visualizable behavioral datasets that are valuable resources for the research community. We demonstrate its efficacy in capturing subtle behavioral changes in animals ranging from soft-bodied invertebrates to mammals.",

    "abstract": "HBO1 (HAT bound to ORC), a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), was initially identified as a binding partner of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that acetylates free histone H3, H4, and nucleosomal H3. It functions as a quaternary complex with the BRPF (BRPF1/2/3) scaffolding protein and two accessory proteins, ING4/5 and Eaf6. BRPF2 interaction with HBO1 has been shown to be important for regulating H3K14 acetylation during embryonic development. However, how the BRPF2 directs the HBO1 HAT complex to chromatin to regulate its HAT activity towards nucleosomal substrates remains unclear. Our findings reveal novel interacting partners of the BRPF2 bromodomain that recognizes different acetyllysine residues on the N-terminus of histone H4, H3, and H2A and preferentially binds to H4K5ac, H4K8ac, and H4K5acK12ac modifications. Further, mutational analysis of BRPF2 bromodomain coupled with ITC binding and pull-down assays on the histone substrates identified critical residues responsible for acetyllysine binding. Moreover, the BRPF2 bromodomain could enrich H4K5ac mark-bearing mononucleosomes compared to other acetylated H4 marks. Consistent with this, ChIP-seq analysis revealed that BRPF2 strongly co-localizes with HBO1 at histone H4K5ac and H4K8ac marks near the TSS in the genome. Together, our study provides novel insights into how the histone binding function of the BRPF2 bromodomain directs the recruitment of the HBO1 HAT complex to chromatin to regulate gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Immune surveillance escape is a hallmark of tumorigenesis1. Multiple studies have characterized the immune escape landscape across several untreated early-stage primary cancer types2-4. However, whether late-stage treated metastatic tumors present differences in genetic immune escape (GIE) prevalence and dynamics remains unclear. Here, we performed a pan-cancer characterization of GIE prevalence across six immune escape pathways in 6,457 uniformly processed Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) tumor samples including 58 cancer types from 1,943 primary untreated patients and 4,514 metastatic patients. To effectively address the complexity of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA-I) locus and to characterize its tumor status, we developed LILAC, an open-source integrative framework. We demonstrate that one in four tumors harbor GIE alterations, with high mechanistic and frequency variability across cancer types. GIE prevalence is highly consistent between primary and metastatic tumors for most cancer types with few exceptions such as prostate and thyroid carcinomas that have increased immune evasion frequencies in metastatic tumors. Positive selection analysis revealed that GIE alterations are frequently selected for in tumor evolution and that focal LOH of HLA-I, unlike non-focal LOH of HLA-I, tends to lose the HLA allele that presents the largest neoepitope repertoire. We also unraveled tumor genomic features contributing to immune escape incidence, including DNA repair deficiency, APOBEC activity, tobacco associated mutation load and viral DNA integration. Finally, there is a strong tendency for mid and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) tumors to preferentially select LOH of HLA-I for GIE whereas hypermutated samples favor global immune evasion strategies. Our results indicate that genetic immune escape is generally a pre-metastatic event during tumor evolution and that tumors adapt different strategies depending on their neoepitope burden.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies for cancer biomarker discovery based on pre-diagnostic blood DNA methylation profiles, either ignore the explicit modeling of the time to diagnosis (TTD) as in a survival analysis setting, or provide inconsistent results. This lack of consistency is likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work, we argue that a global approach to estimate CpG sites effect profile is needed, and we claim that such approach should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. To prove our concept, we develop a new Deep Learning-based approach assessing the relevance of individual CpG Islands (i.e., assigning a weight to each site) in determining TTD while modeling their combined effect in a survival analysis scenario. The algorithm combines a tailored sampling procedure with DNAm sites agglomeration, deep non-linear survival modeling and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values estimation to aid robustness of the derived effects profile. The proposed approach deal with the common complexities arising from epidemiological studies, such as small sample size, noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-derived DNAm. We apply our approach to a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort and we perform weighted gene-set enrichment analyses to demonstrate the biological meaningfulness of the obtained results. We compared the results of Deep Survival EWAS with those of a traditional EWAS approach, demonstrating that our method performs better than the standard approach in identifying biologically relevant pathways.\n\nAuthor summaryBlood-derived DNAm profiles could be exploited as new biomarkers for cancer risk stratification and possibly, early detection. This is of particular interest since blood is a convenient tissue to assay for constitutional methylation and its collection is non-invasive. Exploiting pre-diagnostic blood DNAm data opens the further opportunity to investigate the association of DNAm at baseline on cancer risk, modeling the relationship between sites methylation and the Time to Diagnosis. Previous studies mostly provide inconsistent results likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work we argue that an approach to estimate single CpG sites effect while modeling their combined effect on the survival outcome is needed, and we claim that such approach should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. We prove this concept by developing a novel approach to analyze a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort. A weighted gene set enrichment analysis confirms that our approach outperforms standard EWAS in identifying biologically meaningful pathways.",

In this study, we delivered double-blind and sham-control tPBM with different wavelengths to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 90 healthy participants and conducted four electroencephalography (EEG) experiments to investigate whether individual visual working memory capacity and related neural response could be modulated. We found that 1064 nm tPBM applied to the right PFC has both a substantial impact on visual working memory capacity and occipitoparietal contralateral delay activity (CDA), no matter orientation or color feature of the memorized objects. Importantly, the CDA set-size effect during the retention mediated the effect between 1064 nm tPBM and subsequent WM performance. However, these behavioral benefits and the corresponding changes of CDA set-size effect were absent with tPBM at 852 nm wavelength or with the stimulation on the left PFC. Our findings provide converging evidence that 1064 nm tPBM applied on the right PFC can improve visual working memory capacity, as well as explain the individuals electrophysiological changes about behavioral benefits.",

    "abstract": "Important individual differences are observed in peoples abilities to synchronize their body movements with regular auditory rhythms. We investigate whether synchronizing with a regular auditory cue is affected by each persons spontaneous production rate (SPR) and by hearing a partners synchronization in a social context. Musically trained and untrained participants synchronized their tapping with an auditory cue presented at different rates (their own SPR or their partners SPR) and in a Solo or Joint (turn-taking) condition. Linear and nonlinear oscillator models were fit to participants mean asynchronies (signed timing differences between the cued onsets and taps). In Joint turn-taking, participants synchrony was increased when the auditory signal was cued at the participants own SPR, compared with their partners SPR; in contrast, synchronization did not differ across rates in the Solo condition. Asynchronies in the Joint task became larger as the difference between partners spontaneous rates increased; the increased asynchronies were driven by the faster partner who did not slow down to match the rate of their slower partner. Nonlinear delay-coupled models (with time delay, coupling strength, and intrinsic frequency) outperformed linear models (intrinsic frequency only) in accounting for tappers synchronization adjustments. The nonlinear models coupling value increased for musically trained participants, relative to untrained participants. Overall, these findings suggest that both intrinsic differences in partners spontaneous rates and the social turn-taking context contribute to the range of synchrony in the general population. Delay-coupled models are capable of capturing the wide range of individual differences in auditory-motor synchronization.",

    "abstract": "Given its inputs from auditory structures and neuromodulatory systems, the posterior tail of the striatum is ideally positioned to influence behavioral responses to acoustic stimuli according to context and previous rewards. Results from previous studies indicate that neurons in this striatal region display selective responses to sounds. However, it is not clear whether different striatal cell classes code for distinct features of sounds, nor how different striatal output pathways may use acoustic information to guide behavior. Here we compared the sound-evoked responses of posterior striatal neurons that form the striatal direct pathway (and express the dopamine receptor D1) to the responses of neighboring neurons in naive mice. We achieved this via optogenetic photo-identification of D1-expressing neurons during extracellular electrophysiological recordings in awake head-fixed mice of both sexes. We found that the frequency tuning of sound-responsive direct-pathway striatal neurons is comparable to that of their sound-responsive neighbors. Moreover, we found that both populations encode amplitude modulated sounds in a similar fashion. These results suggest that different classes of neurons in the posterior striatum of naive animals have similar access to acoustic features conveyed by the auditory system even outside the context of an auditory task.",

    "abstract": "During brain development, billions of axons must navigate over multiple spatial scales to reach specific neuronal targets, and so build the processing circuits that generate the intelligent behavior of animals. However, the limited information capacity of the zygotic genome puts a strong constraint on how, and which, axonal routes can be encoded. We propose and validate a mechanism of development that can provide an efficient encoding of this global wiring task. The key principle, confirmed through simulation, is that basic constraints on mitoses of neural stem cells--that mitotic daughters have similar gene expression to their parent and do not stray far from one another--induce a global hierarchical map of nested regions, each marked by the expression profile of its common progenitor population. Thus, a traversal of the lineal hierarchy generates a systematic sequence of expression profiles that traces a staged route, which growth cones can follow to their remote targets. We have analyzed gene expression data of developing and adult mouse brains published by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and found them consistent with our simulations: gene expression indeed partitions the brain into a global spatial hierarchy of nested contiguous regions that is stable at least from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. We use this experimental data to demonstrate that our axonal guidance algorithm is able to robustly extend arbors over long distances to specific targets, and that these connections result in a qualitatively plausible connectome. We conclude that, paradoxically, cell division may be the key to uniting the neurons of the brain.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe embryological development of each brain installs an essentially identical communication network between its cells that is roughly as complex as that between the billions of people living on Earth. Although vast scientific resources are currently applied to identifying the final pattern of connections, the connectome, there has until now been relatively little effort to answer the fundamental question of how this complex network across billions of neurons realized through the mitotic elaboration of the initial embryonic cell. The problem is sharpened by the constraints that construction of the network is limited by the information budget of the initial genome, and that it has no pre-existing address space for placing neurons and guiding axons. We explain how Biology can solve this problem by using the family tree of neurons to install a global space of molecular addresses, which axons can use to navigate from their source neuron to its relatives. We provide experimental evidence for this familial address space in gene expression patterns of the developing mouse brain, and demonstrate through simulation that the experimentally observed address space indeed supports global navigation to produce a qualitatively plausible default connectome.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of oligodendroglia from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to complex and extensive myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a multistep process that involves largescale morphological changes with significant strain on the cytoskeleton. While key chromatin and transcriptional regulators of differentiation have been identified, their target genes responsible for the morphological changes occurring during OL myelination are still largely unknown. Here, we show that the regulator of focal adhesion, Tensin3 (Tns3), is a direct target gene of Olig2, Chd7, and Chd8, transcriptional regulators of OL differentiation. Tns3 is transiently upregulated and localized to cell processes of immature OLs, together with integrin-{beta}1, a key mediator of survival at this transient stage. Constitutive Tns3 loss-of-function leads to reduced viability in mouse and humans, with surviving knockout mice still expressing Tns3 in oligodendroglia. Acute deletion of Tns3 in vivo, either in postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) or in OPCs, leads to a two-fold reduction in OL numbers. We find that the transient upregulation of Tns3 is required to protect differentiating OPCs and immature OLs from cell death by preventing the upregulation of p53, a key regulator of apoptosis. Altogether, our findings reveal a specific time window during which transcriptional upregulation of Tns3 in immature OLs is required for OL differentiation likely by mediating integrin-{beta}1 survival signaling to the actin cytoskeleton as OL undergo the large morphological changes required for their terminal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, members of large transcription factor families often exhibit similar DNA binding properties in vitro, yet initiate paralog-specific gene regulatory networks in vivo. The serially homologous first (T1) and third (T3) thoracic legs of Drosophila, which result from alternative gene regulatory networks specified by the Hox proteins Scr and Ubx, respectively, offer a unique opportunity to address this paradox in vivo. Genome-wide analyses using epitope-tagged alleles of both Hox loci in the T1 and T3 leg imaginal discs, which are the precursors to the adult appendages and ventral body regions, show that [~]8% of Hox binding is paralog-specific. Binding specificity is mediated by interactions with distinct cofactors in different domains: the known Hox cofactor Exd acts in the proximal domain and is necessary for Scr to bind many of its paralog-specific targets, while in the distal leg domain, we identified the homeodomain protein Distal-less (Dll) as a novel Hox cofactor that enhances Scr binding to a different subset of genomic loci. Reporter genes confirm the in vivo roles of Scr+Dll and suggest that [~]1/3 of paralog-specific Hox binding in enhancers is functional. Together, these findings provide a genome-wide view of how Hox paralogs, and perhaps paralogs of other transcription factor families, orchestrate alternative downstream gene networks and suggest the importance of multiple, context-specific cofactors.",

    "abstract": "Fibulin-3 (F3 or EFEMP1) is a disulfide-rich, secreted glycoprotein necessary for maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) and connective tissue integrity. Two studies have identified distinct autosomal recessive F3 mutations in individuals with Marfan Syndrome-like phenotypes. Herein we characterized how one of these mutations, c.163T>C; p.Cys55Arg (C55R), disrupts F3 secretion, quaternary structure, and function by forming unique extracellular disulfide-linked homodimers. Dual cysteine mutants suggest that the C55R-induced disulfide species forms because of new availability of Cys70 on adjacent F3 monomers. Surprisingly, mutation of single cysteines located near C55 (i.e., C29, C42, C48, C61, C70, C159, and C171) also produced similar extracellular disulfide-linked dimers, suggesting that this is not a phenomenon isolated to the C55R mutant. To assess C55R functionality, F3 knockout (KO) retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) were generated, followed by reintroduction of wild-type (WT) or C55R F3. F3 KO cells produced lower levels of the ECM remodeling enzyme, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and reduced formation of collagen VI ECM filaments, both of which were partially rescued by WT F3 overexpression. However, C55R F3 was unable to compensate for these same ECM-related defects. Our results highlight the unique behavior of particular cysteine mutations in F3 and uncover potential routes to restore C55R F3 loss-of-function.",

However, it remains unclear how epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation can contribute to multigenerational acclimation and adaptation to environmental stressors. Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), an economically important salmonid, is highly sensitive to thermal stress, and is of conservation concern in the context of climate change. We studied the effects of temperature during parental sexual maturation and offspring rearing on whole-genome DNA methylation in brook charr juveniles (fry). Parents were split between warm and cold temperatures during sexual maturation, mated in controlled breeding designs, then offspring from each family were split between warm (8{degrees}C) and cold (5{degrees}C) rearing environments. We found 188 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) due to parental maturation temperature after controlling for family structure. In contrast, offspring rearing temperature had a negligible effect on offspring methylation. Stable intergenerational inheritance of DNA methylation and minimal plasticity in progeny could result in transmission of acclimatory epigenetic states to offspring, priming them for a warming environment. Our findings have implications pertaining to the role of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance in response to ongoing climate change.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, knowledge about the genes that are important for development and function of the mammalian eye and are involved in human eye disorders remains incomplete. During mammalian evolution, mammals that naturally exhibit poor vision or regressive eye phenotypes have independently lost many eye-related genes. This provides an opportunity to predict novel eye-related genes based on specific evolutionary gene loss signatures. Building on these observations, we performed a genome-wide screen across 49 mammals for functionally uncharacterized genes that are preferentially lost in species exhibiting lower visual acuity values. The screen uncovered several genes, including SERPINE3, a putative serine proteinase inhibitor. A detailed investigation of 381 additional mammals revealed that SERPINE3 is independently lost in 18 lineages that typically do not primarily rely on vision, predicting a vision-related function for this gene. To test this, we show that SERPINE3 has the highest expression in eyes of zebrafish and mouse. In the zebrafish retina, serpine3 is expressed in Mueller glia cells, a cell type essential for survival and maintenance of the retina. A CRISPR-mediated knockout of serpine3 in zebrafish resulted in alterations in eye shape and defects in retinal layering. Furthermore, two human polymorphisms that are in linkage with SERPINE3 are associated with eye-related traits. Together, these results suggest that SERPINE3 has a role in vertebrate eyes. More generally, by integrating comparative genomics with experiments in model organisms, we show that screens for specific phenotype-associated gene signatures can predict functions of uncharacterized genes.",

We found that MSC and MSC-EV treated DMM mice displayed improved OA pain-related behavior (i.e. locomotion, digging and sleep) compared to untreated DMM mice. Improved behavior was not the result of reduced joint damage, but rather knee-innervating sensory neurons from MSC and MSC-EV treated mice did not display the hyperexcitability observed in untreated DMM mice. Furthermore, we found that MSC-EVs normalize sensory neuron hyperexcitability induced by nerve growth factor in vitro.

To understand whether two behaviors are mediated by damage to distinct regions, researchers often compare LBM weight outputs by either the Overlap method or the Correlation method. However, these methods lack statistical criteria to determine whether two LBM are distinct vs. the same and are disconnected from a major goal of LBMs: predicting behavior from brain damage. Without such criteria, researchers may draw conclusions from numeric differences between LBMs that are irrelevant to predicting behavior. We developed and validated a Predictive Validity Comparison method (PVC) that establishes a statistical criterion for comparing two LBMs using predictive accuracy: two LBMs are distinct if and only if they provide unique predictive power for the behaviors being assessed. We applied PVC to two lesion-behavior stroke data sets, demonstrating its utility for determining when behaviors arise from the same vs. different lesion patterns. Using region-of-interest based simulations derived from proportion damage from a large data set (n = 131), PVC accurately detected when behaviors were mediated by different regions (high sensitivity) vs. the same region (high specificity). Both the Overlap method and Correlation method performed poorly on the simulated data. By objectively determining whether two behavioral deficits can be explained by a single vs. distinct patterns of brain damage, PVC provides a critical advance in establishing the brain bases of behavior.

Among those, P-cadherin expression is highly enriched in basal-like breast cancer, a molecular subset of triple-negative breast carcinomas, playing a central role in inducing cancer cell self-renewal, as well as collective cell migration and invasion capacity. To decipher the P-cadherin-dependent signalling network, we generated a humanised P-cadherin fly model, establishing a clinically relevant platform for functional exploration of P-cadherin effectors in vivo. We report that actin nucleators, MRTF and SRF are main effectors of P-cadherin functional effects. In addition, we validated these findings in a human mammary epithelial cell line with conditional activation of the Src oncogene, which recapitulates molecular events taking place during cellular transformation. We show that prior to triggering the gain of malignant phenotypes, Src induces a transient increase in P-cadherin expression levels, which correlates with MRTF-A accumulation, its nuclear translocation and the upregulation of SRF target genes. Moreover, knocking down P-cadherin, or preventing Factin polymerization with Latrunculin A, impairs SRF transcriptional activity. Furthermore, blocking MRTF-A nuclear translocation with CCG-203971 hampers proliferation, selfrenewal and invasion. Thus, in addition to sustaining malignant phenotypes, P-cadherin can also play a major role in the very early stages of breast carcinogenesis by promoting a transient boost of MRTF-A/SRF signalling through actin regulation.",

However, a significant portion of clinical isolates strongly differ when compared to several reference strains in the light of colony morphology, cellular density, capsule production, natural transformability and in vivo virulence. These genetic and phenotypic differences between current circulating strains of A. baumannii and established reference strains could hamper the study of A. baumannii as an entity.

    "abstract": "The antiviral response induced by type I interferon (IFN) via the JAK-STAT signaling cascade activates hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). While this response occurs essentially in all human and mouse tissues it varies between different cell types. However, the linkage between the underlying epigenetic features and the ISG pattern of a given cell is not well understood. We mapped ISGs, binding sites of the STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors and chromatin features in three different mouse cell types (embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts) before and after treatment with IFN{beta}. The analysis included gene expression, chromatin accessibility and histone H3 lysine modification by acetylation (ac) and mono-/tri-methylation (me1, me3). A large fraction of ISGs and STAT binding sites were cell type specific with promoter binding of a STAT1-STAT2 complex (STAT1/2) being a key driver of ISG induction. Furthermore, STAT1/2 binding to putative enhancers at intergenic and intronic sites induced ISG expression as inferred from a chromatin co-accessibility analysis. STAT1/2 binding was dependent on the chromatin context and positively correlated with pre-existing H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks in an open chromatin state while the presence of H3K27me3 had an inhibitory effect. Thus, chromatin features present before stimulation represent an additional regulatory layer for the cell type specific antiviral response.",

In this work, we sought to establish spatio-temporal context of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) reprogramming during obesity.\n\nMethodsWe captured single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and histological imagining of murine WAT over the course of diet-induced obesity to study macrophage phenotype dynamics. We developed a straightforward mathematical approach to integrating multi-modal data to quantify obesityinduced changes to WAT organization. We aligned ATM phenotypes with crown-like structures (CLS) in early obesity and used spatial network analysis to uncover signalling mechanisms implicated in CLS formation.\n\nResultsWe identified novel diversity of the lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) phenotype, whose transcriptional profile, signaling mechanisms, and spatial context serve as indicators of CLS formation in early obesity. We demonstrated that dysregulation of lipid-metabolic signalling is a critical turning point in the monocyte-LAM lineage and identified novel ligand-receptor mechanisms including Apoe, Lrp1, Lpl and App that serve as hallmarks of nascent CLS in WAT.\n\nConclusionsMulti-modal spatio-temporal profiling demonstrates that LAMs disproportionately accumulate in CLS and are preceded by a transition-state macrophage phenotype with monocytic origins.

    "abstract": "AbstractElasmobranchs are one of the most highly-threatened vertebrate taxa. Estimating abundance of spawning adults is often extremely challenging, yet crucial for prioritization of conservation measures. Emblematic of these challenges, the speartooth shark (Glyphis glyphis, Muller and Henle, 1839) was initially known only from rare specimens collected in a few tropical regions river systems of Australia and Papua New Guinea. Listed as critically endangered in Australia (where only six adults have ever been recorded) and endangered by the IUCN, such scarcity and limited distribution prevent direct assessments of abundance or reproductive biology. We used close-kin mark-recapture to estimate the abundance of mature G. glyphis in a genetically isolated population in the Wenlock River, Queensland, Australia. From 224 juvenile/sub-adults and 2 adult samples taken over three years (2013-2016), 46 half-sibling and 33 full-sibling pairs were found. The adult population was estimated at 897 (80% Credible interval 531 - 1684) with a sex ratio (based on mitochondrial DNA) highly skewed to males (females - 0.09: males - 0.91). Based on juveniles sampled in different years that shared a mother, 71% of females were estimated to skip-spawn. In an average year we estimate 44 breeding females occupy the system. Importantly, these methods constitute a viable and relatively rapid approach to obtain robust estimates of absolute abundance and other key population parameters for similar rare species.",

However, the mechanisms structuring this diversity and its biogeochemical consequences remain poorly understood. Here we use isolates from seven major taxa to demonstrate tradeoffs between phototrophic and phagotrophic abilities. We then show that trophic strategy along the autotrophy-mixotrophy spectrum correlates strongly with global niche differences, across depths and across gradients of stratification and chlorophyll a. A model of competition shows that community shifts can be explained by greater fitness of faster-grazing mixotrophs when nutrients are scarce and light is plentiful. Our results illustrate how basic physiological constraints and principles of resource competition can organize complexity in the surface ocean ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "1The advent of open access to genomic data offers new opportunities to revisit old clinical debates while approaching them from a different angle. We examine anew the question of whether psychiatric and neurological disorders are different from each other by assessing the pool of genes associated with disorders that are understood as psychiatric or as neurological. We do so in the context of transcriptome data tracked as human embryonic stem cells differentiate and become neurons. Building upon probabilistic layers of increasing complexity, we describe the dynamics and stochastic trajectories of the full transcriptome and the embedded genes associated with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders. From marginal distributions of a genes expression across hundreds of cells, to joint interactions taken globally to determine degree of pairwise dependency, to networks derived from probabilistic graphs along maximal spanning trees, we have discovered two fundamentally different classes of genes underlying these disorders and differentiating them. One class of genes boasts higher variability in expression and lower dependencies (\"active genes\"); the other has lower variability and higher dependencies (\"lazy genes\"). They give rise to different network architectures and different transitional states. Active genes have large hubs and a fragile topology, whereas lazy genes show more distributed code during the maturation toward neuronal state. Lazy genes boost differentiation between psychiatric and neurological disorders also at the level of tissue across the brain, spinal cord, and glands. These genes, with their low variability and asynchronous ON/OFF states that have been treated as gross data and excluded from traditional analyses, are helping us settle this old argument at more than one level of inquiry.\n\n2 Manuscript Contribution to the FieldThere is an ongoing debate on whether psychiatric disorders are fundamentally different from neurological disorders. We examine this question anew in the context of transcriptome data tracked as human embryonic stem cells differentiate and become neurons. Building upon probabilistic layers of increasing complexity, we describe the dynamics and stochastic trajectories of the full transcriptome and the embedded genes associated with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders. Two fundamentally different types of genes emerge: \"lazy genes\" with low, odd, and asynchronous variability patterns in expression that would have been, under traditional approaches, considered superfluous gross data, and \"active genes\" likely included under traditional computational techniques. They give rise to different network architectures and different transitional dynamic states. Active genes have large hubs and a fragile topology, whereas lazy genes show more distributed code during the maturation toward neuronal state. Under these new wholistic approach, the methods reveal that the lazy genes play a fundamental role in differentiating psychiatric from neurological disorders across more than one level of analysis. Including these genes in future interrogation of transcriptome data may open new lines of inquiry across brain genomics in general.",

The CTD coordinates RNA synthesis and processing by recruiting transcription regulation factors as well as RNA capping, splicing and 3end processing factors. The SPOC domain of PHF3 was recently identified as a new CTD reader domain specifically binding to phosphorylated serine-2 residues in adjacent CTD repeats. Here, we establish the SPOC domains of the human proteins DIDO, SHARP and RBM15 as phosphoserine binding modules that can act as CTD readers but also recognize other phosphorylated binding partners. We report the crystal structure of SHARP (SPEN) SPOC-CTD and identify the molecular determinants for its specific binding to phosphorylated serine-5. PHF3 and DIDO SPOC domains preferentially interact with the Pol II elongation complex, while RBM15 and SHARP SPOC domains engage with the m6A writer and reader proteins. Our findings establish the SPOC domain as a major interface between the transcription machinery and regulators of transcription and co-transcriptional processes.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in sequencing technologies and assembly methods, obtaining high-quality microbial genomes from metagenomic samples is still not a trivial task. Current metagenomic binners do not take full advantage of assembly graphs and are not optimized for long-read assemblies. Deep graph learning algorithms have been proposed in other fields to deal with complex graph data structures. The graph structure generated during the assembly process could be integrated with contig features to obtain better bins with deep learning.\n\nWe propose GraphMB, which uses graph neural networks to incorporate the assembly graph into the binning process. We test GraphMB on long-read datasets of different complexities, and compare the performance with other binners in terms of the number of High Quality (HQ) genome bins obtained. With our approach, we were able to obtain unique bins on all real datasets, and obtain more bins on most datasets. In particular, we obtained on average 17.5% more HQ bins when compared to state-of-the-art binners and 13.7% when aggregating the results of our binner with the others. These results indicate that a deep learning model can integrate contig-specific and graph-structure information to improve metagenomic binning.

    "abstract": "Protein interactions with nucleic acids are central to all genetic processes and many biotechnological applications. While many sequence-dependent protein-DNA interactions have been studied in detail using single-molecule methods, there is no standard high-throughput way to link the complex single-molecule kinetics of protein-DNA interactions with the DNA sequence of a single molecule. Here we provide the missing link by introducing a single-molecule imaging method (Gap-Seq) that interrogates DNA sequences via transient binding of short fluorescent DNA to a single DNA molecule previously used to characterise a protein-DNA interaction. In Gap-Seq, we identify a base by the degree of binding of 6-9 nt-long DNAs to surface-immobilised DNA substrates featuring a short single-stranded gap. To facilitate detection, we also developed a fluorescence quenching strategy that allows single-molecule detection at up to 500 nM of unbound fluorescent DNA. We link single-base differences on single DNA molecules to the kinetics of protein-DNA interactions by studying the interaction of a transcription activator with its cognate site. Finally, we show that our assay can address mixed sequences by distinguishing between two different sequences immobilised on the same field of view, paving the way for interrogation of sequence libraries for both mechanistic work and biotechnological applications.",

These structures have played important roles in understanding the mechanisms of catalysis, inhibition and drug resistance, and in driving drug design. However, structures of several desired complexes of RT could not be obtained even after many crystallization or crystal soaking experiments. The ternary complexes of doravirine and rilpivirine with RT/DNA are such examples.\n\nStructural study of HIV-1 RT by single-particle cryo-EM has been challenging due to the enzymes relatively smaller size and higher flexibility. We optimized a protocol for rapid structure determination of RT complexes by cryo-EM and determined six structures of wild-type and E138K/M184I mutant RT/DNA in complexes with the nonnucleoside inhibitors rilpivirine, doravirine, and nevirapine. RT/DNA/rilpivirine and RT/DNA/doravirine complexes have structural differences between them and from the representative conformation of RT/DNA/nevirapine (or efavirenz); the primer grip in the RT/DNA/doravirine and the YMDD motif in the RT/DNA/rilpivirine complexes have large shifts. The DNA primer 3-end in the doravirine-bound structure is positioned at the active site, but the complex is in a non-productive state. In the mutant RT/DNA/rilpivirine structure, I184 is stacked with the DNA such that their relative positioning can influence rilpivirine in the pocket. Simultaneously, E138K mutation widens the NNRTI-binding pocket entrance, potentially contributing to a faster rate of rilpivirine dissociation by E138K/M184I mutant RT, as reported by earlier kinetic studies. These structural differences have implications for drug design and for understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance.",

We also calculated the free energy of PIP2 binding relative to other anionic phospholipids in both conformational states using potential of mean force (PMF) and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. Our results identify state-dependent binding of PIP2 to sites involving the proximal C-terminus and we show that PIP2 promotes a conformational transition from a down state towards an intermediate that resembles the up state. These results are consistent with functional data for PIP2 regulation and together provide evidence for a structural mechanism of TREK-1 channel activation by phosphoinositides.",

    "abstract": "Less than 11% of pancreatic cancer patients survive 5-years post-diagnosis. The unique biology of pancreatic cancer includes a significant expansion of its desmoplastic tumor microenvironment, wherein cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their self-produced extracellular matrix are key components. CAF functions are both tumor-supportive and tumor-suppressive, while normal fibroblastic cells are solely tumor-suppressive. Knowing that CAF-eliminating drugs are ineffective and can accelerate cancer progression, therapies that \"normalize\" CAF function are highly pursued. Eribulin is a well-tolerated anti-microtubule drug used to treat a plethora of neoplasias, including advanced/metastatic cancers. Importantly, eribulin can inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition via a mechanism akin to blocking pathways induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF{beta}). Notably, canonical TGF{beta} signaling also plays a pivotal role in CAF activation, which is necessary for the development and maintenance of desmoplasia. Hence, we hypothesized that eribulin could modulate, and perhaps \"normalize\" CAF function. To test this premise, we used a well-established in vivo-mimetic fibroblastic cell-derived extracellular matrix (CDM) system and gauged the effects of eribulin on human pancreatic CAFs and cancer cells. The pathophysiologic cell-culturing system was also used to query eribulin effects on CDM-regulated cancer cell survival and invasive spread. Results demonstrated that intact CDMs modestly restricted eribulin from obstructing cancer cell growth. Nonetheless, eribulin-treated CAFs generated CDMs that limited cancer cell survival under nutritional stress, similar to reported tumor-suppressive CDMs generated by TGF{beta}-deficient CAFs. Data from this study support the central proposed premise and suggest that eribulin could be used as a CAF-normalizing drug.",

We have metabolically engineered an attenuated bacterial strain (i.e., Brucella melitensis 16M {Delta}vjbR, Bm{Delta}vjbR) to produce indole, a tryptophan metabolite that controls the fate and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We demonstrated that treatment with this strain polarized M2 macrophages (M{varphi}) which produced anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) and promoted Treg function; moreover, when combined with adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of Tregs, a single treatment with our engineered bacterial strain dramatically reduced the incidence and score of autoimmune arthritis and decreased joint damage. These findings show how a metabolically engineered bacterium can constitute a powerful vehicle for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy, defeating autoimmunity and reducing inflammation by remodeling the IME and augmenting Treg function.",

    "abstract": "The earliest macrophages are generated during embryonic development from erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) via primitive haematopoiesis. This process is still poorly understood in humans but is generally thought to be spatially restricted to the yolk sac. Human fetal placental macrophages, Hofbauer cells (HBC), arise during the primitive haematopoietic wave, yet are unlikely to be yolk sac derived as they appear prior to placental vascularisation. Here we identify a population of placental erythro-myeloid progenitors (PEMPs) in the early human placenta that give rise to HBC. PEMP are fetal CD34+CD43+ progenitors found exclusively at early gestational timepoints. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that PEMP have a unique transcriptome with some conserved features of primitive yolk sac EMPs, including the lack of HLF expression. Using in vitro single-cell culture experiments we show that PEMP generate HBC-like cells which lack HLA-DR expression, a conserved feature of all fetal primitive macrophages in humans. These findings indicate that HBC are derived locally from PEMP and demonstrate that human primitive haematopoiesis is not restricted to the yolk sac, occurring also in the placenta.",

    "abstract": "Successful direct MHC class I antigen presentation is dependent on the protein degradation machinery of the cell to generate antigenic peptides which can be loaded onto MHC class I molecules for surveillance by CD8+ T cells of the immune system. Most often this process involves the ubiquitin-proteasome system, however other ubiquitin-like (UBL) proteins have also been implicated in protein degradation and direct antigen presentation. Here, we examine the role of neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8 (NEDD8) in direct antigen presentation. NEDD8 is the UBL with highest similarity to ubiquitin and fusion of NEDD8 to the amino-terminus of a target protein can lead to the target proteins degradation. We find that appending NEDD8 to the N-terminus of the model antigen ovalbumin resulted in degradation by both the proteasome and autophagy protein degradation pathways, but only proteasomal degradation, involving the proteasomal subunit NEDD8 ultimate buster 1 (NUB1), resulted in peptide presentation. When directly compare to ubiquitin, NEDD8-fusion was less efficient at generating peptides. However, inactivation of the NEDD8-conugation machinery by treating cells with MLN4924, inhibited the presentation of peptides from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs) derived from a model antigen. These results demonstrate that NEDD8 activity in the cell is important for direct antigen presentation, but not by directly targeting proteins for degradation.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of insulin-secreting {beta}-cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells holds great potential as a cell therapy for treating insulin-dependent diabetes. While these stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) are able to reverse diabetes in animal models, they are not fully equivalent to their in vivo counterparts. To better define the state of the cell types generated within these SC-islets and provide a resource for identifying deficiencies in lineage specification, we used single-cell multiomic sequencing to simultaneously measure the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles of SC-islets at multiple time points as well as primary human islets. The integrated analysis of both the transcriptional and chromatin landscape for each cell provided greater resolution for defining cell identity, allowing us to derive novel gene lists for identifying each islet cell type. Furthermore, this multiomic analysis revealed that the difference between SC-{beta} cells and enterochromaffin-like cells, which are a major off-target from in vitro differentiation, is a gradient of progressive cell states rather than a stark difference in identity. The chromatin landscape of primary human islets was much more restricted, suggesting that stem cell-derived cells are not fully locked into their cell fate. While long term culture of SC-islets both in vitro and in vivo does close overall chromatin state, only in vivo transplantation directs cells toward their correct identities. Collectively, our multiomic analysis demonstrates that both the chromatin and transcriptional landscapes play significant roles in islet cell identity, and these data can be used as a resource to identify specific deficiencies in the chromatin and transcriptional state of SC-islet cell types.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in a hypoxic niche that maintains their differentiation potential. Several studies have highlighted the critical role of hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) in the regulation of stem cell function, reporting differentiation defects following a switch to normoxia (high oxygen concentration). However, the molecular events triggering changes in stem cell fate decisions in response to high oxygen remain elusive. Here, we study the impact of normoxia in the mito-nuclear communication, with regards to stem cell differentiation. We show that normoxia-cultured MSCs undergo profound transcriptional alterations which cause irreversible osteogenesis defects. Mechanistically, high oxygen promotes chromatin compaction and histone hypo-acetylation, particularly on promoters and enhancers of osteogenic genes. Although normoxia induces rewiring of metabolism, resulting in high acetyl-CoA levels, histone hypo-acetylation occurs due to trapping of acetyl-CoA inside mitochondria, likely due to lower CiC activity. Strikingly, restoring the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool via acetate supplementation remodels the chromatin landscape and rescues the osteogenic defects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the metabolism-chromatin-osteogenesis axis is heavily perturbed in response to high oxygen and identify CiC as a novel, oxygen-sensitive regulator of MSC function.",

In humans, mutations on the T3 exclusive transporter monocarboxylic acid transporter 8 (MCT8) lead to the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). Patients with AHDS present severe underdevelopment of the central nervous system with cognitive and locomotory consequences. Functional impairment of the zebrafish T3 exclusive membrane transporter MCT8 has been shown to phenocopy the symptoms observed in human patients with AHDS, thus providing an outstanding animal model to study this human condition. In this zebrafish model, MT3 acts as an integrator of different key developmental pathways during zebrafish neurodevelopment. Here we expand this knowledge by determining the developmental time of action of MT3 that occurs in very defined temporal intervals during zebrafish neurodevelopment. We have determined that MT3 is not involved in neural specification but is fundamental for developing particular neural progenitors and the consequent neural lineages that originate from them. Our data provide evidence that MT3 achieves this likely by modulation NOTCH signalling in a cell non-autonomous way. The findings show that MT3 expands the cell diversity output of neural progenitor cells, establishing a cellular background behind human AHDS and inherited limited CNS development.",

    "abstract": "Siderophores are strong iron-binding molecules produced and utilized by microbes to acquire the limiting nutrient iron (Fe) from their surroundings. Despite their importance as a component of the iron-binding ligand pool in seawater, data on the distribution of siderophores and the microbes that use them are limited. Here we measured the concentrations and types of dissolved siderophores during two cruises in April 2016 and June 2017 that transited from the iron-replete, low-macronutrient North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) through the North Pacific Transition Zone (NPTZ) to the iron-deplete, high-macronutrient North Pacific Subarctic Frontal Zone (SAFZ). Surface siderophore concentrations in 2017 were higher in the NPTZ (4.0 - 13.9 pM) than the SAFZ (1.2 - 5.1 pM), which may be partly attributed to stimulated siderophore production by environmental factors such as dust-derived iron concentrations (up to 0.51 nM). Multiple types of siderophores were identified on both cruises, including ferrioxamines, amphibactins and iron-free forms of photoreactive siderophores, which suggest active production and use of diverse siderophores across latitude and depth. Additionally, the widespread genetic potential for siderophore biosynthesis and uptake across latitude and the variability in the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities that transcribe putative ferrioxamine, amphibactin and salmochelin transporter genes at different latitudes suggest that particular microbes actively produce and use siderophores, altering siderophore distributions and the bioavailability of iron across the North Pacific.",

    "abstract": "Microbes can have profound effects on host fitness and health and the appearance of late-onset diseases. Host-microbe interactions thus represent a major environmental context for healthy aging of the host and might also mediate trade-offs between life-history traits in the evolution of host senescence. Here, we have used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study how host-microbe interactions may modulate the evolution of life histories and aging. We first characterized the effects of two non-pathogenic and one pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, together with the pathogenic Serratia marcescens DB11 strain, on population growth rates and survival of C. elegans from five different genetic backgrounds. We then focused on an outbred C. elegans population, to understand if microbe-specific effects on the reproductive schedule and in traits such as developmental rate and survival were also expressed in the presence of males and standing genetic variation, which could be relevant for the evolution of C. elegans and other nematode species in nature. Our results show that host-microbe interactions have a substantial host-genotype-dependent impact on the reproductive aging and survival of the nematode host. Although both pathogenic bacteria reduced host survival in comparison with benign strains, they differed in how they affected other host traits. Host fertility and population growth rate were affected by S. marcescens DB11 only during early adulthood, whereas this occurred at later ages with the pathogenic E. coli IAI1. In both cases, these effects were largely dependent on the host genotypes. Given such microbe-specific genotypic differences in host life history, we predict that the evolution of reproductive schedules and senescence might be critically contingent on host-microbe interactions in nature.",

    "abstract": "The Dam1 complex is essential for mitotic progression across evolutionarily divergent fungi. Upon analyzing amino acid (aa) sequences of Dad2, a Dam1 complex subunit, we identified a conserved 10-aa-long Dad2 signature sequence (DSS). An arginine residue (R126) in the DSS is essential for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that possesses point centromeres. The corresponding arginine residues are functionally important but not essential for viability in Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, both carry several kilobases long regional centromeres. The purified recombinant Dam1 complex containing either Dad2{Delta}DSS or Dad2R126A failed to bind microtubules (MTs) or form any visible rings like the wild-type complex. Intriguingly, functional analysis revealed that the requirement of the conserved arginine residue for chromosome biorientation and mitotic progression reduced with increasing centromere length. We propose that plasticity of the invariant arginine of Dad2 in organisms with regional centromeres is achieved by conditional elevation of the kinetochore protein(s) to enable multiple kinetochore MTs (kMTs) to bind to each chromosome. The capacity of a chromosome to bind multiple kMTs may mask deleterious effects of such lethal mutations.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a fundamental role in various biological functions; thus, detecting PPI sites is essential for understanding diseases and developing new drugs. PPI prediction is of particular relevance for the development of drugs employing targeted protein degradation, as their efficacy relies on the formation of a stable ternary complex involving two proteins. However, experimental methods to detect PPI sites are both costly and time-intensive. In recent years, computer-aided approaches have been developed as screening tools, but these tools are primarily based on sequence information and are therefore limited in their ability to address spatial requirements and have thus far not been applied to targeted protein degradation.\n\nHere, we present a new deep learning architecture based on the concept of graph representation learning that can predict interaction sites and interactions of proteins based on their surface representations. We demonstrate that our model reaches state-of-the-art performance using AUROC scores on the established MaSIF dataset. We furthermore introduce a new dataset with more diverse protein interactions and show that our model generalizes well to this new data. These generalization capabilities allow our model to predict the PPIs relevant for targeted protein degradation, which we show by demonstrating the high accuracy of our model for PPI prediction on the available ternary complex data. Our results suggest that PPI prediction models can be a valuable tool for screening protein pairs while developing new drugs for targeted protein degradation.",

Recently calcium signals, believed to be crucially important in rhythm generation, have been imaged in intact SAN and shown to be heterogeneous in various regions of the SAN and shown to be heterogeneous in various regions of the SAN with a lot of analysis relying on visual inspection rather than mathematical tools. Here we apply methods of random matrix theory (RMT) developed for financial data and various biological data sets including {beta}-cell collectives and EEGs to analyse correlations in SAN calcium signals using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to locate signalling modules corresponding to localization properties the eigenvectors corresponding to high eigenvalues. We find that the top eigenvector captures the common response of the SAN to action potential. In some cases, the eigenvector corresponding to the second highest eigenvalue yields a pacemaker region whose calcium signals predict the action potential. Furthermore, using new analytic methods, we study the relationship between covariance coefficients and distance, and find that even inside the central zone, there are non-trivial long range correlations, indicating intercellular interactions in most cases. Lastly, we perform an analysis of nearest-neighbor eigenvalue distances and find that it coincides with universal Wigner surmise under all available experimental conditions, while the number variance, which captures eigenvalue correlations, is sensitive to experimental conditions. Thus RMT application to SAN allows to remove noise and the global effects of the action potential and thereby isolate the local and meaningful correlations in calcium signalling.",

In this study, we monitored the immune profile of neonates via analysis of paired samples (n= 28) of cord blood and heel prick blood taken at varying times post term delivery by caesarean section. This paired approach accounted for the between-subject variability often observed over the first week of life. We identified rapid changes in immune cell populations within hours of birth. Specifically, we observed increased proliferation in effector T cells (but not regulatory T cells) that exhibited an increase in cytokine producing ability and also an increase in the percentage of CD3 T cells over this short time frame. This indicates that the mobilisation of the immune system is immediate post birth, presumably as a response to sudden exposure to the external environment, antigen or stress. Hence, immune development may start to occur more rapidly than previously proposed and as such, to study this trajectory, blood sampling should begin as soon after birth as possible.",
