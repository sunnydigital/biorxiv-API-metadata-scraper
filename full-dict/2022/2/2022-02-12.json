    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhile deep learning models have seen increasing applications in protein science, few have been implemented for protein backbone generation--an important task in structure-based problems such as active site and interface design. We present a new approach to building class-specific backbones, using a variational auto-encoder to directly generate the 3D coordinates of immunoglobulins. Our model is torsion- and distance-aware, learns a high-resolution embedding of the dataset, and generates novel, high-quality structures compatible with existing design tools. We show that the Ig-VAE can be used to create a computational model of a SARS-CoV2-RBD binder via latent space sampling. We further demonstrate that the models generative prior is a powerful tool for guiding computational protein design, motivating a new paradigm under which backbone design is solved as constrained optimization problem in the latent space of a generative model.",

    "abstract": "The physiological need for energy evokes motivated feeding behaviours that help to ensure survival. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of food motivation remain poorly understood. We investigated these mechanisms by subdividing feeding-related motivated behaviours into food-seeking, evaluating, and swallowing. Micro-endoscopic results indicated that neurons containing leptin receptors (LepRs) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) are the major food-specific subpopulation of LHGABA neurons. Optogenetic manipulation of LHLepR neurons bidirectionally regulated both food-seeking and evaluating. Furthermore, micro-endoscope data revealed that distinct LHLepR neurons encode seeking and evaluating. Computational modelling analysis demonstrated that LHLepR neurons encode motivation, whereas neurons containing agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY) encode the need for food. Additionally, slice studies revealed that NPY decreases inhibitory input to LHLepR neurons via LHGABA interneurons. This mechanism explains the permissive gate role of hunger (food need) in seeking/evaluating motivation. Together, the present study provides a comprehensive neural mechanism of how physiological needs drive distinct motivated behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Neurons regulate their excitability by adjusting their ion channel levels. Degeneracy - achieving equivalent outcomes (excitability) using different solutions (channel combinations) - facilitates this regulation by enabling a disruptive change in one channel to be offset by compensatory changes in other channels. But neurons must co-regulate many properties. Pleiotropy - the impact of one channel on more than one property - complicates regulation because a compensatory ion channel change that restores one property to its target value often disrupts other properties. How then does a neuron simultaneously regulate multiple properties? Here we demonstrate that of the many channel combinations producing the target value for one property (the single-output solution set), few combinations produce the target value for other properties. Combinations producing the target value for two or more properties (the multi-output solution set) correspond to the intersection between single-output solution sets. Properties can be effectively co-regulated only if the number of adjustable channels (nin) exceeds the number of regulated properties (nout). Ion channel correlations emerge during homeostatic regulation when the dimensionality of solution space (nin - nout) is low. Even if each property can be regulated to its target value when considered in isolation, regulation as a whole fails if single-output solution sets do not intersect. Our results also highlight that ion channels must be co-adjusted with different ratios to regulate different properties, which suggests that each error signal drives modulatory changes independently, despite those changes ultimately affecting the same ion channels.",

    "abstract": "How do attentional networks influence conscious perception? To answer this question, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in human participants, and assessed the effects of spatially nonpredictive or predictive supra-threshold peripheral cues on the conscious perception of near-threshold Gabors. Three main results emerged. (1) As compared with invalid cues, both nonpredictive and predictive valid cues increased conscious detection. Yet, only predictive cues shifted the response criterion towards a more liberal decision (i.e., willingness to report the presence of a target under conditions of greater perceptual uncertainty) and affected target contrast leading to 50% detections. (2) Conscious perception following valid predictive cues was associated to enhanced activity in frontoparietal networks. These responses were lateralized to the left hemisphere during attentional orienting, and to the right hemisphere during target processing. The involvement of frontoparietal networks occurred earlier in valid than in invalid trials, a possible neural marker of the cost of re-orienting attention. (3) When detected targets were preceded by invalid predictive cues, and thus reorienting to the target was required, neural responses occurred in left hemisphere temporo-occipital regions during attentional orienting, and in right hemisphere anterior insular and temporo-occipital regions during target processing. These results confirm and specify the role of frontoparietal networks in modulating conscious processing, and detail how invalid orienting of spatial attention disrupts conscious processing.\n\nSignificance StatementDo we need to pay attention to external objects in order to become aware of them? Characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of attentional effects on visual perception is critical to understand how humans process and select relevant information. Participants detected near-threshold visual targets preceded by supra-threshold spatial cues with varying degrees of predictivity, while their brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography. Results demonstrated that valid predictive cues biased participants conscious perception through an early recruitment of frontoparietal regions, and that attentional costs associated to invalid predictive cues were related to activation of the right hemisphere ventral network. This work characterizes the neural dynamics associated with the cost of attentional reorienting on conscious processing.",

    "abstract": "Animal development is classified as conditional or autonomous based on whether cell fates are specified through inductive signals or maternal determinants, respectively. Yet how these two major developmental modes evolved remains unclear. During spiral cleavage--a stereotypic embryogenesis ancestral to 15 invertebrate groups, including molluscs and annelids--most lineages specify cell fates conditionally, while some define the primary axial fates autonomously. To identify the mechanisms driving this change, we studied Owenia fusiformis, an early-branching, conditional annelid. In Owenia, ERK1/2-mediated FGF receptor signalling specifies the endomesodermal progenitor. This cell likely acts as an organiser, inducing mesodermal and posterodorsal fates in neighbouring cells and repressing anteriorising signals. The organising role of ERK1/2 in Owenia is shared with molluscs, but not with autonomous annelids. Together, these findings suggest that conditional specification of an ERK1/2+ embryonic organiser is ancestral in spiral cleavage and was repeatedly lost in annelid lineages with autonomous development.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing costs currently prohibit the application of single-cell mRNA-seq to many biological and clinical analyses. Targeted single-cell mRNA-sequencing reduces sequencing costs by profiling reduced gene sets that capture biological information with a minimal number of genes. Here, we introduce an active learning method (ActiveSVM) that identifies minimal but highly-informative gene sets that enable the identification of cell-types, physiological states, and genetic perturbations in single-cell data using a small number of genes. Our active feature selection procedure generates minimal gene sets from single-cell data through an iterative cell-type classification task where misclassified cells are examined at each round of analysis to identify maximally informative genes through an  active support vector machine (ActiveSVM) classifier. By focusing computational resources on misclassified cells, ActiveSVM scales to analyze data sets with over a million single cells. We demonstrate that ActiveSVM feature selection identifies gene sets that enable 90% cell-type classification accuracy across a variety of data sets including cell atlas and disease characterization data sets. The method generalizes to reveal genes that respond to genetic perturbations and to identify region specific gene expression patterns in spatial transcriptomics data. The discovery of small but highly informative gene sets should enable substantial reductions in the number of measurements necessary for application of single-cell mRNA-seq to clinical tests, therapeutic discovery, and genetic screens.",

    "abstract": "Online speech processing imposes significant computational demands on the listening brain, the underlying mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Here, we exploit the perceptual  pop-out phenomenon (i.e. the dramatic improvement of speech intelligibility after receiving information about speech content) to investigate the neurophysiological effects of prior expectations on degraded speech comprehension. We recorded electroencephalography and pupillometry from 21 adults while they rated the clarity of noise-vocoded and sine-wave synthesised sentences. Pop-out was reliably elicited following visual presentation of the corresponding written sentence, but not following incongruent or neutral text. Pop-out was associated with improved reconstruction of the acoustic stimulus envelope from low-frequency EEG activity, implying that improvements in perceptual clarity were mediated via top-down signals that enhance the quality of cortical speech representations. Spectral analysis further revealed that pop-out was accompanied by a reduction in theta-band power, consistent with predictive coding accounts of acoustic filling-in and incremental sentence processing. Moreover, delta-band power, alpha-band power, and pupil diameter were all increased following the provision of any written sentence information, irrespective of content. Together, these findings reveal distinctive profiles of neurophysiological activity that differentiate the content-specific processes associated with degraded speech comprehension from the context-specific processes invoked under adverse listening conditions.",

    "abstract": "Attention has been found to sample visual information periodically, in a wide range of frequencies below 20 Hz. This periodicity may be supported by brain oscillations at corresponding frequencies. We propose that part of the discrepancy in periodic frequencies observed in the literature is due to differences in attentional demands, resulting from heterogeneity in tasks performed. To test this hypothesis, we used visual search and manipulated task complexity, i.e., target discriminability (high, medium, low) and number of distractors (set size), while electro-encephalography was simultaneously recorded. We replicated previous results showing that the phase of pre-stimulus low-frequency oscillations predicts search performance. Crucially, such effects were observed at increasing frequencies within the theta-alpha range (6-18 Hz) for decreasing target discriminability. In medium and low discriminability conditions, correct responses were further associated with higher post-stimulus phase-locking than incorrect ones, in increasing frequency and latency. Finally, the larger the set size, the later the post-stimulus effect peaked. Together, these results suggest that increased complexity (lower discriminability or larger set size) requires more attentional cycles to perform the task, partially explaining discrepancies between reports of attentional sampling. Low-frequency oscillations structure the temporal dynamics of neural activity and aid top-down, attentional control for efficient visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Rapid epithelial tissue flows are essential to building and shaping developing embryos. However, it is not well understood how the mechanical properties of tissues and the forces driving them to flow are jointly regulated to accommodate rapid tissue remodeling. To dissect the roles of actomyosin in the mechanics of epithelial tissue flows, here we use two optogenetic tools, optoGEF and optoGAP, to manipulate Rho/Rho-kinase signaling and actomyosin contractility in the germband epithelium, which flows via convergent extension movements during Drosophila body axis elongation. The ability to perturb actomyosin in the tissue allows us to analyze the effects of actomyosin on cell rearrangements, tissue tensions, and tissue mechanical properties. We find that either optogenetic activation or deactivation of Rho1 signaling and actomyosin contractility at the apical surface of the germband disrupts cell rearrangements and tissue-level flows. Rho1 activation leads to poorly oriented rearrangements that are associated with a redistribution of myosin II from the junctional to the medial-apical domain, whereas Rho1 deactivation leads to fewer, slower cell rearrangements that are associated with decreased junctional and medial myosin. By probing mechanical tensions in the tissue using laser ablation and inferring tissue mechanical properties from cell packings, we find that actomyosin influences both the anisotropic forces that drive tissue flow and the mechanical properties of the tissue that resist flow, leading to complex relationships between actomyosin activity and tissue fluidity. Moreover, our results link the subcellular distribution of myosin II to tissue tension and cell packings, revealing how junctional and medial myosin have differential roles in promoting and orienting cell rearrangements during tissue flow.",

    "abstract": "Cell division and cell wall synthesis in staphylococci need to be precisely coordinated and controlled to allow the cell to multiply while maintaining their nearly spherical shape. The mechanisms ensuring correct placement of the division plane and synthesis of new cell wall have been studied intensively, however, hitherto unknown factors and proteins are likely to play key roles in this complex interplay. We here identified and investigated a protein with major influence on cell morphology in Staphylococcus aureus. The protein, named SmdA (for staphylococcal morphology determinant A), is a membrane-protein with septum-enriched localization. By CRISPRi knockdown and overexpression combined with different microscopy techniques, we demonstrate that proper levels of SmdA is necessary for cell division, including septum formation and cell splitting. We also identified conserved residues in SmdA that are critical for its functionality. Pulldown- and bacterial two-hybrid interaction experiments showed that SmdA interacts with several known cell division- and cell wall synthesis proteins, including penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and EzrA. Notably, SmdA also affects susceptibility to cell wall targeting antibiotics, particularly in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Together, our results show that S. aureus is dependent on balanced amounts of membrane-attached SmdA in order to carry out proper cell division.\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is an important human and animal pathogen. Antibiotic resistance is a major problem in treatment of staphylococcal infections, and cell division and cell wall synthesis factors have previously been shown to modulate susceptibility to antibiotics in this species. In the current work we investigated the function of an essential protein named SmdA, which was identified based on its septal localization and knockdown phenotype resulting in defective cellular morphologies. We demonstrate that this protein is critical for normal cell division in S. aureus. Depletion of SmdA sensitize resistant staphylococci to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. This work thus reveals a new staphylococcal cell division factor and a potential future target for narrow spectrum antimicrobials or compounds to resensitize antibiotic resistant staphylococcal strains.",

    "abstract": "Veins in vascular networks, such as in blood vasculature or leaf networks, continuously reorganize, grow or shrink, to minimize energy dissipation. Flow shear stress on vein walls has been set forth as the local driver for a veins continuous adaptation. Yet, shear feedback alone cannot account for the observed diversity of vein dynamics - a puzzle made harder by scarce spatiotemporal data. Here, we resolve network-wide vein dynamics and shear rate during spontaneous reorganization in the prototypical vascular networks of Physarum polycephalum. Our experiments reveal a plethora of vein dynamics (stable, growing, shrinking) where the role of shear is ambiguous. Quantitative analysis of our data reveals that (a) shear rate indeed feeds back on vein radius, yet, with a time delay of 1 -- 3 min. Further, we reconcile the experimentally observed disparate vein fates by developing a model for vein adaptation within a network and accounting for the observed time delay. The model reveals that (b) vein fate is determined by parameters - local pressure or relative vein resistance - which integrate the entire networks architecture, as they result from global conservation of fluid volume. Finally, we observe avalanches of network reorganization events that cause entire clusters of veins to vanish. Such avalanches are consistent with network architecture integrating parameters governing vein fate as vein connections continuously change. As the network architecture integrating parameters intrinsically arise from laminar fluid flow in veins, we expect our findings to play a role across flow-based vascular networks.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical actuation of cells by active forces from the cytoskeleton drives tissue morphogenesis. To understand these forces, multicellular laser dissection has become an essential tool for severing tissue locally and inferring tension from the recoil of surrounding structures. However, conventional laser dissection is limited by 2D steering, which is inadequate for embryos and developing tissues that are intrinsically 3D structures. In this study, we introduce a flexible near-infrared (NIR) fs-pulsed laser dissection system that allows for dissection trajectories to proceed in 3D and adapt to the curved surfaces of cell sheets, which are prominent structures in embryos. Trajectories are computed through an unsupervised search for the surface of interest. Using this technique, we demonstrate sectioning of multicellular domains on curved tissue, which was not possible with regular NIR laser scanning.\n\nWe apply the developed strategy to map mechanical stresses in the imaginal disc of the developing Drosophila wing. Our targeted, adaptive scans can be used in other non-linear processes, such as two-photon fluorescence imaging or optogenetics. Overall, this new laser dissection system offers an innovative solution for studying complex 3D structures and their mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Academic job markets have become increasingly challenging worldwide, yet it remains poorly characterized how competitively-successful candidates should be and what the underlying determinants of their success are. Focusing on the field of ecology and evolutionary biology, we analyzed the academic performance (measured as h-index) as well as the duration before recruitment as a new faculty member and promotion to full professor of 145 principal investigators (PI) over the past 34 years in Taiwan. We found that PIs had higher performance and longer duration before recruitment more recently. Performance before promotion remained stable, whereas the duration increased over time. The origin and prestige of doctorate had no effect on the performance or duration either before recruitment or before promotion. We also found that the difference in performance before and after recruitment (\"After\" performance -- \"Before\" performance) decreased in recent years, with PIs recruited in earlier years maintaining their performance after recruitment while those recruited in later years exhibiting a performance drop. While PIs performed equally well before and after recruitment irrespective of doctorate origin, those with domestic PhD degrees showed a decrease in performance after promotion compared to their counterparts with foreign degrees. Taken together, our findings reveal a prolonged career duration for researchers as a result of intensifying competition in academia, and highlight the increasingly crucial role of academic performance, rather than PhD degree itself, in determining academic success.",

    "abstract": "Macromolecular phase separation is thought to be one of the processes that drives the formation of membraneless biomolecular condensates in cells. The dynamics of phase separation, especially at low endogenous concentrations found in cells, are thought to follow the tenets of classical nucleation theory describing a sharp transition between a dense phase and a dilute phase characterized by dispersed monomers. Here, we used in vitro biophysical studies to study subsaturated solutions of phase separating RNA binding proteins with intrinsically disordered prion like domains (PLDs) and RNA binding domains (RBDs). Surprisingly, we find that subsaturated solutions are characterized by heterogeneous distributions of clusters comprising tens to hundreds of molecules. These clusters also include low abundance mesoscale species that are several hundreds of nanometers in diameter. Our results show that cluster formation in subsaturated solutions and phase separation in supersaturated solutions are strongly coupled via sequence-encoded interactions. Interestingly, however, cluster formation and phase separation can be decoupled from one another using solutes that impact the solubilities of phase separating proteins. They can also be decoupled by specific types of mutations. Overall, our findings implicate the presence of distinct, sequence-specific energy scales that contribute to the overall phase behaviors of RNA binding proteins. We discuss our findings in the context of theories of associative polymers.\n\nSignificance StatementMembraneless biomolecular condensates are molecular communities with distinct compositional preferences and functions. Considerable attention has focused on phase separation as the process that gives rise to condensates. Here, we show that subsaturated solutions of RNA binding proteins form heterogeneous distributions of clusters in subsaturated solutions. The formation of clusters in subsaturated solutions and condensates in supersaturated solution are coupled through sequence-specific interactions. Given the low endogenous concentrations of phase separating proteins, our findings suggest that clusters in subsaturated conditions might be of functional relevance in cells.",

    "abstract": "Traditional methods used to map the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in-situ generally involve chromatin conformation capture by formaldehyde crosslinking, followed by detergent solubilization and enzymatic digestion of DNA. Ligation of proximal DNA fragments followed by next generation sequencing (NGS) generates contact information that enables a global view of the chromatin conformation. Here, we explore the use of cryomilling to physically fragmentize the cells under cryogenic conditions to probe chromatin interactions in the cryomilled cell fragments by the tethered chromatin conformation capture (TCC). Our results show that cryomilling TCC (CTCC) can generate a global contact map similar to that obtained with in-situ Hi-C. This result suggests that summation of chromatin interactions mapped in individual subcellular fragments can reconstitute the global contact map of intact cells in an ensemble manner, paving the way for chromatin conformation analyses of solid tissue by CTCC. Compared with the conventional in-situ methods such as Hi-C, CTCC shows more uniform access to different subcompartments of the folded genome. On the other hand, most inter-chromosomal (trans) contacts are diminished or lost in CTCC except for a group of unique trans contacts that remain intact throughout the cryomilling and in- vitro crosslinking steps. These apparently ultra-stable trans interactions have much enhanced signal in CTCC due to the elimination of signals of most, presumably weak and transient trans interactions. Systematic and comparative analyses between CTCC and in-situ Hi-C provide further insights into the chromatin structure organization and reveal a generally unentangled chromosome interface and the existence of stable inter-chromosomal contacts that may represent intermingled inter-chromosomal interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The models predicting the spatial distribution of species can simulate the suitability of species habitats on different spatial scales, based on species records and site characteristics to gain insight into ecological or evolutionary drivers or to help predict habitat suitability across large scales. Species distribution models (SDMs) based on presence-absence or presence-only data use widely in biogeography to characterize the ecological niche of species and to predict the geographical distribution of their habitat. Although presence-absence data is generally of higher quality, it is also less common than presence-only data because it requires more rigorous planning to visit a set of pre-determined sites. Among the algorithms available, one of the most widely used methods of developing SDMs is the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. The MaxEnt uses entropy to generalize specific observations of presence-only data and does not require or even incorporate points where the species is absent within the theoretical framework. The purpose of this study is to predict the suitable habitat for Goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) in the Samelghan plain in northeastern Iran. The results showed that the variables of the Mediterranean climate classes, slope 0-5% class and semi-dense pastures with type Acantholimon-Astragalus are more important than other environmental variables used in modeling. The area under curve (AUC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and the classification threshold shows model performance. Based on the ROC (AUC=0.99) results in this study, it was found that Maxents performance was very good. Desirability habitat was classified based on the threshold value (0.0277) and the ROC, which approx 11% of the area, predicted suitable habitat for Goitered gazelle.",

    "abstract": "Selective autophagy cargos are recruited to autophagosomes primarily by interacting with autophagosomal ATG8 family proteins via the LC3-interacting region (LIR). The upstream sequence of most LIRs contains negatively charged residues such as Asp, Glu, and phosphorylated Ser and Thr. However, the significance of LIR phosphorylation (compared with having acidic amino acids) and the structural basis of phosphorylated LIR-ATG8 binding are not entirely understood. Here, we show that the serine residues upstream of the core LIR of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy receptor TEX264 are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2, which is critical for its interaction with ATG8s, autophagosomal localization, and ER-phagy. Structural analysis showed that phosphorylation of these serine residues increased binding affinity by producing multiple hydrogen bonds with ATG8s that cannot be mimicked by acidic residues. This binding mode is different from those of other ER-phagy receptors that utilize a downstream helix, which is absent from TEX264, to increase affinity. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the LIR is critically important for strong LIR-ATG8 interactions, even in the absence of auxiliary interactions.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy provides nutrients during starvation and eliminates detrimental cellular components. However, accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy is not merely a housekeeping process. Here, we show that the protein AuTophaGy 5 (ATG5) functions in neurons to regulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of a synapse-confined proteome. This function of ATG5 is independent of bulk turnover of synaptic proteins and requires the targeting of PKA inhibitory R1 subunits to autophagosomes. Neuronal loss of ATG5 causes synaptic accumulation of PKA R1, which sequesters the PKA catalytic subunit and diminishes the cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation of postsynaptic cytoskeletal proteins mediating AMPAR trafficking. Glutamatergic neurons-confined ATG5 deletion augments AMPAR-dependent excitatory neurotransmission and causes the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice. Our findings identify a novel role of autophagy in regulating PKA signaling at glutamatergic synapses and suggest the PKA as a target for restoration of synaptic function in neurodegenerative conditions with autophagy dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "During severe infections, Staphylococcus aureus moves from its colonising sites to blood and tissues, and is exposed to new selective pressures, thus potentially driving adaptive evolution. Previous studies have shown the key role of the agr locus in S. aureus pathoadaptation, however a more comprehensive characterisation of genetic signatures of bacterial adaptation may enable prediction of clinical outcomes and reveal new targets for treatment and prevention of these infections. Here, we measured adaptation using within-host evolution analysis of 2,590 S. aureus genomes from 396 independent episodes of infection. By capturing a comprehensive repertoire of single-nucleotide and structural genome variations, we found evidence of a distinctive evolutionary pattern within the infecting populations compared to colonising bacteria. These invasive strains had up to 20-fold enrichments for genome degradation signatures and displayed significantly convergent mutations in a distinctive set of genes, linked to antibiotic response and pathogenesis. In addition to agr-mediated adaptation we identified non-canonical, genome-wide significant loci including sucA-sucB and stp1. The prevalence of adaptive changes increased with infection extent, emphasising the clinical significance of these signatures. These findings provide a high-resolution picture of the molecular changes when S. aureus transitions from colonisation to severe infection and may inform correlation of infection outcomes with adaptation signatures.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, the de-facto method for short read-based amplicons reconstruction is a sequence similarity threshold approach (Operational taxonomic Units OTUs). This assumption was relaxed by shifting to Amplicon Sequencing Variants (ASVs) where distributions are fitted to abundance profiles of individual genes using a noise-error model. Whilst OTUs-based approach is still useful for 16SrRNA/18S rRNA regions, where typically 97-99% thresholds are used, their utility to functional genes is still debatable as there is no consensus on how to cluster the sequences together. Here, we compare OTUs- and ASVs-based reconstruction approaches as well as taxonomy assignment methods, Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) and Bayesian Lowest Common Ancestor Algorithm (BLCA), using functional genes dataset from the microbial nitrogen-cycling community in the Brouage mudflat (France). A range of OTU similarity thresholds and ASV were used to compare amoA (AOA and AOB), nxrB, nirS, nirK and nrfA communities between differing sedimentary structures. We show that for AOA-amoA and nrfA, the use of ASV led to differences in the communities between sedimentary structures whereas the use of OTUs didnt. Conversely, significant differences were detected when using OTU (97%) for AOB-amoA but not with ASV or OTUs at other similarity thresholds. Interestingly, conclusions drawn from the other three functional genes were consistent between amplicon reconstruction methods. We also show that, when the sequences in the reference-database are related to the environment in question, BLCA leads to more phylogenetically relevant classifications. However, when the reference database contains sequences more dissimilar to the ones retrieved, NBC helps obtain more information.\n\nImportanceSeveral analysis pipelines are available to microbial ecologists to process amplicon sequencing data yet to-date, there is no consensus as to the most appropriate method, and it becomes more difficult for genes that encode a specific function (functional genes). Standardised approaches need to be adopted to increase reliability and reproducibility of environmental amplicon sequencing-based datasets. In this paper, we argue that the recently developed ASV approach offers a better opportunity to achieve such standardisation compared to OTUs for functional genes. We also propose a comprehensive framework for quality filtering of the sequencing reads based on protein sequence verification and merging.",

    "abstract": "Emerging research indicates that plant-associated microbes can alter plant developmental timing. However, it is unclear if host phenology impacts microbial community assembly. Microbiome studies in annuals or deciduous perennial plants face challenges in separating effects of tissue age from phenological driven effects on the microbiome. In contrast, evergreen perennial trees, like Citrus sinensis, retain leaves for years allowing for uniform sampling of similarly aged leaves from the same developmental cohort. This aids in separating phenological effects on the microbiome from impacts due to annual leaf maturation/senescence. Here we used this system to test the hypothesis that host phenology acts as a driver of microbiome composition. Citrus sinensis leaves and roots were sampled during seven phenological stages. Using amplicon-based sequencing, followed by diversity, phylogenetic, differential abundance, and network analyses we examined changes in bacterial and fungal communities. Host phenological stage is the main determinant of microbiome composition, particularly within the foliar bacteriome. Microbial enrichment/depletion patterns suggest that microbial turnover and dispersal were driving these shifts. Moreover, a subset of community shifts were phylogenetically conserved across bacterial clades suggesting that inherited traits contribute to microbe-microbe and/or plant-microbe interactions during specific phenophases. Plant phenology influences microbial community composition. These findings enhance understanding of microbiome assembly and identify microbes that potentially influence plant development and reproduction.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of nano plastics (NPx) and micro plastics (MPx) in the environment has been demonstrated, and as such, the exposure scenarios, mechanisms of plant response, and ultimate risk must be determined. However, the current literature reports ambiguous outcomes and provides limited mechanistic insight into critical governing processes. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of the most recent literature investigating the effect of MPx/NPx on plant species under laboratory and field conditions so as to evaluate the current state of knowledge. Toxic effects of MPx/NPx exposure in plants varies as a function of plant species and interestingly, generally non-significant responses are reported in staple crops. NPx (<100 nm) more negatively affected plant development parameters (n=341) (n is total number of observations), photosynthetic pigments (n=80), and biochemical indicators (n=91) than did MPx (>100 nm). Surprisingly, NPx exposure yielded negligible effects on germination rate (n=17), although root morphology (n=45) was negatively affected. Alternatively, MPx negatively affected on germination (n= 27) and generally non-significant affect with regard to root morphology (n=64). The effect of MPx/NPx on plant health decreases with increasing exposure time. No specific trends were evident for the production of biochemical enzymes as related to MPx/NPx concentration or size. Future work should include crop full life cycle studies to highlight the accumulation of MPx/NPx in edible tissues and also to investigate potential trophic transfer of MPx/NPx. Furthermore, we provide a framework for additional investigative work to address these and other knowledge gaps and to enable accurate assessment of the fate and risk of these materials to environmental and human health.\n\nEnvironmental significanceAccumulation of plastic (MPx and NPx) particles is increasing in environmental compartments, and this might be threatened to agricultural plants.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/480069v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c71fd2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa1facorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1358c12org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f1851_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as a significant risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Studies have supported the notion that obesity accelerates AD-related pathophysiology in mouse models of AD. The majority of studies to date have focused on the use of early-onset AD models. Here we evaluate the impact of genetic risk factors on late-onset AD (LOAD) in mice fed a high fat/high sugar diet. We focused on three mouse models created through the IU/JAX/Pitt MODEL-AD Center, LOAD1, LOAD1.Plcg2M28L and LOAD1.Mthfr677C>T. At 2 months of age, animals were placed on a high fat/high sugar diet (HFD) that induces obesity, or a control diet (CD) that does not, until 12 months of age. Throughout the study, blood was collected to assess cholesterol and glucose. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was completed prior to sacrifice to image for glucose utilization and brain perfusion. At the completion of the study, blood and brains were collected for analysis. As expected, animals fed the HFD, regardless of genotype or sex, showed a significant increase in body weight compared to those fed the CD. Glucose and cholesterol increased as a function of HFD as well. Interestingly, LOAD1.Plcg2M28L demonstrated an increase in microglia density as well as alterations in regional brain glucose and perfusion when on a HFD. These changes were not observed in LOAD1 or LOAD1.Mthfr677C>T animals when fed a HFD. Furthermore, LOAD1.Plcg2M28L but not LOAD1.Mthfr677C>T or LOAD1 animals showed transcriptomics correlations to human AD modules. Our results show HFD affects brain health in a genotype-specific manner. Further insight into this process may have significant implications in the development of lifestyle interventions for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Animals typically forage in groups. Social foraging can help animals avoid predation and decrease their uncertainty about the richness of food resources. Despite this, theoretical mechanistic models of patch foraging have overwhelmingly focused on the behavior of single foragers. In this study, we develop a mechanistic model that accounts for the behavior of individuals foraging together and departing food patches following an evidence accumulation process. Each individuals belief about patch quality is represented by a stochastically accumulating variable which is coupled to others belief to represent the transfer of information. We consider a cohesive group, and model information sharing by considering both intermittent pulsatile coupling (only communicate decision to leave) and continuous diffusive coupling (communicate throughout the evidence accumulation process). We find that foraging efficiency under pulsatile coupling has a stronger dependence on the coupling strength parameter compared to diffusive. Despite employing minimal information transfer, pulsatile coupling can still provide similar or higher foraging efficiency compared to diffusive coupling. Conversely, since diffusive coupling is more robust to parameter choices, it performs better when individuals have heterogeneous departure criteria and social information weighting. Efficiency is measured by a reward rate function that balances the amount of energy accumulated against the time spent in a patch, computed by solving an ordered first passage time problem for the patch departures of each individual. Using synthetic data we show that we can distinguish between the two modes of communication and identify the model parameters. Our model establishes a social patch foraging framework to parse and identify deliberative decision strategies, to distinguish different forms of social communication, and to allow model fitting to real world animal behavior data.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNumerous R packages have been developed for bioinformatics analysis in the last decade and dependencies among packages have become critical issues to consider. In this work, we proposed a new metric named dependency heaviness that measures the number of unique dependencies that a parent brings to a package, and we proposed possible solutions for reducing the complexity of dependencies by optimizing the use of heavy parents. We implemented the metric in a new R package pkgndep which provides an intuitive way for dependency heaviness analysis. Based on pkgndep, we additionally performed a global analysis of dependency heaviness on CRAN and Bioconductor ecosystems and we revealed top packages that have significant contributions of high dependency heaviness to their child packages.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe package pkgndep and documentations are freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgndep.

    "abstract": "Phase separation of ER-exit-sites (ERES) components into membraneless compartments, the Sec bodies, occurs in Drosophila cells upon specific cellular stressors, i.e., salt stress and amino acid starvation, and their formation is linked to the inhibition of the early secretory pathway. Here, we show Sec bodies also form in secretory mammalian INS-1 cells upon the same stress. These reversible and membraneless structures are positive for ERES components, including both isoforms of Sec16 (A and B) and COPII subunits. We find that Sec16A, but not Sec16B, is a driver for Sec body formation. We show that the coalescence of ERES components into Sec bodies occurs by fusion, in line with their liquid-droplet properties. Lastly, we demonstrate that stress-induced ER-exit inhibition is a consequence of the significant coalescence of Sec16A into Sec bodies, leading to its depletion from ERES that become non-functional. Stress relief causes an immediate dissolution of Sec bodies and the concomitant restoration of protein exit from the ER. We propose a model in which dynamic conversion between ERES and Sec body assembly, driven by Sec16A, regulates protein exit from the ER during stress and upon stress relief in mammalian cells, thus providing a conserved pro-survival mechanism in response to stress.",

Heritable genetic differences associated with environment could impact fitness when transferred into new environments. Here, we test the degree to which the environment shapes the evolution and distribution of genetic effects for traits important to adaptation.\n\nMethodsIn a common garden experiment, we quantified trait differentiation for populations of Geum triflorum sourced from three distinct ecoregions and evaluated the ability of climate to predict trait variation. Populations were sourced from alvar ecoregions which experience predictable extremes in seasonal water availability and the prairie ecoregion which exhibits unpredictable changes in water availability.\n\nKey ResultsPlants sourced from alvar ecoregions exhibited smaller but more numerous stomata and greater intrinsic water use efficiency relative to prairie plant populations supporting the evolution of ecotypic differences. Estimates of standing genetic variance and heritable genetic variation for quantitative traits suggest alvar populations have greater adaptive potential. However, reduced evolvability suggest all populations of G. triflorum may have limited capacity to evolve in response to environmental change.\n\nConclusionsThese results point towards the importance of understanding the role of environment in shaping the distribution and evolution of genetic differences across seed populations and how these data may inform recommendations for seed transfer across novel environments and our expectations of populations adaptive potential.",

It is also a key regulator of erythrocyte structure and antigenic recognition. Previous biochemical studies, and a low-resolution crystal structure of the transmembrane domain have provided initial insight into AE1 structure and function. However, key questions remain regarding substrate binding and transport as well as the mechanism of inhibition. The orientation of the intracellular domain as well as the localization of lipid and sterol binding sites also remain enigmatic. We herein present seven novel high resolution cryo-EM structures of the full length human transporter in the apo, bicarbonate-bound, and several inhibitor-bound states combined with uptake- and computational studies. To our knowledge, these studies represent the first full length human, and substrate bound, SLC4 transporter structure. Our results reveal important molecular details about substrate binding and transport, as well as the diverse mechanisms of AE1 inhibition by both research chemicals and prescription drugs. We also provide novel insights into the full-length transporter architecture, identify the conformational space of the Diego blood antigen system and elucidate multiple lipid and sterol binding sites.",

    "abstract": "Human two-pore channels (TPCs) are endolysosomal cation channels and play an important role in NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release and endomembrane dynamics. TPCs are activated by PI(3,5)P2, which is synthesized by PIKfyve. Here, we found that YM201636, a widely used PIKfyve inhibitor, potently inhibits PI(3,5)P2-induced human TPC2 channel Na+ currents in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.16 M. YM201636 also effectively inhibits the currents of a constitutively open TPC2 mutant channel, whereas it exerts no effect when applied in the channels closed state. A YM201636 analog, PI-103, an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, also inhibits human TPC2 with an IC50 of 0.64 M. Substitution of the pore-constriction residues Leu690, Leu694 and Tyr312 by Ala reduced the effectiveness of YM201636 and PI-103 in channel inhibition. Interestingly, a His699 residue located near the cytosolic pore entrance is a key determinant for the TPC2 channels sensitivity to YM201636 and PI-103, whose substitution with a Phe in the human TPC1 largely accounts for the channels loss of inhibition by YM201636. Molecular dynamic simulation and docking analysis of YM201636s binding to TPC2 indicated that His699 can interact with the inhibitor and facilitate the channel-blockade at the cytosolic end of the pore. We conclude that YM201636 and PI-103 directly block the TPC2s open-state channel pore at the cytosolic entrance where the His699 is a key determinant for the blockers access to the pore. These findings identify two new potent TPC2 channel blockers, reveal a channel pore entrance blockade mechanism, and provide a new protein target in interpreting the pharmacological effects of these two widely used phosphoinositide kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Single cell proteomics is a powerful tool with potential for markedly enhancing understanding of cellular processes. Previously reported single cell proteomics innovations employ Orbitrap mass spectrometers. In this study we describe the development, optimization, and application of multiplexed single cell proteomics to the analysis of human-derived cells using trapped ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This method, denoted as pasefRiQ is an advance as it allows accurate peptide quantification at picogram peptide concentrations. When employing a peptide carrier channel to boost protein sequence coverage, we obtain over 40,000 tandem mass spectra in 30 minutes, while achieving higher sequence coverage of each identified protein than described for SCOPE2. Using NCI-H-358 cells, which are a human bronchioalveolar carcinoma and KRASG12C model cell line, we demonstrate that the level of coverage achieved using this method enables the quantification of up to 1,255 proteins per cell and the detection of multiple classes of post-translational modifications in single cells. Further, when cells were treated with sotorasib, a KRASG12C covalent inhibitor, pasefRiQ revealed cell-to-cell variability in the impact of the drug on the NCI-H-358 cells, providing insight missed by traditional analyses. We provide multiple resources necessary for the application of single cell proteomics to drug treatment studies including tools to reduce cell cycle linked proteomic effects from masking pharmacological phenotypes.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work describes the establishment of a single cell proteomics method using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Through this approach, we demonstrate the confident identification of post- translational modifications in single human-derived cells. Additionally, using a KRASG12C covalent inhibitor as a model compound we show that this method can be used to understand pharmacological responses of single human-derived cultured cells.",

    "abstract": "Frataxin is a kinetic activator of the mitochondrial supercomplex for iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Low frataxin expression or a decrease in its functionality results in Friedreichs Ataxia (FRDA). With the aim of creating new molecular tools to study this metabolic pathway, and ultimately, to explore new therapeutic strategies, we have investigated the possibility of obtaining small proteins exhibiting a high affinity for frataxin. In this study, we applied the ribosome display approach, using human frataxin as the target. We focused on Affi_224, one of the proteins that we were able to select after five selection rounds. We have studied the interaction between both proteins and discussed some applications of this specific molecular tutor, concerning the modulation of supercomplex activity. Affi_224 and frataxin showed a KD value in the nanomolar range, as judged by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Most likely, it binds to the frataxin acidic ridge, as suggested by the analysis of chemical shift perturbations (NMR) and computational simulations. Affi_224 was able to increase Cys NFS1 desulfurase activation exerted by the FRDA frataxin variant G130V. Our results suggest quaternary addition may be a new tool to modulate frataxin function in vivo. Nevertheless, more functional experiments under physiological conditions should be carried out to evaluate Affi_224 effectiveness in FRDA cell models.",

Using cryo-EM, we reveal a Q10 molecule occupying the full length of the Q-binding site in the  active (ready-to-go) resting state (plus a matching substrate-free structure) and apply molecular dynamics simulations to propose how the charge states of key residues influence the Q10 binding pose. By comparing ligand-bound and ligand-free forms of the  deactive resting state (that require reactivating to catalyse), we begin to define how substrate binding restructures the deactive Q-binding site, providing insights into its physiological and mechanistic relevance.",

Redox homeostasis or redox potential in organelles is maintained within a particular range to facilitate the organelle specific cellular redox reactions. Previous studies using yeast, cell systems, and nematodes have demonstrated that the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) has a more oxidizing environment while the cytosol exhibits a reducing redox potential. However, we know very little about how universal this phenomenon is. We created transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) lines with roGFP sensors targeted to the ER and cytosol for studying physiological redox potential at the systems level. In the process, we also characterized the ER-targeting signal sequence in D. rerio for the first time. Measurements of the redox state in live embryos found that the endoplasmic reticulum exhibits deviations from its expected oxidizing redox state in different regions of the developing embryos. The ER is far more reducing than expected in certain tissues of the embryo. Cytosol also exhibited unexpected redox states in some parts of the embryo. Notably, the brain showed regions with unexpected redox states in both the ER and the cytosol. Tissue-specific differences in ER-redox potential became even more evident in a transgenic line expressing the more sensitive roGFPiE variant. Thus, live monitoring of redox potential across the developing zebrafish embryos revealed unanticipated redox states of the ER that will require new biological definitions.",

Production of transfusion-ready cultured RBCs (cRBCs) is a promising replacement for the current fully donor-dependent therapy. However, very large number of cells are required for transfusion. Here we scale-up cRBC production from static cultures to 0.5 L stirred tank bioreactors, and identify the effect of operating conditions on the efficiency of the process. Oxygen requirement of proliferating erythroblasts (0.55-2.01 pg/cell/h) required sparging of air to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at the tested setpoint (2.88 mg O2/L). Erythroblasts could be cultured at dissolved oxygen concentrations as low as 0.7 O2 mg/mL without negative impact on proliferation, viability or differentiation dynamics. Stirring speeds of up to 600 rpm supported erythroblast proliferation, while 1800 rpm led to a transient halt in growth and accelerated differentiation followed by a recovery after 5 days of culture. Erythroblasts could also be differentiated in bioreactors, with final enucleation levels and hemoglobin content similar to parallel cultures under static conditions. After defining optimal mixing and aeration strategies, erythroblast proliferation cultures were successfully scaled up to 3 L bioreactors.",

Blocks of residues exhibiting large amplitudes in slow dynamics are rigidified by local inter-residue interactions or secondary structures. A long region or an entire IDP can be slowed down by long-range contacts or secondary- structure packing. On the other hand, glycines promote fast dynamics and either demarcate rigid blocks or facilitate multiple modes of local and long-range inter-residue interactions. The sequence-dependent backbone dynamics endows IDPs with versatile response to binding partners, with some blocks recalcitrant while others readily adapting to intermolecular interactions.",

To fill this gap, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) pulling simulations to dissect the microscopic origin of this phenomenon. We first established that the free energy landscape obtained in the simulations is in excellent agreement with the single-molecule optical tweezer experiments. The origin of the stronger stability in Na+ compared to K+ is found to be due to the differences in the charge-density related binding modes. The smaller hydrated Na+ ion preferentially binds to the highly charged phosphates. In contrast, the larger K+ ions interact with the major grooves. As a result, the electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate groups is reduced more effectively by Na+ ions. Because the proposed mechanism is generic, we predict that the same conclusions are valid for divalent alkaline earth metal cations.",

We also show that the glycocalyx, which is often neglected in studies of cell-entry, plays a key role, and the density and structure of the glycocalyx can determine whether or not a virus can enter the cell. We further find that co-receptors play not only a signalling role, but an important thermodynamic role in viral entry. We then show that this model can be used to calculate the cell-entry probabilities of a given virus, which can shine a light on the clinical observations associated with a virus.",

    "abstract": "Tumor propagating cells (TPCs) make up a small proportion of tumor cells responsible for self-renewal and long-term propagation of small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) tumors. Here, we show that Kinase Suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2) is an important regulator of the self-renewing and clonogenic properties of SCLC cells. KSR2 is a molecular scaffold which promotes Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and AMPK signaling in SCLC. KSR2 is preferentially expressed in the ASCL1 subtype of SCLC tumors as well as the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells from which the SCLC tumors arise. The expression of KSR2 in SCLC and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells was previously unrecognized and serves as a novel model for understanding the role of KSR2-dependent signaling in normal and malignant tissues. Disruption of KSR2 in SCLC-A cell lines significantly reduces colony forming ability of TPCs in vitro and tumor initiating capacity in vivo. These data indicate that the expression of KSR2 is an essential driver of SCLC-A tumor propagating cell function, and therefore may play a role in SCLC tumor initiation. These findings shed light on a key distinct protein responsible for regulation in ASCL1 subtype SCLC tumors, and a potential subtype specific therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with metabolic dysfunction and metabolic dysfunction accelerates the course of aging. This is well illustrated by aging-like phenotypes displayed in the Polymerase Gamma mutant mouse. Here, a key residue of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase is mutated (D257A) which hinders proof reading capacity, resulting in mitochondrial DNA mutation and instability. Given known cardiac phenotypes in the POLG mutant mouse, we sought to characterize the course of cardiac dysfunction in the POLG mutant to guide future intervention studies. Including both male and female animals allowed interrogation of sex-specific responses to severe metabolic dysfunction. We also conducted RNA-seq analysis on cardiac right ventricles to broadly identify mechanisms engaged by severe metabolic dysfunction that are associated with RV pathology. Several interesting sex differences were noted. Specifically, female POLG mutants died earlier than male POLG mutants and LV chamber diameters were impacted earlier in females than males. Moreover, male POLG mutants showed LV wall thinning while female POLG mutant LV walls were thicker. Both males and females displayed significant RV hypertrophy. Finally, RNA-seq analysis of the RV tissue indicated that POLG mutation significantly impacted canonical pathways associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and heart failure. Comparison of this RNA-seq dataset with other publically available datasets highlight 1) strong conservation among downregulated genes in models of accelerated cardiac aging, 2) the potential involvement of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in the POLG mutant, and 3) the ability of zinc dependent HDAC inhibition to rescue the expression of genes downregulated in accelerated cardiac aging.",

Information regarding PepT2 in teleost fish is limited and to date functional data are available from the zebrafish (Danio rerio) only. Here, we report the identification of two slc15a2 genes in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) genome, namely slc15a2a and slc15a2b. The two encoded PepT2 proteins share 87% identity and resemble both structurally and functionally to the canonical vertebrate PepT2 system. The mRNA tissue distribution analyses reveal a widespread distribution of slc15a2a transcripts, being more abundant in the brain and gills, while slc15a2b transcripts are mainly expressed in kidney and distal part of gastrointestinal tract. The function of the two transporters was investigated by heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two- electrode voltage-clamp recordings of transport and presteady-state currents. Both PepT2a and PepT2b in the presence of Gly-Gln elicit pH-dependent and Na+ independent inward currents. The biophysical and kinetic analysis of the recorded currents defined the transport properties, confirming that the two Atlantic salmon PepT2 proteins behave as high-affinity/low-capacity transporters. The recent structures and the previous kinetic schemes of rat and human PepT2 qualitatively account for the characteristics of the two Atlantic salmon proteins.

A major contributor to this complexity is an evolutionary intermediate group (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (Alef.) Voss; SLC) between the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum L.; SLL) and its wild relative (Solanum pimpinellifolium L.; SP). SLC includes accessions with a broad spectrum of genomic and phenotypic characteristics. Some of the SLC accessions were previously hypothesized to be spreading northward from South America into Mesoamerica and that migration probably entailed reversal to wild-like phenotypes such as smaller fruits. Prior to this study, the northernmost confirmed extension of the SLC was limited to northern Mexico.\n\nIn this study, we employed genomic methods to investigate the origin of a wild-like tomato found in a garden in Scottsdale Arizona, USA. The so-called \"Arizona tomato\" featured a vigorous growth habit and carried small fruits weighing 2-3 grams. Our phylogenomic analyses revealed the identity of the Arizona tomato as a member of the Mexican SLC population (SLC MEX). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an SLC accession, confirmed using genomics, growing spontaneously in Arizona. This finding could have implications for conservation biology as well as agriculture.",

Here, we present a suite of functional recombinase-based gene circuits for use in plants. We first established a range of key gene circuit components compatible with plant cell functionality. We then used these to develop a range of operational logic gates using the identify function (activation) and negation function (repression) in Arabidopsis protoplasts and in vivo, demonstrating their utility for programmable manipulation of transcriptional activity in a complex multicellular organism. Through utilization of genetic recombination these circuits create stable long-term changes in expression and recording of past stimuli.

    "abstract": "Gene expression can be monitored in hard-to-image environmental materials using gas-reporting biosensors, but these outputs have only been applied in autoclaved matrices that are hydrated with rich medium. To better understand the compatibility of indicator gas reporting with environmental samples, we evaluated how matrix hydration affects the gas signal of an engineered microbe added to a sieved soil. A gas-reporting microbe presented a gas signal in a forest soil (Alfisol) when hydrated to an environmentally-relevant osmotic pressure. When the gas signal was concentrated prior to analysis, a biosensor titer of 103 cells/gram soil produced a significant signal when soil was supplemented with halides. A signal was also observed without halide amendment, but a higher cell titer (106 cells/gram soil) was required. A sugar-regulated gas biosensor was able to report with a similar level of sensitivity when added to an unsterilized soil matrix, illustrating how gas concentration enables biosensing within a soil containing environmental microbes. These results establish conditions where engineered microbes can report on gene expression in living environmental matrices with minimal perturbation, using biosensor titers that are orders of magnitude lower than the number of cells typically observed in a gram of soil.",

These approaches are robust and can be useful to also validate the status of species that are uncommon and underrepresented in biological collections. We examined the species limits and validated the taxonomic status of the Minor Red Bat (Lasiurus minor), an uncommon species originally described from four specimens. Our approach consisted of three independent lines of evidence combining genetic and phenotypic data. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the uniqueness of L. minor compared to three other geographically and closely related Red Bat species. Furthermore, coalescent species delimitation supported the four Red Bat species hypothesis. Linear phenotypic analyses demonstrated that L. minor is distinct from other Red Bats despite a morphological continuum. Finally, we reassessed the diagnosability of characters used to describe L. minor using an objective shape analysis approach, which emphasized the support for this taxon. Based on our findings, while identification in the field could still pose a challenge, there is strong support to recognize L. minor. This study settles a longstanding taxonomic question and provides evidence to better understand Caribbean biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytic clearance of degenerating neurons is triggered by \"eat-me\" signals exposed on the neuronal surface. The conserved neuronal eat-me signal phosphatidylserine (PS) and the engulfment receptor Draper (Drpr) mediate phagocytosis of degenerating neurons in Drosophila. However, how PS is recognized by Drpr-expressing phagocytes in vivo remains poorly understood. Using multiple models of dendrite degeneration, we show that the Drosophila chemokine-like protein Orion can bind to PS and is responsible for detecting PS exposure on neurons; it is supplied cell-non-autonomously to coat PS-exposing dendrites and to mediate interactions between PS and Drpr, thus enabling phagocytosis. As a result, the accumulation of Orion on neurons and on phagocytes produces opposite outcomes by potentiating and suppressing phagocytosis, respectively. Moreover, the Orion dosage is a key determinant of the sensitivity of phagocytes to PS exposed on neurons. Lastly, mutagenesis analyses show that the sequence motifs shared between Orion and human immunomodulatory proteins are important for Orion function. Thus, our results uncover a missing link in PS-mediated phagocytosis in Drosophila and imply conserved mechanisms of phagocytosis of neurons.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPhagocytes efficiently clear sick or damaged neuronal branches by engulfing them, while leaving healthy branches untouched. How phagocytes recognize degenerating neurites remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a key role for the secreted protein Orion in the detection and engulfment of degenerating neurites in Drosophila. Using multiple models of dendrite degeneration, we found that Orion acts as a bridging molecule between the neuronal \"eat-me\" signal phosphatidylserine and the engulfment receptor Draper on phagocytes, enabling phagocytosis. Our study reveals a missing link in phosphatidylserine-mediated phagocytosis in vivo, sheds light on factors determining the sensitivity of phagocytes, and implies the potential for manipulating the detection of neuronal \"eat-me\" signals in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in the reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system in response to stressful situations are thought to be an important predictor for psychological well-being and the focus of current scientific investigations. Here, we explored whether increased sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) was associated with reduced alpha power and with increased freezing-like behaviour (i.e., body sway) while watching threatening stimuli, reflecting enhanced attention. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) was used as a proxy for sympathetic nervous activity, which is elevated in stressful situations. A passive viewing task with affective pictures (unpleasant, neutral, pleasant) was carried out, and pre- and post- task sAA samples were taken. Oscillatory brain activity in the EEG and body sway were assessed simultaneously during the task. The results point to an increase in sAA being associated with reduced alpha power decrease to the unpleasant compared to the neutral pictures as well as increased freezing-like behaviour (i.e., reduction in body sway for unpleasant versus neutral pictures). It appears that an increase in SNA is linked to less attentional valence differentiation. Furthermore, our study corroborates findings from the animal literature in that the SNA increase is linked to a freezing-like response.",

    "abstract": "Prediction errors in the brain are indexed by two event-related potentials - MMN and P300, which are elicited upon violation of regularity in the occurrence of repetitive stimuli. While MMN reflects the brains ability to perform automatic comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an electrophysiological index of sensory error detection, P300 is associated with cognitive processes such as update in working memory. Till date, there has been extensive research on the roles of MMN and P300 individually, because of their potential to be used as clinical markers of consciousness and attention, respectively. However, the relationship between these two ERPs, specifically in terms of their underlying cortical generators, in context of prediction error propagation along the hierarchical brain across multiple modalities is an open question. Our objective in this article is two-fold. First, we reconfirm previous reports regarding the generators of MMN and P300 in sensor space through source-space analysis using an accurate individual subject level co-registration of MRI and EEG data collected from healthy humans. We demonstrate that in multisensory environments, MMN and P300 markers represent \"modality-specific\" and \"modality-independent\" information processing, respectively. Advancing an earlier understanding that multisensory contexts speed up early sensory processing, our study reveals that this temporal facilitation extends to even the later components of prediction error processing, using custom-designed experiments that allow comparisons across different modality combinations. Such knowledge can be of immense value in clinical research for determining the stages of various treatments in aging, schizophrenia and depression, and their efficacy on cognitive function.",

In fibrotic lesions in human and mouse lungs, there is extensive desialylation of glycoconjugates, and upregulation of sialidases including the extracellular sialidase NEU3. In the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, mice lacking NEU3 (Neu3-/-) showed strongly attenuated bleomycin-induced weight loss, lung damage, inflammation, upregulation of TGF-{beta}1, and fibrosis. This indicates that NEU3 is necessary for the full spectrum of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. To determine if NEU3 is sufficient for fibrosis, mice not treated with bleomycin were treated with recombinant murine NEU3 or inactive NEU3. Aspiration of NEU3 caused inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs, while inactive NEU3 caused inflammation but not fibrosis. Mice were also treated with NEU3 starting 10 days after bleomycin. In male but not female mice, NEU3 increased inflammation and fibrosis. Inactive NEU3 did not enhance bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. These results suggest that NEU3 is sufficient to induce fibrosis in the lungs, and that this effect is mediated by NEU3s enzymic activity.",

    "abstract": "Current influenza vaccines predominantly induce immunity to the hypervariable viral hemagglutinin (HA) head, requiring frequent vaccine reformulation. Conversely, antigenic sites on the conserved HA stem are subdominant and harbor a supersite which is targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), making it a prime target for universal vaccines. Here, we show that co-immunization of two stem immunogens derived from influenza A group 1 and 2 HAs elicits cross-group protective immunity and neutralizing antibody responses in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Immunized mice were protected from multiple group 1 and 2 viruses, and all animal models showed broad serum neutralizing activity. A bnAb isolated from an immunized NHP broadly neutralized and conferred protection from viruses including H5N1 and H7N9. Genetic and structural analyses revealed a remarkable convergent evolution between macaque and human bnAbs, illustrating the biophysical constraints for acquiring immunoglobulins with cross-group specificity. Co-immunization of stem immunogens elicits not only group-specific protective immunity, but also cross-group bnAb responses, and represents a step towards broadly protective influenza vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a promising solution to the antibiotic resistance crisis. However, an unresolved serious concern is that the evolution of resistance to therapeutic AMPs may generate cross-resistance to host AMPs, compromising a cornerstone of the innate immune response. We systematically tested this hypothesis using globally disseminated mobile colistin resistance (MCR) that has been selected by the use of colistin in agriculture and medicine. Here we show that MCR provides a selective advantage to E. coli in the presence of key AMPs from humans and agricultural animals by increasing AMP resistance. Moreover, MCR promotes bacterial growth in human serum and increases virulence in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Our study shows how the anthropogenic use of AMPs can drive the accidental evolution of resistance to the innate immune system of humans and animals. These findings have major implications for the design and use of therapeutic AMPs and they suggest that MCR will be difficult to eradicate, even if colistin use is withdrawn.",

    "abstract": "As viral genomic imprints in host genomes, endogenous viral elements (EVEs) shed light on the deep evolutionary history of viruses, ancestral host ranges, and ancient viral-host interactions. In addition, they may provide crucial information for calibrating viral evolutionary timescales. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive in silico screening of a large dataset of available mammalian genomes for EVEs deriving from members of the viral family Flaviviridae, an important group of viruses including well-known human pathogens. We identified two novel pestivirus-like EVEs in the reference genome of the Indochinese shrew (Crocidura indochinensis). Homologs of these novel EVEs were subsequently detected in vivo by molecular detection and sequencing in 27 shrew species, including 26 species representing a wide distribution within the Crocidurinae subfamily and one in the Soricinae subfamily. Based on this wide distribution, we estimate that the integration event occurred before the last common ancestor of the subfamily, about 10.8 million years ago, attesting to an ancient origin of pestiviruses and Flaviviridae in general. Moreover, we provide the first description of Flaviviridae-derived EVEs in mammals even though the family encompasses numerous mammal-infecting members, including major human pathogens such as Zika, dengue, or hepatitis C viruses. This also suggests that shrews were past and perhaps also current natural reservoirs of pestiviruses. Taken together, our results expand the current known Pestivirus host range and provide novel insight into the ancient evolutionary history of pestiviruses and the Flaviviridae family in general.",

    "abstract": "Exploring natural diversity of functional genes/proteins from environmental DNA (eDNA) in a high-throughput fashion remains challenging. In this study, we developed a sequence-based functional metagenomics procedure for mining the diversity of copper resistance gene copA in global microbiomes, by combining the metagenomic assembly technology, local BLAST, evolutionary trace analysis (ETA), chemical synthesis, and conventional functional genomics. In total, 88 metagenomes were collected from a public database and subjected to copA detection, resulting in 93,899 hits. Manual curation of 1214 hits of high-confidence led to the retrieval of 517 unique CopA candidates, which were further subjected to ETA. Eventually 175 novel copA sequences of high-quality were discovered. Phylogenetic analysis showed that almost all of these putative CopA proteins are distantly related to known CopA proteins, with 55 sequences from totally unknown species. Ten novel and three known copA genes were chemically synthesized for further functional genomic tests using the Cu-sensitive Escherichia coli ({Delta}copA). Growth test and Cu uptake determination showed that five novel clones had positive effects on host Cu resistance and uptake. One recombinant harboring copA-like 15 (copAL15) successfully restored Cu resistance of host with a substantially enhanced Cu uptake. Two novel copA genes were fused with the gfp gene and expressed in E. coli for microscopic observation. Imaging results showed that they were successfully expressed and their proteins were localized to the membrane. The results here greatly expand the diversity of known CopA proteins, and the sequence-based procedure developed overcomes biases in length, screening methods, and abundance of conventional functional metagenomics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRapid diagnostic tests based on detection of histidine rich proteins (HRP) are widely used for malaria diagnosis, but parasites carrying pfhrp deletions can evade detection and are increasing in frequency in some countries. Models aim to predict conditions under which pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 deletions will increase, but a key parameter - the fitness cost of deletions - is unknown\n\nMethodsWe removed pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 from a Malawian parasite clone using CRISPR/Cas9 and measured fitness costs by conducting pairwise competition experiments.\n\nResultsWe observed significant fitness costs of 0.087 {+/-} 0.008 (1 s.e.) per asexual cycle for pfhrp2 deletion and 0.113 {+/-} 0.008 (1 s.e.) for the pfhrp2/3 double deletion, relative to the unedited progenitor parasite. The results demonstrate [~]10% reduced survival of parasites bearing deletions of these loci.\n\nConclusionsPrior modelling suggested that diagnostic selection may drive increased frequency of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions when fitness costs are [&le;]10%. Our laboratory competition experiments are consistent with costs of pfhrp2/3 deletions lying at this critical tipping point. These results may inform future modelling efforts and help us to understand why pfhrp2/3 deletions are increasing in some locations (Ethiopia/Eritrea) but not in others (Mekong region).",

    "abstract": "Secretion of high-molecular-weight polysaccharides across the bacterial envelope is ubiquitous as it enhances prokaryotic survival in (a)biotic settings. Such polymers are often assembled by Wzx/Wzy- or ABC transporter-dependent schemes that implicate outer-membrane (OM) polysaccharide export (OPX) proteins in polymer translocation to the cell surface. In the social predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, exopolysaccharide (EPS)-pathway WzaX, major spore coat (MASC)-pathway WzaS, and biosurfactant polysaccharide-pathway WzaB were herein found to be truncated OPX homologues of Escherichia coli Wza lacking OM-spanning -helices. Comparative genomics across all bacteria, complemented with cryo-electron tomography cell- envelope analyses, revealed WzaX/S/B architecture to be the most common amongst three defined OPX-protein structural classes independent of periplasmic thickness. Fold-recognition and deep- learning analyses revealed the conserved M. xanthus proteins MXAN_7418/3226/1916 (encoded adjacent to WzaX/S/B) to be integral OM {beta}-barrels, with structural homology to the poly-N-acetyl-D- glucosamine synthase-dependent pathway porin PgaA. Such porins were identified in bacteria near numerous genes for all three OPX-protein classes. Interior MXAN_7418/3226/1916 {beta}-barrel electrostatics were found to match known properties of their associated polymers. With MXAN_3226 essential for MASC export, and MXAN_7418 absence shown herein to compromise EPS translocation, these data support a novel secretion paradigm for Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathways in which those containing an OPX component that cannot span the OM instead utilize a {beta}-barrel porin to mediate polysaccharide transport across the OM.",

Elucidating the process of this presentation is essential for regulation and potential manipulation of the cellular immune system [1]. Predicting whether a given peptide will bind to the MHC is an important step in the above process, motivating the introduction of many computational approaches. NetMHCPan [2], a pan-specific model predicting binding of peptides to any MHC molecule, is one of the most widely used methods which focuses on solving this binary classification problem using a shallow neural network. The successful results of AI methods, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP-based) pretrained models in various applications including protein structure determination, motivated us to explore their use in this problem as well. Specifically, we considered fine-tuning these large deep learning models using as dataset the peptide-MHC sequences. Using standard metrics in this area, and the same training and test sets, we show that our model outperforms NetMHCpan4.1 which has been shown to outperform all other earlier methods [2].",

    "abstract": "The widely occurring bacterial RNA chaperone Hfq is a key factor in the post-transcriptional control of hundreds of genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. How this broadly acting protein can contribute to the regulation requirements of so many different genes remains puzzling. Here, we describe the structures of higher-order assemblies formed on control regions of different P. aeruginosa target mRNAs by Hfq and its partner protein Crc. Our results show that these assemblies have mRNA-specific quaternary architectures resulting from the combination of multivalent protein-protein interfaces and recognition of patterns in the RNA sequence. The structural polymorphism of the ribonucleoprotein assemblies enables selective translational repression of many different target mRNAs. This system suggests how highly complex regulatory pathways can evolve and be rewired with a simple economy of proteinogenic components.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=117 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/480102v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b34242org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c31071org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c8750org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@27ca3c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The RNA chaperone Hfq, in conjunction with the co-repressor Crc, forms higher order assemblies on nascent mRNAs. These complexes impact on translation of hundreds of transcripts in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Assemblies with different quaternary structures result from the interactions of the proteins with sequence motifs and structural elements in different mRNA targets, as well as from a repertoire of protein-to-protein interfaces. In this way, the combination of RNA sequence and two proteins can generate the diversity required to regulate many genes. It is proposed that the multi-step assembly process is highly cooperative and most likely competes kinetically with translation initiation to silence the targeted transcripts.",
