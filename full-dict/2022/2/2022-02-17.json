    "abstract": "FAM21 (family with sequence similarity 21) is a component of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) protein complex that mediates actin polymerization at endosomal membranes to facilitate sorting of cargo-containing vesicles out of endosomes. To study the function of FAM21 in vivo, we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice in the C57BL/6 background in which FAM21 was specifically knocked out of CD11c-positive dendritic cells. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from those mice displayed enlarged early endosomes, and altered cell migration and morphology relative to wildtype (WT) cells. FAM21-cKO cells were less competent in phagocytosis and antigen processing in vitro, though antigen presentation was not affected. More importantly, we identified the TLR2/CLEC4E signaling pathway as being downregulated in FAM21-cKO BMDCs when challenged with its specific ligand Candida albicans. Moreover, FAM21-cKO mice were more susceptible to C. albicans infection than WT mice. Reconstitution of WT BMDCs in FAM21-cKO mice rescued them from lethal C. albicans infection. Thus, our study highlights the importance of FAM21 in a host immune response against a significant pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Gene drives hold promise for the genetic control of malaria vectors. The development of vector population modification strategies hinges on the availability of effector mechanisms impeding parasite development in transgenic mosquitoes. We augmented a midgut gene of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae to secrete two exogenous antimicrobial peptides, Magainin 2 and Melittin. This small genetic modification, capable of efficient non-autonomous gene drive, hampers oocyst development in both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei. It delays the release of infectious sporozoites while it simultaneously reduces the lifespan of homozygous female transgenic mosquitoes. Modeling the spread of this modification using a large-scale agent-based model of malaria epidemiology reveals that it can break the cycle of disease transmission across a range of endemic settings.\n\nOne sentence summaryWe developed a gene drive effector that retards Plasmodium development in transgenic Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes via the expression of antimicrobial peptides in the midgut and which is predicted to eliminate malaria under a range of transmission scenarios.",

Unlike their human counterparts, mouse iPSCs (miPSCs) are reported to silence transposable elements (TEs) and prevent TE-mediated mutagenesis. Here we applied short-read or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read genome sequencing to 38 bulk miPSC lines reprogrammed from 10 parental cell types, and 18 single-cell miPSC clones. While single nucleotide variants and structural variants restricted to miPSCs were rare, we found 83 de novo TE insertions, including examples intronic to Brca1 and Dmd. LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons were profoundly hypomethylated in miPSCs, beyond other TEs and the genome overall, and harbored alternative protein-coding gene promoters. Treatment with the L1 inhibitor lamivudine did not hinder reprogramming and efficiently blocked endogenous retrotransposition, as detected by ONT sequencing. These experiments reveal the complete spectrum and potential significance of mutations acquired by miPSCs.",

    "abstract": "Covalent inhibition is a valuable modality in drug-discovery due to its potential ability in decoupling pharmacokinetics from pharmacodynamics by prolonging the residence time of the drug on the target of interest. This increase in target occupancy is limited only by the rate of target turnover. However, a limitation in such studies is to translate the in-vitro inhibition assessment to the appropriate in-cellulo target engagement parameter by covalent probes. Estimation of such parameters is often impeded by the low-throughput nature of current label-free approaches. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring (UPLC-MRM) mass spectrometry platform was utilised to develop a targeted proteomics workflow that can evaluate cellular on-target engagement of covalent molecules in an increased throughput manner. This workflow enabled a throughput increase of 5-10 fold when compared to traditional nanoLC-based proteomics studies. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, KRASG12C was used as a model system to interrogate the interaction of an irreversible covalent small-molecule, compound 25, both in-vitro and in-cellulo. Initial biochemical studies confirmed that the small-molecule forms an adduct with the targeted cysteine on the protein, as assessed at the level of both intact protein and on the target peptide. In-cellulo studies were carried out to quantify target engagement and selectivity assessment in heterozygous NCI-H358 cell line with both WT type and KRASG12C alleles. The workflow enabled evaluation of in-cellulo target engagement kinetics providing mechanistic insights into the irreversible mode of inhibition. In summary, the method has the potential for target agnostic application in the assessment of on-target engagement of covalent probes compatible with the high-throughput requirements of early drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid detection and variant calling through CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPRDx) has facilitated clinical decision-making, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been further accelerated through the discovery of newer and engineered CRISPR effectors, expanding the portfolio of such diagnostic applications to a wide variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic conditions. However, each diagnostic CRISPR pipeline requires customized detection schemes originating from fundamental principles of the Cas protein used, its guide RNA (gRNA) design parameters, and the assay readout. This is particularly relevant for variant detection, an attractive low-cost alternative to sequencing-based approaches for which no in silico pipeline for the ready-to-use design of CRISPR-based diagnostics currently exists. In this manuscript, we fill this lacuna using a unified webserver CriSNPr (CRISPR based SNP recognition), which provides the user the opportunity to de-novo design gRNAs based on six CRISPRDx proteins of choice (Fn/enFnCas9, LwCas13a, LbCas12a, AaCas12b, and Cas14a) and query for ready-to-use oligonucleotide sequences for validation on relevant samples. In addition, we provide a database of curated pre-designed gRNAs and target/off-target for all human and SARS-CoV-2 variants reported so far. CriSNPr has been validated on multiple Cas proteins and highlights its broad and immediate scope of utilization across multiple detection platforms.

AF2 has been used for the modeling of many soluble and membrane proteins, but its performance in modeling peptide structures has not been systematically investigated so far. We benchmarked the accuracy of AF2 in predicting peptide structures between 16 - 60 amino acids using experimentally-determined peptide structures as reference. Our results show that while AF2 can predict the structures of certain peptide scaffolds with RMSD values below 3 [A], it is less successful in predicting the structures of peptides that have kinks, turns, or have extended flexible regions. Further, AF2 had several shortcomings in predicting rotamer recoveries, disulfide bonds, and the lowest RMSD structures based on pLDDT values. In summary, AF2 can be a powerful tool to determine peptide structures, but additional steps may be necessary to analyze and validate the results.",

    "abstract": "For many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, mRNA localizes to the mitochondrial surface co-translationally, aided by the association of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) on the nascent peptide with the mitochondrial import complex. For a subset of these co-translationally localized mRNAs, their localization is dependent on the metabolic state of the cell, while others are constitutively localized. To explore the differences between these two mRNA types we developed a stochastic, quantitative model for MTS-mediated mRNA localization to mitochondria in yeast cells. This model includes translation, applying gene-specific kinetics derived from experimental data; and diffusion in the cytosol. Even though both mRNA types are co-translationally localized we found that the steady state number, or density, of ribosomes along an mRNA was insufficient to differentiate the two mRNA types. Instead, conditionally-localized mRNAs have faster translation kinetics which modulate localization in combination with changes to diffusive search kinetics across metabolic states. Our model also suggests that the MTS requires a maturation time to become competent to bind mitochondria. Our work indicates that yeast cells can regulate mRNA localization to mitochondria by controlling mitochondrial volume fraction (influencing diffusive search times) and gene translation kinetics (adjusting mRNA binding competence) without the need for mRNA-specifc binding proteins. These results shed light on both global and gene-specific mechanisms that enable cells to alter mRNA localization in response to changing metabolic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma vivax is a unicellular hemoparasite, and a principal cause of animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT), a vector-borne and potentially fatal disease of livestock across sub-Saharan Africa. Previously, we identified diverse T. vivax-specific genes that were predicted to encode cell surface proteins. Here, we examine the immune responses of naturally and experimentally infected hosts to many of these unique parasite antigens, to identify immunogens that could become vaccine candidates. Immunoprofiling of host serum showed that one particular family (Fam34) elicits a consistent IgG antibody response. This gene family, which we now call Vivaxin, encodes at least 124 transmembrane glycoproteins that display quite distinct expression profiles and patterns of genetic variation. We focused on one gene (viv-{beta}8) that is among the most immunogenic and highly expressed but displays minimal polymorphism. VIV{beta}8 was localized across the cell body and flagellar membrane, suggesting that vivaxin is substantial family of novel surface proteins. Although vaccination of mice with VIV{beta}8 adjuvanted with Quil-A elicits a strong, balanced immune response and delays parasite proliferation in some animals, ultimately, it does not prevent disease. However, our phylogenetic analysis shows vivaxin includes other antigens shown to induce immunity against T. vivax. Thus, the introduction of vivaxin represents an important advance in our understanding of the T. vivax cell surface. Besides being a source of proven and promising vaccine antigens, the gene family is clearly an important component of the parasite glycocalyx, with potential to influence the host-parasite interaction.\n\nAuthor summaryAnimal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) is an important livestock disease throughout sub-Saharan Africa and beyond. AAT is caused by Trypanosoma vivax, among other species, a unicellular parasite that is spread by biting tsetse flies and multiplies in the bloodstream and other tissues, leading to often fatal neurological conditions if untreated. Although concerted drug treatment and vector eradication programmes have succeeded in controlling Human African trypanosomiasis, AAT continues to adversely affect animal health and impede efficient food production and economic development in many less-developed countries. In this study, we attempted to identify parasite surface proteins that stimulated the strongest immune responses in naturally infected animals, as the basis for a vaccine. We describe the discovery of a new, species-specific protein family in T. vivax, which we call vivaxin. We show that one vivaxin protein (VIV{beta}8) is surface expressed and retards parasite proliferation when used to immunize mice, but does not prevent infection. However, we also reveal that vivaxin includes another protein previously shown to induce protective immunity (IFX/VIV{beta}1). Besides its great potential for novel approaches to AAT control, vivaxin is revealed as a significant component of the T. vivax cell surface and may have important, species-specific roles in host interactions.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 DNA integration into the host chromosomes is carried out by the preintegration complex (PIC). The PIC contains the viral DNA, virally encoded integrase enzyme and other critical viral/host factors. The PIC-associated viral DNA is preferentially integrated into gene bodies of actively transcribing genes. Here, we identify a biochemical mechanism underlying the preference of PIC-mediated viral DNA integration (PIC-VDI). Specifically, we observed that the PIC-VDI into human chromatin is preferred over the genomic DNA. Surprisingly, nucleosome core particles without any histone modifications were not preferred for PIC-VDI when compared to the analogous naked DNA. However, PIC-VDI was markedly enhanced with nucleosomes containing the trimethylated histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), an epigenetic mark linked to HIV-1 DNA integration preference. Interestingly, we observed that nucleosomes with flanking linker DNA promoted PIC-VDI in the presence of LEDGF/p75. We also discovered that nucleosomes with linker DNA and H3K36me3 served as the optimal substrate for PIC-VDI. Mapping of the integration sites within these substrates identified preference of specific regions of the nucleosome core DNA for integration. Finally, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that histone H1 protein, that condenses the chromatin, negatively regulates HIV-1 DNA integration, consistent with the integration preference for open chromatin structure. Collectively, these results identify the role of specific chromatin marks that drive HIV-1 integration preference and define the optimal substrate requirement for efficient DNA integration by the PIC.",

Nine structural snapshots from 1 ns to 100 ms complemented by simulations show how cis-to-trans isomerization of the azobenzene bond leads to a switch in ligand affinity, opening of an exit channel, and collapse of the binding pocket upon ligand release.

    "abstract": "In the first meiotic cell division, proper segregation of chromosomes in most organisms depends on chiasmata, exchanges of continuity between homologous chromosomes that originate from the repair of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the Spo11 endonuclease. Since DSBs can lead to irreparable damage in germ cells, while chromosomes lacking DSBs also lack chiasmata, the number of DSBs must be carefully regulated, so as to be neither too high nor too low. Here, we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, meiotic DSB levels are controlled by the phosphoregulation of DSB-1, a homolog of the yeast Spo11 cofactor Rec114, by the opposing activities of PP4PPH-4.1 phosphatase and ATRATL-1 kinase. Increased DSB-1 phosphorylation in pph-4.1 mutants correlates with reduction in DSB formation, while prevention of DSB-1 phosphorylation drastically increases the number of meiotic DSBs both in pph-4.1 mutants as well as in the wild type background. C. elegans and its close relatives also possess a diverged paralog of DSB-1, called DSB-2, and loss of dsb-2 is known to reduce DSB formation in oocytes with increasing age. We show that the proportion of the phosphorylated, and thus inactivated, form of DSB-1 increases with age and also upon loss of DSB-2, while non-phosphorylatable DSB-1 rescues the age-dependent decrease in DSBs in dsb-2 mutants. These results suggest that DSB-2 evolved in part to compensate for the inactivation of DSB-1 through phosphorylation, to maintain levels of DSBs in older animals. Our work shows that PP4PPH-4.1, ATRATL-1, and DSB-2 act in concert with DSB-1 to promote optimal DSB levels throughout the reproductive lifespan.",

    "abstract": "The rhodopsin mimic is a chemically synthetized complex with the retinyl Schiff base (RSB) formed between protein and the retinal chromophore, which can mimic the natural rhodopsin-like protein. The artificial rhodopsin mimic is more stable and designable than the natural protein and hence has wider uses in photon detection devices. The mimic structure RSB, like the case in the actual rhodopsin-like protein, undergoes isomerization and protonation throughout the photoreaction process. As a result, understanding the dynamics of the RSB in the photoreaction process is critical. In this study, the transient absorption spectra (TAS) of three mutants of the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABPII)-based rhodopsin mimic at PH = 3 were recorded, from which the related excited-state dynamics of the all-trans protonated RSB (AT-PRSB) were investigated. The transient fluorescence spectra (TFS) measurements are used to validate some of the dynamic features. We find that the excited-state dynamics of AT-PRSB in three mutants share a similar pattern that differs significantly from the dynamics of 15-cis PRSB (15C-PRSB) of the rhodopsin mimic in neutral solution. By comparing the dynamics across the three mutants, we discovered that the aromatic residues near the {beta}-ionone ring structure of the retinal may help stabilize the AT-PRSB and hence slow down its isomerization rate. Furthermore, from the three mutants, we find one protein with near-infrared fluorescence emission up to 688 nm, leading to further possible applications in sensing or bioimaging.",

    "abstract": "The AAA+ protein, Skd3 (human CLPB), solubilizes proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, which is critical for human health. Skd3 variants with impaired protein-disaggregase activity cause severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 7 (MGCA7). Yet how Skd3 disaggregates proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we report a high-resolution structure of a Skd3-substrate complex. Skd3 adopts a spiral hexameric arrangement that engages substrate via pore-loop interactions in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Unexpectedly, substrate-bound Skd3 hexamers stack head-to-head via unique, adaptable ankyrin-repeat domain (ANK)-mediated interactions to form dodecamers. Deleting the ANK-linker region reduces dodecamerization and disaggregase activity. We elucidate apomorphic features of the Skd3 NBD and C-terminal domain that regulate disaggregase activity. We also define how Skd3 subunits collaborate to disaggregate proteins. Importantly, SCN-linked subunits sharply inhibit disaggregase activity, whereas MGCA7-linked subunits do not. Our findings illuminate Skd3 structure and mechanism, explain SCN and MGCA7 inheritance patterns, and suggest therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "A common catastrophic event in most human cancers is deregulation of MYC, a multifunctional transcription factor that controls gene expression in partnership with MAX and drives key biological mechanisms of the cell. Restraining its activity impairs cancer cell features and prevents tumor development, as shown by Omomyc - a 90 amino acid mini-protein interfering with MYC activity. MYC regulates many aspects of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), such as activation, pause release, and elongation. That it may have a role in transcription termination as well is suggested by our finding of an interaction between MYC and the Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which catalyzes symmetrical dimethylation of RNAPII at the arginine residue R1810 (R1810me2s) allowing proper termination and splicing of transcripts. Here we show that MYC overexpression strongly increases R1810me2s, while the concomitant expression of Omomyc or a MYC-specific shRNA counteracts this capacity. Omomyc impairs as well Serine 2 phosphorylation in the RNAPII carboxyterminal domain, a modification that sustains transcript elongation and is enhanced by MYC. By displacing MYC on DNA, Omomyc reshapes RNAPII distribution along genes, leading to greater occupancy of promoter and termination sites. It is unclear how this may affect expression of the variety of genes that control metabolic, biosynthetic, and other pathways and are up or down regulated upon MYC inhibition. Genes belonging to a signature of direct MYC targets are instead strongly downregulated following MYC inhibition, with a weak correlation with RNAPII occupancy at promoters. Our data point to a MYC/ PRMT5/RNAPII axis that controls termination via RNAPII dimethylation (R1810me2s) and may contribute to fine-tune the expression of genes altered by MYC overexpression in cancer cells. It remains to be seen which role this may have in tumor development and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "CAR-T therapy is a promising new treatment modality for B-cell malignancies. However, the majority of patients inevitably go on to experience disease relapse through largely unknown means. To investigate leukemia-intrinsic CAR-T resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in an immunocompetent murine model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) utilizing a novel, modular guide RNA library. We identified IFN{gamma}/JAK/STAT signaling and components of antigen processing and presentation pathway as key mediators of resistance to CAR-T therapy in vivo, but not in vitro. Transcriptional characterization of this model demonstrated an upregulation of these pathways in CAR-T treated relapsed tumors, and examination of data from CAR-T treated patients with B-ALL revealed an association between poor outcomes and increased expression of JAK/STAT/MHC-I in leukemia cells. Overall, our data identify an unexpected mechanism of resistance to CAR-T therapy in which tumor cell interaction with CAR-T cells in vivo induces expression of an adaptive T-cell resistance program in tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "Extinction learning is central to exposure-based behavioral therapies for reducing fear and anxiety in humans. However, patients with fear and anxiety disorders are often resistant to extinction. Moreover, trauma and stress-related disorders are highly prone to relapse and are twice as likely to occur in females compared to males, suggesting that females may be more susceptible to extinction deficits and fear relapse phenomena. In this report, we tested this hypothesis by examining sex differences in a stress-induced extinction learning impairment, the immediate extinction deficit (IED), and renewal, a common form of fear relapse. In contrast to our hypothesis, there were no sex differences in the magnitude of the immediate extinction deficit in two different rat strains (Long-Evans and Wistar). However, we did observe a sex difference in the renewal of fear when the extinguished conditioned stimulus was presented outside the extinction context. Male Wistar rats exhibited significantly greater renewal than female rats, a sex difference that has previously been reported after appetitive extinction. Collectively, these data reveal that stress-induced extinction impairments are similar in male and female rats, though the context-dependence of extinction is more pronounced in males.",

    "abstract": "Recent interest in the cultivation and use of butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) has increased demand for its commercial production. Successful germination of seed is a critical first step to its production; however, few studies have documented factors influential to germination success. To help support commercial production efforts, the influence of substrate temperature and seed scarification technique on germination parameters were evaluated. Two scarification (nicked and nicked and soaked) and three substrate temperature treatments (21, 24, and 27 {degrees}C) were imposed on C. ternatea seed. Following treatments, six germination parameters were recorded. Data showed seeds maintained at a substrate temperature of 21 {degrees}C reached maximal germination (54.8%) at the longest mean germination time (2.61 d) and slowest mean germination rate (0.39 d-1). Mechanical scarification by nicking the seed coat with a razor blade prior to soaking the seed for 24 hours reached maximal germination (80.95%) at the lowest mean germination time (2.06 d) and fastest mean germination rate (0.51 d-1). Optimal germination was attained when seed was scarified and soaked and then germinated in rockwool substrate maintained at a temperature (To) of 21 {degrees}C. Results provide commercial growers with production technique information helpful to fast and efficient germination of C. ternatea seed.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSex differences in autonomic control may contribute to physiological sex differences in cardiovascular disease, thermoregulation, and the experience of pain. We previously showed sex differences in functional mapping of autonomic responses across the insula, a central autonomic control region. Anterior insula response patterns to sympathetic activation (Valsalva) and parasympathetic withdrawal (handgrip) differed between men and women. We here assessed sex differences in autonomic insula gyrus responses to a cold pressor challenge, which involves temperature and pain regulation.\n\nMethodsFunctional MRI (fMRI) involved a 1-minute right-foot cold pressor challenge in 22 women (age; mean{+/-}std: 50{+/-}4 yrs), and 39 men (45{+/-}3 yrs). Regions of interest (ROI) comprised left and right anterior short gyrus (ASG), middle short gyrus (MSG), posterior short gyrus (PSG), anterior long gyrus (ALG), and posterior long gyrus (PLG). Two-second time intervals of fMRI signal responses per ROI and concurrently recorded heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) were tested for within- and between-group effects over time (repeated measures ANOVA P[&le;]0.05). We tested sex differences in 1) each ROI; 2) lateralization effects; and 3) posterior-to-anterior gradients in responses.\n\nResultsNo sex differences emerged in heart rate or SaO2. Women showed larger signal changes in several gyri than men after cold pressor onset and offset. Most consistently, women showed a greater right-over-left hemisphere dominance in cold pressor response compared to men in the MSG, PSG and ALG. Greater right-over-left hemisphere anterior-to-posterior dominance was more pronounced in men.\n\nConclusionsThe findings confirm anterior and right-hemispheric dominance of insular responses during sympathetic activation that includes pain and cold. Although distinct transient male-female differences in fMRI responses appeared during the cold pressor, unlike the Valsalva and handgrip, no sex differences in ASG lateralization emerged, suggesting that the previously found sex differences may not solely relate to regulating blood pressure responses.",

    "abstract": "Globally estuaries are under increasing pressure from human development impacts as well as the growing effects of climate change that is already, and increasingly so, causing major changes in events such as droughts. Although droughts are regular occurrences and are projected to become progressively more significant in many parts of the world, their potential impacts on estuaries requires better understanding and quantification. This study aims to quantify environmental and phytoplankton parameter changes in two contrasting subtropical estuary types in South Africa; the temporarily closed uMdloti Estuary and the predominantly open to the sea uMlalazi Estuary during a hydrological drought event and subsequent non-drought period. Drought caused lower salinities, almost exclusively freshwater, throughout the temporarily closed estuarine type uMdloti. The marine-estuarine salinity environment of the predominantly open uMlalazi during drought expanded to include lower salinities in the non-drought period. Dissolved oxygen levels were more variable during drought conditions including periods of hypoxia, but more stable at elevated levels in both estuaries during the non- drought period. Temperature measurements included higher values during drought, especially in the dry season. Chl-a concentrations were overall higher and more variable during drought in uMdloti, with periods of bloom formation as well as decay. Drought-induced conditions can span several generations for estuarine and estuarine associated organisms. The results from the study provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that extended periods of drought conditions lead to a decrease in niche availability to estuarine organisms in a range of estuary types.",
