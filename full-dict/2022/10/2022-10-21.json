    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that transcriptional riboswitches function through internal strand displacement mechanisms that guide the formation of alternative structures which drive regulatory outcomes. Here we sought to investigate this phenomenon using the Clostridium beijerinckii pfl ZTP riboswitch as a model system. Using functional mutagenesis with in vivo gene expression assays in E. coli, we show that mutations designed to slow strand displacement of the expression platform enable precise tuning of riboswitch dynamic range (2.4-34-fold), depending on the type of kinetic barrier introduced, and the position of the barrier relative to the strand displacement nucleation site. We also show that expression platforms from a range of different Clostridium ZTP riboswitches contain sequences that impose these barriers to affect dynamic range in these different contexts. Finally, we use sequence design to flip the regulatory logic of the riboswitch to create a transcriptional OFF-switch, and show that the same barriers to strand displacement tune dynamic range in this synthetic context. Together, our findings further elucidate how strand displacement can be manipulated to alter the riboswitch decision landscape, suggesting that this could be a mechanism by which evolution tunes riboswitch sequence, and providing an approach to optimize synthetic riboswitches for biotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive isolation occurs when the genomes of two populations accumulate genetic incompatibilities that prevent inter-breeding. Cell biological understanding of such hybrid incompatibility is limited, especially for hybrid female sterility. Here we find that species divergence in condensin regulation and centromere organization between two mouse species, Mus musculus and Mus spretus, drives chromosome de-condensation and mis-segregation in their F1 hybrid oocytes, reducing female fertility. The chromosome condensation defects in hybrid oocytes were especially prominent at Mus musculus centromeres due to their highly abundant major satellite DNA, leading to species-specific chromosome mis-segregation. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into hybrid incompatibility in female meiosis and demonstrates that condensin mis-regulation can be a reproductive isolating barrier in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Cilia are hair-like projections of the plasma membrane with an inner microtubule skeleton known as axoneme. Motile cilia and flagella beat to displace extracellular fluids, playing important roles in the airways and reproductive system, among others. Instead, primary cilia function as cell type-dependent sensory organelles, detecting chemical, mechanical or optical signals from the extracellular environment. Cilia dysfunction is associated with genetic diseases called ciliopathies, and with some types of cancer.\n\nCilia have been recently identified in zebrafish gametogenesis as an important regulator of the bouquet conformation and recombination. However, there is very little information about the structure and functions of cilia in mammalian meiosis. Here we describe the presence of cilia in male mouse meiotic cells. These solitary cilia form transiently in 20% of zygotene spermatocytes and reach considerable lengths (up to 15 m). CEP164 and CETN3 localization studies indicate that these cilia emanate from the mother centriole, prior to centrosome duplication. In addition, the study of telomeric TFR2 suggests that these cilia are not directly related to the bouquet conformation during early male mouse meiosis. Instead, based on TEX14 labeling of intercellular bridges in spermatocyte cysts, we suggest that mouse meiotic cilia may have sensory roles affecting cyst function during prophase I.",

    "abstract": "Most phytophagous insect species exhibit a limited diet breadth and specialize on few or a single host plant. In contrast, some species display a remarkably large diet breadth, with host plants spanning several families and many species. It is unclear, however, whether this phylogenetic generalism is supported by a generic metabolic use of common host chemical compounds ( metabolic generalism) or alternatively by distinct uses of diet-specific compounds ( multi-host metabolic specialism)? Here, we simultaneously investigated the metabolomes of fruit diets and of individuals of a generalist phytophagous species, Drosophila suzukii, that developed on them. The direct comparison of metabolomes of diets and consumers enabled us to disentangle the metabolic fate of common and rarer dietary compounds. We showed that the consumption of biochemically dissimilar diets resulted in a canalized, generic response from generalist individuals, consistent with the metabolic generalism hypothesis. We also showed that many diet-specific metabolites, such as related to the particular color, odor or taste of diets, were not metabolized, and rather accumulated in consumer individuals, even when probably detrimental to fitness. As a result, while individuals were mostly similar across diets, the detection of their particular diet was straightforward. Our study thus supports the view that dietary generalism may emerge from a passive, opportunistic use of various resources, contrary to more widespread views of an active role of adaptation in this process. Such a passive stance towards dietary chemicals, probably costly in the short term, might favor the later evolution of new diet specializations.",

    "abstract": "Host to intricated networks of marine species, coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth. Over the past decades, major degradations of coral reefs have been observed worldwide, which is largely attributed to the effects of climate change and local stressors related to human activities. Now more than ever, characterizing how the environment shapes the dynamics of the reef ecosystem is key to (1) uncovering the environmental drivers of reef degradation, and (2) enforcing efficient conservation strategies in response. To achieve these objectives, it is pivotal that environmental data characterizing such ecosystem dynamics, which occur across specific spatial and temporal scales, are easily accessible to coral reef researchers and conservation stakeholders alike.\n\nHere we present the Reef Environment Centralized Information System (RECIFS), an online repository of datasets describing reef environments worldwide over the past few decades.\n\nThe data served through RECIFS originate from remote sensed datasets available in the public domain, and characterize various facets of the reef environment, including water chemistry and physics (e.g. temperature, pH, chlorophyll concentration), as well as anthropogenic local pressures (e.g. boat detection, distance from agricultural or urban areas). The datasets from RECIFS can be accessed at different spatial and temporal resolutions and are delivered through an intuitive web-application featuring an interactive map requiring no prior knowledge working with remote sensing or geographic information systems. The RECIFS web-application is available in complete open access at https://recifs.epfl.ch.\n\nWe describe two case studies showing possible implementations of RECIFS to 1) characterize coral diversity in the Caribbean and 2) investigate local adaptation of a reef fish population in Northwest Australia.",

    "abstract": "Eastern spruce budworm moth (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) mass outbreaks have widespread economic and ecological consequences. A key explanation for the large-scale spread and synchronization of these outbreaks is the long-distance dispersal (up to 450km) of moths from hotspots (high-density populations) to lower-density areas. These events have proved difficult to monitor because dispersal flights occur only a few times a year, have no consistent routes, and commonly used tracking methods (e.g., population genetics, mark-recapture, radio telemetry) are inadequate for this system. Distinguishing between local and immigrant individuals is a crucial step in identifying the physical and ecological drivers of moth dispersal. Here we test whether isotopes of hydrogen (i.e., delta notation:{delta} 2H) and strontium (i.e., strontium isotope ratios: 87Sr/86Sr), known to independently vary in space in a predictable manner, can be used to distinguish between local and immigrant adult spruce budworm moths. We used an automated pheromone trap system to collect individuals at six different sites in eastern Canada within and outside the current outbreak area of budworm moths. We first use moth flight behaviour and time of capture, currently the best available tool, to determine putative local vs. immigrant status, and then evaluate whether individual 87Sr/86Sr and{delta} 2H differ between putative classes. At all sites, we detect immigrant individuals that differ significantly from putative locals. Saliently, sites where putative locals were sampled before the occurrence of potential immigration events (~10 days) showed the strongest differences between immigrant individuals and the locals 87Sr/86Sr and{delta} 2H values. Sites where the collection of putative locals was close in time (hours) or following an immigration event had a less-clear distinction between putative immigrants and locals, and showed signs of mixing between these two groups. We speculate that recent immigration could have led to the misclassification of immigrants as putative locals. 87Sr/86Sr and{delta} 2H data generally support the adequacy of current approaches using capture-time to detect immigration events, and provide enhanced resolution to distinguish between local and immigrant individuals. We discuss the broader implication of adding isotopes to the toolkit to monitor spruce budworm dispersal and suggest next steps in implementing these tools.",

The transfer of information among individuals is primarily based on cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC). These chemical compounds, produced by all insects, initially evolved to prevent water loss1. They were subsequently co-opted as semiochemicals to communicate various types of information. This includes nestmate recognition in social insects2,3, enabling different colonies to partition resources by ousting conspecific competitors. In this study, we report the near complete loss of CHC production by workers of the ant Nylanderia fulva. This absence of CHCs is a double-edged sword. It represents a causative agent in the ecological success of this ant species -- enabling the development of a large supercolony in its invasive range through limited ability to differentiate nestmates-- but increases the risk of suffering ecological stress through desiccation.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary convergence is one of the most striking examples of adaptation driven by natural selection. However, genomic evidence for convergent adaptation to extreme environments remains scarce. The Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains represent the worlds most species-rich temperate alpine biota, providing an ideal \"natural laboratory\" for studying convergent adaptation to high altitudes. Here, we generate reference genomes for two alpine plants, Saussurea obvallata (Asteraceae) and Rheum alexandrae (Polygonaceae), with 37,938 and 61,463 annotated protein-coding genes. By integrating an additional five alpine genomes, we investigate genomic signatures of convergent adaptation to the hostile environments of high altitudes. We show that alpine genomes tend to mitigate their genetic load by contracting genes functioning in the immune system to survive such harsh environments with few pathogens present. We detect signatures of convergent positive selection on a set of genes involved in reproduction and development and reveal that molecular convergence has acted on genes involved in self-incompatibility, cell wall modification, DNA repair and stress resistance, which underlie adaptation to extremely cold, high UV radiation and hypoxia environments. Using gene expression profiles, we further demonstrate that genes associated with cuticular wax and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways exhibit higher expression levels in leafy bracts, shedding lights on the genetic mechanisms of the adaptive  greenhouse morphology. Our integrative data provide genomic insights into the convergent evolution at higher-taxonomic levels, aiding in deep understanding of genetic adaptation to complex environments.",

    "abstract": "1The demography and genetic structure of a population are closely linked. The study of this interplay is crucial, especially for organisms with frequent demographic fluctuations such as pathogen species responsible for emerging diseases. The joint study of demographic variations and genetic evolution of a pathogen population can be achieved by coupling epidemiology and population genetics. This framework is particularly suited to the study of genetic signatures of strong and rapid selective events, such as pathogen adaptation to plant genetic resistances. We have limited knowledge of how these events shape the genetic evolution of pathogens and what would be the typical genetic signatures of strong demographic and selective events on the pathogen population. In this study, we model pathogen population dynamics and genetic evolution at neutral loci to draw a typology of scenarios of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Using a clustering method dedicated to time-series variations, we identify three main scenarios: 1) small variations in the pathogen population size and small changes in genetic structure, 2) a strong founder event on the resistant host that in turn leads to a genetic structure on the susceptible host, and 3) evolutionary rescue that results in a strong founder event on the resistant host, preceded by a bottleneck on the susceptible host. Beyond the selective event itself, the demographic trajectory imposes specific changes in the genetic structure of the pathogen population. Most of these genetic changes are transient, with a signature of resistance overcoming that vanishes in a few years only. Considering time series is therefore of utmost importance for accurate tracking of the evolutionary trajectories of pathogen populations.",

In various settings ranging from biology to social systems, individuals tend to interact more often with those present in their proximity and rarely with those far away. A common approach to model the structure of a population is Evolutionary Graph Theory. In this framework, each graph node is occupied by a reproducing individual. The links connect these individuals to their neighbours. The offspring can be placed on neighbouring nodes, replacing the neighbours - or the progeny of its neighbours can replace a node during the course of ongoing evolutionary dynamics. Extending this theory by replacing single individuals with subpopulations at nodes yields a graph-structured metapopulation. The dynamics between the different local subpopulations is set by an update mechanism. There are many such update mechanisms. Here, we classify update mechanisms for structured metapopulations, which allows to find commonalities between past work and illustrate directions for further research and current gaps of investigation.",

However, the role of long-range resection mediated by Exo1 and/or Sgs1-Dna2 in HR is not fully understood. Here, we show that Exo1 and Sgs1 are dispensable for recombination between closely-linked repeats but are required for interchromosomal repeat recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This requirement for long-range resection is coupled to DNA damage checkpoint activation and the need for checkpoint proteins. Furthermore, artificial activation of the checkpoint partially restores interchromosomal recombination to exo1{Delta} sgs1{Delta} cells. However, cell cycle delay is insufficient to rescue the interchromosomal recombination defect of exo1{Delta} sgs1{Delta} cells, suggesting an additional role for the checkpoint. Given that the checkpoint is necessary for DNA damage-induced chromosome mobility, we propose that the importance of the checkpoint, and therefore long-range resection, in interchromosomal recombination is due to a need to increase chromosome mobility to facilitate pairing of distant sites. The need for long-range resection is circumvented when the DSB and its repair template are in close proximity.",

We developed Paraphase, an informatics method that identifies full-length SMN1 and SMN2 haplotypes, determines the gene copy numbers and calls phased variants using long-read PacBio HiFi data. The SMN1 and SMN2 copy number calls by Paraphase are highly concordant with orthogonal methods (99.2% for SMN1 and 100% for SMN2). We applied Paraphase to 438 samples across five ethnic populations to conduct a population-wide haplotype analysis of these highly homologous genes. We identified major SMN1 and SMN2 haplogroups and characterized their co-segregation through pedigree-based analyses. We identified two SMN1 haplotypes that form a common two-copy SMN1 allele in African populations. Testing positive for these two haplotypes in an individual with two copies of SMN1 gives a silent carrier risk of 88.5%, which is significantly higher than the currently used marker (1.7-3.0%). Extending beyond simple copy number testing, Paraphase can detect pathogenic variants and enable potential haplotype-based screening of silent carriers through statistical phasing of haplotypes into alleles. Future analysis of larger population data will allow identification of more diverse haplotypes and genetic markers for silent carriers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn animals and flowering plants specific chromatin modifications define three chromosomal domains: euchromatin comprising transcribed genes, facultative heterochromatin comprising repressed genes, and constitutive heterochromatin comprising transposons. However, recent studies have shown that the correlation between chromatin modifications and transcription vary among different eukaryotic organisms including mosses and liverworts that differ from one another. Mosses and liverworts diverged from hornworts, altogether forming the lineage of bryophytes that shared a common ancestor with all land plants. We aimed to obtain chromatin landscapes in hornworts to establish synapomorphies across bryophytes.\n\nResultsWe mapped the chromatin landscape of the model hornwort Anthoceros agrestis. By comparing chromatin landscapes across bryophytes we defined the common chromatin landscape of the ancestor of extant bryophytes. In this group, constitutive heterochromatin was characterized by a scattered distribution across autosomes, which contrasted with the dense compartments of heterochromatin surrounding the centromeres in flowering plants. Topologically associated domains were primarily occupied by transposons with genes at their boundaries and nearly half of the hornwort transposons were associated with facultative heterochromatin and euchromatin.\n\nConclusionsMost of the features observed in hornworts are also present in liverworts but are distinct from flowering plants. Hence, the ancestral genome of bryophytes was likely a patchwork of units of euchromatin interspersed within facultative and constitutive heterochromatin and each unit contained both transposons and genes sharing the same chromatin state. We propose this genome organization was ancestral to land plants and prevented transposons from being segregated as constitutive heterochromatin around point centromeres as in flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial microcompartments (BMC) are complex macromolecular assemblies that participate to varied chemical processes in about one fourth of bacterial species. BMC-encapsulated enzymatic activities are segregated from other cell contents by means of semipermeable shells, justifying why BMC are viewed as prototype nano-reactors for biotechnological applications. Herein, we undertook a comparative study of trends of self-assembly of BMC hexamers (BMC-H), the most abundant shell constituents. Published and new microscopy data show that some BMC-H, like {beta}-carboxysomal CcmK, tend to assemble flat whereas other BMC-H often build curved-implying objects. Inspection of available crystal structures presenting BMC-H in tiled arrangements permitted to identify two major assembly modes with a striking connection with experimental trends. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) supported that BMC-H bending is triggered robustly only from the disposition adopted by BMC-H that form curved objects experimentally, conducting to almost identical arrangements to those found in structures of recomposed BMC shells. Simulations on ensembles of planar-behaving hexamers, which were previously reconfigured to comply with such disposition, confirmed that bending is defined by assembly details, rather than by BMC-H identity. Finally, although no common atomic determinants could be identified as responsible of BMC-H spontaneous curvature, an inter-hexamer ionic pair was pinpointed as contributor to hold a subset of BMC-H in low bending dispositions. These results are expected to improve our understanding of the variable mechanisms of biogenesis characterized for BMC, and of possible strategies to regulate BMC size and shape.",

    "abstract": "3D fluorescence microscopy can be profitably used in combination with tissue clearing and myelin labeling techniques for investigating the human brain myeloarchitectonics with sub-micrometric resolution, and for providing detailed histological reference data for the validation of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. Differently from state-of-the-art polarimetry-based neuroimaging modalities such as 3D polarized light imaging and 3D polarized-sensitive optical coherence tomography, the quantitative histological analysis of cortical and white matter fiber architectures from fluorescence microscopy images requires the estimation of fiber orientations via image processing techniques, as Fourier or structure tensor analysis. However, these can be error-prone as they are not able to detect myelinated fibers in surrounding brain tissue. Here we present a novel image processing pipeline built around a 3D Frangi filter able to enhance fiber structures of varying diameters in tiled brain section reconstructions of arbitrary size, and to produce accurate 3D fiber orientation maps in both grey and white matter regions, while preserving the native resolution of the employed microscopy system. The developed software tool also features the estimation of fiber orientation distribution functions which, in view of their widespread use in the neuroimaging community, may favor a multimodal comparison with brain connectivity data obtained from the aforementioned label-free optical modalities, and the validation of modern dMRI-based tractography. The proposed image processing pipeline was applied to brain samples treated according to a novel label-free preparation technique capable of enhancing the autofluorescence of myelinated fiber axons, thus demonstrating the feasibility of single fiber orientation analyses in fluorescence microscopy without the need for exogenous staining.",

However, existing biomaterials that fulfill the physicochemical requirements of VBP are limited to gelatin-based photoresins of high polymer concentrations. The printed microenvironments are predominantly static and stiff, lacking sufficient capacity to support 3D cell growth. We here report a dynamic resin based on thiol-ene photo-clickable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and thermo-sensitive sacrificial gelatin for fast VBP of functional ultrasoft cell-laden hydrogel constructs within 7-15 seconds. Using gelatin allows VBP of permissive hydrogels with low PVA contents of 1.5%, providing a stress-relaxing environment for fast cell spreading, 3D osteogenic differentiation of embedded human mesenchymal stem cells and matrix mineralization. Additionally, site-specific immobilization of molecules-of-interest inside a PVA hydrogel is achieved by 4D tomographic thiol-ene photopatterning. This technique may enable spatiotemporal control of cell-material interactions and guided in vitro tissue formation using programmed cell-friendly light. Altogether, this study introduces a synthetic dynamic photoresin enabling fast VBP of functional ultrasoft hydrogel constructs with well-defined physicochemical properties and high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Minimizers are ubiquitously used in data structures and algorithms for efficient searching, mapping, and indexing of high-throughput DNA sequencing data. Minimizer schemes select a minimum k-mer in every L-long sub-sequence of the target sequence, where minimality is with respect to a predefined k-mer order. Commonly used minimizer orders select more k-mers than necessary and therefore provide limited improvement in runtime and memory usage of downstream analysis tasks. The recently introduced universal k-mer hitting sets produce minimizer orders with fewer selected k-mers. Unfortunately, generating compact universal k-mer hitting sets is currently infeasible for k > 13, and thus cannot help in the many applications that require minimizer orders for larger k.\n\nHere, we close the gap of efficient minimizer orders for large values of k by introducing decycling-set-based minimizer orders, new orders based on minimum decycling sets. We show that in practice these new minimizer orders select a number of k-mers comparable to that of minimizer orders based on universal k-mer hitting sets, and can also scale up to larger k. Furthermore, we developed a method that computes the minimizers in a sequence on the fly without keeping the k-mers of a decycling set in memory. This enables the use of these minimizer orders for any value of k. We expect the new orders to improve the runtime and memory usage of algorithms and data structures in high-throughput DNA sequencing analysis.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sequence alignment is a critical step in the study of protein sequence and function. Typically, multiple sequence alignment algorithms progressively align pairs of sequences and combine these alignments with the aid of a guide tree. These alignment algorithms use scoring systems based on substitution matrices to measure amino-acid similarities. While successful, standard methods struggle on sets of proteins with low sequence identity - the so-called twilight zone of protein alignment. For these difficult cases, another source of information is needed. Protein language models are a powerful new approach that leverage massive sequence datasets to produce high-dimensional contextual embeddings for each amino acid in a sequence. These embeddings have been shown to reflect physicochemical and higher-order structural and functional attributes of amino acids within proteins. Here, we present a novel approach to multiple sequence alignment, based on clustering and ordering amino acid contextual embeddings. Our method for aligning semantically consistent groups of proteins circumvents the need for many standard components of multiple sequence alignment algorithms, avoiding initial guide tree construction, intermediate pairwise alignments, gap penalties, and substitution matrices. The added information from contextual embeddings leads to higher accuracy alignments for structurally similar proteins with low amino-acid similarity. We anticipate that protein language models will become a fundamental component of the next generation of algorithms for generating MSAs.\n\nSoftware availability: https://github.com/clairemcwhite/vcmsa",

    "abstract": "Multiplex imaging is a powerful tool to analyze the structural and functional states of cells in their morphological and pathological contexts. However, hypothesis testing with multiplex imaging data is a challenging task due to the extent and complexity of the information obtained. Various computational pipelines have been developed and validated to extract knowledge from specific imaging platforms. A common problem with customized pipelines is their reduced applicability across different imaging platforms: Every multiplex imaging technique exhibits platform-specific characteristics in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and acquisition artifacts that need to be accounted for to yield reliable and reproducible results. We propose a pixel classifier-based image preprocessing step that aims to minimize platform-dependency for all multiplex image analysis pipelines. Signal detection and noise reduction as well as artifact removal can be posed as a pixel classification problem in which all pixels in multiplex images can be assigned to two general classes of either I) signal of interest or II) artifacts and noise. The resulting feature representation maps contain pixel-accurate representations of the input data, but exhibit signifi-cantly increased signal-to-noise ratios with normalized pixel values as output data. We demonstrate the validity of our proposed image preprocessing approach by comparing the results of two well-accepted and widely-used image analysis pipelines.",

We have found 959 benign and 875 pathogenic X/Gly substitutions. Pathogenicity origins were initially searched in the distribution profiles of replaced amino acids. These profiles indicate that Mendelian disorders including Gly-replacements arise mainly from substitutions of amino acids bearing bulky hydrophobic side chains, thus reducing protein core stability. In the case mutated proteins were structurally defined, we could give a deeper insight into pathogenicity mechanisms, checking whether Gly-mutations altered protein shapes, modifying water surface dynamics and, hence, the physiological protein-protein interaction processes.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms coordinate packaging, accessibility and read-out of the DNA sequence within the chromatin context. They significantly contribute to the regulation of gene expression. Thus, they play fundamental roles during differentiation on the one hand and maintenance and propagation of cell identity on the other. Epigenetic malfunctioning is associated with a large range of diseases, from neurodevelopmental disorders to cancer progression. In humans, hundreds of known epigenetic factors and complexes are involved in establishing covalent modifications on the DNA sequence itself and on associated histone proteins. Within the cellular context, the resulting combinatorial epigenomic patterns are neither established nor interpreted independently of each other and therefore exhibit high correlations in a region-specific manner. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins can be analysed using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Often, several assays for a number of different histone modifications are performed as part of the same experimental design. These measurements are, however, confounded by shared biases including chromatin accessibility and mappability. Existing computational methods analyse each histone modification separately. We introduce DecoDen, a new approach that leverages replicates and multi-histone ChIP-Seq experiments for a fixed cell type to learn and remove shared biases. DecoDen (Deconvolve and Denoise) consists of two major steps: We use non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to learn a joint cell-type specific background signal. Half-sibling regression (HSR) is then used to correct for these biases in the histone modification signals. We demonstrate that DecoDen is a robust and interpretable method that enables the unbiased discovery of subtle peaks, which are particularly important in an individual-specific context.",

    "abstract": "There is a long tradition in the Biophysics community of using simulations as a means to understand macromolecular behavior in various physicochemical methods. This allows a rigorous means to interpret observations in terms of fundamental principles, including chemical equilibrium, reaction kinetics, transport processes and thermodynamics. Here we simulate data for the Gilbert Theory for self-association, a fundamental analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC) technique to understand the shape of sedimentation velocity reaction boundaries that involve reversible monomer-Nmer interactions. Simulating monomer-dimer through monomer-hexamer systems as a function of concentration about the equilibrium constant allows a visual means to differentiate reaction stoichiometry by determining end points and inflexion positions. Including intermediates (eg A1-A2-A3-A4-A5-A6) in the simulations reveals the smoothing of the reaction boundary and the removal of sharp inflexions between monomers and polymers. The addition of cooperativity restores sharp boundaries or peaks to the observation and allows more discrimination in the selection of possible fitting models. Thermodynamic nonideality adds additional features when applied across wide ranges of concentration that might be appropriate for high concentration therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) solutions. This presentation serves as a tutorial for using modern AUC analysis software like SEDANAL for selecting potential fitting models.",

Apart from highest-resolution single-state structures, the exact distances enable molecular dynamics (MD) ensemble simulations orchestrated by a dense network of experimental inter-proton distance boundaries gathered in the context of their physical lattices. This direct embedding of experimental ensemble distances into MD will provide access to representative, atomic-level spatial details of conformational dynamics in supramolecular assemblies, crystalline and lipid-embedded proteins, and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The control of starch granule number and morphology in plastids is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that AtFZL, a protein involved in thylakoid membrane organisation, is required for correct starch granule morphology in Arabidopsis. Leaves of mutants lacking AtFZL had the same starch content as wild-type leaves, but their starch granules were smaller and had a distinct, uneven surface morphology. Most chloroplasts in the mutant were larger than those of the wild type.\n\nHowever, the difference in chloroplast size could not explain the difference in granule size and shape in the Atfzl mutants, since other mutants with larger chloroplasts than the wild type (arc mutants) had granules that were similar in size and shape to wild-type granules. As reported previously, the Atfzl mutant had aberrant thylakoid organisation. We found that this phenomenon was particularly pronounced in regions surrounding starch granules. The location of the thylakoid-bound granule initiation protein MFP1 was unaffected in the Atfzl mutant. We propose that AtFZL affects starch granule size and shape by influencing thylakoid organisation at the periphery of starch granules. Our results are consistent with an important role for thylakoid architecture in determining granule morphology.",

This study used roGFP2 expressing Arabidopsis seedlings to measure the oxidation states of the nuclei and cytosol in response to HC treatment. The Cytrap dual cell cycle phase marker system and flow cytometry were used to study associated changes in cell proliferation. HC (1.5mM) reversibly inhibited root growth during a 24h treatment. Higher concentrations were not reversible. HC did not synchronize the cell cycle. In contrast to hydroxyurea, HC caused a gradual accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase and decline of G1/S phase cells 16 to 24h post-treatment. This was accompanied by increased oxidation of both the nuclei and cytosol. Taken together, HC impairs proliferation of embryonic root meristem cells in a reversible manner through restriction of G2/M transition accompanied by increased oxidative poise.",

    "abstract": "An important step in brain development is the remodeling of juvenile neural circuits to establish mature connectivity. The elimination of juvenile synapses is a critical step in this process; however, the molecular mechanisms directing synapse elimination activities and their timing are not fully understood. We identify here a conserved transcriptional regulator, DVE-1, that shares homology with mammalian special AT-rich sequence-binding (SATB) family members and directs the elimination of juvenile synaptic inputs onto remodeling C. elegans GABAergic neurons. Dorsally localized juvenile acetylcholine receptor clusters and apposing presynaptic sites are eliminated during maturation of wild type GABAergic neurons but persist into adulthood in dve-1 mutants. The persistence of juvenile synapses in dve-1 mutants does not impede synaptic growth during GABAergic remodeling and therefore produces heightened motor connectivity and a turning bias during movement. DVE-1 is localized to GABAergic nuclei prior to and during remodeling and DVE-1 nuclear localization is required for synapse elimination to proceed, consistent with DVE-1s function as a transcriptional regulator. Pathway analysis of DVE-1 targets and proteasome inhibitor experiments implicate transcriptional control of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in synapse elimination. Together, our findings demonstrate a new role for a SATB family member in the control of synapse elimination during circuit remodeling through transcriptional regulation of ubiquitin-proteasome signaling.\n\nContributions SummaryKDA generated strains, transgenic lines, molecular constructs, confocal microscopy images and analysis, performed optogenetic behavioral experiments, photoconversion experiments, modencode ChIP-seq analysis and pathway analysis.

    "abstract": "Appropriate modulation of escape behaviors in response to potentially damaging stimuli is essential for survival. Although nociceptive circuitry has been studied, it is poorly understood how genetic contexts affect the relevant escape responses. Using an unbiased genome-wide association analysis, we identified a Ly6/-neurotoxin family protein, Belly roll (Bero), which negatively regulates Drosophila nociceptive escape behavior. We show that Bero is expressed in abdominal leucokinin-producing neurons (ABLK neurons) and bero knockdown in ABLK neurons resulted in enhanced escape behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ABLK neurons responded to the activation of nociceptors and initiated the behavior. Notably, bero knockdown reduced the persistent neuronal activity and increased the evoked nociceptive responses in ABLK neurons. Our findings reveal that Bero modulates an escape response by regulating distinct neuronal activities in ABLK neurons.",

    "abstract": "Within-host models of infection can provide important insights into the processes that affect parasite spread and persistence in host populations. However, modeling is often limited by the availability of empirical data, a problem commonly encountered in natural systems. Here, we used six years of immune-infection observations of two gastrointestinal helminths (Trichostrongylus retortaeformis and Graphidium strigosum) from a population of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) to develop an age-dependent, within-host mathematical model that explicitly included species-specific and cross-reacting antibody (IgA and IgG) responses to each helminth in hosts with single or dual infections. Different models of single infection were formally compared to test alternative mechanisms of parasite regulation. The two models that best described single infections of each helminth species were then coupled through antibody cross-immunity to examine how the presence of one species could alter the host immune response to, and the within-host dynamics of, the other species. For both single infections, model selection suggested that either IgA or IgG responses could equally explain the observed parasite intensities at different host age. However, the strength of this response drastically changed between the two helminths, being stronger against T. retortaeformis than against G. strigosum and causing contrasting age-intensity profiles. When the two helminths coinfect the same host, we found a decrease of the species-specific immune response to both species together with an asymmetric cross-immune response driven by IgG. Changes in the level and affinity of antibodies from single to dual infections contributed to the significant increase of both helminth abundances. By combining mathematical modeling with immuno-infection data, our work provides a model framework for disentangling some of the complexities generated by host-parasite and parasite-parasite interactions from natural systems. Our approach thus offers a tractable general tool to examine immune-infection relationships within hosts.\n\nAuthor summaryThe host immune response often plays a critical role in regulating parasite dynamics and transmission. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate whether and how the observed variation in host antibody responses could explain the relative differences in the abundance of two parasite species in hosts with single and dual infections from a natural rabbit population. Our results indicated that either IgA or IgG could describe the contrasting trends of the two parasites in rabbits with single infections. Specifically, antibodies appeared to control T. retortaeformis, while the effect was less clear for G. strigosum. For dual infections, we found a weaker specific antibody response against both helminths and an asymmetric cross-immunity, which could explain the significantly greater intensities observed for T. retortaeformis and, secondly, for G. strigosum. Our within-host mathematical framework provides a plausible mechanism for the mediated role of antibodies in hosts with single and dual parasite infections, and how the strength of these infection-immune interactions changes with host age. This model framework offers a way forward to our understanding of the within-host processes that generate individual variation in infection and is relatively flexible to be applied to other natural systems.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) subverts host defenses to persist in macrophages despite immune pressure. CD4 T-cells can recognize macrophages infected with a single bacillus in vitro. Under identical conditions, CD8 T-cells inefficiently recognize infected macrophages and fail to restrict Mtb growth, although they can inhibit Mtb growth during high burden intracellular infection. We show that high intracellular Mtb numbers cause macrophage death, leading other macrophages to scavenge cellular debris and cross-present the TB10.4 antigen to CD8 T-cells. Presentation by infected macrophages requires Mtb to have a functional ESX-1 type VII secretion system. These data indicate that phagosomal membrane damage and cell death promote class I MHC presentation of the immunodominant antigen TB10.4 by macrophages. Although this mode of antigen-presentation stimulates cytokine production that we presume would be host beneficial; killing of uninfected cells could worsen immunopathology. We suggest that shifting the focus of CD8 T-cell recognition to uninfected macrophages would limit the interaction of CD8 T-cells with infected macrophages and impair CD8 T-cell mediated resolution of tuberculosis.",

We further identified two CTCF-bound elements, internal to the SOX9 topologically associating domain, which are positioned near its 3D geometric center and bridge enhancer-promoter contacts in a series of chromatin loops.

    "abstract": "Intergenic genomic regions have essential regulatory and structural roles that impose constraints on their sequences. But regions that do not currently encode proteins, also carry the potential to do so in the future. De novo gene emergence, the evolution of novel genes out of previously non-coding sequences has now been established as a potent force for genomic novelty. Recently, it was shown that intergenic regions in the genome of S. cerevisiae harbor pervasive cryptic potential to, if theoretically translated, form transmembrane domains (TM domains) more frequently than expected by chance, a property that we refer to as TM-forming enrichment. The source and biological relevance of this property is unknown. Here we expand the investigation into the TM-forming potential of intergenic regions to the entire Saccharomycotina budding yeast subphylum, in an effort to explain this property and understand its importance. We find pervasive but variable enrichment in TM-forming potential across the subphylum, regardless of the composition and average size of intergenic regions. This cryptic property is evenly spread across the genome, cannot be explained by the hydrophobic content of the sequence, and does not appear to localize to regions containing regulatory motifs. This TM-forming enrichment specifically, and not the actual TM-forming potential, is associated, across genomes, with more TM domains in evolutionarily young genes. Our findings shed light on this newly discovered feature of yeast genomes and constitute a first step towards understanding its evolutionary importance.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is thought to combine \"what\" and \"where\" information from the cortex so that objects and events can be represented within the spatial context in which they occur. Surprisingly then, these distinct types of information remain partially segregated in the output region of the hippocampus, area CA1. In this region, objects preferentially activate neurons in the distal segment (adjacent to the subiculum) while spatial locations are precisely represented by neurons in the proximal segment (adjacent to CA2). This difference likely results from distinct anatomical connections; proximal CA1 receives direct input from the medial entorhinal cortex (which encodes spatial context) whereas distal CA1 has reciprocal connections with the lateral entorhinal cortex (which encodes objects and events). Based on these findings, it has been proposed that CA1 contains two distinct representations; one that encodes the animals spatial location and another that encodes objects that are present in the environment. The current study aimed to determine the role of distal CA1 in learning the location of objects in an environment. To do this, we first examined c-Fos expression in proximal and distal CA1 to see if we could replicate previous findings and confirm that neurons in these distinct segment are responsive to different stimuli. As previous studies indicate that catecholamines can regulate the activity of segments of CA1, we then investigate the role of catecholamines on learning object locations using 6-OHDA or SCH23390 to lesion catecholaminergic input and block D1/D5 receptors, respectively. Finally, we monitored calcium activity with fiber photometry while animals performed a hippocampal-dependent object location memory task.",

    "abstract": "Curli are functional amyloids present on the outer membrane of E. coli. Cell-surface aggregation of CsgA, the major subunit of curli, is a well-orchestrated process. CsgB, the minor subunit of curli, nucleates the aggregation of CsgA while CsgF, a curli accessory protein, ensures proper anchoring of CsgB to the cell surface. The molecular basis of the interactions between CsgF and curli subunits is unclear. Here, we show that CsgF undergoes phase separation in vitro and that the ability of CsgF variants to phase separate tightly correlated with CsgF function in cells during curli biogenesis. Substitution of phenylalanine residues in the CsgF N-terminus both reduced the propensity of CsgF to phase-separate and impaired curli biogenesis. Exogenous addition of purified CsgF complemented csgF - cells. This exogenous addition assay was used to assess the ability of CsgF variants to complement csgF - cells. The presence of CsgF on the cell surface modulated the secretion of CsgA to the cell surface. We also found that the CsgB nucleator protein is a CsgF client. CsgB can form SDS-insoluble aggregates within the dynamic CsgF condensate, and we propose that these multi-component CsgF-B condensates form a nucleation-competent complex that templates CsgA amyloid formation on the cell surface. Together, our study provides insight into the ability of CsgF to phase separate, regulate CsgA secretion, and promote CsgB aggregation in curli assembly.",

ABCB5 has been identified as a marker of skin progenitor cells, melanoma, and limbal stem cells. It has also been associated with multidrug resistance in several cancers. The unique feature of ABCB5 is that it exists as both a full transporter (ABCB5FL) and a half transporter (ABCB5{beta}). Several studies have shown that the ABCB5{beta} homodimer does not confer multidrug resistance, in contrast to ABCB5FL. In this study, using three complementary techniques; (1) nanoluciferase-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, (2) co-immunoprecipitation, and (3) proximity ligation assay, we identified two novel heterodimers in melanoma: ABCB5{beta}/B6 and ABCB5{beta}/B9.

    "abstract": "Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the key cytokine produced by T-helper, eosinophils, mast and basophils cells. It can act as an enticing therapeutic target due to its pivotal role in several eosinophil-mediated diseases. Though numerous methods have been developed to predict HLA binders and cytokines-inducing peptides, no method was developed for predicting IL-5 inducing peptides. All models in this study have been trained, tested and validated on experimentally validated 1907 IL-5 inducing and 7759 non-IL-5 inducing peptides obtained from IEDB. First, alignment-based methods have been developed using similarity and motif search. These alignment-based methods provide high precision but poor coverage. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed machine learning-based models for predicting IL-5 inducing peptides using a wide range of peptide features. Our random-forest model developed using selected 250 dipeptides achieved the highest performance among alignment-free methods with AUC 0.75 and MCC 0.29 on validation dataset. In order to improve the performance, we developed an ensemble or hybrid method that combined alignment-based and alignment-free methods. Our hybrid method achieved AUC 0.94 with MCC 0.60 on validation/ independent dataset.

    "abstract": "Gene expression and morphology both play a key role in determining the types and functions of cells, but the relationship between molecular and morphological features is largely uncharacterized. We present MorphNet, a computational approach that can draw pictures of a cells morphology from its gene expression profile. Our approach leverages paired morphology and molecular data to train a neural network that can predict nuclear or whole-cell morphology from gene expression. We employ state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques that allow training using as few as 103 images. We find that MorphNet can generate novel, realistic morphological images that retain the complex relationship between gene expression and cell appearance. We then train MorphNet to generate nuclear morphology from gene expression using brain-wide MERFISH data. In addition, we show that MorphNet can generate neuron morphologies with realistic axonal and dendritic structures. MorphNet generalizes to unseen brain regions, allowing prediction of neuron morphologies across the entire mouse isocortex and even non-cortical regions. We show that MorphNet performs meaningful latent space interpolation, allowing prediction of the effects of gene expression variation on morphology. Finally, we provide a web server that allows users to predict neuron morphologies for their own scRNA-seq data. MorphNet represents a powerful new approach for linking gene expression and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cachexia is highly prevalent in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although advanced cachexia is associated with inflammatory signaling, the early events driving wasting are poorly defined. Using an orthotopic mouse model of PDAC, we find that early cachexia is defined by a pronounced vulnerability to undernutrition, characterized by increased skeletal muscle wasting. PDAC suppresses lipid beta oxidation and impairs ketogenesis in the liver, which coordinates the adaptive response to nutritional scarcity. When PDAC mice are fed ketogenic diet, this effect is reversed, and muscle mass is preserved. Furthermore, physiologic levels of ketones are sufficient to protect myotubes against PDAC-associated wasting. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) drives liver metabolic reprogramming, and hepatocyte-specific loss of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is sufficient to prevent PDAC-associated muscle loss. Together, these studies define a key role for the liver in cachexia development and directly link skeletal muscle homeostasis to hepatic lipid oxidation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionVasculogenic mimicry (VM), the process of tumor cell trans-differentiation to endow endothelial-like characteristics supporting de novo vessel formation, is associated with poor prognosis in several tumor types, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, NOTCH and MYC co-operate to drive a neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE phenotypic switch and co-operation between NE and non-NE cells is required for metastasis. Here, we define the phenotype of VM-competent cells and molecular mechanisms underpinning SCLC VM using circulating tumor cell-derived explant (CDX) models and GEMMs.\n\nMethodsWe analysed perfusion within VM vessels and their association with NE and non-NE phenotypes using multiplex immunohistochemistry in CDX and GEMMs. VM-proficient cell subpopulations in ex vivo cultures were molecularly profiled by RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. We evaluated their 3D structure and defined collagen-integrin interactions.\n\nResultsWe show that VM vessels are present in 23/25 CDX models and in 2 GEMMs. Perfused VM vessels support tumor growth and only Notch-active non-NE cells are VM-competent in vivo and ex vivo, expressing pseudohypoxia, blood vessel development and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization signatures. On Matrigel, VM-primed non-NE cells re-model ECM into hollow tubules in an integrin {beta}1-dependent process.\n\nConclusionsWe identify VM as an exemplar of functional heterogeneity and plasticity in SCLC and these findings take significant steps towards understanding the molecular events that enable VM. These results support therapeutic co-targeting of both NE and non-NE cells to curtail SCLC progression and to improve SCLC patient outcomes in future.",

    "abstract": "Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) facilitates the conversion of prohormones into mature hormones and is highly expressed in multiple neuroendocrine tissues. Carriers of CPE mutations have elevated plasma proinsulin and develop severe obesity and hyperglycemia. We aimed to determine whether loss of Cpe in pancreatic beta cells disrupts proinsulin processing and accelerates development of diabetes and obesity in mice. Pancreatic beta cell-specific Cpe knockout mice ({beta}CpeKO; Cpefl/fl x Ins1Cre/+) lack mature insulin granules and have elevated proinsulin in plasma; however, glucose-and KCl-stimulated insulin secretion in {beta}CpeKO islets remained intact. High fat diet-fed {beta}CpeKO mice showed comparable weight gain and glucose tolerance compared to Wt littermates. Notably, beta-cell area was increased in chow-fed {beta}CpeKO mice and beta-cell replication was elevated in {beta}CpeKO islets. Transcriptomic analysis of {beta}CpeKO beta cells revealed elevated glycolysis and Hif1-target gene expression. Upon high glucose challenge, beta cells from {beta}CpeKO mice showed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, reduced MafA, and elevated Aldh1a3 transcript levels. Following multiple low-dose streptozotocin treatment, {beta}CpeKO mice had accelerated hyperglycemia with reduced beta-cell insulin and Glut2 expression. These findings suggest that Cpe and proper proinsulin processing are critical in maintaining beta cell function during the development of diabetes.",

Using differentiated air-liquid interface cultures of primary nasal cells, we show that the T1R3 receptor is also expressed in human and mouse nasal cell cilia. D-amino acids produced at low mM concentrations by Staphylococcus aureus activate T1R3 to decrease ASL glucose and increase apical glucose uptake by increasing GLUT2 and GLUT10 expression through a {beta}-arrestin pathway. Our data suggests that T1R3 localized to cilia functions as an immune detector for D-amino acids to reduce ASL glucose and potentially limit bacterial growth.

Here we show that N-terminal proline-rich domains of CWLP and PRP940, containing glycosylated hydroxyproline residues, contact the CW, while their C-terminal 8CM domains function as PM-scaffolds. Both proteins are detected in PM nanodomains (PM-ND) and show co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation with aquaporins PIP2;1 and PIP2;7. Inhibition of actin polymerization by latrunculin B promotes CWLP-endosome appearance, while blocking the actomyosin-based transport by a truncated form of myosin XI-K relaxes lateral boundaries of CWLP-PIP2;1 PD-NDs. Mass spectrometry data indicate that CWLP co-purifies with dynamins implicated in fission of endocytic PD-ND invaginations. Lack of co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation with aquaporin-binding flotillin (FLOT2) indicates that CWLP and PRP940 mark a new distinct type of PM-ND. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that CWLP and PRP940 interact with multiple aquaporins and several protein phosphatase PP2A-B regulatory subunits. By preventing irreversible separation of CW and PM, and likely assisting PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of aquaporins and closure of their water channels, overexpression of CWLP confers tolerance to plasmolysis, dehydration and freezing in Arabidopsis and to water shortage in potato plants.\n\nSummary StatementArabidopsis Hybrid-Proline-Rich Proteins CWLP and PRP940 occur in association with dynamins, recruit PP2A protein phosphatases to aquaporin water channels in plasma-membrane (PM) nanodomains and elevate tolerance to cellular dehydration.",

    "abstract": "Polarization is the process by which a macrophage cell commits to a phenotype based on external signal stimulation. To know how this process is affected by random fluctuations and events within a cell is of utmost importance to better understand the underlying dynamics and predict possible phenotype transitions. For this purpose, we develop a stochastic modeling approach for the macrophage polarization process. We classify phenotype states using the Robust Perron Cluster Analysis and quantify transition pathways and probabilities by applying Transition Path Theory. Depending on the model parameters, we identify four bistable and one tristable phenotype configuration. We find that bistable transitions are fast but their states less robust. In contrast, phenotype transitions in the tristable situation have a comparatively long time duration, which reflects the robustness of the states. The results indicate parallels in the overall transition behavior of macrophage cells with other heterogeneous and plastic cell types, such as cancer cells. Our approach allows for a probabilistic interpretation of macrophage phenotype transitions and biological inference on phenotype robustness. In general, the methodology can easily be adapted to other systems where random state switches are known to occur.",

    "abstract": "A series of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have evolved in humans during the COVID-19 pandemic--Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. Here, we used global proteomic and genomic analyses during infection to understand the molecular responses driving VOC evolution. We discovered VOC-specific differences in viral RNA and protein expression levels, including for N, Orf6, and Orf9b, and pinpointed several viral mutations responsible. An analysis of the host response to VOC infection and comprehensive interrogation of altered virus-host protein-protein interactions revealed conserved and divergent regulation of biological pathways. For example, regulation of host translation was highly conserved, consistent with suppression of VOC replication in mice using the translation inhibitor plitidepsin. Conversely, modulation of the host inflammatory response was most divergent, where we found Alpha and Beta, but not Omicron BA.1, antagonized interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), a phenotype that correlated with differing levels of Orf6. Additionally, Delta more strongly upregulated proinflammatory genes compared to other VOCs. Systematic comparison of Omicron subvariants revealed BA.5 to have evolved enhanced ISG and proinflammatory gene suppression that similarly correlated with Orf6 expression, effects not seen in BA.4 due to a mutation that disrupts the Orf6-nuclear pore interaction. Our findings describe how VOCs have evolved to fine-tune viral protein expression and protein-protein interactions to evade both innate and adaptive immune responses, offering a likely explanation for increased transmission in humans.\n\nOne sentence summarySystematic proteomic and genomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern reveal how variant-specific mutations alter viral gene expression, virus-host protein complexes, and the host response to infection with applications to therapy and future pandemic preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in fluorescence technologies and microscopy techniques have significantly improved scientists ability to investigate biological processes at the single-cell level. However, fluorescent reporters can only track the temporal dynamics of a limited number of critical components in a cell (e.g., fluorescent proteins), leaving other pivotal dynamic components (such as gene-state) hidden. Moreover, the nature of the interactions among intracellular biomolecular species is inevitably stochastic in the low copy number regime, which adds more difficulties to the investigation of these hidden species dynamics. Therefore developing mathematical and computational tools for inferring the behaviour of stochastic reaction networks from time-course data is urgently needed.\n\nHere we develop a finite-dimensional filter for estimating the conditional distribution of the hidden (unobserved) species given continuous-time and noise-free observations of some species (e.g. a fluorescent reporter). It was proposed that in this setting, the conditional distribution evolves in time according to a large or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. We first formally verify the validity of this filtering equation under the non-explosivity condition and then develop a Finite-State Projection method, which provides an approximate solution by truncating the infinite-dimensional system. Additionally, we give computable error bounds for the algorithm. Finally, we present several numerical examples to illustrate our method and compare its performance with an existing particle filtering method for estimating the conditional distribution.",

We revealed a previously unknown role for the tumor suppressor NF2/Merlin for maximum induction of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISG), which are positively regulated by the transcription factor IRF-1. We then performed an additional focused ISG-targeted CRISPR screen that identified the host E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF213 as essential for IFN-{gamma} mediated control of T. gondii. RNF213 mediated ubiquitination of targets on the parasite-containing vacuole and growth restriction in response to IFN-{gamma} in a variety of cell types, thus identifying a conserved factor that plays a prominent role in human cells. Surprisingly, growth inhibition did not require the autophagy protein ATG5, indicating that RNF213 initiates restriction independent of a non-canonical autophagy pathway that has previously been implicated in control of T. gondii. RNF213 was also important for control of unrelated intracellular pathogens in human cells treated with IFN, as shown here for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus. Collectively, our findings establish RNF213 as a critical component of cell-autonomous immunity to a broad spectrum of intracellular pathogens in human cells.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPositive ecological interactions can play a role in community structure and species co-existence. A well-documented case of mutualistic interaction is Mullerian mimicry, the convergence of colour pattern in defended species living in sympatry. By reducing predation pressure, Mullerian mimicry may limit local extinction risks of defended species, but this positive effect can be weakened by undefended mimics (Batesian mimicry). While mimicry was well-studied in neotropical butterflies, it remains surprisingly poorly studied in wasps and bees (Hymenoptera: Aculeata). However, only females are defended in Aculeata and this female-limited defence may modulate the effect of Mullerian mimicry on extinction risks. Here, we focus on the effect of Mullerian mimicry on extinction risk in Aculeata, using a population dynamics model for two species. We show that Mullerian mimicry has a positive effect on species co-existence, but this effect depends on the sex-ratio. We found that the probability of extinction increases as the proportion of undefended males increases in the population, however co-existence still occurs if females are sufficiently abundant or noxious. Furthermore, we detected a destabilising effect of dual sex-limited mimicry (when each sex resembles a different model) on species co-existence. In a context of massive population decline caused by anthropic activities, our findings highlight the potential importance of Mullerian mimicry as an overlooked mechanism linked to extinction risk in wasp and bee species.",

In a candidate RNAi screen designed to search for new modifiers of DAF-16 function among genes involved in histone modification and/or small RNA-mediated silencing pathways, we found nrde-1, wago-1, and adr-1 as positive regulators of DAF-16. We confirmed by several methods and in different models that DAF-16 translocation to the nucleus and, subsequently, its function is tightly controlled by these genes and narrowed down to components of the NRDE complex and the nuclear RNAi pathway as key DAF-16 modulators. Importantly, we found that the NRDE pathway controls DAF-16-mediated longevity and dauer entry. Our epistasis data indicate that nrde-1 interacts with akt-1 to control lifespan. We also demonstrated that NRDE-1 acts downstream of AGE-1/PI3K and partially requires mTORC2 and AKT-1 to control DAF-16 translocation. These results unveil a mechanism of regulation of dauer formation and longevity in C. elegans via nuclear RNAi-mediated modulation of DAF-16 function in a manner that involves the mTORC2-AKT axis.",

    "abstract": "Type 4 Secretion Systems are a main driver for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in bacteria. In Gram-positives, these secretion systems often rely on surface adhesins to enhance cellular aggregation and mating pair formation. One of the best studied adhesins is PrgB from the conjugative plasmid pCF10 of Enterococcus faecalis, which has been shown to play major roles in conjugation, biofilm formation and importantly also in bacterial virulence. Since prgB orthologs exist on a large number of conjugative plasmids in various different species, this makes PrgB a model protein for this widespread virulence factor. After characterizing the polymer adhesin domain of PrgB previously, we here report the structure for almost the entire remainder of PrgB, which reveals that PrgB contains four immunoglobulin-like domains. Based on this new insight, we re-evaluate previously studied variants and present new in vivo data where specific domains or conserved residues have been removed. For the first time, we can show a decoupling of cellular aggregation from biofilm formation and conjugation in prgB mutant phenotypes. Based on the presented data, we propose a new functional model to explain how PrgB mediates its different functions. We hypothesize that the Ig-like domains act as a rigid stalk that presents the polymer adhesin domain at the right distance from the cell wall.",

This tumor is characterized by a very low 2-year survival rate, high rates of metastasis, and rapid acquisition of chemoresistance. The heterogeneous nature of this tumor makes it difficult to study and to treat, as it is not clear how or when this heterogeneity arises. Here we describe temporal, single-cell analysis of SCLC to investigate tumor initiation and chemoresistance in both SCLC xenografts and in situ SCLC mouse models. We identify an early population of tumor cells with high expression of AP-1 network genes that are critical for tumor growth. Furthermore, we have identified and validated the cancer testis antigens (CTAs) PAGE5 and GAGE2A as mediators of chemoresistance in human SCLC.

Respondents from biomedical fields completed surveys administered by the National Institutes of Health Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (NIH BEST) programs across 17 US institutional sites. Graduate and postdoctoral demographic and survey response data were examined to evaluate the impact of intersectional identities on trainee career self-efficacy. The study hypothesized that race, ethnicity and gender, and the relations between these identities, would impact trainee career self-efficacy. The analysis demonstrated that racial and ethnic group, gender, specific career interests (academic principal investigator vs. other careers), and seniority (junior vs. senior trainee level) were, to various degrees, all associated with trainee career self-efficacy and the effects were consistent across graduate and postdoctoral respondents. Implications for differing levels of self-efficacy are discussed, including factors and events during training that may contribute to (or undermine) career self-efficacy. The importance of mentorship for building research and career self-efficacy of trainees is discussed, especially with respect to those identifying as women and belonging to racial/ethnic populations underrepresented in biomedical sciences. The results underscore the need for change in the biomedical academic research community in order to retain a diverse biomedical workforce.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe liver-derived circulating PCSK9 enhances the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in endosomes/lysosomes. PCSK9 inhibition or silencing is presently used in clinics worldwide to reduce LDL-cholesterol, resulting in lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and possibly cancer/metastasis. The mechanism by which the PCSK9-LDLR complex is sorted to degradation compartments is not fully understood. We previously suggested that out of the three M1, M2 and M3 subdomains of the C-terminal Cys/His-rich-domain (CHRD) of PCSK9, only M2 is critical for the activity of extracellular of PCSK9 on cell surface LDLR. This likely implicates the binding of M2 to an unknown membrane-associated \"protein X\" that would escort the complex to endosomes/lysosomes for degradation. We reported that a nanobody P1.40 binds the M1 and M3 domains of the CHRD and inhibits the function of PCSK9. It was also reported that the cytosolic adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) could bind M1 and M3 subdomains and enhance the activity of PCSK9. In this study, we determined the 3-dimensional structure of the CHRD-P1.40 complex to understand the intricate interplay between P1.40, CAP1 and PCSK9 and how they regulate LDLR degradation.\n\nMethodsX-ray diffraction of the CHRD-P1.40 complex was analyzed with a 2.2 [A] resolution. The affinity and interaction of PCSK9 or CHRD with P1.40 or CAP1 was analyzed by atomic modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, bio-layer interferometry, expression in hepatic cell lines and immunocytochemistry to monitor LDLR degradation. The CHRD-P1.40 interaction was further analyzed by deep mutational scanning and binding assays to validate the role of predicted critical residues. Conformational changes and atomic models were obtained by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that PCSK9 exists in a closed or open conformation and that P1.40 favors the latter by binding key residues in the M1 and M3 subdomains of the CHRD. Our data show that CAP1 is well secreted by hepatic cells and binds extracellular PCSK9 at distinct residues in the M1 and M3 domains and in the acidic prodomain. CAP1 stabilizes the closed conformation of PCSK9 and prevents P1.40 binding. However, CAP1 siRNA only partially inhibited PCSK9 activity on the LDLR. By modeling the previously reported interaction between M2 and an R-X-E motif in HLA-C, we identified Glu567 and Arg549 as the critical M2 residues binding HLA-C. Amazingly, these two residues are also required for the PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation.\n\nConclusionsThe present study reveals that CAP1 enhances the function of PCSK9, likely by twisting the protein into a closed configuration that exposes the M2 subdomain needed for targeting the PCSK9-LDLR complex to degradation compartments. We hypothesize that \"protein X\", which is expected to guide the LDLR-PCSK9-CAP1 complex to these compartments after endocytosis into clathrin-coated vesicles, is HLA-C or a similar MHC-I family member. This conclusion is supported by the PCSK9 natural loss-of-function Q554E and gain-of-function H553R M2 variants, whose consequences are anticipated by our modeling.",

    "abstract": "T cell recognition of SARS-CoV-2 antigens after vaccination and/or natural infection has played a central role in resolving SARS-CoV-2 infections and generating adaptive immune memory. However, the clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses is variable and the mechanisms underlying T cell interaction with target antigens are not fully understood. This is especially true given the virus rapid evolution, which leads to new variants with immune escape capacity. In this study, we used the Omicron variant as a model organism and took a systems approach to evaluate the impact of mutations on CD8+ T cell immunogenicity. We computed an  immunogenicity potential score for each SARS-CoV-2 peptide antigen from the ancestral strain and Omicron, capturing both antigen presentation and T cell recognition probabilities. By comparing ancestral vs. Omicron immunogenicity scores, we reveal a divergent and heterogeneous landscape of impact for CD8+ T cell recognition of mutated targets in Omicron variants. While T cell recognition of Omicron peptides is broadly preserved, we observed mutated peptides with deteriorated immunogenicity that may assist breakthrough infection in some individuals. We then combined our scoring scheme with an in-silico mutagenesis, to characterise the position- and residue-specific theoretical mutational impact on immunogenicity. While we predict many escape trajectories from the theoretical landscape of substitutions, our study suggests that Omicron mutations in T cell epitopes did not develop under cell-mediated pressure. Our study provides a generalisable platform for fostering a deeper understanding of existing and novel variant impact on antigen-specific vaccine- and/or infection-induced T cell immunity.",

Moreover, growth-survival relationships of larvae and juveniles associated with vegetated habitats have rarely been examined. To quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the processes affecting juvenile survival in vegetated habitats, we investigated whether there is a correlation between the degree of selection for bigger and faster-growing fish and mortality rates for three cohorts by birth date of post-settlement black rockfish (Sebastes cheni) in a macroalgal bed. We also analyzed relationships between growth rate and experienced temperature by age class to examine the effects of temperature on growth. The latest cohort, which grew under lower vegetation coverage due to a seasonal increase in water temperature, showed higher mortality with evidence of strong selection for bigger and faster-growing fish. The growth-temperature relationships showed that positive effects of temperature on growth weakened after settlement. Therefore, we suggest that macroalgal coverage has a critical role controlling the growth-mortality relationship of post-settlement S. cheni. Furthermore, the negative effects of high temperature on juvenile survival through loss of vegetation may be greater than the positive effects on juvenile growth. These findings will contribute to the management of fisheries resources by increasing the understanding of relationships between survival mechanisms in fish early life stages and vegetation phenology of their habitat under the increasing effects of global warming.",

Here, we carried out a comparative selection study on wing shape and body size across multiple populations of two closely related and ecologically similar pond damselflies: Enallagma cyathigerum and Ischnura elegans (family Coenagrionidae). Our data revealed directional selection on body size in females and weak stabilizing selection on wing shape in both sexes, and these selection regimes were shared between the species. In contrast, sexual selection on male body size was curvilinear and divergent between species. By analyzing selection on the fine-grained spatial scale, we found that selection of male body size was shaped by the local social organization, and the relationship between socioecological indices and directional selection was consistent between the two species. Our study illustrates a case of stasis in the adaptive landscape caused by ecological similarity between taxa, supporting the idea that a shared ecological niche may result in a stable adaptive zone lasting millions of years.",

    "abstract": "In many autoimmune diseases, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) skew towards a pro-inflammatory and non-suppressive phenotype and are therefore unable to control the exaggerated autoimmune response. This may largely impact the success of autologous Treg therapy which is currently under investigation for treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, there is a need to ensure in vivo stability of Tregs before successful Treg therapy can be applied. Using a murine genetic fate-mapping model, we demonstrate that inflammatory exFOXP3 T cells accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In a human in vitro BBB model, we discovered that interaction with inflamed blood-brain barrier (BBB)-endothelial cells induces loss of suppressive function in Tregs. Transcriptome analysis further revealed that Tregs which migrated across inflamed BBB-endothelial cells in vitro have a pro-inflammatory Th1/17 signature and upregulate the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared to non-migrated Tregs. These findings suggest that interaction with BBB-endothelial cells is sufficient to affect Treg function, and that transmigration triggers an additive pro-inflammatory phenotype switch, which was also seen in CNS-derived exFOXP3 T cells of EAE mice. In vitro treatment of migrated human Tregs with the clinically-approved mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin completely restored the loss of suppressive function. Finally, flow cytometric analysis indicated an enrichment of inflammatory, less suppressive CD49d+ Tregs in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients, thereby underscoring the relevance of our findings for human disease. In sum, our findings provide firm evidence that the inflamed BBB affects human Treg stability, which can be restored using a mTORC1 inhibitor. These insights can help in significantly improving the efficacy of autologous Treg therapy of MS.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudies on the role of the oral microbiome in SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of the disease are limited. We aimed to characterize the bacterial communities present in the saliva of patients with varied COVID-19 severity to learn if there are differences in the characteristics of the microbiome among the clinical groups.\n\nMethodsWe included asymptomatic subjects with no previous COVID-19 infection or vaccination; patients with mild respiratory symptoms, positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection; patients that required hospitalization because of severe COVID-19 with oxygen saturation below 92%, and fatal cases of COVID-19. Saliva samples collected before any treatment were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Oral microbiota in saliva was studied by amplification and sequencing of the V1-V3 variable regions of 16S gene using a Illumina MiSeq platform.\n\nResultsWe found significant changes in diversity, composition, and networking in saliva microbiota of patients with COVID-19, as well as patterns associated with severity of disease. The presence or abundance of several commensal species and opportunistic pathogens were associated with each clinical stage. Patterns of networking were also found associated with severity of disease: a highly regulated bacterial community (normonetting) was found in healthy people whereas poorly regulated populations (disnetting) were characteristic of severe cases.\n\nConclusionsCharacterization of microbiota in saliva may offer important clues in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and may also identify potential markers for prognosis in the severity of the disease.\n\nImportance of the workSARS-CoV-2 infection is the most severe pandemic of humankind in the last hundred years. The outcome of the infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild to severe and even fatal cases, but reasons for this remain unknown. Microbes normally colonizing the respiratory tract form communities that may mitigate the transmission, symptoms, and severity of viral infections, but very little is known on the role of these microbial communities in the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to characterize the bacterial communities in saliva of patients with different severity of COVID-19 disease, from mild to fatal cases. Our results revealed clear differences in the composition and in the nature of interactions (networking) of the bacterial species present in the different clinical groups and show community-patterns associated with disease severity. Characterization of the microbial communities in saliva may offer important clues to learn ways COVID-19 patients may suffer from different disease severities.",

Despite deep conservation of the Z chromosome across Lepidoptera, our chromosome-level W assembly reveals little conservation with available W chromosome sequence in related species or with the Z chromosome, consistent with a non-canonical origin of the W chromosome. The W chromosome has accumulated significant repetitive elements and experienced rapid gene gain from the remainder of the genome, with most genes exhibiting pseudogenization after duplication to the W. The genes that retain significant expression are largely enriched for functions in DNA recombination, the nucleosome, chromatin and DNA binding, likely related to meiotic and mitotic processes within the female gonad.",

    "abstract": "The human genome contains numerous duplicated regions, such as parent-pseudogene pairs, causing sequencing reads to align equally well to either gene. The extent to which this ambiguity complicates transcriptomic analyses is currently unknown. This is concerning as many parent genes have been linked to disease, including GBA1, causally linked to both Parkinsons and Gaucher disease. We find that most of the short sequencing reads that map to GBA1, also map to its pseudogene, GBAP1. Using long-read RNA-sequencing in human brain, where all reads mapped uniquely, we demonstrate significant differences in expression compared to short-read data. We identify novel transcripts from both GBA1 and GBAP1, including protein-coding transcripts that are translated in vitro and detected in proteomic data, but that lack GCase activity. By combining long-read with single-nuclear RNA-sequencing to analyse brain-relevant cell types we demonstrate that transcript expression varies by brain region with cell-type-selectivity. Taken together, these results suggest a non-lysosomal function for both GBA1 and GBAP1 in brain. Finally, we demonstrate that inaccuracies in annotation are widespread among parent genes, with implications for many human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Changes in spatial localization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are necessary for establishing morphogenesis in multiple developmental contexts. Both ECM motion and tissue deformation require multicellular scale coordination, however the interplay between them remain largely unexplored. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism coupling morphogenetic events and epithelia-driven ECM flow in vitro. We show that exposure to ECM components triggers periodic morphogenesis of dome-shaped structures in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) monolayers, driven by directional ECM flow. We show that this flow is initiated by local symmetry breaking events, is driven by microvilli and requires unperturbed flow conditions, microvilli function, and cytoskeletal contractility. An in silico model shows that a reaction-diffusion-like mechanism is responsible for organizing local morphogenesis into global tissue-wide events. We validate this model by predicting changes in cell patterning landscape during mesoderm differentiation, and demonstrate changes in cellular identity by immunohistochemistry and scRNAseq. These results demonstrate that transport of ECM over epithelia, termed ECM flow, is a major contributor in sustaining morphogenesis and differentiation. Our in vitro approach suggests that ECM flow may be a broadly conserved mechanism guiding multi-cellular morphogenesis and may be further explored to investigate the role of ECM transport in other model systems.",

    "abstract": "The design and manufacturing of high value industrial components is suffering a change of paradigm with 3D printing. In this change of paradigm, metamaterials have an important role because when a component is 3D-printed, it is performed from the micro level, where custom structures may be designed to endow the material and the component of special of customized mechanical properties. Topology optimization techniques facilitate the design of both the microstructures and the overall component topology, and today the component topology may be designed assuming a continuous spectrum of mechanical properties facilitated by different locally designed microstructures. However, current topology optimization techniques do not operate directly with the mechanical properties of the material, but through density intermediates, using density-based limits like a minimum or maximum density, assuming an homogeneous base material. We propose here a novel topology optimization algorithm which operates directly on the mechanical properties and energies, without employing density intermediates. The proposed approach reduces the algorithmic complexity since the optimization is performed by the direct iterative update of the mechanical properties, through information taken from its finite element analysis. We show that the proposed methodology can reach similar results as the current techniques based on a gradient descent optimization, eliminating the need for external parameters and, hence, increasing the easy of use and its robustness. The proposed technique is specially suitable for two-level concurrent material-component design using functionally graded metamaterials.",

    "abstract": "Online assessment of tumor characteristics during surgery is important and has the potential to establish an intraoperative surgeon feedback mechanism. With the availability of such feedback, surgeons could decide to be more liberal or conservative regarding the resection of the tumor. While there are methods to perform metabolomics-based online tumor pathology prediction, their model complexity and, in turn, the predictive performance is limited by the small dataset sizes. Furthermore, the information conveyed by the feedback provided on the tumor tissue could be improved both in terms of content and accuracy. In this study, we propose a metabolic pathway-informed deep learning model, PiDeeL, to perform survival analysis and pathology assessment based on metabolite concentrations. We show that incorporating pathway information into the model architecture substantially reduces parameter complexity and achieves better survival analysis and pathological classification performance. With these design decisions, we show that PiDeeL improves tumor pathology prediction performance of the state-of-the-art in terms of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) by 3.38% and the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) by 4.06%. Similarly, with respect to the time-dependent concordance index (c-index), we observe that PiDeeL achieves better survival analysis performance (improvement up to 4.3%) when compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we show that importance analyses performed on input metabolite features as well as pathway-specific hidden-layer neurons of PiDeeL provide insights into tumor metabolism. We foresee that the use of this model in the surgery room will help surgeons adjust the surgery plan on the fly and will result in better prognosis estimates tailored to surgical procedures.\n\nAvailabilityThe code is released at https://github.com/ciceklab/PiDeeL.

We developed a scoring function system to identify RNA biomarkers with RNA-seq data. We applied the method to two data sets, one for extracellular RNAs (ex-RNAs) and the other for intracellular microRNAs (miRNAs). The data set have RNA-seq data of ex-RNAs from cell culture media for six different types of cells, including human embryonic stem cells. To get the RNA-seq data from intracellular miRNAs, we cultured three types of cells: human embryonic stem cells (H9), neural stem cells (NSC), hESC-derived endothelial cells (EC) and conducted small RNA-seq to their intracellular miRNAs. Using these data, we identified a set of ex-RNAs/smRNAs as candidates of biomarkers for different types of cells for cell manufacture. We also used deep-learning based prediction methods and simulated data to validate these discovered biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALFs) are cysteine-rich peptides that regulate multiple physiological processes in plants. This peptide family has considerably expanded during land plant evolution, but the role of ancient RALFs in modulating stress response is unknown. Here, we used the moss Physcomitrium patens as a model to gain insight into the role of RALF peptides in coordination of plant growth and stress response in non-vascular plants. The quantitative proteomic analysis revealed concerted downregulation of M6 metalloproteases and some membrane proteins, including those involved in stress response, in PpRALF1, 2 and 3 knockout (KO) lines. We found that knockout of PpRALF2 and PpRALF3 genes resulted in increased resistance to bacterial and fungal phytopathogens - Pectobacterium carotovorum and Fusarium solani, suggesting the role of these peptides in negative regulation of immune response in P. patens. The comparative transcriptome analysis of PpRALF3 KO and wild type plants under Fusarium solani infection showed the clear difference in regulation of genes belonging to phenylpropanoid pathway and associated with cell wall modification and biogenesis between these genotypes. The follow-up analysis revealed the role of PpRALF3 in growth regulation under abiotic and biotic stress regulation, which suggests the role of RALFs in responses to different adverse conditions. Thus, our study sheds light on the function of the previously uncharacterized PpRALF3 peptide and gives a clue to ancestral functions of RALF peptides in plant stress response.",

Like in bread wheat, the starch and protein accumulated in the endosperm during grain development are the primary contributors to the calorific value of durum grains. To enable further research into endosperm development and storage reserve synthesis, we generated a high-quality transcriptomics dataset from developing endosperms of variety Kronos, to complement the extensive mutant resources available for this variety. Endosperms were dissected from grains harvested at eight timepoints during grain development (6 to 30 days post anthesis (dpa)), then RNA sequencing was used to profile the transcriptome at each stage. The largest changes in gene expression profile were observed between the earlier timepoints, prior to 15 dpa. We detected a total of 29,925 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between at least two timepoints, and clustering analysis revealed nine distinct expression patterns. We demonstrate the potential of our dataset to provide new insights into key processes that occur during endosperm development, using starch metabolism as an example. Overall, we provide a valuable resource for studying endosperm development in this increasingly important crop species.",

    "abstract": "Temporal binding has been understood as an illusion in timing judgement. When an action triggers an outcome (e.g. a sound) after a brief delay, the action is reported to occur later than if the outcome does not occur, and the outcome is reported to occur earlier than a similar outcome not caused by an action. We show here that an attention mechanism underlies the seeming illusion of timing judgement. In one method, participants watch a rotating clock hand and report event times by noting the clock hand position when the event occurs. We find that visual attention is critically involved in shaping event time reports made in this way. This occurs because action and outcome events result in shifts of attention around the clock rim, thereby biasing the perceived location of the clock hand. Using a probe detection task to measure attention, we show a difference in attention distribution between a single-event condition (sound only or action only) and a two-event agency condition (action plus sound). Participants accordingly report the timing of the same event (the sound or the action) differently in the two conditions: spatial attentional shifts masquerading as temporal binding. Furthermore, computational modelling based on the attention measure can reproduce temporal binding. Studies that use time judgement as an implicit marker of voluntary agency should first discount the artefactual changes in event timing reports that actually reflect differences in spatial attention. The study also has important implications for related results in mental chronometry obtained with the clock-like method since Wundt, as attention may well be a critical confounding factor in the interpretation of these studies.",

    "abstract": "Very preterm birth (VPT; [&le;] 32 weeks gestation) is associated with altered brain development and cognitive and behavioral difficulties across the lifespan. However, heterogeneity in outcomes among individuals born VPT makes it challenging to identify those most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental sequelae. Here, we aimed to stratify VPT children into distinct behavioral subgroups and explore between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain structure and function. 198 VPT children (98 females) previously enrolled in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42) underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging at term-equivalent age and neuropsychological assessments at 4-7 years. Using an integrative clustering approach, we combined neonatal socio-demographic, clinical factors and childhood socio-emotional and executive function outcomes, to identify distinct subgroups of children based on their similarity profiles in a multidimensional space. We characterized resultant subgroups using domain-specific outcomes (temperament, psychopathology, IQ and cognitively stimulating home environment) and explored between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain volumes (voxel-wise Tensor-Based-Morphometry), functional connectivity (voxel-wise degree centrality) and structural connectivity (Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics). Results showed two-and three-cluster data-driven solutions. The two-cluster solution comprised a  resilient subgroup (lower psychopathology and higher IQ, executive function and socio-emotional outcomes) and an  at-risk subgroup (poorer behavioral and cognitive outcomes). The three-cluster solution showed an additional third  intermediate subgroup displaying behavioral and cognitive outcomes intermediate between the resilient and at-risk subgroups. The resilient subgroup had the most cognitively stimulating home environment and the at-risk subgroup showed the highest neonatal clinical risk, while the intermediate subgroup showed the lowest clinical but the highest socio-demographic risk. Compared to the intermediate subgroup, the resilient subgroup displayed larger neonatal insular and orbitofrontal volumes and stronger orbitofrontal functional connectivity, while the at-risk group showed widespread white matter microstructural alterations. These findings suggest that risk stratification following VPT birth is feasible and could be used translationally to guide personalized interventions aimed at promoting childrens resilience.",

    "abstract": "The roots of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination go back to the early 1900s. Since then, the test has undergone modifications and advancements in an effort to increase its dependability and accuracy. Although biological investigations use an ever-increasing number of samples, complicated processes and human error sometimes result in poor data quality, which makes it challenging to replicate scientific conclusions. The automation of the few manual steps using protocols decipherable by machine can ease some of the procedural difficulties. Originally relying on manual pipetting and human vision to determine the results, modern broth dilution MIC testing procedures have incorporated microplate readers to enhance sample analysis. However, current MIC testing procedures are unable to simultaneously evaluate a large number of samples efficiently. Here, we have created a workflow using the Opentrons OT-2 robot to enable high-throughput MIC testing. We have further optimized the analysis by incorporating Python programming for MIC assignment to streamline the automation. In this workflow, we performed MIC tests on four different strains, three replicates per strain, and analyzed a total of 1,152 wells. Comparing our our workflow to a conventional plate MIC procedure, we find that the HT-MIC method is 630% faster while simulataneously boasting a 100% accuracy. Our high-throughput MIC workflow can be applied in both academic and clinical settings since it is faster, more efficient, and more accurate than many conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "Modern migrants using plants to meet their health needs are known to conserve traditional knowledge, but also to innovate to adapt to their new environment. The voyage into Polynesia is amongst the most remarkable of human migrations, resulting in the peopling of isolated, difficult to reach archipelagos. We use this context to determine the role for adaptation in plant-based healthcare at pre-historic timescales. Testing the extent to which the new floristic environments encountered, cultural ancestry or geographic proximity predict the composition of ethnopharmacopoeias, we reveal adaptation to new floristic environments across seven oceanic ethnolinguistic groups. Reconstructions using data that encompass therapeutic applications and plant parts reveal more than three quarters of the plants used cross-culturally have use likely to be innovations by the first migrants into Oceania. For the other plants, there are non-tree-like patterns in therapeutic applications and plant parts used, showing that even when plants have continuity of use there is lability in how they are used. Applying linguistic criteria to the plants with putatively deep cultural uses, we find two, qaoa (Ficus) and walo-walo (Premna), that are highly conserved in therapeutic use, plant part used and with cognate names. Our study highlights the remarkable flexibility of Polynesian people seeking to meet health needs.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are of paramount importance in marine ecosystems, where they provide support for a large part of the biodiversity. Being quite sensitive to global changes, they are therefore the prime targets for biodiversity conservation policies. However, such conservation goals require accurate species identification, which are notoriously difficult to get in these highly morphologically variable organisms, rich in cryptic species. There is an acute need for easy-to-use and resolutive species diagnostic molecular markers. The present study builds on the huge sequencing effort developed during the TARA Pacific expedition to develop a genotyping strategy to assign coral samples to the correct species within two coral genera (Porites and Pocillopora). For this purpose, we developed a technique that we called \"Divergent Fragment\" based on the sequencing of a less than 2kb long diagnostic genomic fragment determined from the metagenomic data of a subset of the corals collected. This method has proven to be rapid, resolvable and cost-effective. Sequencing of PCR fragments nested along the species diagnostic fragment allowed us to assign 232 individuals of the genus Pocillopora and 247 individuals of the genus Porites to previously identified independent genetic lineages (i.e. species). This genotyping method will allow to fully analyze the coral samples collected across the Pacific during the Tara Pacific expedition and opens technological perspectives in the field of population genomics-guided conservation.",

    "abstract": "With the identification of an archaeal Last Universal Common Ancestor phylogenetically related to Methanopyrus, the origin of Bacteria becomes a choice between independent emergence versus descent from Archaea. Recently, use of the similarity between paralogous valyl-tRNA synthetase (VARS) and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IARS) as a measure of the ages of bacteria indicated that an Ancestral Bacterial Cluster centred at clostridial Mahella australiensis (Mau) were the oldest bacteria. Clostridial Thermincola potens (Tpo) also displayed an elevated similarity VARS-IARS bitscore. Overall, the high-bitscore bacteria dominated by Clostridia comprised a number of hydrogen producers. A search for archaea capable of hydrogen production that might be ancestral to the Bacteria domain yielded candidates led by Thermococci which, like Clostridia, form hydrogen through dark fermentation. A two-domain VARS tree based on Mahella, Thermincola, a broad spectrum of archaea together with both well known and newly reported species of Thermococci allocated these two Clostridia to a minor-Thermococcal division on the tree. The kinship between Thermoccoci and Clostridia suggested by this allocation was substantiated by conserved oligopeptide segments on their VARS sequences. It was therefore suggested that a Thermococci-to-Clostridia evolutionary pathway brought about the emergence of the Bacteria domain.",

    "abstract": "Thermostability is important for thermoactivity of proteins including enzymes. However, it is still challenging to pinpoint the specific structural factors for different temperature thresholds to initiate their specific structural and functional perturbations. Here, graph theory was used to investigate how the temperature-dependent noncovalent interactions as identified in the structures of aldolase B and its prevalent A149P mutant could form a systematic fluidic grid-like mesh network with topological grids to regulate the structural thermostability and the functional thermoactivity. The results showed that the biggest grid may determine the temperature thresholds for the changes in their secondary and tertiary structures and specific catalytic activities. Further, a highly conserved thermostable grid may serve as an anchor to secure the flexible active site to achieve the specific thermoactivity. Finally, higher grid-based systematic thermal instability may disfavor the thermoactivity. Thus, this computational study may provide critical clues for the structural thermostability and the functional thermoactivity of proteins including enzymes.",

    "abstract": "With the high mutation rate in viruses, a mixture of closely related viral strains (called viral quasispecies) often co-infect an individual host. Reconstructing individual strains from viral quasispecies is a key step to characterizing the viral population, revealing strain-level genetic variability, and providing insights into biomedical and clinical studies. Reference-based approaches of reconstructing viral strains suffer from the lack of high-quality references due to high mutation rates and biased variant calling introduced by a selected reference. De novo methods require no references but face challenges due to errors in reads, the high similarity of quasispecies, and uneven abundance of strains.\n\nIn this paper, we propose VStrains, a de novo approach for reconstructing strains from viral quasispecies. VStrains incorporates contigs, paired-end reads, and coverage information to iteratively extract the strain-specific paths from assembly graphs. We benchmark VStrains against multiple state-of-the-art de novo and reference-based approaches on both simulated and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that VStrains achieves the best overall performance on both simulated and real datasets under a comprehensive set of metrics such as genome fraction, duplication ratio, NGA50, error rate, etc.\n\nAvailabilityVStrains is freely available at https://github.com/MetaGenTools/VStrains.",

    "abstract": "Because of the biophysical relation between muscle fibre diameter and the propagation velocity of action potentials along the muscle fibres, motor unit conduction velocity (MUCV) could be a non-invasive index of muscle fibre size in humans. However, the relation between MUCV and fibre size has been only assessed indirectly in animal models and in human patients with invasive intramuscular EMG recordings, or it has been mathematically derived from computer simulations. By combining advanced non-invasive techniques to record motor unit activity in vivo, i.e., high-density surface EMG, with the gold standard technique for muscle tissue sampling, i.e., muscle biopsy, here we investigated the relation between the conduction velocity of populations of motor units identified from the biceps brachii muscle, and muscle fibre diameter. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility to predict muscle fibre diameter (R2 = 0.66) and cross-sectional area (R2 = 0.65) from conduction velocity estimates with low systematic bias (~2% and ~4% respectively) and a relatively low margin of individual error (~8% and ~16%, respectively). The proposed neuromuscular interface opens new perspectives in the use of high-density EMG as a non-invasive tool to estimate muscle fibre size without the need of surgical biopsy sampling. The non-invasive nature of high-density surface EMG for the assessment of muscle fibre size may be useful in studies monitoring child development, aging, space and exercise physiology.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOur study explored the relation between the conduction velocity of populations of motor units and muscle fibre size in healthy humans. Our results provide in vivo evidence that a high-density surface EMG-derived physiological parameter, i.e. motor unit conduction velocity, can be adopted to estimate muscle fibre size, without the need of surgical biopsy sampling. Here we propose a neuromuscular interface that opens new perspectives not only in the study of neuromuscular disorders, but also in other fields where the non-invasive and painless determination of muscle fibre and motor unit size becomes a priority, such as in aging, space and exercise physiology.",

    "abstract": "The counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia (CRR), which ensures a sufficient glucose supply to the brain, is an essential survival function. It is orchestrated by incompletely characterized glucose-sensing neurons, which trigger a coordinated autonomous and hormonal response that restores normoglycemia. Here, we investigated the role of hypothalamic Tmem117, identified in a genetic screen as a regulator of CRR. We show that Tmem117 is expressed in vasopressin magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus. Tmem117 inactivation in these neurons increases hypoglycemia-induced vasopressin secretion leading to higher glucagon secretion, an estrus cycle phase-dependent effect in female mice. Ex vivo electrophysiological analysis, in-situ hybridization and in vivo calcium imaging reveal that Tmem117 inactivation does not affect the glucose-sensing properties of vasopressin neurons but increases ER-stress, ROS production and intracellular calcium levels accompanied by increased AVP production and secretion. Thus, Tmem117 in vasopressin neurons is a physiological regulator of glucagon secretion and highlight the role of these neurons in the coordinated response to hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe continuous decline of executive abilities with age is mirrored by increased neural activity of domain-general networks during task processing. So far, it remains unclear how much domain-general networks contribute to domain-specific processes such as language when cognitive demands increase. The current neuroimaging study explored the potential of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over a domain-general hub to enhance executive and semantic processing in healthy middle-aged to older adults.\n\nMethodsWe implemented a cross-over within-subject study design with three task-based neuroimaging sessions per participant. Using an individualized stimulation approach, we stimulated each participant once with effective and once with sham iTBS over the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), a region of domain-general control. Subsequently, task-specific stimulation effects were assessed in functional MRI using a semantic and a non-verbal executive task with varying cognitive demand.\n\nResultsEffective stimulation increased activation relative to sham stimulation only during semantic processing in visual and dorsal attention networks. Further, iTBS induced increased functional connectivity in task-specific networks for semantic and executive conditions with high cognitive load. Notably, stimulation-induced changes in activation and connectivity related differently to behavior: While increased activation of the parietal dorsal attention network was linked to poorer semantic performance, its enhanced coupling with the pre-SMA was associated with more efficient semantic processing.\n\nConclusionsiTBS modulates networks in a task-dependent manner and generates effects at regions remote to the stimulation site. These neural changes are linked to more efficient semantic processing, which underlines the general potential of network stimulation approaches in cognitive aging.",
