    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo investigate the role of BMP signaling in osteoarthritis' pathogenesis and propose a disease-modifying therapy for OA.\n\nMethodsC57BL6/J mouse line was used to perform ACLT surgery at P120 to study the expression pattern of the BMP signaling readout pSMAD1/5/9. To investigate whether activation of BMP signaling is sufficient and necessary to induce osteoarthritis, we have used conditional GOF and LOF mouse lines in which BMP signaling can be activated or depleted, respectively, upon intra-peritoneal injection of tamoxifen. Finally, we locally inhibited BMP signaling through intra-articular injection of LDN-193189 pre- and post-onset surgically induced OA. Most of the analysis has been done through immunohistochemistry, histopathological staining, and micro-CT to evaluate the status of the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nResultsWe observed concomitant activation of BMP signaling, as judged by pSMAD1/5/9 immunoreactivity in the articular cartilage, upon induction of osteoarthritis with simultaneous depletion of SMURF1, an intra-cellular BMP signaling inhibitor in articular cartilage. Even without surgical induction of osteoarthritis, only BMP gain-of-function mutation induces OA in mouse articular cartilage. Also, genetic, or pharmacological inhibition of BMP signaling offered significant protection against OA pathogenesis. Interestingly, post-onset of the disease, inhibition of BMP signaling by intra-articular injection of LDN-193189 retarded OA progression with a significant reduction in inflammatory markers.\n\nConclusionOur study demonstrated that BMP signaling plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of OA and that local BMP inhibition can be an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Detection of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors has been explained by the presence of T cells primed by other coronaviruses. However, based on the relative high frequency and prevalence of cross-reactive T cells, we hypothesized CMV may induce these cross-reactive T cells. Stimulation of pre-pandemic cryo-preserved PBMCs with SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed that frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were higher in CMV-seropositive donors. Characterization of these T cells demonstrated that membrane-specific CD4+ and spike-specific CD8+ T cells originate from cross-reactive CMV-specific T cells. Spike-specific CD8+ T cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide FVSNGTHWF (FVS) and dissimilar CMV pp65 peptide IPSINVHHY (IPS) presented by HLA-B*35:01. These dual IPS/FVS-reactive CD8+ T cells were found in multiple donors as well as severe COVID-19 patients and shared a common T cell receptor (TCR), illustrating that IPS/FVS-cross-reactivity is caused by a public TCR. In conclusion, CMV-specific T cells cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, despite low sequence homology between the two viruses, and may contribute to the pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The currently expanding monkeypox epidemic is caused by a subclade IIb descendant of a monkeypox virus (MPXV) lineage traced back to Nigeria in 1971. In contrast to monkeypox cases caused by clade I and subclade IIa MPXV, the prognosis of current cases is generally favorable, but person-to-person transmission is much more efficient. MPXV evolution is driven by selective pressure from hosts and loss of virus-host interacting genes. However, there is no satisfactory genetic explanation using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the observed increased MPXV transmissibility. We hypothesized that key genomic changes may occur in the genomes low-complexity regions (LCRs), which are highly challenging to sequence and have been dismissed as uninformative. Using a combination of highly sensitive techniques, we determined a first high-quality MPXV genome sequence of a representative of the current epidemic with LCRs resolved at unprecedented accuracy. This effort revealed significant variation in short-tandem repeats within LCRs. We demonstrate that LCR entropy in the MPXV genome is significantly higher than that of SNPs and that LCRs are not randomly distributed. In silico analyses indicate that expression, translation, stability, or function of MPXV orthologous poxvirus genes (OPGs) 153, 204, and 208 could be affected in a manner consistent with the established \"genomic accordion\" evolutionary strategies of orthopoxviruses. Consequently, we posit that genomic studies focusing on phenotypic MPXV clade-/subclade-/lineage-/strain differences should change their focus to the study of LCR variability instead of SNP variability.",

    "abstract": "The lack of routine viral genomic surveillance delayed the initial detection of SARS-CoV-2, allowing the virus to spread unfettered at the outset of the U.S. epidemic. Over subsequent months, poor surveillance enabled variants to emerge unnoticed. Against this backdrop, long-standing social and racial inequities have contributed to a greater burden of cases and deaths among minority groups. To begin to address these problems, we developed a new variant surveillance model geared toward building microbial genome sequencing capacity at universities in or near rural areas and engaging the participation of their local communities. The resulting genomic surveillance network has generated more than 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to date, including the first confirmed case in northeast Louisiana of Omicron, and the first and sixth confirmed cases in Georgia of the emergent BA.2.75 and BQ.1.1 variants, respectively. In agreement with other studies, significantly higher viral gene copy numbers were observed in Delta variant samples compared to those from Omicron BA.1 variant infections, and lower copy numbers were seen in asymptomatic infections relative to symptomatic ones. Collectively, the results and outcomes from our collaborative work demonstrate that establishing genomic surveillance capacity at smaller academic institutions in rural areas and fostering relationships between academic teams and local health clinics represent a robust pathway to improve pandemic readiness.\n\nAuthor summaryGenomic surveillance involves decoding a pathogens genetic code to track its spread and evolution. During the pandemic, genomic surveillance programs around the world provided valuable data to scientists, doctors, and public health officials. Knowing the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome has helped detect the emergence of new variants, including ones that are more transmissible or cause more severe disease, and has supported the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The impact of genomic surveillance on public health depends on representative sampling that accurately reflects the diversity and distribution of populations, as well as rapid turnaround time from sampling to data sharing. After a slow start, SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in the United States grew exponentially. Despite this, many rural regions and ethnic minorities remain poorly represented, leaving significant gaps in the data that informs public health responses. To address this problem, we formed a network of universities and clinics in Louisiana, Georgia, and Mississippi with the goal of increasing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing volume, representation, and equity. Our results demonstrate the advantages of rapidly sequencing pathogens in the same communities where the cases occur and present a model that leverages existing academic and clinical infrastructure for a powerful decentralized genomic surveillance system.",

    "abstract": "Nearly 90% of the disease risk-associated variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are in non-coding regions of the genome. The annotations obtained from analyzing functional genomics assays can provide additional information to pinpoint causal variants, which are often not the lead variants identified from association studies. However, the lack of available annotation tools limits the use of such data.\n\nTo address the challenge, we have previously built the RegulomeDB database for prioritizing and annotating variants in non-coding regions1, which has been a highly utilized resource for the research community (Supplementary Fig. 1). RegulomeDB annotates a variant by intersecting its position with genomic intervals identified from functional genomic assays and computational approaches. It also incorporates those hits of a variant into a heuristic ranking score, representing its potential to be functional in regulatory elements.\n\nHere we present a newer version of the RegulomeDB web server, RegulomeDB v2.1 (http://regulomedb.org). We improve and boost annotation power by incorporating thousands of newly processed data from functional genomic assays in GRCh38 assembly, and now include probabilistic scores from the SURF algorithm that was the top performing non-coding variant predictor in CAGI 52. We also provide interactive charts and genome browser views to allow users an easy way to perform exploratory analyses in different tissue contexts.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the interrelationship between primary dendrite selection of Purkinje cells and migration of their pre-synaptic partner granule cells during cerebellar development. During development of the cerebellar cortex, each Purkinje cell grows more than three dendritic trees, from which a primary tree is selected to develop further, whereas the others completely retract. Experimental studies suggest that this selection process is coordinated by physical and synaptic interactions with granule cells. However, technical limitations hinder a continuous experimental observation of multiple populations. To reveal the mechanism underlying this selection process, we constructed a computational model of dendritic developments and granule cell migrations, using a new computational framework, NeuroDevSim. Comparisons of the resulting morphologies from the model demonstrate the roles of the selection stage in regulating the growth of the selected primary trees. The study presents the first computational model that simultaneously simulates growing Purkinje cells and the dynamics of granule cell migrations, revealing the role of physical and synaptic interactions upon dendritic selection. The model provides new insights about the distinct planar morphology of Purkinje cell dendrites and about roles of the dendritic selection process during the cerebellar development. The model also supports the hypothesis that synaptic interactions by granule cells are likely to be involved in the selection procedure.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe mature structure of a Purkinje cell, the main neuron of the cerebellum, is composed of a large flat dendritic tree composed of a single or sometimes 2 primary dendrites. However, this neuron has multiple similar trees during development, and retracts most of them to select its primary tree. We aim to explore roles of this developmental process as either an important step to attain optimal morphology or merely a redundant step to be eliminated by evolution in the future. We especially focused on environmental interactions on Purkinje cells as criteria to select the dendritic tree, hypothesizing that developing an efficient network with other neurons is one of the main goals of neuronal morphology. We constructed and used computational models to investigate detailed physical interactions and communications between Purkinje cells and their environment. Comparisons of models suggest the role of the selection stage is to obtain favorable growth of primary trees.",

    "abstract": "Neanderthals were a species of archaic human that became extinct around 40,000 years ago. Modern humans have inherited 1-6% of Neanderthal DNA as a result of interbreeding with the Neanderthals. These inherited Neanderthal genes have paradoxical influences, while some can provide protection to viral infections, some others are associated with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory diseases.\n\nWe hypothesized that genetic variants with strong detrimental effects on the function of the immune system could potentially contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthal population. In modern humans more than 450 genes are associated with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). We used the publically available genome information from a Neanderthal from the Altai mountains and filtered for potentially damaging variants that were present in genes associated with IEI, and checked whether these variants were present in the genomes of the Denisovan, Vindija and Chagyrskaya Neanderthals.\n\nWe identified 24 homozygous variants and 15 heterozygous variants in IEI-related genes in the Altai Neanderthal. Interestingly, two homozygous variants in the UNC13D gene and one variant in the MOGS gene were present in all archaic genomes. Defects in the UNC13D gene are known to cause a severe and often fatal disease called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis (HLH). One of these variants p.(Asn943Ser) has been reported in patients with HLH. Variants in MOGS are associated with glycosylation defects in the immune system affecting the susceptibility for infections. So, although we do not know exactly the functional impact yet, these three variants could have resulted in an increased susceptibility to severe diseases, and may have contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals after exposure to specific infections.",

The polymerization cycle and filament properties of eukaryotic actin have studied for decades and are well characterized. However, purification and in vitro work on MreB proteins have proven very difficult. Current knowledge of MreB biochemical and polymerization properties remains limited and is based on MreB proteins from Gram-negative species. In this study, we report the first observation of organized filaments and the first 3D-structure of MreB from a Gram-positive bacterium. We have purified MreB from the thermophilic Geobacillus stearothermophilus and shown that it forms straight pairs of protofilaments in vitro, and that polymerization depends on the presence of both lipids and nucleotide triphosphate. Two spatially close short hydrophobic sequences mediate membrane anchoring. Importantly, we demonstrate that unlike eukaryotic actin, nucleotide hydrolysis is a prerequisite for MreB interaction with the membrane, and that binding to lipids then triggers polymerization. Based on our results, we propose a molecular model for the mechanism of MreB polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Synapses at the pillar IHC-side activate at lower voltages than those of the modiolar side, which show larger active zones and Ca2+-channel clusters. At the postsynapse, SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds and operating ranges. While it is tempting to speculate about a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we bridged this gap by ex-vivo paired recordings of IHCs and postsynaptic boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in-vivo SGN-characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate (SR) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage-thresholds, shorter response latencies and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs can account for functional response diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN.\n\nSignificance StatementSound encoding relies on spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) with diverse spontaneous activities, sound thresholds and sound intensity ranges over which firing rates change. Such functional SGN diversity might originate from different input provided by the presynaptic inner hair cells (IHCs) at their afferent synapses. The present study addresses this hypothesis by using recordings from individual IHC-SGN synapses. The results provide evidence that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs underlies SGN firing diversity. Thus, IHCs seem to employ diverse active zones to decompose sound information into different neural pathways that collectively inform the brain.",

    "abstract": "Mature gametocytes of Plasmodium (P.) falciparum display a banana (falciform) shape conferred by a complex array of subpellicular microtubules (SPMT) associated to the inner membrane complex (IMC). Microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) define MT populations and modulate interaction to pellicular components. Several MAPs have been identified in Toxoplasma gondii and homologues can be found in the genome of Plasmodium species, but the function of these proteins for asexual and sexual development of malaria parasites is still unknown. Here we identified a novel subpellicular MAP, termed SPM3, that is conserved within the genus Plasmodium., especially within the Laverania subgenus, but absent in other Apicomplexa. Conditional knockdown and targeted gene disruption of Pfspm3 in P. falciparum cause severe morphological defects during gametocytogenesis leading to round, non-falciform gametocytes with an aberrant SPMT pattern. In contrast, Pbspm3 knockout in P. berghei, a species with round gametocytes, caused no defect in gametocytogenesis, but sporozoites displayed an aberrant motility and a dramatic defect in sporozoite invasion of salivary glands leading to a decreased efficiency in transmission. Electron microscopy revealed a dissociation of the SPMT from the IMC in Pbspm3 knockout parasites suggesting a function of SPM3 in anchoring MTs to the IMC. Overall, our results highlight SPM3 as a pellicular component with essential functions for malaria parasite transmission.\n\nIMPORTANCEA key structural feature driving the transition between different life cycle stages of the malaria parasite is the unique three membrane \"pellicle\", consisting of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) and a double membrane structure underlying the PPM termed the \"inner membrane complex\" (IMC). Additionally, there are numerous linearly arranged intramembranous particles (IMPs) linked to the IMC, which likely link the IMC to the subpellicular microtubule cytoskeleton. Here we identify, localize and characterize a novel subpellicular microtubule associated protein unique to the genus Plasmodium (P.). The knockout of this protein in the human infecting P. falciparum species result in malformed gametocytes and aberrant microtubules. We confirmed the microtubule association in the P. berghei rodent malaria homologue and show that its knockout results in a perturbated microtubule architecture, aberrant sporozoite motility and decreased transmission efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Three palps make the most anterior structure of the ascidian larva. These ectodermal derivatives have both a sensory and adhesive functions essential for metamorphosis. They derive from the anterior neural border and their formation is regulated by signaling pathways such as FGF and Wnt. Since they also share gene expression profiles with vertebrate anterior neural tissue and cranial placodes, their study should shed light on the emergence of the unique vertebrate telencephalon. Here, we show that BMP signaling regulates two phases of palps formation in Ciona intestinalis. During gastrula stages, the anterior neural border marked by Foxc is specified in a domain of inactive BMP signaling, and activating BMP prevented its formation. Later on, inhibiting BMP led to the formation of a single large palp, most likely of dorsal identity. Our results indicate that BMP signaling regulates papilla vs inter-papilla fate decision within the palps forming region. Finally, we showed that modulating BMP signaling led to similar palps phenotypes in another ascidian species Phallusia mammillata. This led us to screen transcriptomic data and identify novel palps markers. Collectively, we provide a better molecular description of palps formation in ascidians that will be instrumental for comparative studies within ascidians and between ascidians and other chordates.",

    "abstract": "To prevent future pandemics, it is important that we understand whether SARS-CoV-2 spilled over directly from animals to people, or indirectly in a laboratory accident. The genome of SARS-COV-2 contains a peculiar pattern of unique restriction endonuclease recognition sites allowing efficient dis- and re-assembly of the viral genome characteristic of synthetic viruses. Here, we report the likelihood of observing such a pattern in coronaviruses with no history of bioengineering. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is an anomaly, more likely a product of synthetic genome assembly than natural evolution. The restriction map of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with many previously reported synthetic coronavirus genomes, meets all the criteria required for an efficient reverse genetic system, differs from closest relatives by a significantly higher rate of synonymous mutations in these synthetic-looking recognitions sites, and has a synthetic fingerprint unlikely to have evolved from its close relatives. We report a high likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated as an infectious clone assembled in vitro.\n\nLay SummaryTo construct synthetic variants of natural coronaviruses in the lab, researchers often use a method called in vitro genome assembly. This method utilizes special enzymes called restriction enzymes to generate DNA building blocks that then can be \"stitched\" together in the correct order of the viral genome. To make a virus in the lab, researchers usually engineer the viral genome to add and remove stitching sites, called restriction sites. The ways researchers modify these sites can serve as fingerprints of in vitro genome assembly.\n\nWe found that SARS-CoV has the restriction site fingerprint that is typical for synthetic viruses. The synthetic fingerprint of SARS-CoV-2 is anomalous in wild coronaviruses, and common in lab-assembled viruses. The type of mutations (synonymous or silent mutations) that differentiate the restriction sites in SARS-CoV-2 are characteristic of engineering, and the concentration of these silent mutations in the restriction sites is extremely unlikely to have arisen by random evolution. Both the restriction site fingerprint and the pattern of mutations generating them are extremely unlikely in wild coronaviruses and nearly universal in synthetic viruses. Our findings strongly suggest a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV2.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict and understand the complex molecular motions occurring over diverse timescales ranging from picoseconds to seconds and even hours occurring in biological systems remains one of the largest challenges to chemical theory. Markov State Models (MSMs), which provide a memoryless description of the transitions between different states of a biochemical system, have provided numerous important physically transparent insights into biological function. However, constructing these models often necessitates performing extremely long molecular simulations to converge the rates. Here we show that by incorporating memory via the time-convolutionless generalized master equation (TCL-GME) one can build a theoretically transparent and physically intuitive memory-enriched model of biochemical processes with up to a three orders of magnitude reduction in the simulation data required while also providing a higher temporal resolution. We derive the conditions under which the TCL-GME provides a more efficient means to capture slow dynamics than MSMs and rigorously prove when the two provide equally valid and efficient descriptions of the slow configurational dynamics. We further introduce a simple averaging procedure that enables our TCL-GME approach to quickly converge and accurately predict long-time dynamics even when parameterized with noisy reference data arising from short trajectories. We illustrate the advantages of the TCL-GME using alanine dipeptide, the human argonaute complex, and FiP35 WW domain.",

    "abstract": "Vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases) are rotary proton pumps that acidify specific intracellular compartments in almost all eukaryotic cells. These multi-subunit enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V1 region and a membrane-embedded proton-translocating VO region. VO is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and V1 is assembled in the cytosol. However, V1 binds VO only after VO is transported to the Golgi membrane, thereby preventing acidification of the ER. We isolated VO complexes and subcomplexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to V-ATPase assembly factors Vma12p, Vma21p, and Vma22p. Electron cryomicroscopy shows how the Vma12-22p complex recruits subunits a, e, and f to the rotor ring of VO while blocking premature binding of V1. Vma21p, which contains an ER-retrieval motif, binds the VO:Vma12-22p complex,  mature VO, and a complex that appears to contain a ring of loosely-packed rotor subunits and the proteins YAR027W and YAR028W. The structures suggest that Vma21p binds assembly intermediates that contain a rotor ring, and that activation of proton pumping following assembly of V1 with VO removes Vma21p, allowing V-ATPase to remain in the Golgi. Together, these structures show how Vma12-22p and Vma21p function in V-ATPase assembly and quality control, ensuring the enzyme acidifies only its intended cellular targets.",

    "abstract": "Multiple cell types, molecules, and processes contribute to inhibition of anti-tumor effector responses, often frustrating effective immunotherapy. Among these, Foxp3+ CD4+ cells (Tregs) are well-recognized to play an immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment. The first clinically successful checkpoint inhibitor, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, may deplete Tregs at least in part by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), but this effect is unreliable in mice, including in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In contrast, agonistic CD40 antibody, which serves as an effective therapy, is associated with notable Treg disappearance in the PDAC model. The mechanism of CD40-mediated Treg loss is poorly understood, as Tregs are CD40-negative. Here we have explored the mechanistic basis for the loss of Foxp3 T cells upon anti-CD40 treatment and find, using tissue-level multiplex immunostaining and orthogonal dissociated cell analyses, that Tregs are not depleted but converted into interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) producing, Type I CD4+ T effector cells. This process depends on IL-12 and IFN-{gamma} signaling evoked by action of the anti-CD40 antibody on dendritic cells (DCs), especially BATF3-dependent cDC1s. These findings provide insight into a previously unappreciated mechanism of CD40 agonism as a potent anti-tumor intervention that promotes the re-programming of Tregs into tumor-reactive CD4+ effector T cells, markedly augmenting the anti-tumor response.",

    "abstract": "Cells sense physical cues, such as changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, and translate these stimuli into biochemical signals that control various aspects of cellular behavior, thereby facilitating physiological and pathological processes in various organs. Evidence from multiple studies suggests that the anterior vaginal wall stiffness is higher in POP patients than in non-POP patients. Our experiments found that the expression of -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) in the anterior vaginal wall of patients with POP was increased, and the expression of DNMT1 was decreased. We used polyacrylamide gel to simulate matrix stiffening in vitro, and substrate stiffening induced the high expression of myofibroblast markers -SMA and CTGF in L929 cells. Inhibition of DNMT1 promotes fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts in vitro. The results of bioinformatics analysis showed that the expression of DNMT1 was significantly correlated with microtubule polymerization-related proteins. The experiment showed that the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole could eliminate the decrease of DNMT1 expression in fibroblasts induced by high stiffness. We conclude that fibroblasts sense an increase in the stiffness of the surrounding matrix and regulate fibroblast differentiation by regulating the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) through the regulation of microtubule polymerization. This study may help to elucidate the complex crosstalk between vaginal fibroblasts and their surrounding matrix in both healthy and pathological conditions, and provide new insights into the implications of potentially targeted phenotypic regulation mechanisms in material-related therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Expanding beta cell mass is a critical goal in the fight against diabetes. CDK4, an extensively characterized cell cycle activator, is required to establish and maintain beta cell number. Beta cell failure in the IRS2-deletion mouse type 2 diabetes model is in part due to loss of CDK4 regulator Cyclin D2. We set out to determine whether replacement of endogenous CDK4 with the inhibitor-resistant mutant CDK4-R24C rescued the loss of beta cell mass in Irs2-deficient mice. Surprisingly, not only beta cell mass but also beta cell dedifferentiation status was effectively rescued, despite no improvement in insulin sensitivity. Ex vivo studies in primary islet cells revealed a novel mechanism in which CDK4 intervened downstream in the insulin signaling pathway to prevent FOXO1-mediated transcriptional repression of critical beta cell transcription factor Pdx1. FOXO1 inhibition was not related to E2F1 activity, to FOXO1 phosphorylation, or even to FOXO1 subcellular localization, but rather was related to deacetylation of FOXO1 and reduced FOXO1 abundance. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel differentiation-promoting activity of the classical cell cycle activator CDK4 and support the concept that beta cell mass can be expanded without compromising function.",

However, studies in recent decades have provided new perspectives on the physiological roles of L-lactate as a major energy substrate and a signaling molecule. To enable further investigations of the physiological roles of L-lactate, we have developed a series of high-performance ({Delta}F/F = 15 to 30 in vitro), intensiometric, genetically-encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based intracellular L-lactate biosensors with a range of affinities. We evaluated the performance of these biosensors by in vitro and live-cell characterization and demonstrated the utility with imaging applications in several cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Local mechanical tissue properties are a critical regulator of cell function in the central nervous system (CNS) during development and disorder. However, we still dont fully understand how the mechanical properties of individual tissue constituents, such as cell nuclei or myelin, determine tissue mechanics. Here we developed a model predicting local tissue mechanics, which induces non-affine deformations of the tissue components. Using the mouse hippocampus and cerebellum as model systems, we show that considering individual tissue components alone, as identified by immunohistochemistry, is not sufficient to reproduce the local mechanical properties of CNS tissue. Our results suggest that brain tissue shows a universal response to applied forces that depends not only on the amount and stiffness of the individual tissue constituents but also on the way how they assemble. Our model may unify current incongruences between the mechanics of soft biological tissues and the underlying constituents and facilitate the design of better biomedical materials and engineered tissues. To this end, we provide a freely-available platform to predict local tissue elasticity upon providing immunohistochemistry images and stiffness values for the constituents of the tissue.",

Here we report a strategy for the fully automated reconstruction of densely labelled neuronal circuits. Firstly, we established stochastic \"super-multicolour\" labelling with up to seven different fluorescent proteins using the Tetbow method. With this method, each neuron was labelled with a unique combination of fluorescent proteins, which were then imaged and separated by linear unmixing. We also established an automated neurite reconstruction pipeline based on the quantitative analysis of multiple dyes (QDyeFinder). To classify colour combinations, we used a newly developed unsupervised clustering algorithm, dCrawler, in which data points in multi-dimensional space were clustered based on a given threshold distance. Our new strategy allows for the reconstruction of neurites for up to hundreds of neurons at a millimetre scale without manual tracing.",

    "abstract": "Philippine native pigs (PhNP) are small black pigs domesticated in rural communities in the Philippines. They are valued locally for their various sociocultural roles. Recently, considerable literature has accumulated in the field of native pig production and marketing. However, there is limited research on the genetic diversity of PhNP. No previous study has investigated the evolutionary relatedness among native pigs from various islands and provinces in Luzon and Visayas, Philippines. In addition, a much-debated question is whether the PhNP were interbreeding with or even domesticated from endemic wild pigs. This study aims to clarify some of the uncertainties surrounding the identity and classification of PhNP based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) signatures. Native pig samples (n=157) were collected from 10 provinces in Luzon and the Visayas, Philippines. Approximately 650 base pairs of the mtDNA d-loop control region were sequenced and analyzed together with publicly available sequences. Pairwise-distance analysis showed genetic separation of North and South Luzon (SL) and the clustering of SL with Visayan pigs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PhNP clustered within 3 recognized Asian pig domestication centers: D2 (East Asia), D7 (Southeast Asia) and the Cordillera clade (sister to the Lanyu). We identified 19 haplotypes (1-38 samples each), forming 4 haplogroups i.e. North Luzon, South Luzon and Visayas, Asian mix and the Cordillera cluster. No endemic wild pig mtDNA was detected in the native pig population, but the use of wild pig for interspecific hybridization was observed. This study showed that the Philippine native pigs have ancestral origin from at least 3 Sus scrofa lineage and that they were not domesticated from the endemic wild pigs of the Philippines.",

The integrated device includes a range of innovations from a sample interface, to the integration of blisters on a laser engraved surface and a large volume (130 L) one-stroke manual pump which could be useful in other low-cost microfluidic-based point-of-care devices. The adaptability of the acoustic mixer is demonstrated on highly viscous fluids, including whole blood, with up to 65% percent volume fraction of red blood cells. Used in conjunction with a lysis buffer, the micromixer unit is also shown to lyse a finger-prick (20 L) blood sample in 30 seconds and benchmarked across ten donor samples. Finally, we demonstrate the ease of use of the fully integrated device. Cheap, modular, but reliable, finger-actuated microfluidic functions could open up opportunities for the development of diagnostics with minimal resources.",

Secondary structure (2D) information is the standard prerequisite for most RNA 3D modeling. Despite several 2D and 3D structure prediction tools proposed in recent years, one of the challenges is to choose the best combination for accurate RNA 3D structure prediction. Here, we benchmarked seven small RNA PDB structures (40 to 90 nucleotides) with different topologies to understand the effects of different 2D structure predictions on the accuracy of 3D modeling. The current study explores the blind challenge of 2D to 3D conversions and highlights the performances of de novo RNA 3D modeling from their predicted 2D structure constraints. Our results show that conformational sampling-based methods such as SimRNA and IsRNA1 depend less on 2D accuracy, whereas motif-based methods account for 2D evidence. Our observations illustrate the disparities in available 3D and 2D prediction methods and may further offer insights into developing topology-specific or family-specific RNA structure prediction pipelines.",

Based on the identified templates, we further enhanced state-of-the-art modelling method and explored protein folding pathways based on the residue frequency distribution of homologs and the secondary structure. The results show that the average accuracy of templates identified by PAthreader is 11.6% higher than those of HHsearch on 551 nonredundant proteins. In terms of structure modelling, PAthreader improves the performance of AlphaFold2 and ranks first in CAMEO blind test for the last three months. Furthermore, we explored protein folding pathways for 37 proteins. The results are almost consistent with biological experiments for 7 proteins, and the remaining 30 human proteins have yet to be verified by biological experiments, revealing that folding information can be exploited from remote homologous structures.",

Sketches are building blocks for large-scale analyses that consider similarities between many pairs of sequences or sequence collections. While existing tools can easily compare 10,000s of genomes, relevant datasets can reach millions of sequences and beyond. Popular tools also fail to consider k-mer multiplicities, making them less applicable in quantitative settings. We describe a method called Dashing 2 that builds on the SetSketch data structure. SetSketch is related to HyperLogLog, but discards use of leading zero count in favor of a truncated logarithm of adjustable base. Unlike HLL, SetSketch can perform multiplicity-aware sketching when combined with the ProbMinHash method. Dashing 2 integrates locality-sensitive hashing to scale all-pairs comparisons to millions of sequences. Dashing 2 is free, open source software available at https://github.com/dnbaker/dashing2",

    "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized rare disease diagnosis, resulting in an increasing volume of available genomic data. Despite this wealth of information and improved procedures to combine data from various sources, identifying the pathogenic causal variants and distinguishing between severe and benign variants remains a key challenge. Mutations in the Kv7.2 voltage-gated potassium channel gene (KCNQ2) have been linked to different subtypes of epilepsies, such as benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE). To date, there is a wide variety of genome-wide computational tools aiming at predicting the pathogenicity of variants. However, previous reports suggest that these genome-wide tools have limited applicability to the KCNQ2 gene related diseases due to overestimation of deleterious mutations and failure to correctly identify benign variants, being, therefore, of limited use in clinical practice. In this work, we found that combining readily available features, such as AlphaFold structural information, Missense Tolerance Ratio (MTR) and other commonly used protein descriptors, provides foundations to build reliable gene-specific machine learning ensemble models. Here, we present a transferable methodology able to accurately predict the pathogenicity of KCNQ2 missense variants with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity scores above 90%.",

    "abstract": "Predictive biomarkers of functional or biological age are key for evaluating interventions aimed at increasing healthspan and, perhaps, lifespan in humans. Currently, cardiovascular performance, blood analytes, frailty indices, and DNA methylation clocks are used to provide such estimates; each technique has its own strength and limitations. We have developed a novel approach, microscopic imaging of epigenetic age (miEpiAge), which computes multiparametric signatures based on the patterns of epigenetic landscape in single nuclei. We demonstrated that such epigenetic age (EpiAge) readouts robustly distinguish young and old cells from multiple tissues and observed the emergency of epigenetic trajectories of aging using different embeddings of peripheral blood (e.g. CD3+ T cells) without linear regression or averaging. EpiAge readouts based on H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 revealed distinct progression of epigenetic age in different tissues, while brain and heart were correlated (Spearman r=0.8, p=0.015), and suggested an overall slower pace of epigenetic changes in brain and kidney. Further, EpiAge readouts were consistent with expected acceleration or slowdown of biological age in chronologically identical mice treated with chemotherapy or following caloric restriction regimen, respectively. Critically, we demonstrated that miEpiAge readouts from mouse skeletal muscles correlate (Pearson r=0.92, p=5e-8) with linear combinations of circadian rhythms dependent whole organism metabolic and behavioral readouts recorded from the same mice. Because EpiAge readouts are derived from individual sample measurements without averaging or regression on chronological age, EpiAge represents a personalized biomarker. We posit that miEpiAge provides first in class approach to assess functional age in a variety of organs and tissues offering a rich collection of universal personalized biomarkers of functional age with a single cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of neural network connectivity is a central focus of neuroscience. The ability to use neuronal connection information to predict activity at single unit resolution and decipher its effect on whole systems can provide critical information about behavior and cognitive processing. Neuronal sensing modalities come in varying forms, but there is yet to exist a modality that can deliver readouts that sufficiently address the spatiotemporal constraints of biological nervous systems. This necessitates supplementary approaches that rely on mathematical models to mitigate physical limitations and decode network features. Here, we introduce a simple proof-of-concept model that addresses temporal constraints by reconstructing presynaptic connections from temporally blurry data. We use a variation of the perceptron algorithm to process firing rate information at multiple time constraints for a heterogenous feed-forward network of excitatory, inhibitory, and unconnected presynaptic units. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm under these conditions and determine the optimal learning rate, firing rate, and the ability to reconstruct single unit spikes for a given degree of temporal blur. We then test our method on a physiologically relevant configuration by sampling network subpopulations of leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal models displaying bursting firing patterns and find comparable learning rates for optimized reconstruction of network connectivity. Our method provides a recipe for reverse engineering neural networks based on limited data quality that can be extended to more complicated readouts and connectivity distributions relevant to multiple brain circuits.",

    "abstract": "In nature, entangled webs of predator-prey interactions constitute the backbones of ecosystems. Uncovering the network architecture of such trophic interactions has been recognized as the essential step for exploring species with great impacts on ecosystem-level phenomena and functions. However, it has remained a major challenge to reveal how species-rich networks of predator-prey interactions are continually reshaped though time in the wild. We here show that dynamics of species-rich predator-prey interactions can be characterized by remarkable network structural changes and alternations of potential keystone species. Based on high-throughput detection of prey DNA from 1,556 spider individuals collected in a grassland ecosystem, we reconstructed dynamics of interaction networks involving, in total, 50 spider species and 974 prey species/strains through eight months. The networks were compartmentalized into modules (groups) of closely interacting predators and prey in some but not all months. As the modules differed in detritus/grazing food chain properties, complex fission-fusion dynamics of below-ground and above-ground energy channels was reconstructed across the seasons. The substantial shifts of network structure entailed alternations of spider species located at the core positions within the entangled webs of interactions. These results indicate that knowledge of dynamically shifting food webs is essential for understanding the temporally-varying roles of keystone species that interlink multiple energy channels.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several variants of concern (VOC) have been identified, many of which share recurrent mutations in the spike proteins receptor binding domain (RBD). This region coincides with known epitopes and can therefore have an impact on immune escape. Protracted infections in immunosuppressed patients have been hypothesized to lead to an enrichment of such mutations and therefore drive evolution towards VOCs. Here, we show that immunosuppressed patients with hematologic cancers develop distinct populations with immune escape mutations throughout the course of their infection. Notably, by investigating the co-occurrence of substitutions on individual sequencing reads in the RBD, we found quasispecies harboring mutations that confer resistance to known monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as S:E484K and S:E484A. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for a viral reservoir based on intra-host phylogenetics. Our results on viral reservoirs can shed light on protracted infections interspersed with periods where the virus is undetectable as well as an alternative explanation for some long-COVID cases. Our findings also highlight that protracted infections should be treated with combination therapies rather than by a single mAbs to clear pre-existing resistant mutations.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the efficacy of hybrid SARS-COV-2 vaccines using wild-type nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) protein. We upgraded this strategy one step further using clinically proven spike protein by considering the delta and post-delta omicron variant of concern (VOC) mutations and nucleocapsid peptides conferring T-cell immunity. Nucleocapsid peptides are considered much better immunological replacement of nucleocapsid proteins. Hence, peptide linking strategy is applied which is more economic for cellular biosynthesis than whole proteins. An envelope peptide with potent T-cell immune response is also selected. All these peptides are clustered in this hybrid spikes designed cytoplasmic region separated by non-immunogenic helical linkers. The resulting domain is more folded in the construct devoid of transmembrane domain after AlphaFold analysis. Alongside, we also propose the idea of introduction of any T-cell peptide like other Human Corona Viruses (HuCoV) in these linker regions whenever required. In addition to SARS-COV-2, the same approach can be applied for any emergency or even long-term unsolved outbreaks of Influenza, Dengue and West Nile Virus etc. In this era of novelty as presented by subunit and nucleic acid vaccines, multiepitope strategies like this can help to combat multiple diseases successfully in real time to give hope for better future.",

Integration of knowledge concerning their genetic, protein as well as functional and conservational aspects is necessary for an exhaustive assessment of their relevance and for prioritization of further clinical and functional studies investigating their role in human disease. In order to collect the necessary information, a multitude of different databases has to be accessed and data extraction from the original sources commonly is not user-friendly and requires advanced bioinformatics skills.

In contrast to existing online platforms for compilation of variant data, aRgus complements visualization of chromosomal exon-intron structure and protein domain annotation with ClinVar and gnomAD variant distributions as well as position-specific variant effect prediction score modeling. aRgus thereby enables timely assessment of protein regions vulnerable to variation with single amino acid resolution and provides numerous applications in variant and protein domain interpretation as well as in the design of in vitro experiments.",

    "abstract": "Protein Language Models (PLMs) are shown capable of learning sequence representations useful for various prediction tasks, from subcellular localization, evolutionary relationships, family membership, and more. They have yet to be demonstrated useful for protein function prediction. In particular, the problem of automatic annotation of proteins under the Gene Ontology (GO) framework remains open. This paper makes two key contributions. It debuts a novel method that leverages the transformer architecture in two ways. A sequence transformer encodes protein sequences in a task-agnostic feature space. A graph transformer learns a representation of GO terms while respecting their hierarchical relationships. The learned sequence and GO terms representations are combined and utilized for multi-label classification, with the labels corresponding to GO terms. The method is shown superior over recent representative GO prediction methods. The second major contribution in this paper is a deep investigation of different ways of constructing training and testing datasets. The paper shows that existing approaches under- or over-estimate the generalization power of a model. A novel approach is proposed to address these issues, resulting a new benchmark dataset to rigorously evaluate and compare methods and advance the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD), a neuro-degenerative disorder, is often detected by onset of its motor symptoms such as rest tremor. Unfortunately, motor symptoms appear only when approximately 40%-60% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. In most cases, by the time PD is clinically diagnosed, the disease may already have started 4 to 6 years beforehand. So there is a need for developing a test for detecting PD before the onset of the motor symptoms. This phase of PD is referred to as Presymptomatic PD (PPD). The motor symptoms of Parkinsons Disease are manifestations of instability in the sensorimotor system that develops gradually due to the neuro-degenerative process. In this paper, based on the above insight, we propose a new method that can potentially be used to detect degradation of motor control stability which can be employed for the detection of PPD. The proposed method tracks the tendency of a feedback control system to transition to an unstable state, and uses machine learning algorithm for its robust detection. This method is explored using simulations of a simple pendulum with PID controller as a conceptual representation for both healthy and PPD individuals. We also propose an example task with physiological measurements that can be used with this method and potentially be employed in a clinical setting. We present representative data collected through such a task, thereby demonstrating the feasibility to generate data for the proposed method.\n\nAuthor summaryParkinsons disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative disorder that develops and progresses over several years. Currently, one is able to diagnose PD only after the appearance of motor symptoms (symptoms in movements of body parts), which unfortunately may be 4 to 6 years after the neuro-degeneration may have started. It has been shown that there are benefits to diagnosing PD at early stages, motivating the need to explore tools for diagnosing PD in the pre-symptomatic stage referred to as Presymptomatic Parkinsons disease (PPD). In this paper, a novel approach is explored that utilises the insight that the motor symptoms in PD may be seen as an instability in the feedback-control system that controls movements of body parts (sensory-motor loop). The proposed method uses a series of simple movement tasks performed by an individual in a clinic as the input to detect any gradual degradation of movement control that is leading to an instability, but before the instability and consequently the symptoms are manifested. This method is tested through extensive simulations and a potential experimental realisation with preliminary data. While a full-fledged validation will be undertaken as part of future work, initial results show promise and feasibility of further data collection.",

Here we report how the recently discovered FAAH-OUT lncRNA-encoding gene, which was found from studying a pain insensitive patient with reduced anxiety and fast wound healing, regulates the adjacent key endocannabinoid system gene FAAH, which encodes the anandamide-degrading fatty acid amide hydrolase enzyme. We demonstrate that the disruption in FAAH-OUT lncRNA transcription leads to DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation within the FAAH promoter. In addition, FAAH-OUT contains a conserved regulatory element, FAAH-AMP, that acts as an enhancer for FAAH expression. Furthermore, using transcriptomic analyses we have uncovered a network of genes that are dysregulated from disruption of the FAAH-FAAH-OUT axis, thus providing a coherent mechanistic basis to understand the human phenotype observed and a platform for development of future gene and small molecule therapies.",

    "abstract": "Emerging variants of concern (VOCs) are threatening to limit the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and vaccines currently used in clinical practice; broadly neutralizing antibodies and strategies for their identification are therefore urgently required. Here we demonstrate that broadly neutralizing antibodies can be isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of convalescent patients using SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains (RBDs) carrying epitope-specific mutations. This is exemplified by two human antibodies, GAR05, binding to epitope class 1, and GAR12, binding to a new epitope class 6 (located between class 3 and class 5). Both antibodies broadly neutralize VOCs, exceeding the potency of the clinical monoclonal sotrovimab (mAb S309) by orders of magnitude. They also provide potent prophylactic and therapeutic in vivo protection of hACE2 mice against viral challenge. Our results indicate that exposure to Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 induces antibodies that maintain potent and broad neutralization against emerging VOCs using two unique strategies: either by targeting the divergent class 1 epitope in a manner resistant to VOCs (ACE2 mimicry, as illustrated by GAR05 and mAbs P2C-1F11/S2K14); or alternatively, by targeting rare and highly conserved epitopes, such as the new class 6 epitope identified here (as illustrated by GAR12).

    "abstract": "Biofilms are the leading cause of nosocomial infections, and are hard to eradicate due to their inherent antimicrobial resistance. Candida albicans is the leading cause of nosocomial fungal infections, and is frequently co-isolated with the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa from biofilms in the Cystic Fibrosis lung and severe burn wounds. The presence of C. albicans in multi-species biofilms is associated with enhanced antibacterial resistance, which is largely mediated through fungal extracellular carbohydrates sequestering the antibiotics. However, significantly less is known regarding the impact of polymicrobial biofilms on antifungal resistance. Here we show that, in dual species biofilms, P. aeruginosa enhances the sensitivity of C. albicans to amphotericin B, an effect that was biofilm specific. Transcriptional analysis combined with gene ontology enrichment analysis identified several C. albicans processes associated with oxidative stress to be differentially regulated in dual species biofilms, suggesting that P. aeruginosa exerts oxidative stress on C. albicans, likely through the actions of secreted phenazines. However, the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2 was significantly downregulated in the presence of P. aeruginosa. Monospecies biofilms of the sod2{Delta} mutant were more susceptible to amphotericin B, and the susceptibility of these biofilms was further enhanced by the addition of exogenous phenazines. Therefore, we propose that in dual species biofilms, P. aeruginosa simultaneously induces mitochondrial oxidative stress, whilst downregulating key detoxification enzymes, which prevent C. albicans mounting an appropriate oxidative stress response to amphotericin B, leading to fungal cell death. This work highlights the importance of understanding the impact of polymicrobial interactions on antimicrobial susceptibility.\n\nImportanceBiofilms are aggregates of cells encased in an extracellular matrix, and are responsible for the majority of infections in hospitals. The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans are frequently co-isolated from biofilms in the Cystic Fibrosis lung, and in burn wounds.

Overall, C. difficile was found in 90.5% (114/126) of raw sewage influent, 48.1% (50/104) of treated effluent, 40% (2/5) of reclaimed irrigation water, 100% (38/38) of untreated biosolids, 95.2% (20/21) of anaerobically digested biosolids and 72.7% (8/11) of lime-amended biosolids. Over half the isolates (55.3%, 157/284) were toxigenic and 97 C. difficile ribotypes (RTs) were identified with RT014/020 the most common (14.8%, 42/284). Thirteen C. difficile isolates with the toxin profile A+B+CDT+ were found, including the hypervirulent RT078 strain. Resistance to the antimicrobials fidaxomicin, vancomycin, metronidazole, rifaximin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, meropenem and moxifloxacin was uncommon, however, resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline was relatively frequent at 56.7% (161/284), 14.4% (41/284) and 13.7% (39/284), respectively. This study revealed that toxigenic C. difficile was commonly encountered in WWTPs and being released into the environment. This raises concern about the possible spill-over of C. difficile into animal and/or human populations via land receiving the treated waste. In Western Australia, stringent measures are in place to mitigate the health and environmental risk of recycling human waste, however, further studies are needed to elucidate the public health significance of C. difficile surviving the treatment processes at WWTPs.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of antimicrobial-associated diarrhoea in healthcare facilities. Extended hospital stays and recurrences increase the cost of treatment, and morbidity and mortality. Community-associated CDI (CA-CDI) cases, with no history of antimicrobial use or exposure to healthcare settings, are increasing. The isolation of clinically important C. difficile strains from animals, rivers, soil, meat, vegetables, compost, treated wastewater and biosolids has been reported. The objective of this study was to characterise C. difficile in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Australia. We found that C. difficile can persist through the treatment processes of WWTPs and toxigenic C. difficile was being released into the environment becoming a potential source/reservoir for CA-CDI.",

    "abstract": "SigS is the sole extracytoplasmic function sigma in S. aureus and is necessary for virulence, immune evasion, as well as surviving exposure to toxic chemicals and environmental stressors. Despite the contribution of SigS to a myriad of critical phenotypes, the downstream effectors of the SigS-dependent S. aureus pathogenesis, immune evasion, and stress response remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the S. aureus transcriptome following transient over-expression of SigS. We identified a bi-cistronic transcript, up-regulated by 1000-fold, containing two mid-sized genes each containing single domains of unknown function (DUF). We renamed these genes sroA (SigS regulated orfA) and sroB (SigS regulated orfB). We demonstrated that the SigS regulation of the sroAB operon is direct using in vitro transcription analysis. Using northern blot analysis, we also demonstrated that SroA and SroB have opposing auto- regulatory functions on the transcriptional architecture of the sigS locus; with SroA stimulated SigS mRNA levels and SroB stimulating s750 (SigS antisense) levels. We hypothesized that these this opposing regulatory effects were due to a direct interaction. We demonstrated an interaction between SroA and SroB using an in-vivo surrogate genetics approach via Bacterial Two Hybrid. We demonstrated that the SroA effect on SigS is at the post-transcriptional level of mRNA stability, highlighting a mechanism likely used by S. aureus to tightly control SigS levels. Finally, we demonstrate that the sroAB locus promotes virulence in a female murine pneumonia model of infection.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a Gram- positive encapsulated bacterium that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of 30-50% of humans. GBS causes invasive infection during pregnancy that can lead to chorioamnionitis, funisitis, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal and fetal demise. Upon infecting the host, GBS encounters sentinel innate immune cells, such as macrophages, within reproductive tissues. Once phagocytosed by macrophages, GBS upregulates expression of the gene, npx, which encodes a NADH peroxidase. GBS mutants with a npx deletion ({Delta}npx) are exquisitely sensitive to reactive oxygen stress. Furthermore, we have shown that npx is required for GBS survival in both THP-1 and placental macrophages. In an in vivo murine model of ascending GBS vaginal infection during pregnancy, npx is required for invasion of reproductive tissues and is critical for inducing disease progression including PPROM and preterm birth. Reproductive tissue cytokine production was also significantly diminished in {Delta}npx infected animals compared to those infected with wild type (WT)-GBS. Complementation in trans reversed this phenotype, indicating npx is critical for GBS survival and initiation of proinflammatory signaling in the gravid host.",

    "abstract": "Controversial reports have suggested that SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins may be viroporins that conduct currents through the plasma membrane of the infected cells. If true, these proteins would represent accessible targets for the development of new antiviral drugs by using high-throughput patch-clamp techniques. Here we aimed at better characterizing the cell responses induced by E or 3a protein with a particular focus on the ion conductances measured at the cell surface. First, we show that expression of SARS-CoV-2 E or 3a protein in CHO cells gives rise to cells with newly-acquired round shape, tending to detach from the Petri dish. This suggests that cell death is induced upon expression of E or 3a protein. We confirmed this hypothesis by using flow cytometry, in agreement with earlier reports on other cell types. In adhering cells expressing E or 3a protein, whole-cell currents were in fact not different from the control condition indicating that E and 3a proteins are not plasma membrane viroporins. In contrast, recording currents on detached cells uncovered outwardly-rectifying currents, much larger than those observed in control. The current characteristics are reminiscent of what was previously observed in cells expressing SARS-CoV-1 E or 3a proteins. Herein, we illustrate for the first time that carbenoxolone blocks these outward currents suggesting that they are conducted by pannexin channels, mostly likely activated by cell morphology change and/or cell death. Alongside we also demonstrate that truncation of the C-terminal PDZ binding motifs reduces the proportion of dying cells but does not prevent pannexin currents suggesting distinct pathways for cell death and pannexin currents induced by E and 3a proteins. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 E and 3a proteins are not acting as viroporins expressed at the plasma membrane.\n\nAuthor SummaryA viroporin (or viral porin) is a class of proteins that is encoded by a virus genome. It is named porin because its biological role is to conduct ions through a pore that it created in a lipid membrane such as the one surrounding a human cell. if such viroporin is present at the external membrane of a human cell infected by a virus, it can be an easy target of an antiviral agent which thus does not have to enter the cell to be active. One example of viroporin is the flu M2 protein that is the target of amantadine, an antiviral agent used against flu. In previous studies, two proteins of SARS-CoV viruses, named E protein and 3a protein, have been suggested to be viroporins at the surface of infected human cells, potentially opening a new research avenue against SARS. Here we demonstrate that both proteins are not viroporins at the external membrane but they rather trigger changes in the cell shape and promote cell death. They only indirectly induce the activity of a porin that is encoded by the cell genome, named pannexin.",

We find that transformed cells preferentially undergo EMT in hypoxic tumor regions in multiple model systems and that hypoxia drives a cell-autonomous EMT in PDAC cells which, unlike EMT in response to growth factors, can last for weeks. We further demonstrate that hypoxia reduces histone demethylase KDM2A activity, suppresses PP2 family phosphatase expression, and activates MAPKs to post-translationally stabilize histone methyltransferase NSD2, leading to an H3K36me2-dependent EMT in which hypoxia-inducible factors play only a supporting role. This mechanism can be antagonized in vivo by combinations of MAPK inhibitors that may be effective in multi-drug therapies designed to target EMT.",

    "abstract": "Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are bona fide precursor lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The most common subtype of IPMNs harbor a gastric foveolar-type epithelium, and these low-grade mucinous neoplasms are harbingers of IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia and cancer. The molecular underpinning of gastric differentiation in IPMNs is unknown, although identifying drivers of this indolent phenotype might enable opportunities for intercepting progression to high-grade IPMN and cancer. We conducted spatial transcriptomics on a cohort of IPMNs, followed by orthogonal and cross species validation studies, which established the transcription factor NKX6-2 as a key determinant of gastric cell identity in low-grade IPMNs. Loss of NKX6-2 expression is a consistent feature of IPMN progression, while re-expression of NKX6-2 in murine IPMN lines recapitulates the aforementioned gastric transcriptional program and glandular morphology. Our study identifies NKX6-2 as a previously unknown transcription factor driving indolent gastric differentiation in IPMN pathogenesis.\n\nSignificanceImproved understanding of the molecular features driving IPMN development and differentiation is critical to prevent cancer progression and enhance risk stratification. Our study employed spatial profiling technologies to characterize the epithelium and microenvironment of IPMN, which revealed a previously unknown link between NKX6-2 expression and gastric differentiation in IPMNs, the latter associated with an indolent biological potential.",

    "abstract": "Nanowires have substantial potential as the sensor component in electronic sensing devices. However, surface functionalization of traditional nanowire and nanotube materials with short peptides that increase sensor selectivity and sensitivity requires complex chemistries with toxic reagents. In contrast, microorganisms can assemble pilin monomers into protein nanowires with intrinsic conductivity from renewable feedstocks, yielding an electronic material that is robust and stable in applications, but also biodegradable. Here we report that the sensitivity and selectivity of protein nanowire-based sensors can be modified with a simple plug and play genetic approach in which a short peptide sequence, designed to bind the analyte of interest, is incorporated into the pilin protein that is microbially assembled into nanowires. We employed a scalable Escherichia coli chassis to fabricate protein nanowires that displayed either a peptide previously demonstrated to effectively bind ammonia, or a peptide known to bind acetic acid. Sensors comprised of thin films of the nanowires amended with the ammonia-specific peptide had a ca. 100-fold greater response to ammonia than sensors made with unmodified protein nanowires. Protein nanowires with the peptide that binds acetic acid yielded a 4-fold higher response than nanowires without the peptide. The results demonstrate that protein nanowires with enhanced sensor response for analytes of interest can be fabricated with a flexible genetic strategy that sustainably eliminates the energy, environmental, and health concerns associated with other common nanomaterials.",

However, it is known that messenger RNA (mRNA), which dominates Nanopore direct RNA (dRNA) sequencing libraries, contains specific nucleotide patterns that are implicitly encoded in the Nanopore signals since RNA is always sequenced from the 3 to 5 direction. In this study we present an approach to exploit the sequence biases in mRNA as an additional input to dRNA basecalling. We developed a probabilistic model of mRNA language and propose a modified CTC beam search decoding algorithm to conditionally incorporate the language model during basecalling. Our findings demonstrate that inclusion of mRNA language is able to guide CTC beam search decoding towards the more probable nucleotide sequence. We also propose a time efficient approach to decoding variable length nanopore signals.

    "abstract": "Marine algae are diverse photosynthetic organisms, profoundly rich in bioactive compounds. Temperature is a major factor in algal cultivation and biomass production. At the cellular level, the change of temperature is reflected in oscillating algal lipid/fatty acid profile and inhibition of photosynthetic activities. The function of thylakoid membrane system is intimately dependent on its lipid matrix, however the molecular organization of these lipid membranes and particularly their adaptive arrangements under temperature stress remain largely unexplored. The present work employing extensive atomistic simulations provides the first atomistic view of the phase transition and domain coexistence in model membrane composed of thylakoid lipids of a marine alga, between 10-40 {degrees}C. The model membrane undergoes a transition from a gel-like phase at 10-15 {degrees}C to a homogeneous liquid-disordered phase at 40 {degrees}C. Clear evidences of spontaneous phase separation into coexisting nanoscale domains are detected at intermediate temperatures. Particularly at 25-30 {degrees}C, we identified the formation of a stable rippled phase, where the gel-like domains rich in saturated and nearly hexagonally packed lipids separated from fluid-like domains enriched in lipids containing polyunsaturated chains. Cholesterol impairs the phase transition and the emergence of domains, and induces a fairly uniform liquid-ordered phase in the membrane over the temperatures studied. The results have implications in understanding the role of lipids in temperature adaptation in algal.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by an unfavorable prognosis for patients affected. During standard-of-care chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ), tumors acquire resistance thereby causing tumor recurrence. Thus, deciphering essential molecular pathways causing TMZ resistance are of high therapeutic relevance.\n\nMethodsMass spectrometry based proteomics were used to study the GBM proteome. Immunohistochemistry staining of human GBM tissue for either calpain-1 or -2 was performed to locate expression of proteases. In vitro cell based assays were used to measure cell viability and survival of primary patient-derived GBM cells and established GBM cell lines after TMZ +/- calpain inhibitor administration. shRNA expression knockdowns of either calpain-1 or calpain-2 were generated to study TMZ sensitivity of the specific subunits. The Comet assay and {gamma}H2AX signal measurements were performed in order to assess the DNA damage amount and recognition. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR of target proteins was applied to differentiate between transcriptional and post-translational regulation.\n\nResultsCalcium-dependent calpain proteases, in particular calpain-2, are more abundant in glioblastoma compared to normal brain and increased in patient-matched initial and recurrent glioblastomas. On the cellular level, pharmacological calpain inhibition increased the sensitivities of primary glioblastoma cells towards TMZ. A genetic knockdown of calpain-2 in U251 cells led to increased caspase-3 cleavage and sensitivity to neocarzinostatin, which rapidly induces DNA strand breakage. We hypothesize that calpain-2 causes desensitization of tumor cells against TMZ by preventing strong DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis via post-translational TP53 inhibition. Indeed, proteomic comparison of U251 control vs. U251 calpain-2 knockdown cells highlights perturbed levels of numerous proteins involved in DNA damage response and downstream pathways affecting TP53 and NF-{kappa}B signaling. TP53 showed increased protein abundance, but no transcriptional regulation.\n\nConclusionTMZ-induced cell death in the presence of calpain-2 expression appears to favor DNA repair and promote cell survival. We conclude from our experiments that calpain-2 expression represents a proteomic mode that is associated with higher resistance via \"priming\" GBM cells to TMZ chemotherapy. Thus, calpain-2 could serve as a prognostic factor for GBM outcome.",

In this study, we demonstrated that cold-induced expression of protease inhibitor FmASP in a citrus relative species kumquat (Fortunella margarita (Lour.) Swingle) contributes to its freezing tolerance by regulating protein degradation. First, we found that only cold-acclimated kumquat plants, although with extensive leaf cellular damage during freezing, are able to resume their normal growth upon stress relief. To dissect the impact of cold acclimation on this extraordinary freezing tolerance, we performed protein abundance assay and quantitative proteomics analysis of kumquat leaves subjected to cold acclimation (4 {degrees}C), freezing treatment (-10 {degrees}C) and post-stress recovery (25 {degrees}C). FmASP and a few non-specific proteases were identified as differentially expressed proteins induced by cold acclimation and associated with stable protein abundance throughout the course of freezing treatment. FmASP was further characterized as a robust inhibitor that inhibits the degradation capacity of multiple proteases. In addition, heterogeneous expression of FmASP in Arabidopsis confirmed its positive function in freezing tolerance. Finally, we proposed a working model of FmASP and illustrated how this extracellular-localized protease inhibitor protects proteins from degradation and consequently maintains essential cellular function for freezing stress recovery. These findings revealed the important role of protease inhibition on freezing response and provide insights on how this role may help develop new strategies to enhance plant freezing tolerance.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA protease inhibitor of Fortunella margarita enhances protein stability and freezing tolerance by regulating non-specific protease degradation",

    "abstract": "Improving nitrogen use efficiency is critical to enhancing agricultural productivity and to mitigate environmental pollution. To overcome the fluctuations in soil nitrate concentration, plants have evolved an elaborate nitrate transporting mechanism that switches between high and low affinity. In plants, NRT1.1, a root-associated nitrate transporter, switches its affinity upon phosphorylation at Thr101. However, the molecular basis of this unique functional behavior known as dual-affinity switching remains elusive. Crystal structures of the NRT1.1 nitrate transporter have provided evidence for the two competing hypotheses to explain the origin of dual-affinity switching. It is not known how the interplay between transporter phosphorylation and dimerization regulates the affinity switching. To reconcile the different hypotheses, we have performed extensive simulations of nitrate transporter in conjunction with Markov state models to elucidate the molecular origin for a dual-affinity switching mechanism. Simulations of monomeric transporter reveal that phosphorylation stabilizes the outward-facing state and accelerates dynamical transitions for facilitating transport. On the other hand, phosphorylation of the transporter dimer decouples dynamic motions of dimer into independent monomers and thus facilitates substrate transport. Therefore, the phosphorylation-induced enhancement of substrate transport and dimer decoupling not only reconcile the competing experimental results but also provide an atomistic view of how nitrate transport is regulated in plants.",

    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase demethylates the central cell genome prior to fertilization. This epigenetic reconfiguration of the female gamete companion cell establishes gene imprinting in the endosperm and is essential for seed viability. DME demethylates small and genic-flanking transposons as well as intergenic and heterochromatin sequences, but how DME is recruited to these target loci remains unknown. H1.2 was identified as a DME-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and maternal genome H1 loss affects DNA methylation and expression of selected imprinted genes in the endosperm. Yet, the extent to which how H1 influences DME demethylation and gene imprinting in the Arabidopsis endosperm has not been investigated. Here, we showed that unlike in the vegetative cell, both canonical histone H1 variants are present in the central cell. Our endosperm methylome analysis revealed that without the maternal linker histones, DME-mediated demethylation is facilitated, particularly in the heterochromatin regions, indicating that H1-containing nucleosomes are barriers for DME demethylation. Loss of H1 in the maternal genome has a very limited effect on gene transcription or gene imprinting regulation in the endosperm; however, it variably influences euchromatin TE methylation and causes a slight hypermethylation and a reduced expression in selected imprinted genes. We conclude that loss of maternal H1 indirectly influences DME-mediated demethylation and endosperm DNA methylation landscape but does not appear to affect endosperm gene transcription and overall imprinting regulation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the quality of immune repertoire triggered during natural infection can provide vital clues that form the basis for development of humoral immune response in some individuals capable of broadly neutralizing pan SARS-CoV-2 variants. We assessed the diversity of neutralizing antibody responses developed in an unvaccinated individual infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 by examining the ability of the distinct B cell germline-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in neutralizing known and currently circulating Omicron variants by pseudovirus and authentic virus neutralization assays. The ability of the antibodies developed post vaccination in neutralizing Omicron variants was compared to that obtained at baseline of the same individual and to those obtained from Omicron breakthrough infected individuals by pseudovirus neutralization assay. Broadly SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs representing unique B cell lineages with non-overlapping epitope specificities isolated from a single donor varied in their ability to neutralize Omicron variants. Plasma antibodies developed post vaccination from this individual demonstrated neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4 with increased magnitude and found to be comparable with those obtained from other vaccinated individuals who were infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Development of B cell repertoire capable of producing antibodies with distinct affinity and specificities for the antigen immediately after infection capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies offers highest probability in protecting against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nImportanceDevelopment of robust neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals is known, however varies at population level. We isolated monoclonal antibodies from an individual infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 that not only varied in their B cell lineage origin but also varied in their capability and potency to neutralize all the known VOC and currently circulating Omicron variants. This indicated establishment of unique lineages that contributed in forming B cell repertoire in this particular individual immediately following infection giving rise to diverse antibody responses that could compensate each other in providing broadly neutralizing polyclonal antibody response. Individuals who were able to produce such potent polyclonal antibody responses after infection have a higher chance of being protected from evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

Here we examine the neutralization resistance of these subvariants, as well as their ancestral BA.4/5, BA.2.75 and D614G variants, against sera from 3-dose vaccinated health care workers, hospitalized BA.1-wave patients, and BA.5-wave patients. We found enhanced neutralization resistance in all new subvariants, especially the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants driven by a key N460K mutation, and to a lesser extent, R346T and K444T mutations, as well as the BA.2.75.2 subvariant driven largely by its F486S mutation. The BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants also exhibited enhanced fusogenicity and S processing dictated by the N460K mutation. Interestingly, the BA.2.75.2 subvariant saw an enhancement by the F486S mutation and a reduction by the D1199N mutation to its fusogenicity and S processing, resulting in minimal overall change. Molecular modelling revealed the mechanisms of receptor-binding and non-receptor binding monoclonal antibody-mediated immune evasion by R346T, K444T, F486S and D1199N mutations. Altogether, these findings shed light on the concerning evolution of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are complex assemblages whose dynamics are shaped by abiotic and biotic factors. A major challenge concerns correctly forecasting the community behaviour in the future. In this context, communities in biological wastewater treatment plants (BWWTPs) represent excellent model systems, because forecasting them is required to ultimately control and operate the plants in a sustainable manner. Here, we forecast the microbial community from the water-air interface of the anaerobic tank of a BWWTP via longitudinal meta-omics (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics) data covering 14 months at weekly intervals. We extracted all the available time-dependent information, summarised it in 17 temporal signals (explaining 91.1% of the temporal variance) and linked them over time to rebuild the sequence of ecological phenomena behind the community dynamics. We forecasted the signals over the following five years and tested the predictions with 21 extra samples. We were able to correctly forecast five signals accounting for 22.5% of the time-dependent information in the system and generate mechanistic predictions on the ecological events in the community (e.g. a predation cycle involving bacteria, viruses and amoebas). Through the forecasting of the 17 signals and the environmental variables readings we reconstructed the gene abundance and expression for the following 5 years, showing a nearly perfect trend prediction (coefficient of determination [&ge;] 0.97) for the first 2 years. The study demonstrates the maturity of microbial ecology to forecast composition and gene expression of open microbial ecosystems using year-spanning interactions between community cycles and environmental parameters.",

    "abstract": "The Enterobacteriaceae are a scientifically and medically important clade of bacteria, containing the gut commensal and model organism Escherichia coli, as well as several major human pathogens including multiple serovars of Salmonella enterica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Essential gene sets have been determined for several members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the E. coli Keio single-gene deletion library often regarded as a gold standard for gene essentiality studies. However, it remains unclear how gene essentiality varies between related strains and species. To investigate this, we have assembled a collection of thirteen sequenced high-density transposon mutant libraries from five genera within the Enterobacteriaceae. We first benchmark a number of gene essentiality prediction approaches, investigate the effects of transposon density on essentiality prediction, and identify biases in transposon insertion sequencing data. Based on these investigations we develop a new classifier for gene essentiality. Using this new classifier, we define a core essential genome in the Enterobacteriaceae of 201 universally essential genes, and reconstruct an ancestral essential gene set of 296 genes. Despite the presence of a large cohort of variably essential genes, surprisingly we find an absence of evidence for genus-specific essential genes. A clear example of this sporadic essentiality is given by the set of genes regulating the {sigma}E extracytoplasmic stress response, which appears to have independently become essential multiple times in the Enterobacteriaceae. Finally, we compare our essential gene sets to the natural experiment of gene loss in obligate insect endosymbionts that have emerged from within the Enterobacteriaceae. This isolates a remarkably small set of genes absolutely required for survival, and uncovers several instances of essential stress responses masked by redundancy in free-living bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Gardnerella spp. are associated with bacterial vaginosis, in which normally dominant lactobacilli are replaced with facultative and anaerobic bacteria including Gardnerella spp. Co-occurrence of multiple species of Gardnerella is common in the vagina and competition for nutrients such as glycogen likely contributes to the differential abundances of Gardnerella spp. Glycogen must be digested into smaller components for uptake; a process that depends on the combined action of glycogen degrading enzymes. In this study, the ability of culture supernatants of 15 isolates of Gardnerella spp. to produce glucose, maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose from glycogen was demonstrated. Carbohydrate active enzymes were identified bioinformatically in Gardnerella proteomes using dbCAN2. Identified proteins included a single domain -amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) (encoded by all 15 isolates) and an -amylase-pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41) containing amylase, carbohydrate binding modules and pullulanase domains (14/15 isolates). To verify the sequence-based functional predictions, the amylase and pullulanase domains of the -amylase-pullulanase, and the single domain -amylase were each produced in E. coli. The -amylase domain from the -amylase-pullulanase released maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose from glycogen, and the pullulanase domain released maltotriose from pullulan and maltose from glycogen, demonstrating that the Gardnerella -amylase-pullulanase is capable of hydrolyzing -1,4 and -1,6 glycosidic bonds. Similarly, the single domain -amylase protein also produced maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose from glycogen. Our findings show that Gardnerella spp. produce extracellular amylase enzymes as  public goods that can digest glycogen into maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose that can be used by the vaginal microbiota.\n\nImportanceIncreased abundance of Gardnerella spp. is a diagnostic characteristic of bacterial vaginosis, an imbalance in the human vaginal microbiome associated with troubling symptoms, and negative reproductive health outcomes, including increased transmission of sexually transmitted infections and preterm birth. Competition for nutrients is likely an important factor in causing dramatic shifts in the vaginal microbial community but little is known about the contribution of bacterial enzymes to the metabolism of glycogen, a major food source available to vaginal bacteria. The significance of our research is characterizing the activity of enzymes conserved in Gardnerella species that contribute to the ability of these bacteria to utilize glycogen.",

However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has shown that blocking viral transmission is an important attribute of efficient vaccines. Here, we investigated if recombinant influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) vaccines delivered at a mucosal site could protect from onward transmission of influenza B viruses in the guinea pig model. We tested four different scenarios in which sequential transmission was investigated in chains of four guinea pigs. The variables tested included a low and a high viral inoculum (104 vs 105 plaque forming units) in the initial donor guinea pig and variation of exposure/cohousing time (1 day vs 6 days). In three out of four scenarios - low inoculum-long exposure, low inoculum-short exposure and high inoculum-short exposure - transmission chains were efficiently blocked. Based on this data we believe an intranasal recombinant NA vaccine could be used to efficiently curtail influenza virus spread in the human population during influenza epidemics.\n\nImportanceVaccines that can slow respiratory virus transmission in the population are urgently needed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus.

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus gamma-hemolysin CB (HlgCB) is a core-genome encoded pore-forming toxin that targets the C5a receptor, similarly as the phage-encoded Panton-Valentine Leucocidin. Absolute quantification by mass spectrometry of HlgCB in 39 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) isolates showed considerable variations in HlgC and HlgB yields between isolates. Interestingly, when testing the hypothesis that HlgCB might be associated with severe S. aureus CAP, we found that a high level of HlgCB synthesis was associated with mortality in a rabbit model of pneumonia. To decipher the molecular basis for the variation in hlgCB and hlgB expression and protein production among strains, different regulation levels were analyzed in representative clinical isolates and reference strains. Although HlgC and HlgB are encoded on a single operon, their levels were dissociated in 10% of the clinical strains studied. HlgCB amount and HlgC/HlgB ratio were found to both depend on promotor activity, mRNA stability and translatability, and on the presence of an individual hlgB mRNA processed from the hlgCB transcript. Strikingly, toe-printing and in vitro translation assays revealed that a single SNP in the 5-UTR of hlgCB mRNA strongly impaired hlgC translation in the USA300 strain, leading to a strong decrease in HlgC but not in HlgB; the level of HlgB is likely to have been maintained by the presence of the processed hlgB mRNA. This work illustrates the complexity of virulence factor expression in clinical strains and demonstrates a butterfly effect, where subtle genomic variations have a major impact on phenotype and virulence.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus can provoke a wide range of infections due to its ability to produce a large diversity of virulence factors, including immune evasion molecules, adhesins, and toxins. Some of these toxin-encoding genes are localized in mobile genetic elements, and are thus not present in all strains, whilst others are encoded in the core-genome and present in all strains. Gamma-hemolysin CB is a core-genome encoded toxin but its amount varies between community-acquired pneumonia isolates. The regulation mechanisms underlying this variation however, are not well characterized. Here, we show that gamma-hemolysin expression levels vary largely among clinical strains and that, when highly produced, it induces high mortality in a rabbit model of pneumonia. The molecular basis for the variation in gamma-hemolysin expression depends on multiple mechanisms including promoter strength, transcript stability and processing, and translatability (i.e. the amount of protein that is synthetized by the ribosome for a given transcript). Incredibly, all these factors rely on a subtle genetic modification. This work emphasizes the importance of the disparity in virulence factor expression among clinical isolates and points the extreme complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying their regulation, rendering the prediction of virulence for a clinical isolate difficult.",

    "abstract": "Emerging COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a great threat to human health and economics. Although SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism has been explored, little is known about how SARS-CoV-2 regulates the host cell remodeling to facilitate virus invasion process. Here we unveil that SARS-CoV-2 boosts and repurposes filopodia for entry to the target cells. Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle (VLP), real-time live-cell imaging and simulation of active gel model, we reveal that VLP-induced Cdc42 activation leads to the formation of filopodia, which reinforce the viral entry to host cells. By single-particle tracking and sparse deconvolution algorithm, we uncover that VLP particles utilize filopodia to reach the entry site in two patterns,  surfing and  grabbing, which are more efficient and faster than entry via flat plasma membrane regions. Furthermore, the entry process via filopodia is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton and actin-associated proteins fascin, formin, and Arp2/3. Importantly, either inhibition the actin cross-linking protein fascin or the active level of Cdc42 could significantly hinders both the VLP and the authentic SARS-CoV-2 entry. Together, our results highlight that the spatial-temporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by SARS-CoV-2 infection makes filopodia as a  highway for virus entry, which emerges as an antiviral target.\n\nSignificance StatementRevealing the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 invasion is of great significance to explain its high pathogenic and rapid transmission in the world. We discovered a previously unknown route of SARS-CoV-2 entry. SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles boost cellular filopodia formation by activating Cdc42. Using state-of-art-technology, we spatial-temporally described how virus utilize filopodia to enter the target cell in two modes:  surfing and  grabbing. Filopodia can directly transport the virus to endocytic hot spots to avoid the virus from disorderly searching on the plasma membrane. Our study complements current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 that filopodia and its components not only play an important role in virus release and cell-cell transmission, but also in the entry process, and provides several potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHighlightsO_LISARS-CoV-2 VLP infection promotes filopodia formation by activating Cdc42\nC_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 VLP utilizes filopodia to enter target cell via two modes,  surfing and  grabbing\nC_LIO_LIFilopodia disruption compromises the invasion of both VLP and authentic SARS-CoV-2\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) was originally conceived as an mRNA surveillance mechanism to prevent the production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. Recent research shows NMD is an important post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanism selectively targeting many non-aberrant mRNAs. However, how natural genetic variants affect NMD and modulate gene expressions remains elusive.\n\nResultsHere we elucidate NMD regulation of individual genes across human tissues through genetical genomics. Genetic variants corresponding to NMD regulation are identified based on the GTEx data through unique and robust transcript expression modelling. We identify genetic variants that influence the percentage of NMD-targeted transcripts (pNMD-QTLs), as well as genetic variants regulating the decay efficiency of NMD-targeted transcripts (dNMD-QTLs). Many such variants are missed in traditional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. NMD-QTLs show strong tissue specificity especially in the brain. They are more likely to colocalize with disease single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to eQTLs, NMD-QTLs are more likely to be located within gene bodies and exons, especially the penultimate exons from the 3 end. Furthermore, NMD-QTLs are more likely to be found in the binding sites of miRNAs and RNA binding proteins (RBPs).\n\nConclusionsWe reveal the genome-wide landscape of genetic variants associated with NMD regulation across human tissues. Our analysis results indicate important roles of NMD in the brain. The preferential genomic positions of NMD-QTLs suggest key attributes for NMD regulation. Furthermore, the colocalization with disease-associated SNPs and post-transcriptional regulatory elements implicate regulatory roles of NMD-QTLs in disease manifestation and their interactions with other post-transcriptional regulators.",

    "abstract": "Genomic surveillance provides a data source complementary to contact tracing to resolve putative transmission chains. However, the role of within-host diversity in transmission is understudied due to a lack of experimental and clinical datasets that capture within-host diversity in both donors and recipients. Here, we assess the utility of deep-sequenced genomic surveillance within a mouse transmission model where the gastrointestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium was controllably spread during co-housing of infected and naive animals. We observed that within-host variants were maintained over multiple transmission steps until fixation or elimination. We present a model for inferring the likelihood that a given pair of samples are linked by transmission, by comparing the allelic frequency at variant genomic loci. Our data affirm that within-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) can repeatedly pass from donor to recipient along the transmission chain, and the mere sharing of iSNVs between different transmission pairs offers limited confidence in identifying a transmission pair. Beyond the presence and absence of within-host variants, we show that differences arising in the relative abundance of iSNVs can infer transmission pairs with high precision. An important component of our approach is that the inference is based solely on sequence data, without incorporating epidemiological or demographic data for context. Our model, which substantially reduces the number of comparisons a contact tracer needs to consider, may enhance the accuracy of contact tracing and other epidemiological processes, including early detection of emerging transmission clusters.",
