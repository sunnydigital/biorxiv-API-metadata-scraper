    "abstract": "Central Nervous System (CNS) organogenesis is a complex process that obeys precise architectural rules. The impact that nervous system architecture may have on its functionality remains, however, relatively unexplored. To clarify this problem, we analyzed the development of the Drosophila embryonic Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC). VNC morphogenesis requires the tight control of Jun kinase (JNK) signaling, exerted in part via a negative feedback loop mediated by the dual specificity phosphatase Puckered, in a subset of pioneer neurons. Here we show that the JNK pathway autonomously regulates neuronal electrophysiological properties without affecting synaptic vesicle transport. Manipulating, during early embryogenesis, JNK signaling activity in pioneer neurons, directly influences their function as  organizers of VNC architecture and, moreover, uncovers a role in the coordination of the embryonic motor circuitry that is required for hatching. Together, our data reveal critical links, mediated by the control of the JNK signaling cascade by Puckered, between the structural organization of the VNC and its functional optimization.",

    "abstract": "Null models provide a critical baseline for the evaluation of predictive disease models. Many studies consider only the grand mean null model (i.e. R2) when evaluating the predictive ability of a model, which is often misleading in conveying the predictive power of a model. We evaluated ten null models for human cases of West Nile virus (WNV), a zoonotic mosquito-borne disease introduced to the United States in 1999. The Negative Binomial, Historical (i.e. using previous cases to predict future cases) and Always Absent null models were the strongest overall, and the majority of null models significantly outperformed the grand mean. Somewhat surprisingly, the length of the training timeseries did not strongly affect the performance of most null models. We argue that a combination of null models is needed to evaluate the forecasting performance of predictive models and the grand mean is the lowest bar.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is predominantly catalyzed by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in response to DNA damage, mediating the DNA repair process to maintain genomic integrity. Single strand (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks are bonafide stimulators of PARP1 activity. However, PAR mediated PARP1 regulation remains unexplored. Here, we report ZnF3, BRCT and WGR, hitherto uncharacterized, as PAR reader domains of PARP1. Surprisingly, these domains recognize PARylated protein with a higher affinity compared to PAR but bind with weak or no affinity to DNA breaks as standalone domains. Conversely, ZnF1 and ZnF2 of PARP1 recognize DNA breaks but weakly to PAR. In addition, PAR reader domains, together, exhibit a synergy to recognize PAR or PARylated protein. Further competition binding studies suggest that PAR binding releases DNA from PARP1, and WGR domain facilitates the DNA release. Unexpectedly, PAR showed catalytic stimulation of PARP1 but hampers the DNA-dependent stimulation. Altogether, our work discovers dedicated high-affinity PAR reader domains of PARP1 and uncovers a novel mechanism of allosteric stimulation, but retardation of DNA-dependent activities of PARP1 by its catalytic product PAR. Therefore, our studies can be used as a model to understand the effect of one or more allosteric activators on the regulation of receptors or modular enzyme activities by another allosteric activator.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs) drives life-shortening mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, primarily because of its resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. To date, our knowledge on the host and bacterial determinants driving Mabs pathology in CF patient lung remains rudimentary. Here, we used human airway organoids (AOs) microinjected with smooth (S) or rough (R-)Mabs to evaluate bacteria fitness, host responses to infection, and new treatment efficacy. We show that S Mabs formed biofilm, R Mabs formed cord serpentines and displayed a higher virulence. While Mabs infection triggers enhanced oxidative stress, pharmacological activation of antioxidant pathways resulted in better control of Mabs growth. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the CFTR is associated with better growth and higher virulence of S and R Mabs. Finally, pharmacological activation of antioxidant pathways inhibited Mabs growth and improved efficacy in combination with cefoxitin, a first line antibiotic. In conclusion, we have established AOs as a suitable human system to decipher mechanisms of CF-driven respiratory infection by Mabs and propose antioxidants as a potential host-directed strategy to improve Mabs infection control.",

    "abstract": "Root hairs (RH) are excellent model systems for studying cell size and polarity since they elongate several hundred-fold their original size. Their tip growth is determined both by intrinsic and environmental signals. Although nutrient availability and temperature are key factors for a sustained plant growth, the molecular mechanisms underlying their sensing and downstream signaling pathways remain unclear. Here, we identified that low temperature (10{degrees}C) triggers a strong RH elongation response involving the cell surface receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) and the nutrient sensing TOR Complex 1 (TORC). In this study, we found that FER is required to perceive limited nutrient availability caused by low temperature. FER interacts with and activates TORC downstream components to trigger RH growth. In addition, the small GTPase Rho-related protein from plants 2 (ROP2) is also involved in this RH growth response linking FER and TOR. We also found that limited nitrogen nutrient availability can mimic the RH growth response at 10{degrees}C in a NRT1.1-dependent manner. These results uncover a molecular mechanism by which a central hub composed by FER-ROP2-TORC is involved in the control of RH elongation under low temperature and nitrogen deficiency.",

    "abstract": "We developed a method for altering terrain unevenness on a treadmill to study gait kinematics. Terrain consisted of rigid polyurethane disks (12.7 cm diameter, 1.3-3.8 cm tall) which attached to the treadmill belt using hook-and-loop fasteners. Here, we tested four terrain unevenness conditions: Flat, Low, Medium, and High. The main objective was to test the hypothesis that increasing the unevenness of the terrain would result in greater gait kinematic variability. Seventeen younger adults (age 20-40 years), 25 higher-functioning older adults (age 65+ years), and 29 lower-functioning older adults (age 65+ years, Short Physical Performance Battery score < 10) participated. We customized the treadmill speed to each participants walking ability, keeping the speed constant across all four terrain conditions. Participants completed two 3-minute walking trials per condition. Using an inertial measurement unit placed over the sacrum and pressure sensors in the shoes, we calculated the stride-to-stride variability in step duration and sacral excursion (coefficient of variation; standard deviation expressed as percentage of the mean). Participants also self-reported their perceived stability for each condition. Terrain was a significant predictor of step duration variability, which roughly doubled from Flat to High terrain for all participant groups: younger adults (Flat 4.0%, High 8.2%), higher-functioning older adults (Flat 5.0%, High 8.9%), lower-functioning older adults (Flat 7.0%, High 14.1%). Similarly, all groups exhibited significant increases in sacral excursion variability for all three uneven terrain conditions compared to Flat. Participants were also significantly more likely to report feeling less stable walking over all three uneven terrain conditions compared to Flat. These findings support the hypothesis that altering terrain unevenness on a treadmill will increase gait kinematic variability and reduce perceived stability in younger and older adults.",

Here, we uncover a conserved program of alternative microexons included in mRNAs of islet cells, particularly in genes involved in vesicle transport and exocytosis. Islet microexons (IsletMICs) are regulated by the RNA binding protein SRRM3 and represent a subset of the larger neural program that are particularly sensitive to the levels of this regulator. Both SRRM3 and IsletMICs are induced by elevated glucose levels, and depletion of SRRM3 in beta cell lines and mouse islets, or repression of particular IsletMICs using antisense oligonucleotides, leads to inappropriate insulin secretion. Consistently, SRRM3 mutant mice display defects in islet cell identity and function, leading to hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.

    "abstract": "The planetary biosphere is powered by a suite of key metabolic innovations that emerged early in the history of life. However, it is unknown whether life has always followed the same set of strategies for performing these critical tasks. Today, microbes access atmospheric sources of bioessential nitrogen through the activities of just one family of enzymes, nitrogenases. Here, we show that the only dinitrogen reduction mechanism known to date is an ancient feature conserved from nitrogenase ancestors. We designed a paleomolecular engineering approach wherein ancestral nitrogenase genes were phylogenetically reconstructed and inserted into the genome of the diazotrophic bacterial model, Azotobacter vinelandii, enabling an integrated assessment of both in vivo functionality and purified nitrogenase biochemistry. Nitrogenase ancestors are active and robust to variable incorporation of one or more ancestral protein subunits. Further, we find that all ancestors exhibit the reversible enzymatic mechanism for dinitrogen reduction, specifically evidenced by hydrogen inhibition, that is also exhibited by extant A. vinelandii nitrogenase isozymes. Our results suggest that life may have been constrained in its sampling of protein sequence space to catalyze one of the most energetically challenging biochemical reactions in nature. The experimental framework established here is essential for probing how nitrogenase functionality has been shaped within a dynamic, cellular context to sustain a globally consequential metabolism.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe enzymatic mechanism for dinitrogen reduction is an ancient feature of nitrogenases that persisted over hundreds of millions of years.",

    "abstract": "AimThe astonishing diversity of ancient mountains was likely shaped by multiple evolutionary processes. However, there is an ongoing debate on what were the main processes driving the assembly of campos rupestres, the mega-diverse flora of Eastern South American mountains. Although the ancient nature of these mountains suggests their flora should be composed by relatively older lineages, they harbour a number of recently diverged clades. To better understand the evolution of ancient mountains floras, we tested if the campos rupestres are mainly composed by relatively old or recent communities and if angiosperm diversity is geographically structured using analyses of diversity and endemism.\n\nLocationEastern South America.\n\nTime periodOligocene/Miocene to the present.\n\nMajor taxa studiedFlowering plants.\n\nMethodsWe used analyses of diversity and endemism for 10% of the campos rupestres flora. We obtained distribution data from online databases, and phylogenetic hypotheses from the literature. With these datasets, we estimated alpha and beta metrics of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, and conducted categorical analyses of neo- and paleo-endemism.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic overdispersion predominates in the campos rupestres. However, this general pattern is permeated by both lineage- and site-specific phylogenetic clustering, suggesting that recent diversification events depend on particular regional conditions and on the overall maintenance of old lineages. Although endemism patterns vary among different campos rupestres sites, paleo-endemism is widespread and particularly prominent where phylogenetic overdispersion is evident. Moreover, phylogenetic composition indicates variable past spatial connections across different sites, taxonomic composition is highly geographically structured and seems to be influenced by the vegetation surrounding the campos rupestres and/or by abiotic conditions.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results reinforce the idiosyncratic nature of diversification patterns in ancient mountains and suggest that old, climatically buffered, infertile montane ecosystems not only include both relatively old and recent lineages, but that recent diversification is lineage and spatially dependent.",

Since cell borders are seldom labeled, researchers generally segment cells by their nuclei.

The lack of effective methods for three-dimensional segmentation represents a bottleneck in the realization of the potential of tissue cytometry, particularly as methods of tissue clearing present researchers with the opportunity to characterize entire organs. Methods based upon deep-learning have shown enormous promise, but their implementation is hampered by the need for large amounts of manually annotated training data.

    "abstract": "Susceptibility of Leishmania to the first line treatment amphotericin B remains poorly understood. Amphotericin B targets ergosterol, so one approach to improving drug efficacy and reducing side effects could be improving access to ergosterol. While the surface exposure of ergosterol in Leishmania is unknown, sterols in mammalian cells can be sheltered from sterol-binding agents by membrane components, including sphingolipids. Here, we tested the ability of the Leishmania major sphingolipids inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), and ceramide to shelter ergosterol by preventing binding and cytotoxicity of the sterol-specific toxins streptolysin O and perfringolysin O using flow cytometry. In contrast to mammalian systems, Leishmania sphingolipids did not preclude toxin binding to sterols in the membrane. However, IPC interfered with cytotoxicity. Ceramide reduced perfringolysin O, but not streptolysin O, cytotoxicity in cells. Ceramide sensing was controlled by the toxin L3 loop. Ceramide was sufficient to protect L. major promastigotes from amphotericin B. We propose a mechanism whereby pore-forming toxins engage additional lipids like ceramide to determine the optimal environment to sustain pore formation. Thus, L. major offers a genetically tractable model organism for understanding toxin-membrane interactions. Furthermore, our findings suggest targeting ceramide may enhance the efficacy of ergosterol-targeting anti-leishmanial drugs.\n\nAbstract ImportanceLeishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with [~]1.5-2 million new cases and [~]70,000 deaths annually. One first-line treatment for leishmaniasis is liposomal amphotericin B, which is expensive and damages the kidneys. Cost and side effects can be minimized by improving efficacy. To improve efficacy, we must learn how amphotericins target--ergosterol--is protected by other components of Leishmania. The human ergosterol equivalent is protected by components called sphingolipids. We tested the ability of sphingolipids to protect ergosterol using pore-forming toxins. Pore-forming toxins use ergosterol to bind and kill Leishmania. Unlike human cells, toxins bound to ergosterol--indicating that they had access--when sphingolipids were present. However, sphingolipids protected Leishmania from toxins and amphotericin. Thus, Leishmania organizes sterol-protective components differently from humans. Further, toxins and Leishmania serve as a system to understand fundamental rules governing sterol-protecting component membrane organization. We can use this information to help improve drugs targeting sterols.",

When environmental conditions are not favorable, the stress hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA) signals plants to postpone seedling establishment by inducing the expression of the transcription factor ABI5.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the stability and activity of ABI5 during the transition to light are less known. We found that two microProteins miP1a/ BBX31 and miP1b/BBX30 alongwith ABI5 inhibit post-germination seedling establishment in a partially interdependent manner. MicroProteins are single-domain proteins that interact with multi-domain proteins to modulate their post-translational activity. miP1a/ BBX31 and miP1b/BBX30 physically interact with ABI5 to stabilize it and promote its binding to promoters of downstream genes in light. ABI5 reciprocally induces the expression of BBX30 and BBX31 by directly binding to their promoter. ABI5 and the two microProteins thereby form a positive feedback loop to promote ABA-mediated developmental arrest of seedlings. Our study highlights the functional versatility of microProteins which can act as regulators of crucial developmental transitions in plants as well as other eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The fine-tuning of pectins by polygalacturonases (PGs) plays a key role in modulating plant cell wall chemistry and mechanics, impacting plant development. In plants, the high number of PGs encoded in the genome questions the regulation of pectin depolymerization and the roles of distinct isozymes in the control of development. Here we report the first crystal structures of two PGs from Arabidopsis, PGLR and ADPG2 whose expression overlap in roots. Albeit having overall conserved folds and active sites, PGLR and ADPG2 differed in the structure of their binding grooves and in the amino-acids of the subsites. We determined the structural features that explain the absence of inhibition of the plant PGs by endogenous PG-Inhibiting Proteins (PGIPs). By combining molecular dynamic simulations, analysis of enzymes kinetics and hydrolysis products, we showed that subtle differences in PGLR and ADPG2 structures translated into distinct enzyme-substrate dynamics and enzymes processivities. Using the plant root as a developmental model, exogenous application of purified enzymes showed that these distinct PGLR/ADPG2 processivities ultimately translated into different impacts on development. The highly processive ADPG2 had major effects on both root cell elongation and cell adhesion. Our study suggests that, in plants, gene redundancy is unlikely to reflect redundant biochemical specificities. Isozymes of distinct specificities and processivities are likely to be of major importance for the fine spatial and temporal regulation of pectin structure.\n\nSignificance StatementPlant polygalacturonases (PG) are enzymes that play a key role in the regulation of cell wall pectin chemistry by controlling the degree of polymerization of the HG chains. The high number of genes encoding PG in Arabidopsis questions the rationale for such abundance. We solved the crystal structure of two PG (PGLR and ADPG2) whose expression overlap in roots and showed, using combined computational and experimental approaches, that they differ in their enzyme-substrate dynamics, leading to distinct processivities. The highly processive ADPG2 can generate digestion products of shorter degree of polymerization, and upon exogenous application on developing roots, induced drastic developmental defects. Our study suggests that gene redundancy is unlikely to reflect redundant biochemical specificities of isozymes.",

However, little is known about the geographic distribution of plant-microbe symbioses and how they are formed and change along latitudinal gradients. Here we identified leaf bacteria for 328 plant species sampled from 10 forests along a tropical to temperate gradient in China. We analyzed the diversity and composition of plant leaf-associated bacteria and quantified the contributions of hosts, habitats, and neighborhood plants to the plant-bacterial symbiosis. We found a strong latitudinal gradient in leaf bacterial diversity and composition. Bacterial assemblages on leaves were most strongly selected by host plants, and the selection pressure increased with latitude. In contrast, at low latitudes and at large geographical scales multiple factors were found to jointly regulate bacterial community composition. Our result also showed that plant-bacteria symbiotic networks were structured by network hub bacteria taxa with high co-occurrence network centrality, and the abundance of temperate hub taxa was more influenced by host plants than that in tropical forests. For the first time, we documented a previously unrecognized latitudinal gradient in plant-bacterial symbioses that was regulated by a joint effect of multiple factors at low latitudes but mostly by host selection at high latitudes, implying that leaf microbiomes are likely to respond differently to global change along the latitudinal gradient.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection not only affects the actual loci under selection but also leaves \"footprints\" in patterns of genetic variation in linked genetic regions. This offers exciting opportunities for inferring selection and for understanding the processes shaping levels of genetic variation in natural populations. Here we develop analytical approximations based on coalescent theory to characterize the genetic footprint of a complex, but potentially common type of natural selection: balancing selection with seasonally fluctuating allele frequencies. We show that seasonal allele frequency fluctuations can have important (and partly unexpected) consequences for the genetic footprint of balancing selection. As also confirmed by stochastic simulations, fluctuating balancing selection generally leads to an increase in genetic diversity close to the selected site, the effect of balancing selection, but reduces diversity further away from the selected site, which is a consequence of the allele-frequency fluctuations effectively producing recurrent bottlenecks of allelic backgrounds. This negative effect usually outweighs the positive effect when averaging diversity levels across the entire chromosome. Strong fluctuating balancing selection even induces a loss of genetic variation in unlinked regions, e.g. on different chromosomes. If many loci in the genome are simultaneously under fluctuating balancing selection this could lead to substantial genome-wide reductions in genetic diversity. This may be the case, even if allele-frequency fluctuations are so small that individual footprints are hard to detect. Thus, together with genetic drift, selective sweeps and background selection, fluctuating selection could be one of the major forces shaping levels of genetic diversity in natural populations.\n\nArticle summaryIn some species with multiple generations per year, many loci in the genome experience strong seasonally fluctuating selection, in some cases with stable maintenance of polymorphism. Here we investigate the consequences for levels of genetic diversity at linked neutral sites. Using analytical approximations and stochastic simulations, we find a characteristic local genetic footprint with a diversity peak around the selected site and a diversity valley further away and a substantial reduction in diversity levels chromosome-wide and even genome-wide.",

Here, we present an alternative new approach to data acquisition and processing based on an affordable event-based sensor. This type of sensor reacts to light intensity changes rather than integrating photons during each frame exposure time. This makes it particularly suited to SMLM, where the ability to surpass the diffraction-limited resolution is provided by blinking events. Each pixel works independently and returns a signal only when an intensity change is detected. Since the output is a list containing only useful data rather than a series of frames, the temporal resolution is significantly better than typical scientific cameras. We demonstrate event-based SMLM super-resolution imaging on biological samples with spatial resolution on par with EMCCD or sCMOS performance. Furthermore, taking advantage of its unique properties, we use event-based SMLM to perform very dense single-molecule imaging, where framebased cameras experience significant limitations.",

    "abstract": "During listening, brain activity tracks the rhythmic structures of speech signals. Here, we directly dissociated the contribution of neural tracking in the processing of speech acoustic cues from that related to linguistic processing. We examined the neural changes associated with the comprehension of Noise-Vocoded (NV) speech using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened to NV sentences in a 3-phase training paradigm: (1) pre-training, where NV stimuli were barely comprehended, (2) training with exposure of the original clear version of speech stimulus, and (3) post-training, where the same stimuli gained intelligibility from the training phase. Using this paradigm, we tested if the neural responses of a speech signal was modulated by its intelligibility without any change in its acoustic structure. To test the influence of spectral degradation on neural tracking independently of training, participants listened to two types of NV sentences (4-band and 2-band NV speech), but were only trained to understand 4-band NV speech. Significant changes in neural tracking were observed in the delta range in relation to the acoustic degradation of speech. However, we failed to find a direct effect of intelligibility on the neural tracking of speech in both theta and delta ranges. This suggests that acoustics greatly influence the neural tracking response to speech signals, and that caution needs to be taken when choosing the control signals for speech-brain tracking analyses, considering that a slight change in acoustic parameters can have strong effects on the neural tracking response.",

    "abstract": "The correct evaluation of ligand binding free energies by computational methods is still a very challenging active area of research. The most employed methods for these calculations can be roughly classified into four groups: (i) the fastest and less accurate methods, such as molecular docking, designed to sample a large number of molecules and rapidly rank them according to the potential binding energy; (ii) the second class of methods use a thermodynamic ensemble, typically generated by molecular dynamics, to analyze the endpoints of the thermodynamic cycle for binding and extract differences, in the so-called  end-point methods; (iii) the third class of methods is based on the Zwanzig relationship and computes the free energy difference after a chemical change of the system (alchemical methods); and (iv) methods based on biased simulations, such as metadynamics, for example. These methods require increased computational power and as expected, result in increased accuracy for the determination of the strength of binding. Here, we describe an intermediate approach, based on the Monte Carlo Recursion (MCR) method first developed by Harold Scheraga. In this method, the system is sampled at increasing effective temperatures, and the free energy of the system is assessed from a series of terms W(b, T), computed from Monte Carlo (MC) averages at each iteration. We show the application of the MCR for ligand binding with datasets of guest-hosts systems (N=75) and we observed that a good correlation is obtained between experimental data and the binding energies computed with MCR. We also compared the experimental data with an end-point calculation from equilibrium Monte Carlo calculations that allowed us to conclude that the lower-energy (lower-temperature) terms in the calculation are the most relevant to the estimation of the binding energies, resulting in similar correlations between MCR and MC data and the experimental values. On the other hand, the MCR method provides a reasonable view of the binding energy funnel, with possible connections with the ligand binding kinetics, as well. The codes developed for this analysis are publicly available on GitHub as a part of the LiBELa/MCLiBELa project (https://github.com/alessandronascimento/LiBELa).",

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical work on phylogenetic birth-death models offers differing viewpoints on whether they can be estimated using lineage-through-time data. Louca and Pennell (2020) showed that the class of models with continuously differentiable rate functions is nonidentifiable: any such model is consistent with an infinite collection of alternative models, which are statistically indistinguishable regardless of how much data are collected. Legried and Terhorst (2022a) qualified this grave result by showing that identifiability is restored if only piecewise constant rate functions are considered.\n\nHere, we contribute new theoretical results to this discussion, in both the positive and negative directions. Our main result is to prove that models based on piecewise polynomial rate functions of any order and with any (finite) number of pieces are statistically identifiable. In particular, this implies that spline-based models with an arbitrary number of knots are identifiable. The proof is simple and self-contained, relying mainly on basic algebra. We complement this positive result with a negative one, which shows that even when identifiability holds, rate function estimation is still a difficult problem. To illustrate this, we prove some rates-of-convergence results for hypothesis testing using birth-death models. These results are information-theoretic lower bounds which apply to all potential estimators.",

    "abstract": "H3K9me3-based gene silencing is a conserved strategy for securing cell fate, but the mechanisms controlling lineage-specific installation of this epigenetic mark remain unclear. In Drosophila, H3K9 methylation plays an essential role in securing female germ cell fate by silencing lineage inappropriate phf7 transcription. Thus, phf7 regulation in the female germline provides a powerful system to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying H3K9me3 deposition onto protein coding genes. Here we used genetic studies to identify the essential cis-regulatory elements, finding that the sequences required for H3K9me3 deposition are conserved across Drosophila species. Transposable elements are also silenced by an H3K9me3-mediated mechanism. But our finding that phf7 regulation does not require the dedicated piRNA pathway components, piwi, aub, rhino, panx, and nxf2, indicates that the mechanisms of H3K9me3 recruitment are distinct. Lastly, we discovered that an uncharacterized member of the zinc finger associated domain (ZAD) containing C2H2 zinc finger protein family, IDENTITY CRISIS (IDC; CG4936), is necessary for H3K9me3 deposition onto phf7. Loss of idc in germ cells interferes with phf7 transcriptional regulation and H3K9me3 deposition, resulting in ectopic PHF7 protein expression. IDCs role is likely to be direct, as it localizes to a conserved domain within the phf7 gene. Collectively, our findings support a model in which IDC guides sequence-specific establishment of an H3K9me3 mini domain, thereby preventing accidental female-to-male programming.\n\nAuthor SummaryTissue development and function relies on cells remembering their identity. A cells identity is defined by the genes it expresses and those it does not. Recent work has shown that genes can be silenced by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) marked chromatin, and that H3K9me3-mediated gene silencing is a vital strategy for securing cell fate. But there is very little information about how the machinery responsible for H3K9 methylation finds its target genes. Here we explore this issue using the Drosophila female germline where a mini domain of repressive H3K9me3 chromatin secures female germ cell fate by silencing phf7, a gene normally expressed in male germ cells. Transposable elements are also silenced by H3K9me3 mini domains, but we find that the proteins involved in this process are not required for phf7 silencing. Instead, we find that silencing requires a previously uncharacterized protein, we have named IDENTITY CRISIS. Our work provides evidence that IDENTITY CRISIS directs the H3K9 methylation machinery to build a mini domain at the phf7 locus. Our results shed new light into how cells safeguard their identity by silencing cell type inappropriate genes, and more specifically how these genes are identified by the silencing machinery.",

However, much less is known about the signaling pathways downstream of neurexins largely-invariant intracellular domain. C. elegans contains a single neurexin gene that we have previously shown is required for presynaptic assembly and stabilization. To gain insight into the signaling pathways mediating neurexins presynaptic functions, we employed a proximity ligation method, endogenously tagging neurexins intracellular domain with the promiscuous biotin ligase TurboID, allowing us to isolate adjacent biotinylated proteins by streptavidin pull-down and mass spectrometry. We compared our experimental strain to a control strain in which neurexin, endogenously tagged with TurboID, was dispersed from presynaptic active zones by the deletion of its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. Using this approach we identified both known and novel intracellular interactors of neurexin, including active zone scaffolds, actin-binding proteins (including almost every member of the Arp2/3 complex), signaling molecules, and mediators of RNA trafficking, protein synthesis and degradation, among others. Characterization of mutants for candidate neurexin interactors revealed that they recapitulate aspects of the nrx-1 mutant phenotype, suggesting they may be involved in neurexin signaling. Finally, to investigate a possible role for neurexin in local actin assembly, we endogenously tagged its intracellular domain with actin depolymerizing and sequestering peptides (DeActs), and found that this led to defects in active zone assembly.",

Substrate channeling of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate through the enzymes of lower glycolysis fuels pyruvate kinase, which directly consumes the ADP made by phosphofructokinase to raise ATP/ADP and close the channel. We further demonstrate the presence of a plasma membrane NAD+/NADH cycle, whereby lactate dehydrogenase is functionally coupled to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These studies provide direct electrophysiological evidence of a KATP-controlling glycolytic signaling complex and demonstrate its relevance to islet glucose sensing and excitability.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=191 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/511200v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105da9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152d1b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45da58org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fbdc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Ho et al. demonstrate that the enzymes of glycolysis, as well as lactate dehydrogenase, form a plasma membrane-associated metabolon with intrinsic ATP/ADP and NAD+/NADH cycles.

Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, also show diurnal rhythmicity in regulating local immune responses and synaptic remodeling. To investigate the interaction between aging and microglial circadian rhythmicity, we examined mice deficient in the core clock transcription factor, BMAL1. Aging Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice demonstrated accelerated cognitive decline in association with suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation and increases in immature dendritic spines. C1q deposition at synapses and synaptic engulfment were significantly decreased in aging Bmal1-deficient microglia, suggesting that BMAL1 plays a role in regulating synaptic pruning in aging. In addition to accelerated age-associated hippocampal deficits, Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice also showed deficits in the sleep-wake cycle with increased wakefulness across light and dark phases. These results highlight an essential role of microglial BMAL1 in maintenance of synapse homeostasis in the aging brain.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study demonstrates that myeloid deficiency of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 disrupts microglial synaptic pruning in the hippocampus, accelerates age-associated cognitive decline, and disrupts the sleep-wake cycle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a growing need to improve robustness characteristics in fattening pigs, but this trait is difficult to phenotype. Our first objective was to develop a robustness proxy on the basis of modelling of longitudinal energetic allocation coefficient to growth for fattening pigs. Consequently, the environmental variance of this allocation coefficient was considered as a proxy of robustness. The second objective was to estimate its genetic parameters and correlation with traits under selection as well with phenotypes routinely collected on farms. A total of 5848 pigs, from Pietrain NN paternal line, were tested at the AXIOM boar testing station (Azay-sur-Indre, France) from 2015 to 2022. This farm was equipped with automatic feeding system, recording individual weight and feed intake at each visit. We used a dynamic linear regression model to characterize the evolution of the allocation coefficient between cumulative net energy available, estimated from feed intake, and cumulative weight gain during fattening period. Longitudinal energetic allocation coefficients were analysed using a two-step approach, to estimate both its genetic variance and the genetic variance in the residual variance, trait LSR.\n\nResultsThe LSR trait, that could be interpreted as an indicator of the response of the animal to perturbations/stress, showed low heritability (0.05{+/-}0.01). The trait LSR had high favourable genetic correlations with average daily growth (-0.71{+/-}0.06) and unfavourable with feed conversion ratio (-0.76{+/-}0.06) and residual feed intake (-0.83{+/-}0.06). The analysis of the relationship between estimated breeding values (EBV) LSR quartiles and phenotypes routinely collected on farms shows the most favourable situation for animals from quartile with the weakest EBV LSR, i.e., the most robust.\n\nConclusionsThese results show that selection for robustness based on deviation from energetic allocation coefficient to growth can be considered in breeding programs for fattening pigs.",

    "abstract": "Hi-C experiments allow researchers to study and understand the 3D genome organization and its regulatory function. Unfortunately, sequencing costs and technical constraints severely restrict access to high-quality Hi-C data for many cell types. Existing frameworks rely on a sparse Hi-C dataset or cheaper-to-acquire ChIP-seq data to predict Hi-C contact maps with high read coverage. However, these methods fail to generalize to sparse or cross-cell-type inputs because they do not account for the contributions of epigenomic features or the impact of the structural neighborhood in predicting Hi-C reads. We propose GrapHiC, which combines Hi-C and ChIP-seq in a graph representation, allowing more accurate embedding of structural and epigenomic features. Each node represents a binned genomic region, and we assign edge weights using the observed Hi-C reads. Additionally, we embed ChIP-seq and relative positional information as node attributes, allowing our representation to capture structural neighborhoods and the contributions of proteins and their modifications for predicting Hi-C reads. Our evaluations show that GrapHiC generalizes better than the current state-of-the-art on cross-cell-type settings and sparse Hi-C inputs. Moreover, we can utilize our framework to impute Hi-C reads even when no Hi-C contact map is available, thus making high-quality Hi-C data more accessible for many cell types.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/rsinghlab/GrapHiC\n\nACM Reference FormatGhulam Murtaza, Justin Wagner, Justin M.

    "abstract": "The UK Biobank performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) across hundreds of thousands of individuals, allowing researchers to study the effects of both common and rare variants. Haplotype phasing distinguishes the two inherited copies of each chromosome into haplotypes and unlocks novel analyses at the haplotype level. In this work, we describe a new phasing method, SHAPEIT5, that accurately and rapidly phases large sequencing datasets and illustrates its key features on the UK Biobank WGS and WES data. First, we show that it phases rare variants with high accuracy. For instance, variants found in 1 sample out of 100,000 in the WES data are phased with accuracy above 95%. Second, we show that it can phase singletons, although with moderate accuracy, thereby making their inclusion in downstream analyses possible. Third, we show that the use of UK Biobank as a reference panel increases the accuracy of genotype imputation, an increase that is more pronounced when phased with SHAPEIT5 compared to other methods. Finally, we screen the phased WES data for loss-of-function (LoF) compound heterozygous (CH) events and identify 549 genes in which both gene copies are found knocked out. This list of genes complements current knowledge of gene essentiality in the human genome. We provide SHAPEIT5 in an open-source format, providing researchers with the means to leverage haplotype information in genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "As the available sequencing data modalities increase, so does the potential biological insight that they are able to provide. Most existing methods to integrate co-profiled single-cell multi-omics data focus only on learning representations that capture stationary and shared information among these modalities. Current methods do not account for time-dependent and modality-specific information delineating cell states and subtypes, nor do they consider dynamics resulting from causal relations among modalities. For example, open chromatin may cause active transcription; however, it is also possible that gene expression responses lag behind changes in chromatin accessibility. To account for this time lag, the epigenome and transcriptome relationship can be characterized as \"coupled\" (changing dependently) or \"decoupled\" (changing independently). We propose the framework HALO (Hierarchical cAusal representation Learning for Omics data), which adopts a causal approach to model these non-stationary causal relations using independent changing mechanisms in co-profiled single-cell ATAC- and RNA-seq data. Our model factorizes these two modalities into both coupled and decoupled latent representations, allowing us to identify the dynamic interplay between chromatin accessibility and transcription through temporal modulations. In blood lineage and developing mouse brain data, where the balance between proliferation and differentiation is tightly regulated, HALO distinguishes between coupled and decoupled genes and links them with disparate processes that constitute these two complementary states.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora sojae is a soil-borne oomycete and the causal agent of Phytophthora root and stem rot (PRR) in soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill). Yield losses attributed to P. sojae are devastating in disease-conducive environments, with global estimates surpassing 1.1 million tonnes annually. Historically, management of PRR has entailed host genetic resistance (both vertical and horizontal) complemented by disease-suppressive cultural practices (e.g., oomicide application). However, the vast expansion of complex and/or diverse P. sojae pathotypes necessitates developing novel technologies to attenuate PRR in field environments. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to couple high-throughput sequencing data and deep learning to elucidate molecular features in soybean following infection by P. sojae. In doing so, we generated transcriptomes to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during compatible and incompatible interactions with P. sojae and a mock inoculation. The expression data were then used to select two defense-related transcription factors (TFs) belonging to WRKY and RAV families. DNA Affinity Purification and sequencing (DAP-seq) data were obtained for each TF, providing putative DNA binding sites in the soybean genome. These bound sites were used to train Deep Neural Networks with convolutional and recurrent layers to predict new target sites of WRKY and RAV family members in the DEG set. Moreover, we leveraged publicly available Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DAP-seq data for five TF families enriched in our transcriptome analysis to train similar models. These Arabidopsis data-based models were used for cross-species TF binding site prediction on soybean. Finally, we created a gene regulatory network depicting TF-target gene interactions that orchestrate an immune response against P. sojae. Information herein provides novel insight into molecular plant-pathogen interaction and may prove useful in developing soybean cultivars with more durable resistance to P. sojae.\n\nAuthor SummaryGlobal food security is threatened continually by plant pathogens. One approach to circumvent these disease-causing agents entails understanding how hosts balance primary growth and defense upon pathogen perception. Molecular signatures of perception-rendered defense may be leveraged subsequently to develop resistant/tolerant crop plants. Additionally, evidence suggests that the plant immune system is characterized by tuning primary and secondary metabolic activity via transcription factor-mediated transcriptional reprogramming. Therefore, we investigated transcription factor-target gene interactions in soybean upon infection by compatible and incompatible races of Phytophthora sojae. Through transcriptome analysis, we found that the interactions elicited vast, overlapping transcriptional responses and identified overrepresented, defense-related transcription factor families. We then generated/acquired DNA-protein interactome data for the most represented transcription factor families in the transcriptome analysis and trained deep learning-based models to predict novel transcription factor targets. Transcription factor/target gene metrics were used to construct a gene regulatory network with prioritized components. We identified hub transcription factors belonging to WRKY and ERF families, the majority of which function in response to various biotic and abiotic stressors. These findings propose novel regulators in the soybean defense response to Phytophthora sojae and provide an avenue for the investigation of transcription factor-target gene interactions in plants.",

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy, a leading cause of early infant death, is caused by biallelic mutations of the SMN1 gene. Sequence analysis of SMN1 is challenging due to high sequence similarity with its paralog SMN2. Both genes have variable copy numbers across populations. Furthermore, without pedigree information, it is impossible to identify silent carriers (2+0) with two copies of SMN1 on one chromosome and zero copies on the other. We developed Paraphase, an informatics method that identifies full-length SMN1 and SMN2 haplotypes, determines the gene copy numbers and calls phased variants using long-read PacBio HiFi data. The SMN1 and SMN2 copy number calls by Paraphase are highly concordant with orthogonal methods (99.2% for SMN1 and 100% for SMN2). We applied Paraphase to 438 samples across five ethnic populations to conduct a population-wide haplotype analysis of these highly homologous genes. We identified major SMN1 and SMN2 haplogroups and characterized their co-segregation through pedigree-based analyses. We identified two SMN1 haplotypes that form a common two-copy SMN1 allele in African populations. Testing positive for these two haplotypes in an individual with two copies of SMN1 gives a silent carrier risk of 88.5%, which is significantly higher than the currently used marker (1.7-3.0%). Extending beyond simple copy number testing, Paraphase can detect pathogenic variants and enable potential haplotype-based screening of silent carriers through statistical phasing of haplotypes into alleles. Future analysis of larger population data will allow identification of more diverse haplotypes and genetic markers for silent carriers.",

Reconstructing individual strains from viral quasispecies is a key step to characterizing the viral population, revealing strain-level genetic variability, and providing insights into biomedical and clinical studies. Reference-based approaches of reconstructing viral strains suffer from the lack of high-quality references due to high mutation rates and biased variant calling introduced by a selected reference. De novo methods require no references but face challenges due to errors in reads, the high similarity of quasispecies, and uneven abundance of strains.\n\nIn this paper, we propose VStrains, a de novo approach for reconstructing strains from viral quasispecies. VStrains incorporates contigs, paired-end reads, and coverage information to iteratively extract the strain-specific paths from assembly graphs. We benchmark VStrains against multiple state-of-the-art de novo and reference-based approaches on both simulated and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that VStrains achieves the best overall performance on both simulated and real datasets under a comprehensive set of metrics such as genome fraction, duplication ratio, NGA50, error rate, etc.\n\nAvailabilityVStrains is freely available at https://github.com/MetaGenTools/VStrains.",

A small number of circRNAs have been implicated as functional, however, we still lack systematic understanding of cellular processes and signalling pathways that are regulated by circRNAs. A major gap in understanding circRNA function is the ability to define pathways that are regulated by circRNAs. Here, we generated a pooled shRNA library targeting the back-splice junction of 3,354 human circRNAs that are expressed at low to high levels in humans. We used this library for loss of function proliferation screens in a panel of 18 cancer cell lines from four tissue types that harbour mutations leading to constitutive activity of defined pathways. Using this dataset, we identify context specific and non-specific circRNAs. We validated these observations with a secondary screen and uncovered a role for circRERE, a cell essential circRNA that regulates ferroptosis. Furthermore, we characterised the functional roles of pathway-specific circRNA, circSMAD2, a novel regulator of the WNT pathway and circMTO1, a regulator of MAPK signalling in a PTEN dependent manner.

    "abstract": "Toehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD) has been used extensively for molecular sensing and computing in DNA-based molecular circuits. As these circuits grow in complexity, sequence similarity between components can lead to cross-talk causing leak, altered kinetics, or even circuit failure. For small non-biological circuits, such unwanted interactions can be designed against. In environments containing a huge number of sequences, taking all possible interactions into account becomes infeasible. Therefore, a general understanding of the impact of sequence backgrounds on TMSD reactions is of great interest. Here, we investigate the impact of random DNA sequences on TMSD circuits. We begin by studying individual interfering strands and use the obtained data to build machine learning models that estimate kinetics. We then investigate the influence of pools of random strands and find that the kinetics are determined by only a small subpopulation of strongly interacting strands. Consequently, their behavior can be mimicked by a small collection of such strands. The equilibration of the circuit with the background sequences strongly influences this behavior, leading to up to one order of magnitude difference in reaction speed. Finally, we compare two established and a novel technique that speed up TMSD reactions in random sequence pools: a threeletter alphabet, protection of toeholds by intramolecular secondary structure, or by an additional blocking strand. While all of these techniques were useful, only the latter can be used without sequence constraints. We expect that our insights will be useful for the construction of TMSD circuits that are robust to molecular noise.",

Analyzing high-throughput multiplexed images of tissues has recently emerged as a routine clinical procedure for early detection, clinical cancer diagnosis, treatment planning and prognosis for many cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Multiplexed images enable the precise interpretation of spatial distribution of cells and cellular states and the characterization of tumor-immune interactions in situ and at the single-cell level. Through two cornerstone image processing techniques - cell segmentation and image tiling generating quadrats - we perform an in-depth analysis of multiplexed images based on the frequency, phenotype, and spatial distribution of immune and tumor cells within the immune landscape of NSCLC. Multiplexed images were obtained from nine patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC with progression who were treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Images were collected from all patients both pre- and on-treatment (days 15-21). We profile [~]100K cells and [~]10K quadrats from tumor and adjacent tissues to characterize cellular composition and spatial neighborhoods and elucidate that distinct spatial cellular ecologies exist across progressive disease (PD) and stable disease (SD) patients where tumors of PD patients are characterized by a highly suppressed immune environment prior to treatment enabling higher chances of disease progression during treatment. These fundamentally distinct architectures across PD and SD patients enable disease progression prediction and clinical biomarker identification. Our results also provide a potential companion biomarker for PD-L1 in NSCLC. Validating the biomarker and its feasibility will require further in-depth investigation.",

    "abstract": "The foraging behavior of honeybees is one of the most systematically composed behaviors among social insects which are admirable to watch. The main purpose of honeybee foraging is to collect food for their colony and since ancient days honeybee products have been used for various medicinal purposes (Singh and Takhellambam 2021). During foraging, honeybees gather information and transmit to their colony members regarding the location, distance, and profitability of forage sites with the help of unique movements called waggle dance. The capacities of honeybees time memory enable the foragers to return to a good food source in anticipation of the time of day. This highly intellectual, dynamic, and well-coordinated behavior of honeybees makes them to be one of the best choices of behavioral model to study various aspects of dynamic behaviors. As a result, vast knowledge in honeybee behavior has been accumulated and several recent studies immerge towards finding the underpinning regulatory biology of honeybee foraging behaviors. Immediate early genes (IE) genes are well documented neural markers and their promising roles in honeybee foraging have been demonstrated. Two of our recent studies showed three IE genes Egr-1, Hr38 and Kakusei involvement during the daily foraging of honeybees. This finding has provided an avenue to further explore and identify the regulatory genes/proteins and neurons that underlie a specific behavior such as learning, memory, communication, and interaction etc. In this study we further analyze our previous published data to examine interaction of the three genes during the daily foraging of honeybees.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal colonization by commensal bacteria is a reproducible yet complex process. Mapping the spatiotemporal and genetic factors driving microbial colonization of the gut is key to understanding the gut microbiome and improving clinical interventions that treat dysbiosis. Here, we explored a murine gut colonization model that leveraged the natural inter-individual variations in gut microbiomes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We identified a natural  super-donor consortium that universally engrafts into diverse recipients and resists reciprocal colonization. Upon FMT, the super-donor microbiota displaces a significant fraction of the recipient microbiome and stably persists over months. Metagenomic sequencing of this consortium revealed diverse metabolic genes that could participate in nutrient niche expansion. Temporal profiling of the gut microbiome showed an ordered succession of rapid engraftment by early colonizers within 72 hours followed by a slower emergence of late colonizers over 15-30 days. Moreover, microbial engraftment was localized to specific compartments of the gastrointestinal tract in a species-specific manner. Spatial metagenomic characterization and functional studies suggested that stable engraftment was mediated by simultaneous transfer of spatially co-localizing species from the super-donor consortia, many of which belonged to the Bacteroidales order. These results offer a mechanism of super-donor colonization by which nutritional niches are expanded in a spatiotemporally-mediated manner to promote successful engraftment into a resident gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clock and chromatin remodeling complexes are tightly intertwined systems that regulate rhythmic gene expression. The circadian clock promotes rhythmic expression, timely recruitment, and/or activation of chromatin remodelers, while chromatin remodelers regulate accessibility of clock transcription factors to the DNA to influence expression of clock genes. We previously reported that the BRAHMA (BRM) chromatin remodeling complex promotes the repression of circadian gene expression in Drosophila. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which the circadian clock feeds back to modulate daily BRM activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we observed rhythmic BRM binding to clock gene promoters despite constitutive BRM protein expression, suggesting that factors other than protein abundance are responsible for rhythmic BRM occupancy at clock-controlled loci. Since we previously reported that BRM interacts with two key clock proteins, CLOCK (CLK) and TIMELESS (TIM), we examined their effect on BRM occupancy to the period (per) promoter. We observed reduced BRM binding to the DNA in clk null flies, suggesting that CLK is involved in enhancing BRM occupancy to initiate transcriptional repression at the conclusion of the activation phase. Additionally, we observed reduced BRM binding to the per promoter in flies overexpressing TIM, suggesting that TIM promotes BRM removal from DNA. This conclusion is further supported by elevated BRM binding to the per promoter in flies subjected to constant light. In summary, this study provides new insights into the reciprocal regulation between the circadian clock and the BRM chromatin remodeling complex.\n\nAuthor SummaryCircadian clocks are endogenous time-keeping mechanisms that allow organisms to anticipate and adapt to daily changes in their external environment. These clocks are driven by a molecular oscillator that generates rhythms in the expression of many genes, termed clock-controlled genes. The genomic DNA containing these clock-controlled genes are also modified in a rhythmic manner throughout the day. DNA are more tightly packaged with histone proteins when transcription of clock-controlled genes is repressed while the interaction between DNA and histone proteins are more relaxed during transcriptional activation. We found that two key clock proteins, CLOCK and TIMELESS, regulate daily rhythmicity in the binding of BRAHMA, a chromatin remodeler, to DNA spanning clock-controlled genes to facilitate their rhythmic gene expression cycles. Moreover, because TIMELESS is sensitive to light, our study provides new insights into how light can affect DNA structure and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Complex patterns of genome and life-history evolution associated with the end-Cretaceous (K- Pg) mass extinction event limit our understanding of the early evolutionary history of crown group birds [1-9]. Here, we assess molecular heterogeneity across living birds using a technique enabling inferred sequence substitution models to transition across the history of a clade [10]. Our approach identifies distinct and contrasting regimes of molecular evolution across exons, introns, untranslated regions, and mitochondrial genomes. Up to fifteen shifts in the mode of avian molecular evolution map to rapidly diversifying clades near the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary, demonstrating a burst of genomic disparity early in the evolutionary history of crown birds [11-13]. Using simulation and machine learning techniques, we show that shifts in developmental mode [14] or adult body mass [4] best explain transitions in the mode of nucleotide substitution. These patterns are related, in turn, to macroevolutionary shifts in the allometric scaling relationship between basal metabolic rate and body mass [15, 16]. In agreement with theoretical predictions, this scaling relationship appears to have weakened across the end-Cretaceous transition. Overall, our study provides evidence that the Chicxulub bolide impact [17] triggered integrated patterns of evolution across avian genomes, physiology, and life history that structured the evolutionary potential of modern birds.",

However, little is known about the biological pattern of genome-wide structural variations (SVs) and the evolutionary forces underlying SVs. Here, we conducted genomic sequencing and analyses based on Nanopore long reads and Illumina short reads technology. We called SVs between the two subspecies (China vs. India), using three methods of assembly-based and long-reads-based algorithms. Interestingly, we found significantly more SVs in X-chromosome than in autosomes, consistent with the expectation of the faster-X divergence at the subspecies level. With the fine-scale methylation frequencies and recombination rates, we found duplications with significantly lower methylation frequencies while higher recombination rates than other types of SVs, suggesting a higher level of transcriptional and evolutionary potential for duplications than for other SVs types. A genome-wide scan of selective sweep revealed that over 3% of SVs are under positive selection. Moreover, X chromosome showed significantly higher number of positively selected SVs than do autosomes, suggesting the \"faster-X effect\" of SVs. Our study revealed a different evolutionary importance for duplications compared with other SVs forms. We also revealed the \"faster-X effect\" of SVs, which could provide raw material upon which positive selection can further play.",

    "abstract": "Single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is widely used to study tissues and diseases. However, the technique remains challenging, as cytoplasmic RNA often contaminates nuclei-containing droplets and may even complicate the removal of empty droplets. Incomplete removal of contaminated background signal masks cell type-specific signal and interferes with differential gene expression analysis. Thus, removing empty droplets and highly contaminated nuclei is of paramount importance in snRNA-seq analysis. This is especially the case in solid tissues such as the heart. Here, we present QClus, a novel nuclei filtering method targeted to human heart samples. In the human heart, most of the contamination originates from cytoplasmic RNA, stemming from cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we use specific metrics such as splicing, mitochondrial gene expression, nuclear gene expression, and non-cardiomyocyte and cardiomyocyte marker gene expression to cluster nuclei and filter empty and highly contaminated droplets. This approach combined with other filtering steps enables for flexible, automated, and reliable cleaning of samples with varying number of nuclei, quality, and contamination levels. To confirm the robustness of our method, we ran QClus on our dataset of 32 human heart samples and compared results to six alternative methods. None of the methods resulted in the same filtering quality as QClus, each of them failing significantly in some samples. As snRNA-seq is predominantly used on unique human tissue samples, sample failure due to inadequate data processing seems unacceptable. Our study shows that, instead of using universal preprocessing methods, challenging tissue types, such as heart tissue, may benefit from methods that are more specific to the tissue under study, as QClus outperforms the other methods primarily due to improved integration of sample type-specific features.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in shape, ranging from amorphous aggregates to amyloid fibrils. Possibly for such heterogeneity, strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we present a new strategy by which we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. Thus, they act on dynamic precursors before a mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using a peptide array approach, we first identified peptides inhibiting the predominantly amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation-prone protein, a thermolabile mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. A series of optimization steps revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants. The key properties that made a peptide active were a composition of 20-30% flexible, 30-40% aliphatic and 20-30% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1 and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. Remarkably, the optimized peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimers disease, and entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early aggregation stages, independent of the aggregation mechanism, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross-mechanistic, multi-targeting aggregation inhibitors may be attractive lead compounds against multiple protein aggregation diseases.",

In addition, the insulin-regulated PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway plays an important role in the regulation of islet cell proliferation and this pathway is hyperactivated in human non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). We therefore investigated the effect of a very low carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet) on a mouse model that develops non-functional PanNETs to ask how reduced PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling might affect the development and progression of non-functional PanNET. We found that this dietary intervention resulted in lower PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling in islet cells and a significant reduction in PanNET formation and progression. We also found that this treatment had a significant effect on the suppression of pituitary NET development. Furthermore, we found that non-functional PanNET patients with lower blood glucose levels tend to have a better prognosis than patients with higher blood glucose levels. This preclinical study shows that a dietary intervention that results in lower serum insulin levels leads to lower insulin signal within the neuroendocrine cells and has a striking suppressive effect on the development and progression of both pancreatic and pituitary NETs.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of genetic studies on late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimers disease (AD) remain unclear. Furthermore, different cell types in the central nervous system (CNS) play distinct roles in the onset and progression of AD pathology. To better comprehend the complex etiology of AD, we used an integrative approach to build robust predictive (causal) network models which were cross-validated over multiple large human multi-omics datasets in AD. We employed a published method to delineate bulk-tissue gene expression into single cell-type gene expression and integrated clinical and pathologic traits of AD, single nucleotide variation, and deconvoluted gene expression for the construction of predictive network models for each cell type in AD. With these predictive causal models, we are able to identify and prioritize robust key drivers of the AD-associated network state. In this study, we focused on neuron-specific network models and prioritized 19 predicted key drivers modulating AD pathology. These targets were validated via shRNA knockdown in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons (iNs), in which 10 out of the 19 neuron-related targets (JMJD6, NSF, NUDT2, YWHAZ, RBM4, DCAF12, NDRG4, STXBP1, ATP1B1, and FIBP) significantly modulated levels of amyloid-beta and/or phosphorylated tau peptides in the postmitotic iNs. Most notably, knockdown of JMJD6 significantly altered the neurotoxic ratios of A{beta}42 to 40 and p231-tau to total tau, indicating its potential therapeutic relevance to both amyloid and tau pathology in AD. Molecular validation by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in iNs further confirmed the network structure, showing significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes after knockdown of the validated targets. Interestingly, our network model predicts that these 10 key drivers are upstream regulators of REST and VGF, two recently identified key regulators of AD pathogenesis.",

Here we describe a completely novel role for natriuretic peptide signaling in the control of neural crest (NC) and cranial placode (CP) progenitors formation. Among the components of this signaling pathway, we show that natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (Npr3) plays a pivotal role by differentially regulating two developmental programs through its dual function as clearance and signaling receptor. Using a combination of MO-based knockdowns, pharmacological inhibitors and rescue assays we demonstrate that Npr3 cooperate with guanylate cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (Npr1) and natriuretic peptides (Nppa/Nppc) to regulate NC and CP formation, pointing at a broad requirement of this signaling pathway in early embryogenesis. We propose that Npr3 acts as a clearance receptor to regulate local concentrations of natriuretic peptides for optimal cGMP production through Npr1 activation, and as a signaling receptor to control cAMP levels through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The intracellular modulation of these second messengers therefore participates in the segregation of NC and CP cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Maternally transmitted endosymbiotic bacteria that cause male killing (MK) have only been described from a few insects, but this may reflect challenges in their detection rather than a rarity of MK. Here we identify MK Wolbachia in populations of Drosophila pseudotakahashii, present at a low frequency (around 4%) in natural populations and previously undetected due to a different fixed Wolbachia strain in this species expressing a different reproductive manipulation, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). The MK phenotype was eliminated after tetracycline treatment that removed Wolbachia. Molecular analyses indicated the MK phenotype to be expressed when a second Wolbachia strain was present alongside the CI Wolbachia. A genomic analysis highlighted Wolbachia regions diverged between the strains involving 17 genes and also identified the Wolbachia as representing an outgroup to a clade of Wolbachia infecting melanogaster-group species, including wRi-like and wMel-like strains. Doubly infected males induced CI with uninfected females but not females singly infected with CI-causing Wolbachia. The MK phenotype manifested at the larval stage and was transmitted maternally at a high fidelity but with occasional loss of the MK Wolbachia strain. A rapidly spreading dominant nuclear suppressor genetic element affecting MK was identified through backcrossing and subsequent analysis with ddRAD SNPs of the D. pseudotakahashii genome. These findings highlight the complexity of nuclear and microbial components affecting MK endosymbiont detection and dynamics in populations, and the challenges of making connections between endosymbionts and the host phenotypes affected by them.",

We have previously detected a decrease in the levels of six miRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-499a-5p) in parents and their children inherited at a lower level. Here, we suggest that down-regulation of each of these six miRNAs inherited from parents contributes to the development of children with autism. We compare their levels of distribution in each family between the autistic child and siblings. We find that the distribution of levels of these miRNAs in siblings (undiagnosed as autism) is not always higher than in autistic children, but it is at varying levels. These data support a model in which autistic behavior relies on low levels of the six miRNAs expressed in children potentially associated with autistic syndrome (ASD). The intimate link between miRNAs levels and behavioral characteristics suggests possibilities for understanding the basic circuitry involved in autism and thus advancing partial knowledge of brain functions. An early diagnosis of autism helps provide children an environment conducive to their development.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/512859v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176d6f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a4ebforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@280f67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3659_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis encounters diverse microenvironments as it attempts to establish itself within its human host. The bacterium survives oxidative assault (ROS and RNS) when it is inside the host macrophages. Redox sensory and regulation processes therefore assume significant importance, as these are essential processes for M. tuberculosis to survive under these hostile conditions. The thioredoxin system that maintains balance between the thiol/dithiol couple plays a key role in maintaining redox homeostasis in M. tuberculosis. The most explored function of the thioredoxin system is elimination of toxic molecules such as free radicals, while very little is known about its role in other metabolic processes. In the present study, we aimed to reduce the knowledge gap about the thioredoxin system in M. tuberculosis. We attempted to capture targets of all the thioredoxins (viz., TrxB and TrxC) and a thioredoxin-like protein, NrdH in M. tuberculosis under aerobic and hypoxic conditions by performing thioredoxin trapping chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Targets were classified using the PANTHER classification system and most enriched processes were figured out using Gene Ontology analysis. We found that TrxC captured the maximum number of targets in both the physiological conditions. Also, we suggest that the thioredoxin system might play an important role in hypoxic conditions by targeting proteins responsible to sense and maintain hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, our studies establish a link between TrxB and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in M. tuberculosis. Ultimately, these findings open a novel avenue to target the thioredoxin system for screening new anti-mycobacterial drug targets.\n\nImportanceTuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by bacteria M. tuberculosis, is the leading cause of death in the list of infectious diseases. Worldwide 1.7 billion people are estimated to be infected with TB, containing active and latent cases. An alarming situation is that M. tuberculosis has developed resistance against one or many of the first line drugs leading to emergence of drug resistant or multidrug resistant TB. Novel drugs targeting the drug resistant bacteria is an urgent need to cure the disease. Our study provides the framework to identify new drug targets. The significance of our study is to understand the thioredoxin system in more details by identifying their target proteins, which might facilitate development of new anti-tubercular drugs.",

    "abstract": "In aging and disease, cellular NAD+ is depleted by catabolism to nicotinamide (NAM) and NAD+ supple-mentation is being pursued to enhance human healthspan and lifespan. Activation of nicoti namide phosphoribosyl -transferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting step in NAD+ biosynthesis, has potential to increase salvage of NAM. Novel NAMPT positive allosteric modulators (N-PAMs) were discovered in addition to demonstration of NAMPT activati on by biogenic phenols. The mechanism of activation was revealed through synthesis of novel chemical probes, new NAMPT co-crystal structures, and enzyme kinetics. Binding to a rear channel in NAMPT regulates NAM binding and turnover, with biochemical observations being replicated by NAD+ measurements in human cells. The mechanism of action of N-PAMs identifies, for the first time, the role of the rear channel in regulation of NAMPT turnover coupled to feedback inhibition by NAM. N-PAM inhibition of low affinity, non-productive NAM binding via the rear channel, causes a right-shif t in KI(NAM) that accompanies an increase in enzyme activity. Conversion of an N-PAM to a high-affinity l igand blocks both high and low affinity NAM binding, ablating enzyme activity. In the presence of an N-PAM, NAMPT boosts NAD+ biosynthesis at higher NAM concentrations, in addition to relieving inhibition by NAD+. Since cellular stress often leads to enhanced catabolism of NAD+ to NAM, this mechanism is relevant to supporting cellular N AD+ levels in aging and disease. The tight regulation of cellular NAMPT is differentially regulated by N-PAMs and other activators, indicating that different classes of pharmacological activators may be engineered for cell and tissue selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Chemical herbicides are the primary weed management tool, although several incidences of herbicide resistance have been emerged, causing serious threat to agricultural sustainability. Plant derived phenolic acids with herbicidal potential may provide organic and eco-friendly substitute to such harmful chemicals. In present study, efficacy of two phenolic compounds, ferulic acid (FA) and gallic acid (GA), were evaluated in vitro and in vivo against three prevalent herbicide-resistant weed species (Sinapis arvensis, Lolium multiflorum and Parthenium hysterophorus). FA and GA not only suppressed the weed germination (80 to 60 % respectively), but also inhibited biochemical and photosynthetic pathway of weeds. In addition to significantly lowering the total protein and chlorophyll contents of the targeted weed species, the application of FA and GA treatments increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation. Photosynthetic gene (psbA) expression was downregulated (10 to 30 folds) post 48 h of phenolic application. In silico analysis for receptor identification of FA and GA in psbA protein (D1) showed histidine (his-198) and threonine (thr-286) as novel receptors of FA and GA. These two receptors differ from the D1 amino acid receptors which have previously been identified (serine-264 and histidine-215) in response to PSII inhibitor herbicides. Based on its toxicity responses, structural analogs of FA were also designed. Four out of twelve analogs (0.25 mM) significantly inhibited weed germination (30 to 40%) while enhancing their oxidative stress. These results are unique which provide fundamental evidence of phytotoxicity of FA and GA and their analogs to develop cutting-edge plant based formulation to suppress weed growth in future.",

    "abstract": "Protein-based biologics are highly suitable for drug development, as they exhibit low toxicity and high specificity for their targets. However, for therapeutic applications, biologics must often be formulated to very high concentrations, making insufficient solubility a critical bottleneck in drug development pipelines. Here, we report an ultra-high-throughput microfluidic platform for protein solubility screening. In comparison with previous methods, this microfluidic platform can make, incubate, and measure samples in a few minutes, uses just 20 micrograms of protein (> 10-fold improvement) and yields 10,000 data points (1000-fold improvement). This allows quantitative comparison of formulation additives, such as salt, polysorbate, histidine, arginine and sucrose. Additionally, we can measure how solubility is affected by different concentrations of multiple additives, find a suitable pH for the formulation, and measure the impact of single mutations on solubility, thus enabling the screening of large libraries. By reducing material and time costs, this approach makes detailed multi-dimensional solubility optimization experiments possible, streamlining drug development and increasing our understanding of biotherapeutic solubility and the effects of excipients.",

    "abstract": "During locomotion, soft-bodied terrestrial animals solve complex control problems at substrate interfaces, but our understanding of how they achieve this without rigid components remains incomplete. Here, we develop new all-optical methods based on optical interference in a deformable substrate to measure ground reaction forces (GRFs) with micrometre and nanonewton precision in behaving Drosophila larvae. Combining this with a kinematic analysis of substrate interfacing features, we shed new light onto the biomechanical control of larval locomotion. Crawling in larvae measuring [~]1 mm in length involves an intricate pattern of cuticle sequestration and planting, producing GRFs of 1-7 N. We show that larvae insert and expand denticulated, feet-like structures into substrates as they move, a process not previously observed in soft bodied animals. These  protopodia form dynamic anchors to compensate counteracting forces. Our work provides a framework for future biomechanics research in soft-bodied animals and promises to inspire improved soft-robot design.",

Here, we review anti-E6 antibodies/antibody fragments generated by us and others, as well as present our latest results with Camelidae-derived single-domain antibodies (sdAbs). We had previously isolated a pool of anti-E6 sdAbs to identify E6 binders with the potential to be used clinically and in research. While our previous work has focused on recombinant E6 proteins, here we evaluated these sdAbs binding capacity to the endogenous E6 protein using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. We obtained reproducible results in these applications with two sdAbs, filling a gap in HPV research. Despite their apparent E6 binding ability, these sdAbs do not raise p53 levels or induce apoptosis. Thus, while these reagents are valuable diagnostic and detection tools, identifying their therapeutic potential will require further development and testing.",

To delineate how A3B recognises its substrates and unveil the underlying mechanism leading to the formation of ER-induced DSB, we sampled A3B-mediated deamination sites using whole genome sequencing in a human breast cancer cell model lacking base excision repair function. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that C>U conversions carried out by A3B in R-loop structures are processed into DSB in the vicinity of ER promoters or enhancers. A mechanism which required both the processing of A3B-editing sites and R-loops by distinct DNA damage repair mechanisms. In addition, using BioID-enabled mass-spectroscopy proteomics, we identified TDRD3 as a key A3B-binding partner directing the activity of A3B to ER-induced R-loops.

To analyze the activation mechanism of appetitive CeA neurons, we characterized Serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a)-expressing neurons (CeAHtr2a) that comprise three appetitive clusters and were previously shown to promote feeding. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that CeAHtr2a neurons are activated by fasting, the hormone ghrelin, and the presence of food. Moreover, these neurons are required for the orexigenic effects of ghrelin. Appetitive CeA neurons responsive to fasting and ghrelin project to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) causing inhibition of target PBN neurons. These results illustrate how the transcriptomic diversification of CeA neurons relates to fasting and hormone-regulated feeding behavior.\n\nHighlightsTranscriptomics reveals four appetitive, two aversive and three unknown CeA clusters\n\nGhrelin and fasting activate CeAHtr2a neurons comprising three appetitive clusters\n\nGhrelins orexigenic effects require the activity of appetitive CeA neurons\n\nCeA[-&gt;]PBN inhibition is necessary for ghrelin/fasting induced feeding",

    "abstract": "Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is widely accepted as a mechanism through which the brain can learn information from different stimuli(1, 2). Basing synaptic changes on the timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes enhances contributing edges within a network(3, 4). While STDP rules control the evolution of networks, most research focuses on spiking rates or specific activation paths when evaluating learned information(5-7). However, since STDP augments structural weights, synapses may also contain embedded information. While imaging studies demonstrate physical changes to synapses due to STDP, these changes have not been interrogated based on their embedding capacity of a stimulus(8-12). Here, we show that networks with biological features and STDP rules can embed information on their stimulus into their synaptic weights. We use a k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the synaptic weights of thousands of independent networks to identify their stimulus with high accuracy based on local neighborhoods, demonstrating that the network structure can store stimulus information. While spike rates and timings remain useful, structural embed-dings represent a new way to integrate information within a biological network. Our results demonstrate that there may be value in observing these changes directly. Beyond computational applications for monitoring these structural changes, this analysis may also inform investigation into neuroscience. Research is underway on the potential of astrocytes to integrate synapses in the brain and communicate that information elsewhere(13-15). In addition, observations of these synaptic embeddings may lead to novel therapies for memory disorders that are difficult to explain with current paradigms, such as transient epileptic amnesia.\n\nSignificance StatementLearning in the brain is often achieved via spike-timing dependent plasticity changing the structure of synapses to augment the strength between neurons. Typically, these changes contribute to other behaviors in the network, such as spiking rates or spike timings. However, observing these changes themselves may be fruitful for interrogating the learning capability of networks in the brain. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the synaptic weights contain an embedding of the stimulus after a certain amount of recurrent activity occurs. It is possible that networks in the brain embed information in a similar way and that external readers, such as astrocytes, can interrogate, integrate, and transport this synaptic weight information to process stimuli.",

Styxl2 is specifically expressed in vertebrate striated muscles. By gene knockdown or genetic knockout, we found that Styxl2 plays an essential role in maintaining sarcomere integrity in developing muscles of both zebrafish and mice. To further reveal the functions of Styxl2 in adult muscles, we generated two inducible knockout mouse models: one with Styxl2 being deleted in mature myofibers to assess its role in sarcomere maintenance, and the other in adult muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) to assess its role in de novo sarcomere assembly. We find that Styxl2 is not required for sarcomere maintenance but functions in de novo sarcomere assembly during injury-induced muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, Styxl2 interacts with non-muscle myosin IIs, enhances their ubiquitination, and targets them for autophagy-dependent degradation. Without Styxl2, the degradation of non-muscle myosin IIs is delayed, which leads to defective sarcomere assembly and force generation. Thus, Styxl2 promotes de novo sarcomere assembly by interacting with non-muscle myosin IIs and facilitating their autophagic degradation.",

    "abstract": "Clustering of neuronal L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCC) in the plasma membrane is increasingly implicated in creating highly localized Ca2+ signaling nanodomains. For example, LTCC activation can increase phosphorylation of the nuclear CREB transcription factor by increasing Ca2+ concentrations within a nanodomain close to the channel, without requiring bulk Ca2+ increases in the cytosol or nucleus. However, the molecular basis for LTCC clustering is poorly understood. The postsynaptic scaffolding protein Shank3 specifically associates with one of the major neuronal LTCCs, the CaV1.3 calcium channel, and is required for optimal LTCC-dependent excitation-transcription coupling. Here, we co-expressed CaV1.3 1 subunits with two distinct epitope-tags with or without Shank3 in HEK cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using the cell lysates revealed that Shank3 can assemble multiple CaV1.3 1 subunits in a complex under basal conditions. Moreover, CaV1.3 LTCC complex formation was facilitated by CaV{beta} subunits ({beta}3 and {beta}2a), which also interact with Shank3. Shank3 interactions with CaV1.3 LTCCs and multimeric CaV1.3 LTCC complex assembly were disrupted following addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to cell lysates, perhaps simulating conditions within an activated CaV1.3 LTCC nanodomain. In intact HEK293T cells, co-expression of Shank3 enhanced the intensity of membrane-localized CaV1.3 LTCC clusters under basal conditions, but not after Ca2+channel activation. Live cell imaging studies also revealed that Ca2+ influx through LTCCs disassociated Shank3 from CaV1.3 LTCCs clusters and reduced the CaV1.3 cluster intensity. Deletion of the PDZ domain from Shank3 prevented both binding to CaV1.3 and the changes in multimeric CaV1.3 LTCC complex assembly in vitro and in HEK293 cells. Finally, we found that shRNA knock-down of Shank3 expression in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons reduced the intensity of surface-localized CaV1.3 LTCC clusters in dendrites. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism contributing to neuronal LTCC clustering under basal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Across the nervous system, neurons with similar attributes are topographically organized. This topography reflects developmental pressures. Oddly, vestibular (balance) nuclei are thought to be disorganized. By measuring activity in birthdated neurons, we revealed a functional map within the central vestibular projection nucleus that stabilizes gaze in the larval zebrafish. We first discovered that both somatic position and stimulus selectivity follow projection neuron birthdate. Next, with electron microscopy and loss-of-function assays, we found that patterns of peripheral innervation to projection neurons were similarly organized by birthdate. Lastly, birthdate revealed spatial patterns of axonal arborization and synapse formation to projection neuron outputs. Collectively, we find that development reveals previously hidden organization to the input, processing, and output layers of a highly-conserved vertebrate sensorimotor circuit. The spatial and temporal attributes we uncover constrain the developmental mechanisms that may specify the fate, function, and organization of vestibulo-ocular reflex neurons. More broadly, our data suggest that, like invertebrates, temporal mechanisms may assemble vertebrate sensorimotor architecture.",

    "abstract": "Aggregative multicellularity relies on cooperation among individual cells to form a multicellular body. In Dictyostelium discoideum this cooperation is maintained by high relatedness. Previous work showed that experimental evolution under low-relatedness resulted in an increase of cheaters (cells that contribute proportionally more to spores than to the sterile stalk) and that many clones completely lost cooperation and the ability to form fruiting bodies. Here, we investigate the genomic changes underlying the evolution of the cheating phenotype using whole-genome sequencing and variant analysis of these previously evolved D. discoideum lines. We identified 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 29 genes, none of which have been previously implicated in cheating. Each gene has one variant except for the G protein-coupled receptor grlG, which has at least one variant in over half of the lines. Upon identifying the parallel evolution of grlG, we screened additional clones to investigate the correlation between variants in the gene and the loss of cooperation (identified by the inability to form a fruiting body). We found that variants in the 5 half of grlG that impact the signal peptide or extracellular binding domain are significantly associated with the loss of cooperation (non-fruiting); the association was not significant in the 3 half of the gene. This suggests that the loss of grlG was adaptive under low-relatedness and that the 5 half of the gene in particular is important for cooperation and multicellular development. This confirms the importance of high relatedness in the evolution of altruism in the social amoeba D. discoideum.",

PiRNAs are produced from long single-stranded non-coding transcripts, from protein-coding transcripts, as well as from transposons. While some sites that produce piRNAs are in deeply conserved syntenic regions, in general, piRNAs and piRNA-producing loci turnover faster than other functional parts of the genome. To learn about the sequence changes that contribute to the fast evolution of piRNAs, we set out to analyse piRNA expression between genetically different mice. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of small RNAs from the mouse male germline of four classical inbred strains, one inbred wild-derived strain and one outbred strain. We find that genetic differences between individuals underlie variation in piRNA expression. We report significant differences in piRNA production at loci with endogenous retrovirus insertions. Strain-specific piRNA-producing loci include protein-coding genes. Our findings provide evidence that transposable elements contribute to inter-individual differences in expression, and potentially to the fast evolution of piRNA-producing loci in mammals.",

Here, we present a high spatial and temporal resolution technology that can be activated on demand using light, for high accuracy proximity labeling. Our system, called Light Activated BioID (LAB), is generated by fusing the two halves of the split-TurboID proximity labeling enzyme to the photodimeric proteins CRY2 and CIB1. Using live cell imaging, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and mass spectrometry, we show that upon exposure to blue light, CRY2 and CIB1 dimerize, reconstitute the split-TurboID enzyme, and biotinylate proximate proteins. Turning off the light halts the biotinylation reaction. We validate LAB in different cell types and demonstrate that it can identify known binding partners of proteins while reducing background labeling and false positives.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDrug synergy prediction is a complex problem typically approached with machine learning techniques using molecular data, pharmacological data, and knowledge of biological-interaction networks. The recently published Cancer Drug Atlas (CDA) uses a logistic regression model to predict a binary synergy outcome in cell-line models by utilizing drug target information, knowledge of genes mutated in each model, and the models monotherapy drug sensitivity. However, we observed low performance, 0.33, of the CDA measured by Pearson correlation of predicted versus measured sensitivity when we evaluated datasets from six studies that were not considered during the development of the CDA. Here we describe improvements to the CDA algorithm, the Augmented CDA, that improved performance by 71% and robustness to dataset variations in drug response values.\n\nResultsWe augmented the drug-synergy prediction-modeling approach CDA described in Narayan et al. by applying a random forest regression and optimization via cross-validation hyper-parameter tuning. We benchmarked the performance of our Augmented CDA (ACDA) compared to the original CDA algorithm using datasets from DrugComb, an open-access drug-combination screening data resource. The ACDAs performance is 71% higher than that of the CDA when trained and validated on the same dataset spanning ten tissues. The ACDA performs marginally better (6% increase) than the CDA when trained on one dataset and validated on another dataset in 22 cases that cover seven tissues. We also compared the performance of ACDA to one of the winners of the DREAM Drug Combination Prediction Challenge (Mikhail Zaslavskiys algorithm which we denoted as EN). The performance of EN was smaller than that of the ACDA in 15 out of 19 cases. In addition to data from cell lines, we also trained the ACDA algorithm on Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research PDX encyclopedia (NIBR PDXE) data and generated sensitivity predictions for the cases where drug-combination tumor-volume measurements were unavailable. Finally, we developed an approach to visualize synergy-prediction data using dendrograms and heatmaps instead of the Voronoi diagrams used in the CDA. The latter has a complex algorithmic realization and no publicly available implementation, whereas the ACDA visualization approach is more transparent and has open access. We implemented and wrapped the ACDA algorithm in an easy-to-use python package available from PyPI.\n\nAvailabilityThe source code is available at https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/drug-synergy, and the software package can be installed directly from PyPI using pip.\n\nContactAnuj.Srivastava@jax.org, Carol.Bult@jax.org",

Animals lacking MUC1 exhibit mild reduction in bone density. These phenotypes could be a consequence of modulation of bodily Ca homeostasis by MUC1, as suggested by the previous observation that MUC1 enhances cell surface expression of the Ca2+-selective channel, TRPV5 in cultured unpolarized cells. Using biotinylation of cell-surface proteins, we asked whether MUC1 influences endocytosis of TRPV5 and another Ca2+-selective TRP channel, TRPV6, in cultured polarized epithelial cells. Results indicate that MUC1 reduces endocytosis of both channels, enhancing cell surface expression. Further, mice lacking MUC1 lose apical localization of TRPV5 and TRPV6 in the renal tubular and duodenal epithelium. Females, but not males, lacking MUC1 exhibit reduced blood Ca2+. However, mice lacking MUC1 exhibited no differences in basal urinary Ca excretion or Ca retention in response to PTH receptor signaling, suggesting compensation by transport mechanisms independent of TRPV5 and TRPV6. Finally, humans with autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to frame-shift mutation of MUC1 (ADTKD-MUC1) exhibit reduced plasma Ca concentrations compared to control individuals with mutations in the gene encoding uromodulin (ADTKD-UMOD), consistent with MUC1 haploinsufficiency causing reduced bodily Ca2+.",

Recognition of multiple pathogens by a single NLR is rare and usually occurs via monitoring for changes to host proteins; few characterized NLRs have been shown to recognize multiple effectors. The barley NLR Mla has undergone functional diversification and Mla alleles recognize host-adapted isolates of barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei; Bgh). Here, we show that Mla3 also confers resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) in a dosage dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we discovered that the recognized effector from M. oryzae is PWL2, a host range determinant factor that prevents M. oryzae from infecting weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula). Mla3 has therefore convergently evolved the capacity to recognize effectors from diverse pathogens.",

This phenomenon deviates from the general finding that photosynthetic organisms evolve O2 upon illumination. By using different electron transport chain inhibitors, we showed that O2 consumption occurred around photosystem (PS) I and correlated with higher abundance of flavodiiron (Flv) A protein in ES thylakoid membranes. Furthermore, by measuring P700 absorption changes, we separated different alternative electron flow pathways and demonstrated that electron scavenging from the acceptor-side of PSI via O2 photoreduction is a major alternative pathway in ES.

    "abstract": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is an umbrella term describing the neuropathology of a clinically, genetically and pathologically heterogeneous group of diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Among the major FTLD pathological subgroups, FTLD with TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and FTLD with tau positive inclusions (FTLD-tau) are the most common, representing about 90% of the cases. Although alterations in DNA methylation have been consistently associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease, little is known for FTLD and its heterogeneous subgroups and subtypes. The main goal of this study was to investigate DNA methylation variation in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. We used frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from three FTLD cohorts (234 individuals), generated using the Illumina 450K or EPIC microarray. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for each cohort followed by meta-analysis to identify shared differential methylated loci across FTLD subgroups/subtypes. Additionally, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis to identify co-methylation signatures associated with FTLD and other disease-related traits. Wherever possible, we also incorporated relevant gene/protein expression data. After accounting for a conservative Bonferroni multiple testing correction, the EWAS meta-analysis revealed two differentially methylated loci in FTLD, one annotated to OTUD4 (5UTR-shore) and the other to NFATC1 (gene body-island). Of these loci, OTUD4 showed consistent upregulation of mRNA and protein expression in FTLD. Additionally, in the three independent co-methylation networks, OTUD4-containing modules were enriched for EWAS meta-analysis top loci and were strongly associated with the FTLD status. These co-methylation modules were enriched for genes implicated in the ubiquitin system, RNA/stress granule formation and glutamatergic synaptic signalling. Altogether, our findings identified novel FTLD-associated loci, and support a role for DNA methylation as a mechanism involved in the dysregulation of biological processes relevant to FTLD, highlighting novel potential avenues for therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) anorexigenic and anti-obesogenic effects are centrally mediated. Data on animals emphasize the importance of neuronal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) for feeding suppression, although it is unclear whether astrocytes participate in the transduction of anorectic GLP-1R-dependent signals. In humans, the brain circuitry underlying these effects remains insufficiently investigated. GLP-1R neuroanatomic localization in human hypothalamus, a brain region with a pivotal role in energy homeostasis regulation, is essential in order to improve our understanding of GLP-1 signaling pathways and central metabolic functions. The present study aimed to explore GLP-1R protein expression in human hypothalamus and its correlation with body mass index (BMI).\n\nMethodsSections of hypothalamus from 28 autopsy cases, 11 with normal weight (BMI < 25 Kg/m2) and 17 with non-normal weight (BMI [&ge;] 25 Kg/m2), were examined using immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence labeling.\n\nResultsProminent GLP-1R immunoexpression was detected in neurons of several hypothalamic nuclei, including paraventricular, supraoptic, and infundibular nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area (LH), and basal forebrain nuclei. Interestingly, in LH, GLP-1R protein expression was significantly decreased in individuals with BMI [&ge;] 25 Kg/m2, compared with normal weight counterparts (p=0.03). Furthermore, GLP-1R was moderately and negatively correlated ({tau}b=-0.347, p=0.024) with BMI levels only in the LH. GLP-1R extensively colocalized with the anorexigenic and anti-obesogenic neuropeptide nucleobindin-2/nesfatin-1, but not with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).\n\nConclusionThese data suggest a potential role for GLP-1R in the regulation of energy balance in human hypothalamus, possibly through interactions with nesfatin-1. In LH, an appetite- and reward-related brain region, reduced GLP-1R immunoexpression may contribute to dysregulation of homeostatic and/or hedonic feeding behavior. GLP-1R colocalization with nesfatin-1 in the basal forebrain, a cognition-related brain area, might give impetus towards elucidating additional central actions of GLP-1R.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome and intestinal immune system are engaged in a dynamic interplay that provides myriad benefits to host health. However, the microbiome can also elicit damaging inflammatory responses, and thus establishing harmonious immune-microbiome interactions is essential to maintain homeostasis. Gut microbes actively coordinate the induction of anti-inflammatory responses that establish these mutualistic interactions. Despite this, the microbial pathways that govern this dialogue remain poorly understood. We investigated the mechanisms through which the gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron exerts its immunomodulatory functions. Our data reveal that B. thetaiotaomicron stimulates production of the cytokine IL-10 via secreted factors that are packaged into outer membrane vesicles, in a TLR2 and MyD88 dependent manner. Using a transposon mutagenesis based screen, we identified a key role for the B. thetaiotaomicron encoded NQR complex, which regenerates NAD+ during respiration, in this process. Finally, we found that disruption of NQR reduces the capacity of B. thetaiotaomicron to induce IL-10 by impairing biogenesis of outer membrane vesicles. These data identify a microbial pathway with a previously unappreciated role in gut microbe mediated immunomodulation that may be targeted to manipulate the capacity of the microbiome to shape host immunity.\n\nKey pointsThe B. theta NQR complex coordinates OMV-driven TLR2-dependent IL-10 expression.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria evolving in natural and clinical settings experience spatial fluctuations of multiple factors and this heterogeneity is expected to affect bacterial adaptation. Notably, spatial heterogeneity in antibiotic concentrations is believed to accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistance. However, current literature overlooks the role of cell motility, which is key for bacterial survival and reproduction. Here, we consider a quantitative model for bacterial evolution in antibiotic gradients, where bacteria evolve under the stochastic processes of proliferation, death, mutation and migration. Numerical and analytical results show that cell motility has major effects on bacterial adaptation. If migration is relatively rare, it accelerates adaptation because resistant mutants can colonize neighbouring patches of increasing antibiotic concentration avoiding competition with wild-type cells; but if migration is common throughout the lifespan of bacteria, it decelerates adaptation by promoting genotypic mixing and ecological competition. If migration is sufficiently high, it can limit bacterial survival, and we derive conditions for such a regime. Similar patterns are observed in more complex scenarios, namely where bacteria can bias their motion or switch between motility phenotypes either stochastically or in a density-dependent manner. Overall, our work reveals limits to bacterial adaptation in antibiotic landscapes that are set by cell motility.",

Resembling bacterial persisters, a subset of genetically drug-susceptible C. glabrata cells can survive lethal exposure to the fungicidal echinocandin drugs. Herein, we show that macrophage internalization induces cidal drug tolerance in C. glabrata, expanding the persister reservoir from which echinocandin-resistant mutants emerge. We show that this drug tolerance is associated with non-proliferation and is triggered by macrophage-induced oxidative stress, and that deletion of genes involved in reactive oxygen species detoxification significantly increases the emergence of echinocandin-resistant mutants. Finally, we show that the fungicidal drug amphotericin B can kill intracellular C. glabrata echinocandin persisters, reducing emergence of resistance.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMethanotrophy by the sponge-hosted microbiome has been mainly reported in the ecological context of deep-sea hydrocarbon seep niches where methane is either produced geothermically or via anaerobic methanogenic archaea inhabiting the sulfate-depleted sediments. However, methane oxidizing bacteria from the candidate phylum Binatota have recently been described and shown to be present in oxic shallow-water marine sponges, where sources of methane remain undescribed.\n\nResultsHere, using an integrative -omics approach, we provide evidence for sponge-hosted bacterial methanogenesis occurring in fully oxygenated shallow water habitats. Specifically, we suggest methanogenesis occurs via at least two independent pathways involving methylamine and methylphosphonate transformations that, concomitantly to aerobic methane production, generate bioavailable nitrogen and phosphate, respectively. Methylphosphonate may be sourced from seawater continuously filtered by the sponge host. Methylamines may also be externally sourced or, alternatively, generated by a multi-step metabolic process where carnitine, derived from sponge cell debris, is transformed to methylamine by different sponge-hosted microbial lineages. Finally, methanotrophs specialized in pigment production, affiliated to the phylum Binatota, may provide a photoprotective function, closing a previously undescribed C1-metabolic loop that involves both the sponge host and specific members of the associated microbial community.\n\nConclusionGiven the global distribution of this ancient animal lineage and their remarkable water filtration activity, sponge hosted methane cycling may affect methane supersaturation in oxic coastal environments. Depending on the net balance between methanogenesis and methanotrophy, sponges may serve as marine sources or sinks of this potent greenhouse gas.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, clinicians are more and more confronted with the limitations of antibiotics to completely cure bacterial infections in patients. It has long been assumed that only antibiotic resistance plays a pivotal role in this. Indeed, the worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistance is considered as one of the major health threats of the 21st century. However, the presence of persister cells also has a significant influence on treatment outcomes. These antibiotic-tolerant cells are present in every bacterial population and are the result of the phenotypic switching of normal, antibiotic-sensitive cells. Persister cells complicate current antibiotic therapies and contribute to the development of resistance. In the past, extensive research has been performed to investigate persistence in laboratory settings, however, antibiotic tolerance in conditions that mimic the clinical setting is still poorly understood. In this study, we have optimized a mouse model for lung infections of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this model, mice are intratracheally infected with P. aeruginosa embedded in seaweed alginate beads and subsequently treated with tobramycin via nasal droplets. A strain panel of 18 P. aeruginosa isolates originating from environmental, human and animal clinical sources was selected to assess survival in the animal model. These survival levels were positively correlated with the survival levels determined via time-kill assays which is a common method to study persistence in the laboratory. We showed that both survival levels are comparable and thus that the classical persister assays are indicative for antibiotic tolerance in a clinical setting. The optimized animal model also allows us to test potential antipersister molecules and study persistence.\n\nImportanceThe importance of targeting persister cells in antibiotic therapies becomes more evident as these antibiotic-tolerant cells underlie relapsing infections and resistance development. Here, we studied persistence in a clinically relevant pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is one of the six ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) that are considered as a major health threat. P. aeruginosa is mostly known for causing chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. We mimicked these lung infections in a mouse model to study persistence in more clinical conditions. We showed that the survival levels of natural P. aeruginosa isolates in this model are positively correlated with the survival levels measured in classical persistence assays. These results not only validate the use of our current techniques to study persistence, but also open opportunities to study new persistence mechanisms or evaluate new antipersister compounds in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) dominated by Microcystis spp. have significant public health and economic implications in freshwater bodies around the world. These blooms are capable of producing a variety of cyanotoxins, including microcystins, that affect fishing and tourism industries, human and environmental health, and access to drinking water. In this study, we isolated and sequenced the genomes of 21 unialgal Microcystis cultures collected from western Lake Erie between 2017-2019. While some cultures isolated in different years have a high degree of genetic similarity (Average Nucleotide Identity >99%), genomic data shows that these cultures also represent much of the breadth of known Microcystis diversity in natural populations. Only 5 isolates contained all the genes required for microcystin synthesis while 2 isolates contained a previously described partial mcy operon. Microcystin production within cultures was also assessed using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and supported genomic results with high concentrations (up to 900 g L-1) in cultures with complete mcy operons and no or low toxin detected otherwise. These xenic cultures also contained a substantial diversity of bacteria associated with Microcystis, which has become increasingly recognized as an essential component of cyanoHAB community dynamics. These results highlight the genomic diversity among Microcystis strains and associated bacteria in Lake Erie, and their potential impacts on bloom development, toxin production, and toxin degradation.

    "abstract": "The gram-negative outer membrane (OM) is an asymmetric bilayer with phospholipids in its inner leaflet and mainly lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in its outer leaflet and is largely impermeable to many antibiotics. In Enterobacterales (e.g., Escherichia, Salmonella, Klebsiella, Yersinia), the outer leaflet of the OM also contains phosphoglyceride-linked enterobacterial common antigen (ECAPG). This molecule consists of the conserved ECA carbohydrate linked to diacylglycerol-phosphate (DAG-P) through a phosphodiester bond. ECAPG contributes to the OM permeability barrier and modeling suggests that it may alter the packing of LPS molecules in the OM. Here, we investigate, in Escherichia coli K-12, the reaction synthesizing ECAPG from ECA precursor linked to an isoprenoid carrier to identify the lipid donor that provides the DAG-P moiety to ECAPG. Through overexpression of phospholipid biosynthesis genes, we observed alterations expected to increase levels of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) increased synthesis of ECAPG, whereas alterations expected to decrease levels of PG decreased synthesis of ECAPG. We discovered depletion of PG levels in strains that could synthesize ECAPG, but not other forms of ECA, causes additional growth defects, likely due to the buildup of ECA precursor on the isoprenoid carrier inhibiting peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Our results demonstrate ECAPG can be synthesized in the absence of the other major phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin). Overall, these results conclusively demonstrate PG is the lipid donor for the synthesis of ECAPG and provide a key insight into the reaction producing ECAPG. In addition, these results provide an interesting parallel to lipoprotein acylation, which also uses PG as its DAG donor.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is a permeability barrier that prevents the entry of many antibiotics into the cell. However, the pathways responsible for outer membrane biogenesis are potential targets for small molecule development. Here, we investigate the synthesis of a form of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), ECAPG, found in the outer membrane of Enterobacterales such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Yersinia. ECAPG consists of the conserved ECA carbohydrate unit linked to diacylglycerol-phosphate--ECA is the headgroup of a phospholipid. The details of the reaction forming this molecule from ECA linked to an isoprenoid carrier are unknown. We determined that the lipid donor that provides the phospholipid moiety to ECAPG is phosphatidylglycerol. Understanding the synthesis of outer membrane constituents such as ECAPG provides the opportunity for the development of molecules to increase outer membrane permeability, expanding the antibiotics available to treat gram-negative infections.",

    "abstract": "The cellular Notch signal transduction pathway is intimately associated with infections by Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and other gamma-herpesviruses. RBP-Jk, the cellular DNA binding component of the canonical Notch pathway, is the key Notch downstream effector protein in virus-infected and uninfected animal cells. Reactivation of KSHV from latency requires the viral lytic switch protein, Rta, to form complexes with RBP-Jk on numerous sites within the viral DNA. Constitutive Notch activity is essential for KSHV pathophysiology in models of Kaposis sarcoma (KS) and Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL), and we demonstrate that Notch1 is also constitutively active in infected Vero cells. Although the KSHV genome contains >100 RBP-Jk DNA motifs, we show that none of the four isoforms of activated Notch can productively reactivate the virus from latency in a highly quantitative trans-complementing reporter virus system. Nevertheless, Notch contributed positively to reactivation because broad inhibition of Notch1-4 with gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) or expression of dominant negative mastermind-like1 (dnMAML1) coactivators severely reduced production of infectious KSHV from Vero cells. In infected PEL cells, we show that reduction of vDNA synthesis by GSI is associated with gene specific reduction of viral transcription. Specific inhibition of Notch1 by siRNA partially reduces production of infectious KSHV, and ectopic activated Notch (NICD1) enhances virus production induced by Valproic Acid (VPA) treatment. We conclude that constitutive Notch activity is required for robust production of infectious KSHV, and our results implicate activated Notch1 as a pro-viral member of a MAML1/RBP-Jk complex during viral reactivation.\n\nImportanceKaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates the host cell oncogenic Notch signaling pathway for viral reactivation from latency and cell pathogenesis. KSHV reactivation requires that the viral protein Rta functionally interacts with RBP-Jk, the DNA binding component of the Notch pathway, and with promoter DNA to drive transcription of productive cycle genes. We show that the Notch pathway is constitutively active during KSHV reactivation and is essential for robust production of infectious virus progeny. Inhibiting Notch during reactivation reduces expression of specific viral genes yet does not affect growth of the host cells. Although Notch cannot reactivate KSHV alone, the requisite expression of Rta reveals a previously unappreciated role for Notch in reactivation. We propose that activated Notch cooperates with Rta in a promoter-specific manner that is partially programmed by Rtas ability to redistribute RBP-Jk DNA binding to the virus during reactivation.",

DNA-encoded pause signals trigger elemental pausing by stabilizing a half-translocated (RNA-not-DNA) state and by promoting RNAP swiveling that other factors can enhance. The universal transcription factor NusG (Spt5 in eukaryotes and archaea) N-terminal domain (NGN) modulates pausing through contacts to RNAP and DNA. Pro-pausing NusGs (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) enhance some pauses whereas anti-pausing NusGs (e.g., Escherichia coli) suppress some pauses. Little is known about pausing and NusG in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Using biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy, we show that MtbNusG is a pro-pausing NusG that captures paused, swiveled RNAP by contacts to the RNAP protrusion and to a nontemplate strand-DNA wedge inserted between the NGN and the RNAP gate loop. On the other hand, we find that anti-pausing E. coli NGN contacts the RNAP gate loop to inhibit swiveling and pausing of MtbRNAP. Using CRISPR-mediated mycobacterial genetics, we show that a pro-pausing NGN is required to support robust mycobacterial growth. Our results define an essential function of NusG in mycobacteria and the structural basis of pro-vs. anti-pausing NusG activity with broad implications for NusG function in all domains of life.",

However, re-administration of the same AAV serotype is impossible due to the induction of anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Here we examined the feasibility of re-administration of AAV vectors to change the serotypes. We administered AAV3B, AAV5, or AAV8 vectors targeting the liver of C57BL/6 mice intravenously, and then assessed the emergence of NAbs and the transduction efficacy with a second administration. For all serotypes, we confirmed that re-administration with the same serotype was not possible. Although the highest neutralizing activity of NAb was induced by AAV5; however, the NAbs elicited by AAV5 did not react with any other serotypes, resulting in success in re-administration with the other serotypes. The re-administration of AAV5 was also successful in all mice treated with AAV3B and AAV8. The effective secondary administration of AAV3B and AAV8 was observed in most mice treated with AAV8 and AAV3B, respectively. However, few mice developed NAbs cross-reactive with the other serotypes, especially the serotypes with close sequence homology. In summary, AAV vector administration induced NAbs relatively specific to the serotype administrated.

This precedes the emergence of the three somatic germ layers, but also the segregation of the germline that undergoes genome-wide DNA demethylation after specification. While DNA methylation is essential for embryogenesis, the point at which it becomes critical during differentiation and whether all lineages equally depend on it is unclear. Using culture modeling of cellular transitions, we found that DNA methylation-free embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with a triple DNA methyltransferase knockout (TKO) normally progressed through the continuum of pluripotency states, but demonstrated skewed differentiation abilities towards neural versus other somatic lineages. More saliently, TKO ESCs were fully competent for establishing primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), even showing temporally extended and self-sustained capacity for the germline fate. By mapping chromatin states, we found that the neural and germline lineages are linked by a similar enhancer dynamics during priming, defined by common sets of methyl-sensitive transcription factors that fail to be decommissioned in absence of DNA methylation. We propose that DNA methylation controls the temporality of a coordinated neural-germline axis of preferred differentiation route during early development.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the HCFC1 transcriptional co-factor protein are the cause of cblX syndrome and X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). cblX is the more severe disorder associated with intractable epilepsy, abnormal cobalamin metabolism, facial dysmorphia, cortical gyral malformations, and intellectual disability. In vitro, Hcfc1 regulates neural precursor (NPCs) proliferation and number, which has been validated in zebrafish. However, conditional deletion of Hcfc1 in Nkx2.1+ NPCs increased cell death, reduced Gfap expression, and reduced numbers of GABAergic neurons. Thus, the role of HCFC1 in brain development is not completely understood. Recently, knock-in of both a cblX (HCFC1) and cblX-like (THAP11) allele were created in mice. Knock-in of the cblX-like allele was associated with increased expression of proteins required for ribosome biogenesis. However, the brain phenotypes were not comprehensively studied due to sub-viability and therefore, a mechanism underlying increased ribosome biogenesis was not described. We used a missense, a nonsense, and two conditional zebrafish alleles to further elucidate this mechanism during brain development. We observed contrasting phenotypes at the level of Akt/mTor activation, the number of radial glial cells, and the expression of two downstream target genes of HCFC1, asxl1 and ywhab. Despite these divergent phenotypes, each allele studied demonstrates with a high degree of face validity when compared to the phenotypes reported in the literature. Collectively, these data suggest that individual mutations in the HCFC1 protein result in differential mTor activity which is associated with contrasting cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Having intact epithelial tissues is critical for embryonic development and adult homeostasis. How epithelia respond to damaging insults or tissue growth while still maintaining intercellular connections and barrier integrity during development is poorly understood. The conserved small GTPase Rap1 is critical for establishing cell polarity and regulating cadherin-catenin cell junctions. Here, we identified a new role for Rap1 in maintaining epithelial integrity and tissue shape during Drosophila oogenesis. Loss of Rap1 activity disrupted the follicle cell epithelium and the shape of egg chambers during a period of major growth. Rap1 was required for proper E-Cadherin localization in the anterior epithelium and for epithelial cell survival. Both Myo-II and the adherens junction-cytoskeletal linker protein -Catenin were required for normal egg chamber shape but did not strongly affect cell viability. Blocking the apoptotic cascade failed to rescue the cell shape defects caused by Rap1 inhibition. One consequence of increased cell death caused by Rap1 inhibition was the preferential loss of the polar cells, which later in development led to fewer cells forming a properly migrating border cell cluster. Our results thus indicate dual roles for Rap1 in maintaining epithelia and cell survival in a growing tissue during development.",

    "abstract": "Cold-adapted species are particularly threatened by climate change as rates of environmental warming outpace the ability of many populations adapt. Recent evidence suggest that transgenerational thermal plasticity may play a role in the response of cold-adapted organisms to long-term changes in temperature. Using RNA sequencing, we explored differential gene expression of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-adapted species, to examine the molecular processes that respond to elevated temperatures under conditions of within-generation (offspring) and transgenerational (parental) warm-acclimation. We hypothesized that genes associated with metabolism, growth and thermal stress/tolerance would be differentially expressed in juvenile lake trout offspring depending on their own acclimation temperature and that of their parents. We found enriched pathways for thermal stress, signaling processes, immune function, and transcription regulation, although the specific genes and direction of differential expression (up-or downregulation) depended on the combination of offspring and parental thermal rearing conditions. While parental warm-acclimation did have a transgenerational effect on gene expression in their offspring, within-generation warm-acclimation had a larger effect on differential expression, enriching more pathways. We provide evidence of the transgenerational response to warming at the transcriptional level in lake trout, which should be useful for future studies of transcriptomics and plasticity in these and other cold-adapted species.",

    "abstract": "Mutation is a phenomenon inescapable for all life-forms, including bacteria. While bacterial mutation rates are generally low due to the operation of error-avoidance systems, sometimes they are elevated by many orders of magnitude. Such a state, known as a hypermutable state, can result from exposure to stress or to harmful environments. Studies of bacterial mutation frequencies and analysis of the precise types of mutations can provide insights into the mechanisms by which mutations occur and the possible involvement of error-avoidance pathways. Several approaches have been used for this, like reporter assays involving non-essential genes or mutation accumulation over multiple generations. However, these approaches give an indirect estimation, and a more direct approach for determining mutations is desirable. With the recent development of a DNA sequencing technique known as Duplex Sequencing, it is possible to detect rare variants in a population at a frequency of 1 in 107 base pairs or less. Here, we have applied Duplex Sequencing to study spontaneous mutations in E. coli. We also investigated the production of replication errors by using a mismatch-repair defective (mutL) strain as well as oxidative-stress associated mutations using a mutT-defective strain. For DNA from a wild-type strain we obtained mutant frequencies in the range of 10-7 to 10-8 depending on the specific base-pair substitution, but we argue that these mutants merely represent a background of the system, rather than mutations that occurred in vivo. In contrast, bona-fide in vivo mutations were identified for DNA from both the mutL and mutT strains, as indicated by specific increases in base substitutions that are fully consistent with their established in vivo roles. Notably, the data reproduce the specific context effects of in vivo mutations as well as the leading vs. lagging strand bias among DNA replication errors.",
