    "abstract": "Despite the fact that the cause of Down Syndrome (DS) is well established, the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to the syndrome and the phenotype of accelerated aging remain largely unknown. DNA methylation profiles are largely altered in DS, but it remains unclear how different methylation regions and probes are structured into a network of interactions. We develop and generalize the Parenclitic Networks approach that enables finding correlations between distant CpG probes (which are not pronounced as stand-alone biomarkers) and quantifies hidden network changes in DNA methylation. DS and a familybased cohort (including healthy siblings and mothers of persons with DS) are used as a case study. Following this approach, we constructed parenclitic networks and obtained different signatures that indicate (i) differences between individuals with DS and healthy individuals; (ii) differences between young and old healthy individuals; (iii) differences between DS individuals and their age-matched siblings, and (iv) difference between DS and the adult population (their mothers). The Gene Ontology analysis showed that the CpG network approach is more powerful than the single CpG approach in identifying biological processes related to DS phenotype. This includes the processes occurring in the central nervous system, skeletal muscles, disorders in carbohydrate metabolism, cardiopathology, and oncogenes. Our open-source software implementation is accessible to all researchers. The software includes a complete workflow, which can be used to construct Parenclitic Networks with any machine learning algorithm as a kernel to build edges. We anticipate a broad applicability of the approach to other diseases.",

    "abstract": "A crucial challenge in targeted manipulation of neural activity is to identify perturbation sites whose stimulation exerts significant effects downstream (high efficacy), a procedure currently achieved by labor-intensive trial-and-error. Targeted perturbations will be greatly facilitated by understanding causal interactions within neural ensembles and predicting the efficacy of perturbation sites before intervention. Here, we address this issue by developing a computational framework to predict how single-site micorstimulation alters the ensemble spiking activity in an alert monkeys prefrontal cortex. Our framework uses delay embedding techniques to infer the ensembles functional causal flow (FCF) based on the functional interactions inferred at rest. We validate FCF using ground truth data from models of cortical circuits, showing that FCF is robust to noise and can be inferred from brief recordings of even a small fraction of neurons in the circuit. A detailed comparison of FCF with several alternative methods, including Granger causality and transfer entropy, highlighted the advantages of FCF in predicting perturbation effects on empirical data. Our results provide the foundation for using targeted circuit manipulations to develop targeted interventions suitable for brain-machine interfaces and ameliorating cognitive dysfunctions in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Determination of the structure and dynamics of transmembrane (TM) regions of single-transmembrane receptors is key to understanding their mechanism of signal transduction across the plasma membrane. Although many studies have been performed on isolated soluble extra- and intracellular receptor domains in aqueous solutions, limited knowledge exists on the lipid embedded TM domain. In this study, we examine the assembly of configurations of receptor TM region dimers using the Martini 3 force field for coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics simulations. This recently published version of Martini has new bead types and sizes, which allows more accurate predictions of molecular interactions compared to the previous versions. At first glance our results with Martini 3 simulations show only a reasonable agreement with ab initio predictions using PREDDIMER (for TM domains only), AlphaFold2 Multimer and with available NMR derived structures for TM helix dimers. Specifically, 6 of 11 CG TM structures are similar to the NMR structures (within < 3.5 [A] mainchain RMSD) compared to 10 of 11 and 9 of 11 using PREDDIMER and Alphafold, respectively (7 structures of the latter are within 1.5 [A]) Surprisingly, AlphaFold2 predictions are more comparable with NMR structures when the database of 2001 (mainly composed of soluble proteins) instead of 2020 PDB structures are used. While there are some differences in the conditions used, the CG simulations primarily reveal that alternate configurations of the TM dimers that are sampled, which readily interconvert with a predominant population. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the signalling mechanism of TM receptors are discussed, including opportunities for the development of new pharmaceuticals, some of which are peptide based.",

Diffusion MRI data were used to perform whole-brain tractography and to generate structural brain networks for the whole-brain connectome, and for the default mode, limbic and visual subnetworks. The mean clustering coefficient, mean betweenness centrality, characteristic path length, global efficiency and mean nodal strength were calculated for these networks, for each participant. The connectivity of the rich-club, feeder and local connections was also calculated. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), estimating each participants genetic risk, were calculated at genome-wide level and for nine specific disease pathways. Correlations were calculated between the PRS and a) the graph theoretical metrics of the structural networks and b) the rich-club, feeder and local connectivity of the whole-brain networks.\n\nIn the visual subnetwork, the mean nodal strength was negatively correlated with the genomewide PRS (r=-0.19, p=1.3x10-5), the mean betweenness centrality was positively correlated with the plasma lipoprotein particle assembly PRS (r=0.16, p=9.2x10-4), and the mean clustering coefficient was negatively correlated with the tau protein binding PRS (r=-0.16, p=9.2x10-4). In the default mode network, the mean nodal strength was negatively correlated with the genomewide PRS (r=-0.14, p=1.5x10-3). The rich-club and feeder connectivities were negatively correlated with the genome-wide PRS (r=-0.16, p=3.7x10-4; r=-0.15, p=8.8x10-4).

    "abstract": "Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a reference method for microbial identification and it can be used to predict Antibiotic Resistance (AR) when combined with artificial intelligence methods. However, current solutions need time-costly preprocessing steps, are difficult to reproduce due to hyperparameter tuning, are hardly interpretable, and do not pay attention to epidemiological differences inherent to data coming from different centres, which can be critical.\n\nWe propose using a multi-view heterogeneous Bayesian model (KSSHIBA) for the prediction of AR using MALDI-TOF MS data together with their epidemiological differences. KSSHIBA is the first model that removes the ad-hoc preprocessing steps that work with raw MALDI-TOF data. In addition, due to its Bayesian probabilistic nature, it does not require hyperparameter tuning, provides interpretable results, and allows exploiting local epidemiological differences between data sources. To test the proposal, we used data from 402 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates coming from two different domains and 20 different hospitals located in Spain and Portugal. KSSHIBA outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in antibiotic susceptibility prediction, obtaining a 0.78 AUC score in Wild Type classification and a 0.90 AUC score in Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL)+Carbapenemases (CP)-producers. The proposal consistently removes the need for ad-hoc preprocessing by working with raw MALDI-TOF data, which, in turn, reduces the time needed to obtain the results of the resistance mechanism in microbiological laboratories. The proposed model implementation as well as both data domains are publicly available.",

The incorporation of asparagusic acid was found to be effective in improving the activity of the drug against Gram-negative strains compared to the all carbon control compounds.

    "abstract": "We present a functionally relevant, quantitative characterization of the neural circuitry of Drosophila melanogaster at the mesoscopic level of neuron types as classified exclusively based on potential network connectivity. Starting from a large neuron-to-neuron brain-wide connectome of the fruit fly, we use stochastic block modeling and spectral graph clustering to group neurons together into a common \"cell class\" if they connect to neurons of other classes according to the same probability distributions. We then characterize the connectivity-based cell classes with standard neuronal biomarkers, including neurotransmitters, developmental birthtimes, morphological features, spatial embedding, and functional anatomy. Mutual information indicates that connectivity-based classification reveals aspects of neurons that are not adequately captured by traditional classification schemes. Next, using graph-theoretic and random walk analyses to identify neuron classes as hubs, sources, or destinations, we detect pathways and patterns of directional connectivity that potentially underpin specific functional interactions in the Drosophila brain. We uncover a core of highly interconnected dopaminergic cell classes functioning as the backbone communication pathway for multisensory integration. Additional predicted pathways pertain to the facilitation of circadian rhythmic activity, spatial orientation, fight-or-flight response, and olfactory learning. Our analysis provides experimentally testable hypotheses critically deconstructing complex brain function from organized connectomic architecture.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe potential synaptic circuitry of a neural system constitutes the fundamental architectural underpinning of its in vivo dynamics, plasticity, and functions. The fruit fly neural circuit presented here captures the latent stochastic patterns of network connectivity and provides a fundamental parts list for reverse-engineering brain computation.

The key to analyzing acquired data is accurate and automated cell segmentation at the single-cell level. Therefore, we present microbeSEG, a user-friendly Python-based cell segmentation tool with a graphical user interface and OMERO data management. microbeSEG utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning-based segmentation method and can be used for instance segmentation of a wide range of cell morphologies and imaging techniques, e.g., phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy. The main focus of microbeSEG is a comprehensible, easy, efficient, and complete workflow from the creation of training data to the final application of the trained segmentation model. We demonstrate that accurate cell segmentation results can be obtained within 45 minutes of user time. Utilizing public segmentation datasets or pre-labeling further accelerates the microbeSEG workflow. This opens the door for accurate and efficient data analysis of microbial cultures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 infections in Hong Kong, the model city of universal masking of the world, has resulted in a major public health crisis. Although the third vaccination resulted in strong boosting of neutralization antibody, vaccine efficacy and corelates of immune protection against the major circulating Omicron BA.2 remains to be investigated.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the vaccine efficacy against the Omicron BA.2 breakthrough infection among 470 public servants who had received different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine regimens including two-dose BNT162b2 (2xBNT, n=169), three-dose BNT162b2 (3xBNT, n=170), two-dose CoronaVac (2xCorV, n=34), three-dose CoronaVac (3xCorV, n=67) and third-dose BNT162b2 following 2xCorV (2xCorV+1BNT, n=32). Humoral and cellular immune responses after three-dose vaccination were further characterized and correlated with clinical characteristics of BA.2 infection.\n\nFindingsDuring the BA.2 outbreak, 27.7% vaccinees were infected. The timely third-dose vaccination provided significant protection with lower incidence rates of breakthrough infections (2xBNT 49.2% vs 3xBNT 13.1%, p <0.0001; 2xCorV 44.1% vs 3xCoV 19.4%, p=0.003). Investigation of immune response on blood samples derived from 92 subjects in three-dose vaccination cohorts collected before the BA.2 outbreak revealed that the third-dose vaccination activated spike (S)-specific memory B cells and Omicron cross-reactive T cell responses, which correlated with reduced frequencies of breakthrough infections and disease severity rather than with types of vaccines. Moreover, the frequency of S-specific activated memory B cells was significantly lower in infected vaccinees than uninfected vaccinees before vaccine-breakthrough infection whereas IFN-{gamma}+ CD4 T cells were negatively associated with age and viral clearance time. Critically, BA.2 breakthrough infection boosted cross-reactive memory B cells with enhanced cross-neutralizing antibodies to Omicron sublineages, including BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5, in all vaccinees tested.\n\nInterpretationOur results imply that the timely third vaccination and immune responses are likely required for vaccine-mediated protection against Omicron BA.2 pandemic. Although BA.2 conferred the highest neutralization resistance compared with variants of concern tested before the emergence of BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5, the third dose vaccination-activated S-specific memory B cells and Omicron cross-reactive T cell responses contributed to reduced frequencies of breakthrough infection and disease severity. Neutralizing antibody potency enhanced by BA. 2 breakthrough infection with previous 3 doses of vaccines (CoronaVac or BNT162b2) may reduce the risk for infection of ongoing BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5.\n\nFundingHong Kong Research Grants Council Collaborative Research Fund, Health and Medical Research Fund, Wellcome Trust, Shenzhen Science and Technology Program, the Health@InnoHK, Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong, China, National Program on Key Research Project, Emergency Key Program of Guangzhou Laboratory, donations from the Friends of Hope Education Fund and the Hong Kong Theme-Based Research Scheme.",

    "abstract": "Neuroepithelial cells balance tissue growth requirement with the morphogenetic imperative of closing the neural tube. They apically constrict to generate mechanical forces which elevate the neural folds, but are thought to apically dilate during mitosis. However, we previously reported that mitotic neuroepithelial cells in the mouse posterior neuropore have smaller apical surfaces than non-mitotic cells. Here, we document progressive apical enrichment of non-muscle myosin-II in mitotic, but not non-mitotic, neuroepithelial cells with smaller apical areas. Live-imaging of the chick posterior neuropore confirms apical constriction synchronised with mitosis, reaching maximal constriction by anaphase, before division and re-dilation. Mitotic apical constriction amplitude is significantly greater than interphase constrictions. To investigate conservation in humans, we characterised early stages of iPSC differentiation through dual SMAD-inhibition to robustly produce pseudostratified neuroepithelia with apically enriched actomyosin. These cultured neuroepithelial cells achieve an equivalent apical area to those in mouse embryos. iPSC-derived neuroepithelial cells have large apical areas in G2 which constrict in M phase and retain this constriction in G1/S. Given that this differentiation method produces anterior neural identities, we studied the anterior neuroepithelium of the elevating mouse mid-brain neural tube. Instead of constricting, mid-brain mitotic neuroepithelial cells have larger apical areas than interphase cells. Tissue geometry differs between the apically convex early midbrain and flat posterior neuropore. Culturing human neuroepithelia on equivalently convex surfaces prevents mitotic apical constriction. Thus, neuroepithelial cells undergo high-amplitude apical constriction synchronised with cell cycle progression but the timing of their constriction if influenced by tissue geometry.",

Thus, we conducted ex vivo studies of liver mechanics in rodent models of simple steatosis to isolate and examine the mechanical effects of intrahepatic fat accumulation, and found that fat accumulation softens the liver. Using a novel adaptation of microindentation to permit association of local mechanics with microarchitectural features, we found evidence that the softening of fatty liver results from local softening of fatty regions rather than uniform softening of the liver. These results suggest that fat accumulation itself exerts a softening effect on liver tissue. This, along with the localized heterogeneity of softening within the liver, has implications in what mechanical mechanisms are involved in the progression of liver steatosis to more severe pathologies and disease. Finally, the ability to examine and associate local mechanics with microarchitectural features is potentially applicable to the study of the role of heterogeneous mechanical microenvironments in both other liver pathologies and other organ systems.",

    "abstract": "Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly cognizant of rapid adaptation in wild populations. Rapid adaptation to anthropogenic environmental change is critical for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystems services into the future. Anthropogenic salinization of freshwater ecosystems is quickly emerging as a primary threat, which is well documented in the northern temperate ecoregion. Specifically, many northern temperate lakes have undergone extensive salinization because of urbanization and the associated increase in impervious surfaces causing runoff, and the extensive use of road deicing salts (e.g., NaCl). It remains unclear if increasing salinization will lead to extirpation of species from these systems. Using a \"resurrection genomics\" approach, we investigated whether the keystone aquatic herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, has evolved increased salinity tolerance in a severely salinized lake located in Minnesota, USA. Whole genome resequencing of 54 Daphnia clones from the lake and hatched from resting eggs that represent a 25-year temporal contrast demonstrates that many regions of the genome containing genes related to osmoregulation are under selection in the study population. Tolerance assays of clones revealed that the most recent clones are more tolerant to salinity than older clones; this pattern is concomitant with the temporal pattern of stabilizing salinity in this lake. Together, our results demonstrate that keystone species such as Daphnia can rapidly adapt to increasing freshwater salinization. Further, our results indicate that rapid adaptation to salinity may allow lake Daphnia populations to persist in the face of anthropogenic salinization maintaining the food webs and ecosystem services they support despite global environmental change.\n\nSignificance StatementRapid adaptation to human-induced environmental change is critical for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services into the future. A key question is whether populations of keystone species can rapidly adapt to maintain the ecosystems they support. We investigated rapid adaptation to anthropogenic salinization in Daphnia pulicaria, a keystone aquatic herbivore in lake ecosystems. By resuscitating decades-old resting eggs, we investigate genomic changes across an approximately 25-year temporal contrast from a severely salinized lake. We report that the genes showing signatures of natural selection throughout the genome are related to osmoregulation and ion regulation. Phenotyping clones for salinity tolerance revealed evidence that genetic changes may underlie rapid evolution. We provide molecular genomic and phenotypic evidence for rapid adaptation to salinity in D. pulicaria.",

    "abstract": "Doliolids are common gelatinous grazers in marine ecosystems around the world and likely influence carbon cycling due to their large population sizes with high growth and excretion rates. Aggregations or blooms of these organisms occur frequently, but they are difficult to measure or predict because doliolids are fragile, under sampled with conventional plankton nets, and can aggregate on fine spatial scales (1-10 m). Moreover, ecological studies typically target a single region or site that does not encompass the range of possible habitats favoring doliolid proliferation. To address these limitations, we combined in situ imaging data from six coastal ecosystems, including the Oregon shelf, northern California, southern California Bight, northern Gulf of Mexico, Straits of Florida, and Mediterranean Sea, to resolve and compare doliolid habitat associations during warm months when environmental gradients are strong and doliolid blooms are frequently documented. Higher ocean temperature was the strongest predictor of elevated doliolid abundances across ecosystems, with additional variance explained by chlorophyll-a fluorescence and dissolved oxygen. For marginal seas with a wide range of productivity regimes, the nurse stage tended to comprise a higher proportion of the doliolids when total abundance was low. However, this pattern did not hold in ecosystems with persistent coastal upwelling. The doliolids tended to be most aggregated in oligotrophic systems (Mediterranean and southern California), suggesting that microhabitats within the water column favor proliferation on fine spatial scales. Similar comparative approaches can resolve the realized niche of fast-reproducing marine animals, thus improving predictions for population-level responses to changing oceanographic conditions.",

However, with most glycoengineering strategies, several hours to days are needed to complete the reaction, and the payloads are limited to small molecules. Herein, we show that reducing the complexity of Fc glycan could dramatically boost the enzymatic glycoengineering of IgG molecules to achieve unexpectedly high efficiency and payload capacity. Notably, antibodies with the modified Fc glycan were successfully conjugated with biomacromolecules, e.g., oligonucleotides and nanobodies, in one step by an engineered fucosyltransferase. Moreover, the conversion of this chemoenzymatic engineering could be finished in minutes, or up to hours, affording homogeneous products. The trisaccharide linker of these antibody conjugates exhibits excellent hydrophilicity and stability and reduced ADCC activity. Using this platform, we successfully synthesized an antibody-conjugate-based HER2/CD3 bispecific antibody and applied it to selectively destroy patient-derived cancer organoids by reactivating endogenous T cells inside the organoid.

In reconstituted systems sequential changes in the composition of ESCRT-III polymers induced by the AAA ATPase Vps4 have been shown to remodel membranes. However, it is not known how composite ESCRT-III polymers are organised and remodelled in space and time in cells. Here, taking advantage of the relative simplicity of the ESCRT-III-dependent division system in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, one of the closest experimentally tractable prokaryotic relative of eukaryotes, we use super-resolution microscopy and computational modelling to show how CdvB/CdvB1/CdvB2 proteins form a precisely patterned composite ESCRT-III division ring which undergoes stepwise Vps4-dependent disassembly and contracts to cut cells into two.

    "abstract": "How an organism dies is a fundamental yet poorly understood question in biology. An organism can die of many causes, including stress-induced phenoptosis, also defined as organismic death that is regulated by its genome-encoded programs. The mechanism of stress-induced phenoptosis is still largely unknown. Here we show that transient but severe freezing-thaw stress (FTS) in C. elegans induces rapid and robust phenoptosis that is regulated by G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. RNAi screens identify the GPCR-encoding fshr-1 in mediating transcriptional responses to FTS. FSHR-1 increases ligand interaction upon FTS and activates a cyclic AMP-PKA cascade leading to a genetic program to promote organismic death under severe stress. FSHR-1/GPCR signaling up-regulates the bZIP-type transcription factor ZIP-10, linking FTS to expression of genes involved in lipid remodeling, proteostasis and aging. A mathematical model suggests that genes may promote organismic death under severe stress conditions, potentially benefiting growth of the clonal population with individuals less stressed and more reproductively privileged. Our studies reveal roles of FSHR-1/GPCR-mediated signaling in stress-induced gene expression and phenoptosis in C. elegans, providing empirical new insights into mechanisms of stress-induced phenoptosis with evolutionary implications.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in hardware technology and analysis methods allow more and more mobility in electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) studies may record various types of data such as motion or eye tracking in addition to neural activity. Although there are options available to analyze EEG data in a standardized way, they do not fully cover complex multimodal data from mobile experiments. We thus propose the BeMoBIL Pipeline, an easy-to-use pipeline in MATLAB that supports the time-synchronized handling of multimodal data. It is based on EEGLAB and fieldtrip and consists of automated functions for EEG preprocessing and subsequent source separation. It also provides functions for motion data processing and extraction of event markers from different data modalities, including the extraction of eye-movement and gait-related events from EEG using independent component analysis. The pipeline introduces a new robust method for region-of-interest-based group-level clustering of independent EEG components. Finally, the BeMoBIL Pipeline provides analytical visualizations at various processing steps, keeping the analysis transparent and allowing for quality checks of the resulting outcomes. All parameters and steps are documented within the data structure and can be fully replicated using the same scripts. This pipeline makes the processing and analysis of (mobile) EEG and body data more reliable and independent of the prior experience of the individual researchers, thus facilitating the use of EEG in general and MoBI in particular. It is an open-source project available for download at https://github.com/BeMoBIL/bemobil-pipeline which allows for community-driven adaptations in the future.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between algae and bacteria are widespread in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and play fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and biomass production. However, the chemical basis for many of these interactions is poorly characterized and understood. Recent studies have shown that the plant auxin indole acetic acid (IAA) can mediate chemical crosstalk between algae and bacteria, resembling its role in plant-bacterial associations. While algae have been shown to produce IAA, molecular pathways for IAA synthesis in algae have remained elusive. Here, we report a mechanism for IAA production from L-tryptophan mediated by the extracellular enzyme L-amino acid oxidase (LAO1) in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Under inorganic nitrogen limitation but in the presence of L-tryptophan and other amino acids, high levels of IAA are generated in an LAO1-dependent manner. Thus, LAO1 plays a dual role in scavenging nitrogen from L-amino acids and in producing the phytohormone IAA, which subsequently inhibits algal cell multiplication and chlorophyll degradation. We show that these inhibitory effects can be relieved in the presence of Methylobacterium spp., well-known plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), whose growth is mutualistically enhanced by the presence of the alga. These findings reveal a complex interplay of microbial auxin production and degradation by algal-bacterial consortia under nitrogen limitation and draws attention to potential ecophysiological roles of terrestrial microalgae and PGPB in association with land plants.",

Using a large-scale genome mining strategy, we discovered novel lineages of papillomaviruses infecting the Malayan and Chinese pangolins. We were able to assemble 3 complete circular papillomavirus genomes with an intact coding capacity, and 5 additional L1 genes encoding the major capsid protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 7 out of 8 L1 sequences formed a monophyletic group which is the sister lineage to the Tree shrew papillomavirus 1, isolated from Yunnan province in China. Additionally, a single L1 sequence assembled from a Chinese pangolin was placed in a clade closer to alpha- and omegapapillomaviruses. Examination of the SRA data from 95 re-sequenced genomes revealed that 49.3% Malayan pangolins and 50% Chinese pangolins, were positive for papillomavirus reads.

    "abstract": "New neurones are generated throughout life in the mammalian brain in a process known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Since this phenomenon grants a high degree of neuroplasticity influencing learning and memory and mood related behaviour, identifying factors that regulate AHN may be important for ameliorating age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Calorie restriction (CR), in the absence of malnutrition, has been shown to enhance AHN and improve hippocampal-dependent memory, mediated by the stomach hormone, ghrelin. Intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary strategy offering more flexibility than conventional CR, also promotes aspects of AHN. The 5:2 diet is a popular form of IF linked to a range of health benefits, however its effects on AHN and spatial memory are not well characterised. We hypothesised that the 5:2 diet would enhance AHN in a ghrelin-dependent manner.\n\nTo assess this, we used immunohistochemistry to quantify new adult-born neurones and new neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampal DG of adolescent and adult wild-type and mice lacking the ghrelin receptor following six weeks on a 5:2 diet. We report an age-related decline in neurogenic processes and identify a novel role for ghrelin-receptor in regulating the formation of new adult born NSCs in an age-dependent manner. However, the 5:2 diet did not affect new neurone or NSC formation in the DG. Consistent with this finding the 5:2 diet did not alter performance on a spatial learning and memory task.

    "abstract": "Finely tuned regulation of transport protein localization is vital for epithelial function. Sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter NBCn1 (SLC4A7) is a key contributor to epithelial pH homeostasis, yet the regulation of its subcellular localization is not understood. Here, we show that a predicted N-terminal {beta}-sheet and short C-terminal -helical motif are essential for NBCn1 plasma membrane localization in epithelial cells. This localization was abolished by cell-cell contact disruption, and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and proximity ligation (PLA) revealed NBCn1 interaction with E-cadherin and DLG1, linking the transporter to adherens junctions and the Scribble complex. NBCn1 also interacted with RhoA and localized to lamellipodia and filopodia in migrating cells. Finally, analysis of localization of native and GFP-tagged NBCn1, subcellular fractionation, co-IP of NBCn1 with Arl13B and CEP164, and PLA of NBCn1 and tubulin in mitotic spindles led to the surprising conclusion that NBCn1 additionally localizes to the centrosome and primary cilium in non-dividing, polarized epithelial cells, and to spindle, centrosome and midbodies during mitosis. We propose that NBCn1 traffics between lateral junctions, leading edge, and cell division machinery in Rab11 endosomes, adding new insight to the role of NBCn1 in cell cycle progression.\n\nSummary statementWe unravel molecular determinants of plasma membrane localization of the Na+,HCO3- cotransporter NBCn1 and discover that NBCn1 also localizes to centrosomes, spindle, midbody and primary cilia, likely cycling between these compartments.",

    "abstract": "Although vast numbers of putative gene regulatory elements have been cataloged, the sequence motifs and individual bases that underlie their functions remain largely unknown. Here we combine epigenetic perturbations, base editing, and deep learning models to dissect regulatory sequences within the exemplar immune locus encoding CD69. Focusing on a differentially accessible and acetylated upstream enhancer, we find that the complementary strategies converge on a [~]170 base interval as critical for CD69 induction in stimulated Jurkat T cells. We pinpoint individual cytosine to thymine base edits that markedly reduce element accessibility and acetylation, with corresponding reduction of CD69 expression. The most potent base edits may be explained by their effect on binding competition between the transcriptional activator GATA3 and the repressor BHLHE40. Systematic analysis of GATA and bHLH/Ebox motifs suggests that interplay between these factors plays a general role in rapid T cell transcriptional responses.

    "abstract": "Hop (Humulus lupulus) biosynthesizes the highly economically valuable secondary metabolites, which include flavonoids, bitter acids, polyphenols and essential oils. These compounds have important pharmacological properties and are widely implicated in the brewing industry owing to bittering flavor, floral aroma and preservative activity. Our previous studies documented that ternary MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) and binary WRKY1-WD40 (WW) protein complexes transcriptionally regulate the accumulation of bitter acid (BA) and prenylflavonoids (PF). In the present study, we investigated the regulatory functions of the R2R3-MYB repressor HlMYB7 transcription factor, which contains a conserved N-terminal domain along with the repressive motif EAR, in regulating the PF- and BA-biosynthetic pathway and their accumulation in hop. Constitutive expression of HlMYB7 resulted in transcriptional repression of structural genes involved in the terminal steps of biosynthesis of PF and BA, as well as stunted growth, delayed flowering, and reduced tolerance to viroid infection in hop. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and transient reporter assays revealed that HlMYB7 targets both PF and BA pathway genes and suppresses MBW and WW protein complexes. Heterologous expression of HlMYB7 leads to down-regulation of structural genes of flavonoid pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, including a decrease in anthocyanin content in Nicotiana tabacum. The combined results from functional and transcriptomic analyses highlight the important role of HlMYB7 in fine-tuning and balancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites at the transcriptional level, thus offer a plausible target for metabolic engineering in hop.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth and development involve the integration of numerous processes, influenced by both endogenous and exogenous factors. At any given time during a plants life cycle, the plant architecture is a readout of this continuous integration. However, untangling the individual factors and processes involved in the plant development and quantifying their influence on the plant developmental process is experimentally challenging.\n\nHere we used a combination of computational plant models to help understand experimental findings about how local phloem anatomical features influence the root system architecture. In particular, we simulated the mutual interplay between the root system architecture development and the carbohydrate distribution to provide a plausible mechanistic explanation for several experimental results.\n\nOur in silico study highlighted the strong influence of local phloem hydraulics on the root growth rates, growth duration and final length. The model result showed that a higher phloem resistivity leads to shorter roots due to the reduced flow of carbon within the root system. This effect was due to local properties of individual roots, and not linked to any of the pleiotropic effects at the root system level.\n\nOur results open the door to a better representation of growth processes in plant computational models.",

    "abstract": "The growth factor neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) regulates hypertrophic and hyperplastic myocardial growth and is currently under clinical investigation as a treatment for heart failure. We have previously demonstrated that an isoform of the NRG-1 receptor ERBB4 (ERBB4 JM-b) expressed in cardiomyocytes selectively regulates the activation of STAT5b. To explore the role of STAT5b in NRG-1/EBBB4 mediated cardiomyocyte growth, several in vitro and in vivo models were utilized. The downregulation of NRG-1/ERBB4 signaling consistently reduced STAT5b activation and transcription of STAT5b target genes Igf1, Myc and Cdkn1a in murine in vitro and in vivo models of myocardial growth. Stat5b knock-down in primary cardiomyocytes ablated NRG-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Stat5b was activated during NRG-1-induced hyperplastic myocardial growth and chemical inhibition of the Nrg-1/Erbb4 pathway led to the loss of myocardial growth and Stat5 activation in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-down of stat5b in zebrafish embryos resulted in reduced myocardial growth and heart failure as indicated by reduced ventricular ejection fraction. Dynamin-2 was discovered to control the cell surface localization of ERBB4 and the chemical inhibition of dynamin-2 downregulated NRG-1/ERBB4/STAT5b signaling in models of hypertrophic and hyperplastic myocardial growth. Finally, the activation of the NRG-1/ERBB4/STAT5b signaling pathway was explored in clinical samples representing pathological cardiac hypertrophy. The NRG-1/ERBB4/STAT5b signaling pathway was differentially regulated both at the mRNA and protein levels in the myocardium of patients with pathological cardiac hypertrophy as compared to myocardium of control subjects. These results establish the role for STAT5b, and dynamin-2 in NRG-1/ERBB4-mediated myocardial growth.",

    "abstract": "Copper is a trace element essential to cellular function with elevated levels implicated in cancer progression. Clinical trials using copper chelators are associated with improved patient survival, however, the molecular mechanisms by which copper depletion inhibits tumor progression are poorly understood. This remains a major hurdle to the clinical translation of copper chelators. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is often exploited by malignant cells to promote growth and metastasis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta} is a master regulator of EMT and facilitates cancer progression through changes in the tumor and its microenvironment. Herein, we report that a reduction of copper with the chelating agent tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) inhibited EMT in vitro in three diverse cancer cell types; human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), neuroblastoma (NB), and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cell lines. Single-molecule imaging demonstrated EMT markers including Vimentin, {beta}-catenin, ZEB1, and p-SMAD2 had increased expression with copper treatment and this pro-mesenchymal shift was rescued by the addition of TEPA. Moreover, SNAI1, ZEB1, and p-SMAD2 demonstrated increased accumulation in the cytoplasm after treating with TEPA. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a significant downregulation of the EMT pathway, including canonical (TGF-{beta}/SMAD2&3) and non-canonical (TGF-{beta}/PI3K/AKT and TGF-{beta}/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) TGF signaling pathways. Matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-14 proteins which activate latent TGF-{beta} complexes were also downregulated by TEPA treatment. These molecular changes are consistent with reduced plasma levels of TGF-{beta} we observed in cancer models treated with TEPA. Importantly, copper chelation reduced metastasis to the lung in a TNBC orthotopic syngeneic mouse model. Our studies suggest copper chelation therapy can be used to inhibit EMT-induced metastasis by targeting TGF-{beta} signalling. Because on-target anti-TGF-{beta} therapies are failing in the clinic, copper chelation presents itself as a potential therapy for targeting TGF-{beta} in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Immune evasion and metabolic reprogramming are hallmarks of cancer progression often associated with a poor prognosis and frequently present significant challenge for cancer therapies. Recent studies have emphasized on the dynamic interaction between immunosuppression and the dysregulation of energy metabolism in modulating the tumor microenvironment to promote cancer aggressiveness. However, a pan-cancer association among these two hallmarks, and a potent common driver for them - Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) - remains to be done. Here, our meta-analysis across 184 publicly available transcriptomic datasets as well as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data reveals that an enhanced PD-L1 activity signature along with other immune checkpoint markers correlate positively with a partial EMT and elevated glycolysis signature but a reduced OXPHOS signature in many carcinomas. These trends were also recapitulated in single-cell RNA-seq time-course EMT induction data across cell lines. Furthermore, across multiple cancer types, concurrent enrichment of glycolysis and PD-L1 results in worse outcomes in terms of overall survival as compared to enrichment for only PD-L1 activity or expression. Our results highlight potential functional synergy among these interconnected axes of cellular plasticity in enabling metastasis and/or multi-drug resistance in cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) has a poor prognosis, and most patients present with either locally advanced or distant metastatic disease. Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal method of ablation used clinically in locally advanced PC, but most patients eventually develop distant recurrence. We have previously shown that IRE alone is capable of generating protective, neoantigen-specific immunity. Here we aim to generate meaningful therapeutic immune effects by combining IRE with local (intratumoral) delivery of a CD40 agonistic antibody (CD40Ab).\n\nMethodsKPC46 organoids were generated from a tumor-bearing male KrasLSL-G12D-p53LSL-R172H-Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mouse. Orthotopic tumors were established in the pancreatic tail of B6/129 F1J mice via laparotomy. Mice were randomized to treatment with either sham laparotomy, IRE alone, CD40Ab alone, or IRE followed immediately by CD40Ab injection. Metastatic disease and immune infiltration in the liver were analyzed 14 days post-procedure using flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence imaging with spatial analysis. Candidate neoantigens were identified by mutanome profiling of tumor tissue for ex vivo functional analyses.\n\nResultsThe combination of IRE+CD40Ab improved median survival to greater than 35 days, significantly longer than IRE (21 days) or CD40Ab (24 days) alone (p<0.01). CD40Ab decreased metastatic disease burden, with less disease in the combination group than in the sham group or IRE alone. Immunohistochemistry of liver metastases revealed a more than two-fold higher infiltration of CD8+ T-cells in the IRE+CD40Ab group than in any other group (p<0.01). Multiplex immunofluorescence imaging revealed a 4-6-fold increase in the density of CD80+CD11c+ activated dendritic cells (p<0.05), which were spatially distributed throughout the tumor unlike the sham group, where they were restricted to the periphery. In contrast, CD4+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells (p<0.05) and Ly6G+ MDSCs (P<0.01) were reduced and restricted to the tumor periphery in the IRE+CD40Ab group. T-cells from the IRE+CD40Ab group recognized significantly more peptides representing candidate neoantigens than did T-cells from the IRE or untreated control groups.\n\nConclusionsIRE can induce local tumor regression and neoantigen-specific immune responses. Addition of CD40Ab to IRE improved dendritic cell activation and neoantigen recognition, while generating a strong systemic anti-tumor T-cell response that inhibited metastatic disease progression.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510847v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a42713org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16be8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15362eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@182f988_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "PARP1 is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is critically involved in DNA damage response. Its main enzymatic function is to catalyze a protein post-translational modification known as poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation). Despite the tremendous progresses of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) in the clinic, the basic mechanism of action of PARPi is poorly understood. Recent studies point to PARP1 trapping as a key factor driving the cytotoxic and immunomodulatory functions of PARPi. However, the molecular underpinnings of PARP1 trapping remain elusive. Here, using an unbiased, quantitative proteomic screen, we identified RING finger protein 114 (RNF114), as a PARylation-dependent, ubiquitin E3 ligase involved in DNA damage response. Upon sensing DNA damage, RNF114 was recruited, in a PAR-dependent manner, to the DNA lesions, where it specifically targeted PARylated-PARP1 for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. The blockade of this pathway interfered with the removal of PARP1 from the DNA damage site, leading to profound PARP1 trapping. We show that a natural product, Nimbolide, targeted RNF114 to block the degradation and removal of PARylated-PARP1 from DNA lesions. Unlike conventional PARPi, nimbolide treatment induced the trapping of both PARP1 and PARylation-dependent DNA repair factors. This unique mechanism of action of nimbolide translated into its superior cytotoxic effects against BRCA-deficient cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, as a super trapper of both PARylated-PARP1 and PARylation-dependent DNA repair factors, nimbolide was able to overcome the intrinsic and acquired resistance to PARPi. Finally, we showed that nimbolide treatment activated innate immune signaling and was able to synergize with various cytotoxic agents. These results point to the exciting possibility of targeting homologous recombination-deficient cancers using nimbolide and its analogs.",

RNA sequencing of thirty human BM identified the upregulation of UBE2C, a gene that ensures the correct transition from metaphase to anaphase, across different primary tumor origins. Tissue microarray analysis of an independent BM patient cohort revealed that high expression of UBE2C was associated with decreased survival. UBE2C-driven orthotopic mouse models developed extensive leptomeningeal dissemination, likely due to increased migration and invasion. Early cancer treatment with dactolisib (dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) prevented the development of UBE2C-induced leptomeningeal metastases.

MeCP2 binds methyl-cytosines to finely tune gene expression in the brain, though identifying genes robustly regulated by MeCP2 has been difficult. By integrating multiple transcriptomics datasets, we identified that MeCP2 finely regulates Growth differentiation factor 11 (Gdf11). Gdf11 is down-regulated in RTT mouse models and is inversely up-regulated in MDS mouse models. Strikingly, genetically normalizing Gdf11 dosage levels improved several behavioral deficits in a mouse model of MDS. Next, we discovered that losing one copy of Gdf11 alone was sufficient to cause multiple neurobehavioral deficits in mice, most notably hyperactivity and decreased learning and memory. This decrease in learning and memory was not due to changes in proliferation or numbers of progenitor cells in the hippocampus. Lastly, loss of one copy of Gdf11 decreased longevity and survival in mice, corroborating its putative role in aging. Our data demonstrate that Gdf11 dosage is important for brain function.",

    "abstract": "Monomeric alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a well characterised as a lipid binding protein. aSyn is known to form amyloid fibrils which are also localised with lipids and organelles in so called Lewy bodies, insoluble structures found in Parkinsons disease patients brains. It is still unclear under which conditions the aSyn-lipid interaction can start to become pathological. Previous work to address pathological interactions has focused on using synthetic lipid membranes, which lack the complexity of physiological lipid membranes which not only have a more complex lipid composition, but also contain lipid interacting proteins. Here, we investigate how either monomeric or fibrillar aSyn interact with physiological synaptic vesicles (SV) isolated from rodent brain. Using small angle neutron scattering and high-resolution imaging we observe that aSyn fibrils disintegrate SV, whereas aSyn monomers cause clustering of SV. Furthermore, SV enhance the aggregation rate of aSyn, however increasing the SV:aSyn ratio causes a reduction in aggregation propensity. SV lipids appear as an integrated part of aSyn fibrils and while the fibril morphology differs to aSyn fibrils alone, the core fibril structure remains the same. We finally demonstrate that lipid-associated aSyn fibrils are more easily taken up into cortical i3Neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Our study sheds light on differences between interactions of aSyn with synthetic lipid vesicles and physiological SV. We show how aSyn fibrils may enhance pathology by disintegrating SV, which in turn may have fatal consequences for neurons. Furthermore, disease burden may additionally be impacted by an increased uptake of lipid-associated aSyn by neurons, leading to more SV damage and enhancing aSyn aggregation.",

Astrocytes support the survival of regenerating oligodendrocytes, via downregulation of the Nrf2 pathway associated with increased astrocytic cholesterol biosynthesis pathway activation. Remyelination fails following sustained astrocytic Nrf2 activation yet is restored by either cholesterol biosynthesis/efflux stimulation, or Nrf2 inhibition using the existing therapeutic Luteolin. We identify that astrocyte-oligodendrocyte interaction regulates remyelination, and reveal a drug strategy for central nervous system regeneration centred on targeting this interaction.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Recent advances in deep learning model development have enabled more accurate prediction of drug response in cancer. However, the black-box nature of these models still remains a hurdle in their adoption for precision cancer medicine. Recent efforts have focused on making these models interpretable by incorporating signaling pathway information in model architecture. While these models improve interpretability, it is unclear whether this higher interpretability comes at the cost of less accurate predictions, or a prediction improvement can also be obtained. Results: In this study, we comprehensively and systematically assessed four state-of-the-art interpretable models developed for drug response prediction to answer this question using three pathway collections. Our results showed that models that explicitly incorporate pathway information in the form of a latent layer perform worse compared to models that incorporate this information implicitly. Moreover, in most evaluation setups the best performance is achieved using a simple black-box model. In addition, replacing the signaling pathways with randomly generated pathways shows a comparable performance for the majority of these interpretable models. Our results suggest that new interpretable models are necessary to improve the drug response prediction performance. In addition, the current study provides different baseline models and evaluation setups necessary for such new models to demonstrate their superior prediction performance.

This study highlighted the high concordance, R > 0.85, and <11% change in sensitivity between SPG assay and the single analyte -assays on various cell lines and tissues from human and mouse. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SPG assay was reproducible across multiple users. When used in conjunction with advanced cellular neighborhood segmentation, distinct immune or tumor RNA and protein targets were spatially resolved within individual cell subpopulations in human colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. We used the SPG assay to interrogate 23 different glioblastoma multiforme samples across 4 pathologies. The study revealed distinct clustering of both RNA and protein based on pathology and anatomic location. The in-depth investigation of giant cell glioblastoma multiforme revealed distinct protein and RNA expression profiles compared to that of the more common glioblastoma multiforme. More importantly, the use of spatial proteogenomics allowed simultaneous interrogation of critical protein post-translational modifications alongside whole transcriptomic profiles within the same distinct cellular neighborhoods.",

While previous research shows striatums role in linking behavior to reward, striatums role in linking the underlying behaviorally-relevant cortical activity to reward remains unclear. Leveraging a neuroprosthetic task while recording from the rat cortex and striatum, we demonstrate that the striatum encodes the dynamics of the proximity of cortical activity to reward. Such encoding was independent from external task feedback and emerged as cortical activity consolidated over learning, with dorsal and ventral striatum playing complementary yet distinct roles. Striatal activity thus constitutes a neural model of cortical progress towards reward, suggesting one mechanism by which the brain implements credit assignment to refine behavior.",

Disruption of protein homeostasis is thought be central to PD pathogenesis, however the molecular mechanism of this deregulation is poorly understood. Here we report that pathologic -syn binds to tuberous sclerosis protein (TSC) 2 and destabilizes the TSC1-TSC2 complex leading to activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) and enhanced mRNA translation. Dopamine neuron loss, behavioral deficits and aberrant biochemical signaling in the -syn preformed fibril (PFF) and Drosophila -syn transgenic models of pathologic -syn induced degeneration were attenuated by genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR and protein translation.

    "abstract": "Changing your mind requires shifting the way streams of information lead to a decision. Using in silico experiments we show how the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuits can feasibly implement shifts in the evidence accumulation process. When action contingencies change, dopaminergic plasticity redirects the balance of power, both within and between action representations, to divert the flow of evidence from one option to another. This finding predicts that when competition between action representations is highest, the rate of evidence accumulation is lowest. We then validate this prediction in a sample of homo sapiens as they perform an adaptive decision-making task while whole-brain hemodynamic responses are recorded. These results paint a holistic picture of how CBGT circuits manage and adapt the evidence accumulation process in mammals.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryInteractions between cortical and subcortical circuits in the mammalian brain flexibly control the flow of information streams that drive decisions by shifting the balance of power both within and between action representations.",

    "abstract": "The neurogenomic mechanisms mediating male-male reproductive cooperative behaviors are unknown. We leveraged extensive transcriptomic and behavioral data on a neotropical bird (Pipra filicauda) that perform cooperative courtship displays to understand these mechanisms. Cooperative display is modulated by testosterone, it promotes cooperation in non-territorial birds, but suppresses cooperation in territory holders. We sought to understand the neurogenomic underpinnings of these three related traits: social status, cooperative behavior, and testosterone phenotype. To do this, we profiled gene expression in 10 brain nuclei spanning the social decision-making network (SDMN), and two key endocrine tissues that regulate social behavior. We associated gene expression with each birds behavioral and endocrine profile derived from 3 years of repeated measures taken from free-living birds in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We found distinct landscapes of constitutive gene expression were associated with social status, testosterone phenotype, and cooperation, reflecting the modular organization and engagement of neuroendocrine tissues. Sex-steroid and neuropeptide signaling appeared to be important in mediating status-specific relationships between testosterone and cooperation, suggesting shared regulatory mechanisms with male aggressive and sexual behaviors. We also identified differentially regulated genes involved in cellular activity and synaptic potentiation, suggesting multiple mechanisms underpin these genomic states. Finally, we identified SDMN-wide gene expression differences between territorial and floater males that could form the basis of \"status-specific\" neurophysiological phenotypes, potentially mediated by testosterone and growth hormone. Overall, our findings provide new, systems-level insights into the mechanisms of cooperative behavior and suggest that differences in neurogenomic state are the basis for individual differences in social behavior.",

A total number of 171,985 unique transcripts (50% protein-coding) representing 35,150 unique genes (64% protein-coding) were identified across tissues. Among them, 159,033 transcripts (92% of the total) were structurally validated by independent datasets such as PacBio Iso-seq, ONT-seq, de novo assembled transcripts from RNA-seq, or Ensembl and NCBI gene sets. In addition, all transcripts were supported by extensive independent data from different technologies such as WTTS-seq, RAMPAGE, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq. A large proportion of identified transcripts (69%) were novel, of which 87% were produced by known genes and 13% by novel genes. A median of two 5 untranslated regions was detected per gene, an increase from Ensembl and NCBI annotations (single). Around 50% of protein-coding genes in each tissue were bifunctional and transcribed both coding and noncoding isoforms. Furthermore, we identified 3,744 genes that functioned as non-coding genes in fetal tissues, but as protein coding genes in adult tissues. Our new bovine genome annotation extended more than 11,000 known gene borders compared to Ensembl or NCBI annotations. The resulting bovine transcriptome was integrated with publicly available QTL data to study tissue-tissue interconnection involved in different traits and construct the first bovine trait similarity network.

However, quantifying FC differences between pairs of individuals also provides a rich source of information with which to map to differences in those individuals biology, experience, genetics or behavior. In this study, graph matching is used to create a novel inter-individual FC metric, called swap distance, that quantifies the distance between pairs of individuals FCs. We apply graph matching to align FCs between pairs of individuals from the the Human Connectome Project (N = 997) and find that swap distance i) increases with increasing familial distance, ii) increases with subjects ages, iii) is smaller for pairs of females compared to pairs of males, and iv) is larger for females with lower cognitive scores compared to females with larger cognitive scores. Regions that contributed most to individuals swap distances were in higher-order networks, i.e. default-mode and fronto-parietal, that underlie executive function and memory. These higher-order networks regions also had swap frequencies that varied monotonically with familial relatedness of the individuals in question. We posit that the proposed graph matching technique provides a novel way to study inter-subject differences in FC and enables quantification of how FC may vary with age, relatedness, sex and behavior.",

Elevated dN/dS ratios (the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates) in focal lineages are often interpreted as signs of positive selection. Paradoxically, relaxed purifying selection can also result in elevated dN/dS ratios, but tests to distinguish these two causes are seldomly implemented. Here, we reevaluated seven case studies describing elevated dN/dS ratios in animal mtDNA and their accompanying hypotheses regarding selection. They included flightless vs. flighted lineages in birds, bats, and insects, and physiological adaptations in snakes, two groups of electric fishes, and primates. We found that elevated dN/dS ratios were often not caused by the predicted mechanism, and we sometimes found strong support for the opposite mechanism. We discuss reasons why energetic hypotheses may be confounded by other selective forces acting on mtDNA and caution against overinterpreting molecular \"spandrels\", including elevated dN/dS ratios.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the agent of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, is an enveloped virus propagating within the endocytic and secretory organelles of host mammalian cells. Enveloped viruses modify the ionic homeostasis of organelles to render their intra-luminal milieu permissive for viral entry, replication, and egress. Here, we show that infection of Vero E6 cells with the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 alkalinizes the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) as well as lysosomes, mimicking the effect of inhibitors of vacuolar proton ATPases. We further show the envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 accumulates in the ERGIC when expressed in mammalian cells and selectively dissipates the ERGIC pH. This viroporin effect is not associated with acute cellular toxicity but is prevented by mutations within the channel pore of E. We conclude that the envelope protein acts as a proton channel in the ERGIC to mitigate the acidity of this intermediate compartment. The altered pH homeostasis of the ERGIC likely contributes to the virus fitness and pathogenicity, making the E channel an attractive drug target for the treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the ultimate source of blood and immune cells. Under homeostatic conditions, these cells are considered a quiescent reserve population. However, it is not clear to what extent HSCs participate in emergency responses. Herein, we use fate mapping and proliferation tracking mouse models, which cumulatively record HSC activity in situ. We observed no direct contribution of HSCs to mature blood cell regeneration in response to common hematopoietic emergencies, including inflammation or blood loss. Innate immune training, in which HSCs were proposed to store and integrate information on previous infections, did not alter HSC activity upon secondary exposure. Only severe myeloablation resulted in a robust increase of HSC contribution. Our data demonstrates that HSCs do not directly participate in the regeneration of mature blood cells and therefore do not represent a reserve population to compensate for physiological hematopoietic perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Mitosis results in a dramatic reorganization of chromatin structure in order to promote chromatin compaction and segregation to daughter cells. Consequently, mitotic entry is accompanied by transcriptional silencing and removal of most chromatin-bound RNAs from chromosomes. As cells exit mitosis, chromatin rapidly decondenses and transcription restarts as waves of differential gene expression. However, little is known about the fate of chromatin-bound RNAs following cell division. Here we explored whether nuclear RNA from the previous cell cycle is present in G1 cells following mitosis. We found that half of all nuclear RNAs are inherited in a transcriptionindependent manner following mitosis. Interestingly, the snRNA U2 is efficiently inherited by G1 cells while lncRNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 show no inheritance following mitosis. We found that the nuclear protein SAF-A, which is hypothesized to tether RNA to DNA, did not play a prominent role in nuclear RNA inheritance, indicating the mechanism for RNA inheritance may not involve RNA chaperones that have chromatin binding activity. Instead, we observe that the timing of RNA inheritance indicates a select group of nuclear RNAs are reimported into the nucleus after the nuclear envelope has reassembled. Taken together, our work demonstrates that there is a fraction of nuclear RNA from the previous cell cycle that is reimported following mitosis and suggest that mitosis may serve as a time to reset the interaction of lncRNAs with chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous neurofibromas (CNF) are benign tumors that occur in the dermis of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF), an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome. CNFs cause disfigurement, pain, burning, and itching, resulting in reduced quality of life in NF patients. However, due to their benign nature there are few in vitro or in vivo models of CNFs, which has limited the research of CNF biology and drug discovery efforts. To address this, we developed a patient derived explant (PDE) ex vivo culture model of CNF tumors and normal skin from NF patients. CNF PDEs remain viable in culture for over 9 days and recapitulate the cellular composition and molecular signaling of CNFs. We identified reciprocal inflammatory signaling in CNF PDEs, in which tumors rely on either prostaglandin or leukotriene mediated signaling pathways. Ex vivo glucocorticoid treatment reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes, confirming CNF PDEs are a useful model for mechanistic studies and preclinical drug testing.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical research relies heavily on the use of model organisms to gain insight into human health and development. Traditionally, the mouse has been the favored vertebrate model, due to its experimental and genetic tractability. Non-rodent embryological studies however highlight that many aspects of early mouse development, including the egg-cylinder topology of the embryo and its method of implantation, diverge from other mammals, thus complicating inferences about human development. In this study, we constructed a morphological and molecular atlas of rabbit development, which like the human embryo, develops as a flat-bilaminar disc. We report transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiles of almost 180,000 single cells and high-resolution histology sections from embryos spanning gastrulation, implantation, amniogenesis, and early organogenesis. Using a novel computational pipeline, we compare the transcriptional landscape of rabbit and mouse at the scale of the entire organism, revealing that extra-embryonic tissues, as well as gut and PGC cell types, are highly divergent between species. Focusing on these extra-embryonic tissues, which are highly accessible in the rabbit, we characterize the gene regulatory programs underlying trophoblast differentiation and identify novel signaling interactions involving the yolk sac mesothelium during hematopoiesis. Finally, we demonstrate how the combination of both rabbit and mouse atlases can be leveraged to extract new biological insights from sparse macaque and human data. The datasets and analysis pipelines reported here set a framework for a broader cross-species approach to decipher early mammalian development, and are readily adaptable to deploy single cell comparative genomics more broadly across biomedical research.",

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), an isomer of linoleic acid, has been characterized in several aspects, but few studies have been performed on its involvement in reproduction and fetal programming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the F1, F2 and F3 progeny of female mice supplemented with CLA during the pregestational and gestational periods with respect to biometric and reproductive parameters, as well as ovarian morphophysiology. The F1 progeny of mothers supplemented with CLA exhibited stable weight gain, while the F2 progeny showed no effects (P=0.0187 and P=0.0245, respectively). A reduction in Lees Index was observed in both generations at the second post-weaning evaluation week in the animals treated with CLA (P=0.0100 and P=0.0078, respectively). The F2 generation showed an increase in the anogenital index in both sexes of the animals treated with CLA (P= 0.0114 and P<0.0001, female and male respectively). CLA administration to mothers did not affect any of the following in their progeny: ovarian follicle mobilization (P>0.05), follicle number (P>0.05) and the integrated density of the lipid content of oocytes included in antral follicles (P>0.05). This study evaluated the use of CLA in mothers and found that it did not affect the progeny regarding murine reproductive performance, suggesting that this supplement can be used safely.",

    "abstract": "The continuous emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants poses challenges to the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies. Rational design of antibody cocktails is a realizable approach addressing viral immune evasion. However, evaluating the breadth of antibody cocktails is essential for understanding the development potential. Here, based on a replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus model that incorporates the spike of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-SARS-CoV-2), we evaluated the breadth of a number of antibody cocktails consisting of monoclonal antibodies and bispecific antibodies by long-term passaging the virus in the presence of the cocktails. Results from over two-month passaging of the virus showed that 9E12+10D4+2G1 and 7B9-9D11+2G1 from these cocktails were highly resistant to random mutation, and there was no breakthrough after 30 rounds of passaging. As a control, antibody REGN10933 was broken through in the third passage. Next generation sequencing was performed and several critical mutations related to viral evasion were identified. These mutations caused a decrease in neutralization efficiency, but the reduced replication rate and ACE2 susceptibility of the mutant virus suggested that they might not have the potential to become epidemic strains. The 9E12+10D4+2G1 and 7B9-9D11+2G1 cocktails that picked from the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 system efficiently neutralized all current variants of concern and variants of interest including the most recent variants Delta and Omicron, as well as SARS-CoV-1. Our results highlight the feasibility of using the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 system to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktails and provide a reference for the clinical selection of therapeutic strategies to address the mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2.",

The high propensity to mutate in key regions responsible for the recognition of the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2) or the antibodies produced by the immune system following infection or vaccination makes subunit 1 of the SP a difficult to target and, to date, efforts have not delivered any ACE2 binding inhibitor yet. The inherent flexibility of the stalk region, within subunit S2, is key to SARS-CoV-2 high infectivity because it facilitates the receptor binding domain encounter with ACE2. Thus, it could be a valuable therapeutic target. By employing a fragment-based strategy, we computationally studied the druggability of the conserved part of the SP stalk by means of an integrated approach that combines molecular docking with high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations. Our results suggest that the druggability of the stalk is challenging and provide the structural basis for such difficulty.",

Here we report a rapid generation and immunological evaluation of novel DNA vaccine candidates against Wuhan-Hu-1 and Omicron variants, based on the RBD protein fused with the Potato virus X coat protein (PVXCP). Delivery of DNA vaccines using electroporation in a two-doses regimen induced high antibody titers and profound cellular response in mice. Antibody titers induced against Omicron variant of the vaccine were sufficient for the effective protection against both the Omicron and Wuhan-Hu-1 virus infections. PVXCP protein in the vaccine construct shifted immune response to the favorable Th1-like type and provided oligomerization of RBD-PVXCP protein. A naked DNA delivery by the needle-free injection device allowed us to achieve antibody titers comparable with the mRNA-LNP delivery in rabbits.

We demonstrate this pipeline by characterizing the integrase and excisionase activity in cell-free protein expression system. We build on existing Python tools -- BioCRNpyler, AutoReduce, and Bioscrape -- to create this pipeline. For enzyme-mediated DNA recombination in cell-free system, we create detailed chemical reaction network models from simple high-level descriptions of the biological circuits and their context using BioCRNpyler. We use Bioscrape to show that the output of the detailed model is sensitive to many parameters. However, parameter identification is infeasible for this high-dimensional model, hence, we use AutoReduce to automatically obtain reduced models that have fewer parameters. This results in a hierarchy of reduced models under different assumptions to finally arrive at a minimal ODE model for each circuit. Then, we run sensitivity analysis-guided Bayesian inference using Bioscrape for each circuit to identify the model parameters. This process allows us to quantify integrase and excisionase activity in cell extracts enabling complex-circuit designs that depend on accurate control over protein expression levels through DNA recombination. The automated pipeline presented in this paper opens up a new approach to complex circuit design, modeling, reduction, and parameterization.",

    "abstract": "Microbial symbionts frequently localize within specific body structures or cell types of their multicellular hosts. This spatiotemporal niche is critical to host health, nutrient exchange and fitness. Measuring host-microbe metabolite exchange has conventionally relied on tissue homogenates, eliminating dimensionality and dampening analytical sensitivity. We have developed a mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) workflow for a soft- and hard-bodied cnidarian animal capable of revealing the host and symbiont metabolome in situ, without the need for a priori isotopic labelling or skeleton decalcification. The MSI method provides critical functional insights that cannot be gleaned from bulk tissue analyses or other presently available spatial methods. We show that cnidarian hosts may regulate microalgal symbionts acquisition and rejection through specific ceramides distributed throughout the tissue lining the gastrovascular cavity; once resident, symbionts reside in light-exposed tentacles to generate photosynthate. These spatial patterns reveal how symbiont identity can drive host metabolism.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic variation in the pig genome partially modulates the composition of porcine gut microbial communities. Previous studies have been focused on the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the gut microbiota, but little is known about the relationship between structural variants and gut microbial traits.\n\nResultsThe main goal of this study was to assess the effect of porcine genome copy number variants (CNVs) on the diversity and composition of pig gut microbiota. For this purpose, we used whole-genome sequencing data to undertake a comprehensive identification of CNVs followed by a genome-wide association analysis between the estimated CNV status and the gut bacterial diversity in a commercial Duroc pig population. A CNV predicted as gain (DUP) partially harboring ABCC2-DNMBP loci was associated with richness (p-value=5.41x10-5) and Shannon -diversity (p-value=1.42x10-4). The in-silico predicted gain of copies was validated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and its segregation, and positive association with the richness and Shannon -diversity of the porcine gut bacterial ecosystem was confirmed in an unrelated F1 (DurocxIberian) cross. Furthermore, despite genetic and environmental differences between both populations, the gut microbiota of DUP samples showed a significant over-abundance of the Desulfovibrio, Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Succinivibrio and Anaerovibrio genera.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, this is the first study that evaluate the putative modulatory role of CNVs on pig gut microbiota. Our results advice the relevance of considering the role of host-genome structural variants as modulators of microbial ecosystems, and suggest the ABCC2-DNMBP CNV as a host-genetic factor for the modulation of the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota in pigs.",

    "abstract": "Initial responses to tuberculosis treatment are poor predictors of final therapeutic outcomes in drug-susceptible disease suggesting that treatment success depends on features that are hidden within a small minority of the overall infecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) population. We developed a multi-transwell robotic system to perform numerous parallel cultures of genetically barcoded Mtb exposed to steady-state concentrations of rifampicin to uncover these difficult to eliminate minority populations. We found that tolerance repeatedly emerged from at least two subpopulations of barcoded cells, one that could not grow on solid agar media and a second that could form colonies, but whose kill curves diverged from the general bacterial population within 4 and 16 days of drug exposure, respectively. These tolerant subpopulations reproducibly passed through a phase characterized by multiple unfixed resistance mutations followed by emergent drug resistance in some cultures. Barcodes associated with drug resistance identified an especially privileged subpopulation that was rarely eliminated despite 20 days of drug treatment even in cultures that did not contain any drug resistant mutants. The association of this evolutionary scenario with a defined subset of barcodes across multiple independent cultures suggested a transiently heritable phenotype, and indeed glpK phase variation mutants were associated with up to 16 % of the resistant cultures. Drug tolerance and resistance were eliminated in{Delta} ruvA mutant consistent with the importance of bacterial stress responses. This work provides a window into the origin and dynamics of bacterial drug tolerant subpopulations whose elimination may be critical to developing rapid and resistance free cures.\n\nImportanceTuberculosis is unusual among bacterial diseases in that treatments which can rapidly resolve symptoms do not predictably lead to a durable cure unless treatment is continued for months after all clinical and microbiological signs of disease have been eradicated. Using a novel steady-state antibiotic exposure system combined with chromosomal barcoding, we identified small hidden Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulations that repeatedly enter into a state of drug tolerance with a predisposition to develop fixed drug resistance after first developing a cloud of unfixed resistance mutations. The existence of these difficult to eradicate subpopulations may explain the need for extended treatment regimen for tuberculosis. Their identification provides opportunities to test genetic and therapeutic approaches that may result in shorter and more effective TB treatments.",

    "abstract": "Woodchip bioreactors (WBRs) are used to remove nutrients, especially nitrate, from subsurface drainage. The nitrogen removal efficiency of WBRs, however, is limited by low temperature and availability of labile carbon. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation are potential approaches to enhance nitrate removal of WBRs under cold conditions, but their effectiveness is still unclear. Here, we clarified the effects of bioaugmentation and biostimulation on the microbiomes and nitrate removal rates of WBRs. As a bioaugmentation treatment, we inoculated WBR-borne cold-adapted denitrifying bacteria Cellulomonas cellasea strain WB94 and Microvirgula aerodenitrificans strain BE2.4 into the WBRs located at Willmar, MN, USA. As a biostimulation treatment, acetate was added to the WBRs to promote denitrification. Woodchip samples were collected from multiple locations in each WBR before and after the treatments and used for the microbiome analysis. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that the microbiomes changed by the treatments and season. The high-throughput quantitative PCR for nitrogen cycle genes revealed a higher abundance of denitrification genes at locations closer to the WBR inlet, suggesting that denitrifiers are unevenly present in WBRs. In addition, a positive relationship was identified between the abundance of M. aerodenitrificans strain BE2.4 and those of norB and nosZ in the WBRs. Based on generalized linear modeling, the abundance of norB and nosZ was shown to be useful in predicting the nitrate removal rate of WBRs. Taken together, these results suggest that the bioaugmentation and biostimulation treatments can influence denitrifier populations, thereby influencing the nitrate removal of WBRs.\n\nIMPORTANCENitrate pollution is a serious problem in agricultural areas in the U.S. Midwest and other parts of the world. Woodchip bioreactor is a promising technology that uses microbial denitrification to remove nitrate from agricultural subsurface drainage, although the reactors nitrate removal performance is limited under cold conditions. This study showed that the inoculation of cold-adapted denitrifiers (i.e., bioaugmentation) and the addition of labile carbon (i.e., biostimulation) can influence the microbial populations and enhance the reactors performance under cold conditions. This finding will help establish a strategy to mitigate nitrate pollution.",

    "abstract": "Cells are continuously facing the risk of taking up foreign DNA that can compromise genomic and cellular integrity. Therefore, bacteria are in a constant arms race with mobile genetic elements such as phages, transposons and plasmids. They have developed several active strategies against invading DNA molecules that can be seen as a bacterial  innate immune system. Anti-phage systems are usually organized in  defense islands and can consist of restriction-modification (R-M) systems, CRISPR-Cas, and abortive infection (Abi) systems. Despite recent advances in the field, much less is known about plasmid defense systems. We have recently identified the MksBEFG system in Corynebacterium glutamicum as a novel plasmid defense system which comprises homologues of the condensin system MukFEB. Here, we investigated the molecular arrangement of the MksBEFG complex. Importantly, we identified MksG as a novel nuclease that degrades plasmid DNA and is, thus, the executing part of the system. The crystal structure of MksG revealed a dimeric assembly through its DUF2220 C-terminal domains. This domain is homologous to the TOPRIM domain of the topoisomerase II family of enzymes and contains the corresponding divalent ion binding site that is essential for DNA cleavage in topoisomerases, explaining the in vitro nuclease activity of MksG. We further show that the MksBEF subunits exhibit an ATPase cycle similar to MukBEF in vitro and we reason that this reaction cycle, in combination with the nuclease activity provided by MksG, allows for processive degradation of invading plasmids. Super-resolution localization microscopy revealed that the Mks system is spatially regulated via to the polar scaffold protein DivIVA. Introduction of plasmids increases the diffusion rate and alters the localization of MksG, indicating an activation of the system in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has caused recurring respiratory disease outbreaks in the United States since 2014. The dominant circulating EV-D68 strain has evolved from clade B1 to the more recent B2 and B3 clades. As recurrent outbreaks and continued virus evolution are expected for EV-D68, a robust real-time PCR assay that detects known strains as well as potential emerging strains is critical for national surveillance and clinical diagnostics. We describe a type-specific EV-D68 real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay termed CDC2022, which targets sequences encoding conserved amino acid regions of all extant EV-D68 strains. We targeted three motifs conserved among all strains in the last 60 years. The assay achieved 100% (270/270) sensitivity and 100% (344/344) specificity when tested with a collection of 613 respiratory specimens, compared to the gold-standard EV semi-nested VP1 PCR and sequencing assay (snPCR/Seq). CDC2022 gave negative results with 289/289 non-target viruses, including 104 EV A-D isolates, 165 rhinovirus (RV) isolates or clinical specimens, and 14 other common respiratory viruses. The assay can detect as few as 0.28 CCID50 per reaction. An in silico \"phylo-primer-mismatch\" analysis was performed to visualize primer/probe mismatches and to compare CDC2022 with other EV-D68 rRT-PCR assays, including the previous CDC assay (CDC2015) developed in 2014 for clade B1 strains. It showed that CDC2022 has the fewest primer/probe mismatches among all assays analyzed and is suitable for all clades. We additionally tested 11 EV-D68-positive clinical specimens from 2022 that were confirmed by snPCR/Seq, and all were detected. CDC2022 assay could provide a critical tool for molecular surveillance of EV-D68.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastids are single-celled parasites responsible for human and animal disease. For the vast majority of kinetoplastids, colonization of an insect host is required for transmission. Stable attachment to insect tissues via the single flagellum coincides with differentiation and morphological changes. Although this process is essential for the generation of infectious forms, the molecular mechanism driving differentiation following adherence is not well understood. To study this process, we elaborate upon an in vitro model in which flagellated swimming cells of the kinetoplastid Crithidia fasciculata rapidly differentiate following adhesion to artificial substrates. Manipulation of culture parameters revealed that growth phase and time had a strong influence on the proportion of adherent cells. Live imaging of cells transitioning from swimming to an attached cell fate show parasites undergoing a defined sequence of events including an initial adhesion near the base of the flagellum, immediately followed by flagellar shortening, cell rounding, and the formation of a hemidesmosome-like structure between the tip of the shortened flagellum and the substrate. We have also assayed the role of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway in differentiation of C. fasciculata. Pharmacological inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterases eliminated the ability of swimming cells to attach without affecting their growth rate. Further, treatment with inhibitor did not affect the growth rate of established attached cells, indicating its effect is limited to a critical window of time during the early stages of adhesion. Finally, in swimming parasites we have shown that a receptor adenylate cyclase localizes to the distal portion of the flagellum. In attached cells it is absent from the shortened flagellum and instead localizes to the cell body. Similarly, a putative phosphodiesterase, found along the length of the flagellum, also relocalizes to the cell body in attached parasites. These data suggest that in C. fasciculata cAMP signaling is required for adherence, that cAMP flux in the flagellum of swimming cells is spatially restricted, and that signaling domains may be reorganized during differentiation and attachment. These studies contribute to our understanding of the flagellum as a multi-functional organelle integrating processes related to motility, signaling, attachment, and differentiation and further develop C. fasciculata as a model kinetoplastid.\n\nAuthor SummaryParasites from the order Kinetoplastida are transmitted by insects and cause diseases such as Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and Human African Trypanosomiasis. A key aspect of the life cycle of these parasites is their ability to adhere to surfaces within the insect and subsequently differentiate into forms that are transmissable to their next host. Here, we explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning both adherence and differentiation using the mosquito parasite Crithidia fasciculata. This organism is closely related to pathogenic species but grows to high densities in culture and adheres robustly in vitro. We identified factors affecting the rate of adherence and defined morphological stages of this process including rapid shortening of the cells single flagellum. Using electron microscopy, we confirmed that adhesion to artificial substrates results in the formation of a filament-rich adhesive plaque at the tip of the flagellum that resembles the attachment to insect tissue. We also demonstrate the key role played by the cyclic AMP signaling pathway during adherence and differentiation. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of enzymes that degrade cyclic AMP completely blocks adherence, and tagging of several proteins in this pathway show that their localization along the flagellum changes following differentiation to the attached form. These data provide insights into processes critical for all kinetoplastid life cycles.",

    "abstract": "2Bordetella species cause lower respiratory tract infections in mammals. B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica are the causative agents of whooping cough and kennel cough, respectively. The current acellular vaccine for B. pertussis protects against the pertussis toxin but does not prevent transmission or colonization. Cases of B. pertussis infections are on the rise even in areas of high vaccination. The PlrSR two-component system, is required for persistence in the mouse lung. A partial plrS deletion strain and a plrS H521Q strain cannot survive past three days in the lung, suggesting PlrSR works in a phosphorylation dependent mechanism. We characterized the biochemistry of B. bronchiseptica PlrSR and found that both proteins function as a canonical two-component system. His521 and Glu522 were essential for PlrS autophosphorylation. Asn525 was essential for phosphatase activity. The PAS domain was critical for both PlrS autophosphorylation and phosphatase activities. PlrS can both phosphotransfer to and exert phosphatase activity towards PlrR. Unexpectedly, PlrR forms a tetramer when unphosphorylated and a dimer upon phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrated the importance of PlrS phosphatase activity for persistence within the murine lung. By characterizing PlrSR we hope to guide future in vivo investigation for development of new vaccines and therapeutics.\n\n10 GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) are among the most commonly used vehicles for in vivo based gene therapies. However, it is hard to predict which AAV capsid will provide the most robust expression in human subjects due to the observed discordance in vector-mediated transduction between species. We used a primate specific capsid, AAV-LK03, and demonstrated that the limitation of this capsid towards transduction of mouse cells was unrelated to cell entry and nuclear transport but rather due to depleted histone H3 chemical modifications related to active transcription, namely H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, on the vector DNA itself. A single-amino acid insertion into the AAV-LK03 capsid enabled efficient transduction and the accumulation of active histone marks on the vector chromatin in mouse without compromising transduction efficiency in human cells. Our study suggests that the capsid protein itself is involved in determining the chromatin status of the vector genome, most likely during the process of uncoating. Programming viral chromatin states by capsid design may enable facile DNA transduction between vector and host species.",

    "abstract": "A large number of transcription factors have been shown to bind and interact with mitotic chromosomes, which may promote the efficient reactivation of transcriptional programs following cell division. Although the DNA-binding domain (DBD) contributes strongly to TF behavior, TFs from the same DBD family can display distinct binding behaviors during mitosis. To define the mechanisms governing TF behavior during mitosis in mouse embryonic stem cells, we examined two related TFs: Heat Shock Factor 1 and 2 (HSF1 and HSF2). We found that HSF2 maintains site-specific binding genome-wide during mitosis, whereas HSF1 binding is globally decreased. Surprisingly, live-cell imaging shows that both factors appear excluded from mitotic chromosomes, and are similarly more dynamic in mitosis than in interphase. Exclusion from mitotic DNA is not due to extrinsic factors like nuclear import and export mechanisms. Rather, we found that the HSF2 DBD alone can coat mitotic chromosomes, but is insufficient to promote HSF1 coating. These data further confirm that site-specific binding and chromosome coating are independent properties, and that for some TFs, mitotic behavior is largely determined by the non-DBD regions.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are about 22-nucleotide (nt) non-coding RNAs forming the effector complexes with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to repress gene expression. Although tiny RNAs (tyRNAs) shorter than 19 nt have been found to bind to plant and vertebrate AGOs, their biogenesis remains a long-standing question. Here, our in vivo and in vitro studies show several 3[-&gt;]5 exonucleases, such as interferon-stimulated gene 20 kDa (ISG20), three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), and ERI1 (enhanced RNAi, also known as 3hExo), capable of trimming AGO-associated full-length miRNAs to 14 nt or shorter tyRNAs. Their guide trimming occurs in a manganese-dependent manner but independently of the guide sequence and the loaded four human AGO paralogs. We also show that ISG20-mediated guide trimming makes Argonaute3 (AGO3) a slicer. Given the high Mn2+ concentrations in stressed cells, virus-infected cells, and neurodegeneration, our study sheds light on the roles of the Mn2+-dependent exonucleases in remodeling gene silencing.",

    "abstract": "Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) represent complex lesions that block essential biological processes, including DNA replication, recombination, and transcription. Several pathways have been involved in ICL repair, in particular nucleotide excision repair (NER), translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), Fanconi anemia (FA), and homologous recombination (HR). Still, the extent of factors involved in the resolution of ICL-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) remains poorly defined. Using CRISPR-based genome-wide screening, we identified the poorly characterized C1orf112 (also known as Apolo1) as a novel sensitizer to the clinically relevant ICL-inducing agent mafosfamide. Consistently, we noted that low expression of C1orf112 correlates with increased sensitivity to a series of ICL agents and PARP inhibitors in a panel of cell lines. We showed that lack of C1orf112 does not impact the initial recruitment and ubiquitylation of FANCD2 at the ICL site but rather impairs the resolution of RAD51 from ICL-induced DSBs, thereby compromising homology-directed DNA repair pathways. Our proximal mapping of C1orf112 protein neighbours coupled to structure-function analysis revealed that C1orf112, through its WCF motif, forms a complex with the N-terminal domain of the AAA+ ATPase FIGNL1 and regulates the interaction of FIGNL1 with RAD51. Our work establishes the C1orf112-FIGNL1 complex as an integral part of the HR-mediated response to ICLs by regulating the unloading of RAD51 during ICL repair.",

This is due to rapid microbial colonization during dysbiosis combined with pathogenic tendencies. We characterized the dysbiotic gut community, defined potential functional pathways, and investigated crosstalk between host gene expression and microbial detections in an intestinal inflammation murine model. Members of Enterobacteriaceae family and the Enterococcus genus were highly detected in dysbiotic mice. These metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) contained several virulence factors and metabolic pathways necessary to drive perpetual inflammation. Two Enterobacteriaceae MAGs with L-cysteine and L-taurine dioxygenases were strongly correlated with upregulation of the host gene CSAD, responsible for cysteine metabolism.

    "abstract": "Viral metagenomics has contributed enormously to the characterization of a wide range of viruses infecting animals of all phyla in the last decades. Among Neotropical primates, especially those free-living introduced, knowledge about viral diversity remains poorly studied. Therefore, through the use of metagenomics based on virus enrichment, we explored the viral microbiota present in the feces of introduced common marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in three locations from the Silva Jardim region in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fecal samples were collected from nine marmosets, pooled into three sample pools and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequence reads were analyzed using a viral metagenomic analysis pipeline and two novel insect viruses belonging to the Parvoviridae and Baculoviridae families were identified. The complete genome of a densovirus (Parvoviridae family) of 5,309 nucleotides (nt) was obtained. The NS1 and VP1 proteins share lower than 32% sequence identity with the corresponding proteins of known members of the subfamily Densovirinae. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this virus represents a new genus, named Tritonambidensovirus due to telomeric structures at the 3 and 5 ends of the genome. The novel species received the name Fecalis tritonambidensovirus 1. The complete circular genome of a baculovirus of 107,191 nt was also obtained, showing 60.8% sequence identity with the most closely related member of the Baculoviridae family. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this virus represents a new species of Betabaculovirus, named Callithrix fecalis granulovirus. In addition, sequences from several families of arthropods in the three pools evaluated were characterized (contigs ranging from 244 to 6,750 nt), corroborating the presence of possible insect hosts with which these new viruses may be associated. Our study expands the knowledge about two viral families known to infect insects, an important component of the marmosets diet. This identification in hosts feces samples demonstrates one of the many uses of this type of data and could serve as a basis for future research characterizing viruses in wildlife using noninvasive samples.",

But proteins obtained from natural sources are oftentimes not suitable for direct use in industrial or diagnostic setups. Natural proteins, evolved to optimally perform a task in physiological conditions, usually lack the stability required to be used in harsher conditions. Therefore, the alteration of the stability of proteins is commonly pursued in protein engineering studies.\n\nHere we achieved a substantial thermal stabilization of a bacterial Zn(II) dependent phospholipase C by consensus sequence design. We retrieved and analyzed sequenced homologs from different sources, selecting a subset of examples for expression and characterization. A non-natural consensus sequence showed the highest stability and activity among those tested. Comparison of activity and stability parameters between this stabilized mutant with other natural variants bearing similar mutations allow us to pinpoint the sites most likely to be responsible for the enhancement. We show that the stabilized version of the protein retains full activity even in the harsh oil degumming conditions.",

    "abstract": "Importin  is a nuclear transporter that binds to nuclear localization signals (NLSs), consisting of 7-20 positively charged amino acids found within cargo proteins. In addition to cargo binding, intramolecular interactions also occur within the importin  protein due to binding between the importin {beta}-binding (IBB) domain and the NLS-binding sites, a phenomenon called auto-inhibition. The interactions causing auto-inhibition are driven by a stretch of basic residues, similar to an NLS, in the IBB domain. Consistent with this, importin  proteins that do not have some of these basic residues lack auto-inhibition; a naturally occurring example of such a protein is found in the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum. In this report, we show that importin  from another apicomplexan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, harbors basic residues (KKR) in the IBB domain and exhibits auto-inhibition. This protein has a long, unstructured hinge motif (between the IBB domain and the NLS-binding sites) that does not contribute to auto-inhibition. However, the IBB domain may have a higher propensity to form an -helical structure, positioning the wild-type KKR motif in an orientation that results in weaker interactions with the NLS-binding site than a KRR mutant. We conclude that the importin  protein from T. gondii shows auto-inhibition, exhibiting a different phenotype from that of P. falciparum importin . However, our data indicate that T. gondii importin  may have a low strength of auto-inhibition. We hypothesize that low levels of auto-inhibition may confer an advantage to these important human pathogens.",

The coordination of the nucleocapsid components to the sites of assembly and budding are poorly understood. Here, we investigate nucleocapsid assembly by characterizing the interactions of the wild-type and truncated capsid proteins with membranes by using biophysical methods and model membrane systems. We show that capsid protein initially binds membranes via electrostatic interactions with negatively-charged lipids which is followed by membrane insertion. Additionally, we show that membrane-bound capsid protein can recruit viral genomic RNA. We confirm the biological relevance of the biophysical findings by using mass spectrometry to show that purified virions contain negatively-charged lipids. Our results suggest that nucleocapsid assembly is coordinated by negatively-charged membrane patches on the endoplasmic reticulum and that the capsid protein mediates direct contacts between the nucleocapsid and the membrane.",

    "abstract": "Summary of the Protocol ExtensionThis Protocol Extension describes the adaptation of an existing Nature Protocol detailing the use of T-REX (targetable reactive electrophiles and oxidants)--an on-demand redox targeting toolset in cultured cells. The adaptation described here is for use of REX technologies in live zebrafish embryos (Z-REX). Zebrafish embryos expressing a Halo-tagged protein of interest (POI)--either ubiquitously or tissue-specifically--are treated with a HaloTag-specific small-molecule probe housing a photocaged reactive electrophile (either natural electrophiles or synthetic electrophilic drug-like fragments). The reactive electrophile is then photouncaged at a user-defined time, enabling proximity-assisted electrophile-modification of a POI. Functional and phenotypic ramifications of POI-specific modification can then be monitored, by coupling to standard downstream assays, such as, Click chemistry-based POI-labeling and target-occupancy quantification; immunofluorescence or live imaging; RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses of downstream-transcript modulations. Transient expression of requisite Halo-POI in zebrafish embryos is achieved by mRNA injection. Procedures associated with generation of transgenic zebrafish expressing a tissue-specific Halo-POI are also described. The Z-REX experiments can be completed in <1-week using standard techniques. To successfully execute Z-REX, researchers should have basic skills in fish husbandry, imaging, and pathway analysis. Experience with protein or proteome manipulation is useful. This protocol extension is aimed at helping chemical biologists study precision redox events in a model organism and fish biologists perform redox chemical biology.",

    "abstract": "The surge in demand for cost-effective, durable long-term archival media, coupled with density limitations of contemporary magnetic media, has resulted in synthetic DNA emerging as a promising new alternative. Today, the limiting factor for DNA-based data archival is the cost of writing (synthesis) and reading (sequencing) DNA. Newer techniques that reduce the cost often do so at the expense of reliability, as they introduce complex, technology-specific error patterns. In order to deal with such errors, it is important to design efficient pipelines that can carefully use redundancy to mask errors without amplifying overall cost. In this paper, we present OligoArchive-DSM (OA-DSM), an end-to-end DNA archival pipeline that can provide error-tolerant data storage at low read/write costs. Central to OA-DSM is a database-inspired columnar encoding technique that makes it possible to improve efficiency by enabling integrated decoding and consensus calling during data restoration.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of susceptibility loci associated with immune-mediated diseases, many of which are shared across multiple diseases. To assess the extent of the genetic sharing across nine immune-mediated diseases we applied genomic structural equation modelling (genomic SEM) to GWAS data. By modelling the genetic covariance between these diseases, we identified three distinct groups: gastrointestinal tract diseases, rheumatic and systemic diseases, and allergic diseases. We identified 92, 103 and 91 genetic loci that predispose to each of these disease groups, with only 12 of them being shared across groups. Although loci associated with each of these disease groups were highly specific, they converged on perturbing the same pathways, primarily T cell activation and cytokine signalling. Finally, to assess whether variants associated with each disease group modulate gene expression in immune cells, we tested for colocalization between loci and single-cell eQTLs derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We identified the causal route by which 47 loci contribute to predisposition to these three disease groups. In addition, given that the assessed variants are pleiotropic, we found evidence for eight of these genes being strong candidates for drug repurposing. Taken together, our data suggest that different constellations of diseases have distinct patterns of genetic association, but that associated loci converge on perturbing different nodes in a common set of T cell activation and signalling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Lithium (Li) has a wide range of uses in science, medicine and industry but its isotopy is underexplored, except in nuclear science and in geoscience. 6Li and 7Li isotopic ratio exhibits the second largest variation on Earths surface and constitutes a widely used tool for reconstructing past oceans and climates. As large variations have been measured in mammalian organs, plants or marine species, and as 6Li elicits stronger effects than natural Li (~95% 7Li) a central issue is the identification and quantification of biological influence of Li isotopes distribution. We show here that membrane ion channels and Na+-Li+/H+ exchangers (NHEs), strongly fractionate Li isotopes. This systematic 6Li enrichment is driven by membrane potential for channels, and by intracellular pH for NHEs, where it displays cooperativity, a hallmark of dimeric transport. Evidencing that transport proteins discriminate between isotopes differing by one neutron, opens new avenues for transport mechanisms, Li physiology, and paleoenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Allele-specific expression, which measures the expression of two alleles of a gene in a diploid individual, is a powerful signal to study cis-regulatory effects. Comparing ASE across conditions, or differential ASE, can reveal context-specific gene regulation. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has allowed the measurement of ASE at the resolution of individual cells, but there is a lack of statistical methods to analyze such data. We develop DAESC, a statistical method for differential ASE analysis across any condition of interest using scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals. DAESC includes a baseline model based on beta-binomial regression with random effects accounting for multiple cells from the same individual (DAESC-BB), and an extended mixture model that incorporates implicit haplotype phasing (DAESC-Mix). We demonstrate through simulations that DAESC accurately captures differential ASE effects in a wide range of scenarios. Application to scRNA-seq data from 105 induced pluripotent stem cell lines identifies 657 genes that are dynamically regulated during endoderm differentiation. A second application identifies several genes that are differentially regulated in pancreatic endocrine cells between type 2 diabetes patients and controls. In conclusion, DAESC is a powerful method for single-cell differential ASE analysis and can facilitate the discovery of context-specific regulatory effects.",
