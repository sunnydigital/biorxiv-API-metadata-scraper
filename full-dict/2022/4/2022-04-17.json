    "abstract": "Behaviour involves complex dynamic interactions across many brain regions. Detecting whole-brain activity in mice performing sophisticated behavioural tasks could facilitate insights into distributed processing underlying behaviour, guide local targeting, and help bridge the disparate spatial scales between rodent and human studies. Here, we present a comprehensive approach for recording brain-wide activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compatible with a wide range of behavioural paradigms and neuroscience questions. We introduce hardware and procedural advances to allow multi-sensory, multi-action behavioural paradigms in the scanner. We identify signal artefacts arising from task-related body movements and propose novel strategies to reduce them. We validate and explore our approach in a 4-odour classical conditioning and a visually-guided operant task, illustrating how it can be used to extract information so far inaccessible to rodent behaviour studies. Our work paves the way for future studies combining fMRI and local circuit techniques during complex behaviour to tackle multi-scale behavioural neuroscience questions.",

    "abstract": "How much can connectomes with synaptic resolution help us understand brain function? An optimistic view is that a connectome is a major determinant of brain function and a key substrate for simulating a brain. Here we investigate the explanatory power of connectomics using a wiring diagram reconstructed from a larval zebrafish brainstem. We identify modules of strongly connected neurons that turn out to be specialized for different behavioral functions, the control of eye and body movements. We then build a neural network model using a synaptic weight matrix based on the reconstructed wiring diagram. This leads to predictions that statistically match the neural coding of eye position as observed by calcium imaging. Our work shows the promise of connectome-based brain modeling to yield experimentally testable predictions of neural activity and behavior, as well as mechanistic explanations of low-dimensional neural dynamics, a widely observed phenomenon in nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "Native Americans domesticated maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) from lowland teosinte parviglumis (Zea mays ssp.parviglumis) in the warm Mexican southwest and brought it to the highlands of Mexico and South America where it was exposed to lower temperatures that imposed strong selection on flowering time. Phospholipids are important metabolites in plant responses to low-temperature and phosphorus availability, and have been suggested to influence flowering time. Here, we combined linkage mapping with genome scans to identify High PhosphatidylCholine 1 (HPC1), a gene that encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme, as a major driver of phospholipid variation in highland maize. Common garden experiments demonstrated strong genotype-by-environment interactions associated with variation at HPC1, with the highland HPC1 allele leading to higher fitness in highlands, possibly by hastening flowering. The highland maize HPC1 variant resulted in impaired function of the encoded protein due to a polymorphism in a highly conserved sequence. A meta-analysis across HPC1 orthologs indicated a strong association between the identity of the amino acid at this position and optimal growth in prokaryotes. Mutagenesis of HPC1 via genome editing validated its role in regulating phospholipid metabolism. Finally, we showed that the highland HPC1 allele entered cultivated maize by introgression from the wild highland teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana and has been maintained in maize breeding lines from the Northern US, Canada and Europe. Thus, HPC1 introgressed from teosinte mexicana underlies a large metabolic QTL that modulates phosphatidylcholine levels and has an adaptive effect at least in part via induction of early flowering time.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental principle of biological motor control is that the neural commands driving movement must conform to the response properties of the motor plants they control. In the oculomotor system, characterizations of oculomotor plant dynamics traditionally supported models in which the plant responds to neural drive to extraocular muscles on exclusively short, subsecond timescales. These models predict that the stabilization of gaze during fixations between saccades requires neural drive that approximates eye position on longer timescales and is generated through the temporal integration of brief eye velocity-encoding signals that cause saccades. However, recent measurements of oculomotor plant behaviour have revealed responses on longer timescales. Furthermore, measurements of firing patterns in the oculomotor integrator have revealed a more complex encoding of eye movement dynamics. Yet, the link between these observations has remained unclear. Here we use measurements from the larval zebrafish to link dynamics in the oculomotor plant to dynamics in the neural integrator. The oculomotor plant in both anaesthetized and awake larval zebrafish was characterized by a broad distribution of response timescales, including those much longer than one second. Analysis of the firing patterns of oculomotor integrator neurons, which exhibited a broadly distributed range of decay time constants, demonstrates the sufficiency of this activity for stabilizing gaze given an oculomotor plant with distributed response timescales. This work suggests that leaky integration on multiple, distributed timescales by the oculomotor integrator reflects an inverse model for generating oculomotor commands, and that multi-timescale dynamics may be a general feature of motor circuitry.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIRecent observations of oculomotor plant response properties and neural activity across the oculomotor system have called into question classical formulations of both the oculomotor plant and the oculomotor integrator.\nC_LIO_LIHere we use measurements from new and published experiments in the larval zebrafish together with modelling to reconcile recent oculomotor plant observations with oculomotor integrator function.\nC_LIO_LIWe developed computational techniques to characterize oculomotor plant responses over several seconds in awake animals, demonstrating that long timescale responses seen in anesthetized animals extend to the awake state.\nC_LIO_LIAnalysis of firing patterns of oculomotor integrator neurons demonstrates the sufficiency of this activity for stabilizing gaze given an oculomotor plant with multiple, distributed response timescales.\nC_LIO_LIOur results support a formulation of gaze stabilization by the oculomotor system in which commands for stabilizing gaze are generated through integration on multiple, distributed timescales.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Terrains in a 3D world can be undulating. Yet, most prior research has exclusively investigated spatial representations on a flat surface, leaving a 2D cognitive map as the dominant model in the field. Here, we investigated whether humans represent a curved surface by building a dimension-reduced flattened 2D map or a full 3D map. Participants learned the location of objects positioned on a flat and curved surface in a virtual environment by driving on the concave side of the surface (Experiment 1), driving and looking vertically (Experiment 2), or flying (Experiment 3). Subsequently, they were asked to retrieve either the path distance or the 3D Euclidean distance between the objects. Path distance estimation was good overall, but we found a significant underestimation bias for the path distance on the curve, suggesting an influence of potential 3D shortcuts, even though participants were only driving on the surface. Euclidean distance estimation was better when participants were exposed more to the global 3D structure of the environment by looking and flying. These results suggest that the representation of the 2D manifold, embedded in a 3D world, is neither purely 2D nor 3D. Rather, it is flexible and dependent on the behavioral experience and demand.",

    "abstract": "With the development of sequencing technologies and computational analysis in metagenomics, the genetic diversity of non-conserved regions has been receiving intensive attention to unravel the human gut microbial community. However, it remains a challenge to obtain enough microbial draft genomes at a high resolution from a single sample. In this work, we presented MetaTrass with a strategy of binning first and assembling later to assemble high-quality draft genomes based on metagenomics co-barcoding reads and the public reference genomes. We applied the tool to the single tube long fragment reads datasets for four human faecal samples, and generated more high-quality draft genomes with longer contiguity and higher resolution than the common combination strategies of genome assembling and binning. A total of 178 high-quality genomes was successfully assembled by MetaTrass, but the maximum of 58 was generated by the optimal common combination strategy in our tests. These high-quality genomes paved the way for genetic diversity and lineage analysis among different samples. With the high capability of assembling high-quality genomes of metagenomics datasets, MetaTrass will facilitate the study of spatial characters and dynamics of complex microbial communities at high resolution.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPosition Effect Variegation (PEV) results from the juxtaposition of euchromatic and heterochromatic components of eukaryotic genomes, silencing genes near the new euchromatin/heterochromatin junctions. Silencing is itself heritable through S phase, giving rise to distinctive random patterns of cell clones expressing the genes intermixed with clones in which the genes are silenced. Much of what we know about epigenetic inheritance in the soma stems from work on PEV aimed at identifying the components of the silencing machinery and its mechanism of inheritance. The roles of two central gene activities - the Su(var)3-9-encoded histone H3-Lysine-9 methyltransferase and the Su(var)205-encoded methyl-H3-Lysine-9 binding protein HP1a - have been inferred from terminal phenotypes, leaving considerable gaps in understanding how PEV behaves through development. Here, we investigate the PEV phenotypes of Su(var)3-9 and Su(var)205 mutations in live developing tissues. We discovered that mutation in Su(var)205 compromises the initial establishment of PEV in early embryogenesis. Later gains of heterochromatin-induced gene silencing are possible, but are unstable and lost rapidly. In contrast, a strain with mutation in Su(var)3-9 exhibits robust silencing early in development, but fails to maintain it through subsequent cell divisions. Our analyses show that while the terminal phenotypes of these mutations may appear identical, they have arrived at them through different developmental trajectories. We discuss how our findings expand and clarify existing models for epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin-induced gene silencing.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWCurrent concepts of epigenetic inheritance are exemplified by Position Effect Variegation, a phenomenon whereby heterochromatin can repress genes in clonal cell lineages. Heterochromatin is required for genome protection as it silences toxic transposable elements and prevents instability of repeat sequences. Histone H3 modified by methylation of Lysine-9 and HP1a are critical components of heterochromatin. Using live cell analysis of PEV in mutants in strains with mutations in Su(var)3-9, which encodes the histone methyltransferase, and Su(var)205, which encodes HP1a, we describe an unexpected dynamism in PEV, challenging current models of epigenetics, and revealing unexpectedly different modes of action of these two fundamental components of heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "The direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia (BG) have been suggested to learn mainly from positive and negative feedbacks, respectively. Since these pathways unevenly receive inputs from different cortical neuron types and/or regions, they may preferentially use different state/action representations. We explored whether such combined use of different representations coupled with appetitive or aversive learning has computational benefits. We simulated reward learning tasks in dynamic environments, and examined the performance of animal modeled as an agent equipped with two learning systems, each of which used individual representation (IR) or successor representation (SR) of states. With varying the combination of IR or SR and also the learning rates from positive and negative reward prediction errors (RPEs) in each system, we found that combination of an SR-based system learning mainly from positive RPEs and an IR-based system learning mainly from negative RPEs could achieve good performance, as compared to other combinations, in many situations. The architecture of such a combination provides a novel coherent explanation for the functional significance and underlying mechanism of diverse findings about the cortico-BG circuits. These results suggest that combining different representations with appetitive and aversive learning is an effective learning strategy adopted by the brain.",

    "abstract": "Ovulation is a dramatic remodeling process that includes rupture of blood capillaries and clotting, but coagulation is not thought to directly regulate this process. Herein, we report remarkable increases of coagulation factors V (f5, [~]3145-fold) and tissue factor (f3a, [~]120-fold) in zebrafish ovarian follicle cells during ovulation. This increase was mediated through the nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr), which is essential for ovulation in zebrafish, and was totally abolished in ovarian follicular cells from pgr-/- mutants. In addition, promoter activities of f5 and f3a were significantly enhanced by progestin (DHP) via Pgr. Similar regulation of human F5 promoter activity was induced via human PGRB, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis of the zebrafish f5 promoter further demonstrated a direct regulation of coagulation factors via progestin response elements. Moreover, a stark increase of erythrocytes occurred in capillaries meshed in wildtype preovulatory follicles but was absent in pgr-/- mutants. Interestingly, anticoagulants significantly inhibited ovulation both in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Furthermore, reduced fecundity was observed in f5+/- female zebrafish. Taken together, our study provides plausible evidence for steroid regulation of coagulation factors, and a new hypothesis for blood clotting triggered ovulation in vertebrates.",

We screened the genome for genes with Myb domains encoding since these can be needed for pathogenesis. We found Myb1-19. Only MoMyb1 was previously shown to be involved in pathogenesis. We succeeded in deleting 12 of the other 18 genes. MoMyb2 deletion affected mainly growth, while MoMyb13 or MoMyb15 deletions gave additional defects in conidiation and plant infection. However, RT-qPCR showed that none of the 19 Myb genes are negligibly expressed. Instead, they have different expression profiles hours post-infection when infecting rice plants. Considering this, the unchanged infection phenotype for 9 gene deletions surprised us, and we extended the analysis to expression co-regulation of all 19 Myb proteins and found 5 co-regulated groups of predicted Myb-domain proteins. MoMyb13 or MoMyb15 are discussed and motivated as candidates for further, more detailed studies with aims also outside of plant pathology. Referring to what is found in other eukaryotes, we finally discuss possible redundancy or compensatory regulations for many of the other Myb genes hiding or compensating for the effect of many complete deletions.\n\nIMPORTANCEMagnaporthe oryzae is considered the most important rice pathogen limiting rice production. Our study attempts to find all genes encoding a DNA-binding gene family called Myb, and we found 19, many of which have not been studied before.

    "abstract": "While the One Health issues of intensive animal farming are commonly discussed, keeping companion animals is less associated with the interspecies headway of antimicrobial resistance. With the constant advance of veterinary standards, antibiotics are regularly applied in companion animal medicine. Due to the close coexsistance of dogs and humans, dog bites and other casual encounters with dog saliva (e.g. licking the owner) are common. According to our metagenome studies based on 26 new generation sequencing canine saliva datasets from 2020 and 2021 reposited in NCBI SRA by The 10,000 Dog Genome Consortium and the Broad Institute within Darwins Ark project, canine saliva is rich in bacteria with predictably transferable antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). In the genom of potentially pathogenic Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Corynebacterium, Fusobacterium, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, that are some of the most relevant bacteria in dog bite infections, ARGs against aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins, glycylcyclines, lincosamides, macrolides, oxazolidinone, penams, phenicols, pleuromutilins, streptogramins, sulfonamides and tetracyclines could be identfied. Several ARGs, including ones against amoxicillin-clavulanate, the most commonly applied antibiotic by dog bites, was predicted to be potentially transferable based on their association with mobile genetic elements (e.g. plasmids, phages, integrated mobile genetic elements). According to our findings canine saliva may be a source of transfer of ARG-rich bacteria, that can either colonize the human body or transport ARGs to the host bacteriota and thus can be considered as a risk in the spread of antimicrobial resistance.",

How the brain coordinates neural activity with sleep onset can provide insight into the physiological functions subserved by sleep and pathologic phenomena associated with sleep onset. We quantified whole-brain network changes in synchrony and information flow during the transition from wake to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep using magnetoencephalography imaging in healthy subjects. In addition, we performed computational modeling to infer excitatory and inhibitory properties of local neural activity. The sleep transition was identified to be encoded in spatially and temporally specific patterns of local and long-range neural synchrony. Patterns of information flow revealed that mesial frontal regions receive hierarchically organized inputs from broad cortical regions upon sleep onset. Finally, biophysical neural mass modeling demonstrated spatially heterogeneous properties of cortical excitation-to-inhibition from wake to NREM. Together, these findings reveal whole-brain corticocortical structure in the sleep-wake transition and demonstrate the orchestration of local and long-range, frequency-specific cortical interactions that are fundamental to sleep onset.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the automatic decoding of inner speech using noninvasive methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG)). While inner speech has been a research topic in philosophy and psychology for half a century, recent attempts have been made to decode nonvoiced spoken words by using various brain-computer interfaces. The main shortcomings of existing work are reproducibility and the availability of data and code. In this work, we investigate various methods (using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)) for the detection task of 5 vowels and 6 words on a publicly available EEG dataset. The main contributions of this work are (1) subject dependent vs. subject-independent approaches, (2) the effect of different preprocessing steps (Independent Component Analysis (ICA), down-sampling and filtering), and (3) word classification (where we achieve state-of-the-art performance on a publicly available dataset). Overall we achieve a performance accuracy of 35.20% and 29.21% when classifying 5 vowels and 6 words respectively in a publicly available dataset, using our tuned iSpeech-CNN architecture. All of our code and processed data are publicly available to ensure reproducibility. As such, this work contributes to a deeper understanding and reproducibility of experiments in the area of inner speech detection.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has developed into a set of powerful techniques that has improved spatial resolution over diffraction-limited microscopy and demonstrated the ability to resolve biological features at the very molecular scale. We introduce a single molecule based scanning SMLM (scanSMLM) system that enables rapid volume imaging. Using a standard widefield illumination, the system employs a scanning based detection 4f-sub-system suited for volume interrogation. The 4f system comprises of a combination of electrically-tunable lens and high NA detection objective lens. By rapidly changing the aperture (or equivalently the focus) of electrically-tunable lens (ETL) in a 4f detection system, the selectivity of axial (Z) plane can be achieved in the object plane, for which the corresponding image forms in the image/detector plane. So, in-principle one can scan the object volume by just changing the aperture of ETL. To carry out volume imaging, a cyclic scanning scheme is developed and compared with conventional scanning routinely used in SMLM. The scanning scheme serves the purpose of distributing photobleaching evenly by ensuring uniform dwell time on each frame for collecting data (single molecule events) throughout the specimen volume. With minimal change in the system hardware (requiring an addition of ETL lens and related hardware for step-voltage generation) in the existing SMLM system, volume scanning (along z-axis) can be achieved. To demonstrate, we imaged fluorescent beads embedded in a gel-matrix 3D block as a test sample. Subsequently, scanSMLM is employed to understand clustering of HA single molecules in a transfected cell (Influenza A disease model). The system for the first time enables visualization of HA distribution in a 3D cells that reveal its clustering across the cell volume. Critical biophysical parameters related to HA clusters (density, #HA/cluster and clustered fraction) are also determined.",

While the importance of active turbulence is widely recognized, the structure and dynamics of the resulting collective flows are the subject of intense investigation. Here, we combine microfluidic experiments with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis to quantify the dynamical flow structure of this model active matter system under a variety of conditions. In isotropic bulk turbulence, the modal representation shows that the most energetic flow structures dictate the spatio-temporal dynamics across a range of suspension activity levels. In confined geometries, POD analysis illustrates the role of boundary interactions for the transition to bacterial turbulence, and it quantifies the evolution of coherent active structures in externally applied flows. Beyond establishing the physical flow structures under-pinning the complex dynamics of bacterial turbulence, the low-dimensional representation afforded by this modal analysis offers a potential path toward data-driven modelling of active turbulence.",

    "abstract": "A number of bacteria with close resemblance to Vibrio cholerae has been isolated over the years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which could not be assigned a proper taxonomic designation based on preliminary identification methods. Nine such isolates have been found to share 16S rRNA gene identity exceeding 99% with V. cholerae, yet DNA-DNA hybridization (60.4-62.1%) and average nucleotide identity values (94.4-95.1%) were below the species cut-off, indicating a potentially novel species. Phylogenetic analysis of core genomes places this group of isolates in a monophyletic clade, within the \"Cholerae clade,\" but distinct from any other species. Extensive phenotypic characterization reveals unique biochemical properties that distinguish this novel species from V. cholerae. Comparative genomic analysis reveals a unique set of siderophore genes, suggesting that iron acquisition strategies could be vital for the divergence of the novel species from a common ancestor with V. cholerae. Based on genetic, phylogenetic, and phenotypic differences observed, we propose these isolates represent a novel species of the genus Vibrio, for which the name Vibrio tarriae sp. nov. is proposed.

However, higher-order interactions increasingly appear to be widespread. Consequently, we used a recently introduced and improved framework to re-analyze higher-order ecological interactions. We conducted a literature review of the last 100 years (1920-2020) and reanalyzed 151 ecological three-stressor interactions from 45 published papers. We found that 89% (n=134) of the three-stressor combinations resulted in new or different interactions than previously reported. We also found substantial levels of emergent properties-- interactions that are only revealed when all three stressors are present. Antagonism was the most prevalent net interaction whereas synergy was the most prevalent emergent interaction. Understanding multiple stressor interactions is crucial for fundamental questions in ecology and also has implications for conservation biology and population management.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) binding is a key component of genomic regulation. There are numerous high-throughput experimental methods to characterize TF-DNA binding specificities. Their application, however, is both laborious and expensive, which makes profiling all TFs challenging. For instance, the binding preferences of ~25% human TFs remain unknown; they neither have been determined experimentally nor inferred computationally. We introduce a structure-based learning approach to predict the binding preferences of TFs and the automated modelling of TF regulatory complexes. We show the advantage of using our approach over the state-of-art nearest-neighbor prediction in the limits of remote homology. Starting from a TF sequence or structure, we predict binding preferences in the form of motifs that are then used to scan a DNA sequence for occurrences. The best matches are either profiled with a binding score or collected for their subsequent modeling into a higher-order regulatory complex with DNA. Cooperativity is modelled by: i) the co-localization of TFs; and ii) the structural modeling of protein-protein interactions between TFs and with co-factors. As case examples, we apply our approach to automatically model the interferon-{beta} enhanceosome and the pioneering complex of OCT4, SOX2 and SOX11 with a nucleosome, which are compared with the experimentally known structures.",

Herein, using E. coli as a model live organism, whose viability in dry powders is highly sensitive to the water content in the powders, we demonstrated that the drying rate of thin-film freeze-drying (TFFD) is significantly higher than that of the conventional shelf freeze-drying, likely because the large total surface area from the loosely stacked frozen thin films and the low thickness of the thin-films enable faster and more efficient mass transfer during freeze-drying. The highly porous nature and high specific surface area of the thin-film freeze-dried powders may have contributed to the faster mass transfer as well. Moreover, we demonstrated that TFFD can be applied to produce dry powders of E. coli and L. acidophilus with minimum bacterial viability loss (i.e., within one log reduction), and the L. acidophilus dry powder is suitable for intranasal delivery. It is concluded that TFFD technology is promising in addressing the time-and cost-inefficient issue of conventional shelf freeze-drying.",

Yet, studies demonstrate vaccine responses are less effective in obese hosts. In these studies, we examined how the timing of weight loss influenced influenza vaccine efficacy in male and female diet- induced obese mice. Here, we show weight loss post-vaccination is insufficient to rescue poor vaccine efficacy; however, weight loss occurring pre-vaccination successfully improves outcomes at viral challenge. Pre-vaccination weight loss improved vaccine immunogenicity and restored a functional recall response at challenge. Through tracking sera metabolic biomarkers, we propose the metabolic state at the time of vaccination is predictive of vaccine immunogenicity. Altogether, these findings highlight how timing of host-directed interventions is vital when seeking to improve influenza vaccine immunogenicity in obese hosts.",

    "abstract": "The fijivirus Mal de Rio Cuarto virus (MRCV) causes a devastating maize disease. Its non-structural protein P9-1, which shows ATPase and RNA binding activities, is the major component of the intracellular viroplasm where virus replication takes place. Here, we established that the 24 C-terminal residues (C-arm) of P9-1 are required for the formation of viroplasm-like structures (VLS) in vivo and for the protein multimerization in vitro. Employing an integrative structural approach, we found that the C-arm is dispensable for P9-1 dimer assembly, but essential for the formation of doughnut-shaped pentamers and hexamers of dimers (decamers and dodecamers). Both assemblies, larger than those reported for other reoviruses, contain disordered loops oriented towards the inner pore of the structures, where RNA binding sites and conditional proteasome-mediated degradation signals (PEST) were predicted. In vitro assays demonstrated that ssRNA binding is favored towards P9-1 (do)decamers over the dimeric {Delta}C-arm version. In addition, although both P9-1 and P9-1{Delta}C-arm catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP with similar activity values, an RNA-stimulated ATPase activity was only observed in the full-length protein, indicating a C-arm-mediated interaction between the ATP catalytic site and the allosteric RNA binding sites in the (do)decameric assemblies. Computational studies revealed a stronger preference of phosphate moieties to the decamer in the pore and the C-arm regions, suggesting that the allosteric communication between the ATP and RNA binding sites is favored with this protein arrangement. Overall, our work reveals the structural versatility of a major viroplasm protein providing unprecedented insights into fijivirus viroplasm assembly and function and establishes the structural basis for the development of antiviral strategies against the Mal de Rio Cuarto crop disease.",

    "abstract": "Flavivirus Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein performs multiple functions such as host immune evasion, interaction with complement system factors, membrane rearrangement, etc. Therefore, it is highly plausible that significant structural and folding dynamics of NS1 might play a role in its multifunctionality. The dimeric structures of NS1 of multiple flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are available. However, its domain-wise dynamics perspective has not been explored so far. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the structural conformations of NS1 and its domains in isolation, possibly highlighting the implications on the overall NS1 protein dynamics. Here, we have employed extensively long molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to understand the role of monomer, dimer, and a reductionist approach in understanding the dynamics of the three structural domains (i.e., {beta}- roll, wing, and {beta}-ladder) in isolation. Further, we experimentally validated our findings using CD spectroscopy and confirmed the intrinsically disordered behavior of NS1 {beta}-roll in isolation and lipid mimetic environments. We also found that the {beta}-ladder domain is highly flexible during long simulations. Therefore, we believe this study may have implications for significant dynamics played by NS1 protein, specifically during oligomerization of NS1.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=154 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/488568v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2928org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b0b68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f9da77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@175fbc1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Schematic representation of the ZIKV NS1 protein and the models that we have used in this study.",

    "abstract": "Most cancer patients die because of tumor metastasis not due to tumors at the primary site. Prostate tumors in advance stages frequently metastasize to the bone, which is the main cause of death for the disease. The family of protein kinase D (PKD) has been implicated in prostate cancer development, however, its role in prostate cancer metastasis has not been investigated. In this study, we examined the contribution of PKD to the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells and the impact of PKD inhibition on prostate cancer bone metastasis in vivo. Our data showed that depletion of PKDs by siRNA or inhibition of PKD by an inhibitor CRT0066101 in a highly invasive prostate cancer PC3-ML cells potently inhibited colony formation and cell migration. Furthermore, depletion or inhibition of PKD significantly blocked invasion of PC3-ML cells and suppressed expression of genes related to bone metastasis. The reduced invasive activity resulted from PKD depletion was in part mediated through the transcription factor Runx2 as its silencing decreased PKD-mediated metastatic gene expression. Mechanistically, our data indicate that PKD modulated Runx2 target gene expression through the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling axis. Additionally, we examined whether PKD inhibitor CRT0066101 could prevent prostate cancer bone metastasis in a mouse model of metastasis, where intracardiac injection of PC3-ML cells led to metastasis of cells to the bone. We found that CRT0066101 potently decreased the frequency of micrometastases in mouse bone. These results indicate that PKDs play an important role in bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells and its inhibition may be beneficial for treatment of advanced stages of cancer.",

    "abstract": "A plant can be thought of as a colony comprising numerous growth buds, each developing to its own rhythm. Such lack of synchrony impedes efforts to describe core principles of plant morphogenesis, dissect the underlying mechanisms, and identify regulators. Here, we use the tiniest known angiosperm to overcome this challenge and provide an ideal model system for plant morphogenesis. We present a detailed morphological description of the monocot Wolffia australiana, as well as high-quality genome information. Further, we developed the Plant-on-Chip culture system and demonstrate the application of advanced technologies such as snRNA-seq, protein structure prediction, and gene editing. We provide proof-of-concept examples that illustrate how W. australiana can open a new horizon for deciphering the core regulatory mechanisms of plant morphogenesis.\n\nSignificanceWhat is the core morphogenetic process in angiosperms, a plant like a tree indeterminately growing, or a bud sequentially generating limited types of organs? Wolffia australiana, one of the smallest angiosperms in the world may help to make a distinction. Wolffia plantlet constitutes of only three organs that are indispensable to complete life cycle: one leaf, one stamen and one gynoecium. Before the growth tip is induced to flower, it keeps branching from the leaf axil and the branches separate from the main plantlet. Here we present a high-quality genome of W. australiana, detailed morphological description, a Plant-on-Chip cultural system, and some principle-proof experiments, demonstrating that W. australiana is a promising model system for deciphering core developmental program in angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTraumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) and sleep disturbances. We hypothesized that treatment with sleep aids after TBI can ameliorate PTE.\n\nMethodsCD-1 mice underwent controlled cortical impact (CCI), sham craniotomy or no craniotomy. Sham and CCI groups underwent a month-long treatment with sleep aids including a dual orexin antagonist (DORA-22) or THIP (gaboxadol). We performed week-long EEG recordings during week-1 of treatment and again at months 1, 2 and 3. Seizure analysis occurred at all-time points and sleep analysis occurred in week-1 and month-1 recordings in all groups. Subsets of animals in sleep aid-treated and untreated CCI, and sham groups were subjected to voltage clamp experiments.\n\nResultsDORA-22 treated group had seizures at week-1 but none at months 1-3. TBI reduced amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in dentate granule cells and these changes were rescued by DORA-22 treatment. Sleep analysis showed that DORA-22 increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) in the first 4hours of lights-off whereas THIP increased REM sleep in the first 4-hours of lights-on in week-1, At month-1 both treatments reduced time in NREM during lights-off. TBI increased NREM delta power (N{Delta}) along with loss of the homeostatic overnight decline of N{Delta} in week-1 regardless of treatment. DORA-22 and THIP treatment restored N{Delta} to levels similar to no craniotomy animals at month-1.\n\nConclusionsDORA-22 treatment suppressed posttraumatic seizures possibly due to enhanced GABAergic inhibition in dentate granule cells. DORA-22 may have therapeutic potential in suppressing PTE.\n\nSummary for Social MediaTraumatic brain injury (TBI) can result is posttraumatic epilepsy and sleep disturbances. There are no treatments to prevent these complications. We tested whether treatment with sleep aids after TBI can mitigate seizures and sleep disturbances. We found that a sleep aid DORA-22 but not THIP suppressed post traumatic seizures possibly be enhancing GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus. Sleep analysis showed that TBI disrupts the sleep homeostatic drive and DORA treatment restored it. Findings may lead to potential disease modifying therapy for posttraumatic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are often accompanied by anxiety and depression. Whether and how microglia are involved in TN-induced anxiodepressive remains unclear. Here, we unconventionally report that TN activates ipsilateral but not contralateral hippocampal microglia, upregulates ipsilateral hippocampal ATP and interleukin1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) levels, impairs ipsilateral hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), and induces anxiodepressive-like behaviors in a time-dependent manner in rodents. Specifically, activation of ipsilateral hippocampal microglia is necessary for TN-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviors; and unilateral activating hippocampal microglia is sufficient to elicit an anxiodepressive state and impair LTP. Knockdown of ipsilateral hippocampal P2X7 receptor prevented TN-induced microglial activation and anxiodepressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microglia-derived IL-1{beta} mediates microglial activation-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviors and LTP impairment. Together, these findings suggest that priming of microglia with ATP/P2X7R in the ipsilateral hippocampus drives pain-related anxiodepressive-like behaviors via IL-1{beta}. Our results also reveal an asymmetric role of the bilateral hippocampus in TN-induced anxiety and depression.",

    "abstract": "All drugs with the potential for addiction liability, including alcohol, produce distinct interoceptive stimulus effects that influence drug intake. Our lab has shown involvement of Group II metabotropic receptors (mGlu2/3) in the expression of alcohol interoceptive effects using a nonspecific mGlu2/3 agonist and antagonist. Furthermore, the anterior insular cortex (aIC) is a hub for interoceptive processing, including the interoceptive effects of alcohol. Therefore, the goal of the present work was to assess the independent functional contribution of mGlu2 and mGlu3, and the role of mGlu3 in the aIC, in the interoceptive effects of alcohol. As such, male, Long-Evans rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus effects of alcohol (2 g/kg, i.g.) from water (i.g.) using an operant, 2-lever drug discrimination procedure. To assess involvement of mGlu2 and mGlu3 in the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol, rats were administered the mGlu2 negative allosteric modulator (NAM, VU6001966; 0, 3, 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and the mGlu3-NAM (VU6010572; 0, 3, 6, 12 mg/kg, i.p.) before alcohol (2 g/kg, i.g.). mGlu2-NAM (6 mg/kg) and mGlu3-NAM (12 mg/kg) decreased alcohol-appropriate lever responses without affecting response rate, reflecting diminished interoceptive alcohol sensitivity. mGlu3-NAM microinjection (3 g) into the aIC before alcohol decreased response rate to such an extent that alcohol-appropriate lever responding could not be determined. As such, mGlu3-NAM was tested in the aIC before water administration to determine if VU6010572 substitutes for alcohol. mGlu3-NAM VU6010572 (3 g) in the aIC produced partial alcohol-like stimulus effects without affecting response rate. These data indicate that the newly developed mGlu2 and mGlu3 NAMs can modulate interoceptive effects of alcohol. The opposing effects of systemic vs. microinjected (aIC) mGlu3-NAM on alcohol interoceptive effects may reflect differences in receptor binding, a functionally relevant metabolite, and/or brain region differences in receptor function.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic infection elicits sickness behaviors that promote recovery and survival of the host. For example, following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans modifies its sensory preferences to avoid the pathogen. Here we identify antagonistic neuromodulatory circuits that shape this sickness behavior. Using an unbiased cell-directed neuropeptide screen, we show that AVK neurons upregulate and release FMRFamide-like FLP-1 neuropeptides during infection to drive pathogen avoidance. Manipulations that increase or decrease AVK signaling accelerate or delay pathogen avoidance, respectively, implicating AVK in the dynamics of sickness behavior. FLP-1 neuropeptides act via the G-protein-coupled receptor DMSR-7 in RIM/RIC neurons to reduce tyraminergic/octopaminergic signaling that opposes pathogen avoidance. RIM/RIC neurons relay parallel signals from neuropeptides and the cytokine TGF-{beta} that represent internal and external regulators of pathogen avoidance. Our results demonstrate that antagonism between neuromodulatory systems results in slow, graded transitions between alternative behavioral states.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease with no cure. It is driven by the IL-23/IL-17A axis and TH17 cells but, recently group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) have also been implicated. However, the development, and factors regulating the activity of ILC3s remain incompletely understood.\n\nImmune regulatory pathways are particularly important at barrier sites such as the skin, gut and lung, which are exposed to environmental substances and microbes. CD200R1 is an immune regulatory cell surface receptor which inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production in myeloid cells. CD200R1 is also highly expressed on ILCs, where its function remains largely unexplored. We previously observed reduced CD200R1 signalling in psoriasis skin, suggesting that dysregulation may promote disease. Here we show that contrary to this, psoriasis models are less severe in CD200R1-deficient mice due to reduced IL-17 production. Here we uncover a key cell-intrinsic role for CD200R1 in promoting IL-23-driven IL-17A production by ILC3s, by promoting STAT3 activation. CD200R1 is expressed on ILC precursors and is particularly high on neonatal ILC3s, suggesting CD200R1 may function during ILC development. Therefore, CD200R1 is required on ILC3s, potentially during their development, to promote IL-23-stimulated STAT3 activation triggering optimal IL-17 production.",

    "abstract": "Human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a globally reemerging respiratory pathogen that is associated with the development of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in children. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or treatments for EV-D68 infection, and there is a paucity of data related to the virus and host specific factors that predict disease severity and progression to the neurologic syndrome. Published animal models of EV-D68 infection to date have been limited to mice, cotton rat and ferrets, and investigation of the susceptibility of nonhuman primate (NHP) species to contemporary EV-D68 isolates has not yet been reported. In this study, we challenged juvenile NHPs - cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques, pigtailed macaques, and African green monkeys - with one of five different 2014 or 2018 EV-D68 isolates by the respiratory route. Animals were monitored for clinical respiratory and neurologic signs, and serially collected nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were evaluated for EV-D68 RNA and infectious virus. Infection with 2014 and 2018 EV-D68 isolates resulted in mild respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in some animals, but no evidence of neurological disease. Neither EV-D68 RNA nor infectious virus could be detected from any sample collected from animals challenged with 2014 EV-D68 isolates. Limited viral shedding - based on viral RNA quantified from nasal swabs and BALF - was detected from some animals infected with 2018 EV-D68 isolates. No virus was detectable in CSF. The rate of seroconversion was 100% for cynomolgus macaques infected with the 2018 EV-D68 isolates, but averaged between 0-50% for the 2014 isolates. Based on the results of this study, there is some evidence that infection with 2018 EV-D68 isolates may be more reliable at establishing limited infection than 2014 EV-D68 isolates. Regardless of virus isolate, however, EV-D68 infection of juvenile NHP species resulted in mild and nonspecific clinical disease and limited viral shedding. These data suggest that further refinements to the NHP model system (e.g., immunosuppression and/or direct viral inoculation) may be required to reproduce EV-D68 infection of the central nervous system and the associated AFM phenotype.",

Currently, no effective therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis is available. Three ongoing clinical trials aim to deliver a functional copy of the GLB1 gene to stop disease progression. Here, we show that 41% of GLB1 pathogenic SNVs might be cured by adenine base editors (ABEs). Our results demonstrate that ABE efficiently corrects the pathogenic allele in patient-derived fibroblasts, restoring a therapeutic level of {beta}-gal activity. Unbiased off-target DNA analysis did not detect off-target editing activity in treated patients cells except a bystander edit without consequences on {beta}-gal activity. Altogether our results suggest that gene editing is an alternative strategy to cure GM1 gangliosidosis, by correcting the root cause of disease and avoiding repetitive adeno-associated virus injections.",

We used preexisting variant datasets from USDA, a French commercial line and 30X-coverage whole genome sequencing of INRAE isogenic lines to develop an Affymetrix 665 K SNP array (HD chip) for rainbow trout. In total, we identified 32,372,492 SNPs that were polymorphic in the USDA or INRAE databases. A subset of identified SNPs were selected for inclusion on the chip, prioritizing SNPs whose flanking sequence uniquely aligned to the Swanson reference genome, with homogenous repartition over the genome and the highest Minimum Allele Frequency in both USDA and French databases. Of the 664,531 SNPs which passed the Affymetrix quality filters and were manufactured on the HD chip, 65.3% and 60.9% passed filtering metrics and were polymorphic in two other distinct French commercial populations in which, respectively, 288 and 175 sampled fish were genotyped. Only 576,118 SNPs mapped uniquely on both Swanson and Arlee reference genomes, and 12,071 SNPs did not map at all on the Arlee reference genome. Among those 576,118 SNPs, 38,948 SNPs were kept from the commercially available medium-density 57K SNP chip. We demonstrate the utility of the HD chip by describing the high rates of linkage disequilibrium at 2 kb to 10 kb in the rainbow trout genome in comparison to the linkage disequilibrium observed at 50 kb to 100 kb which are usual distances between markers of the medium-density chip.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis are the dominant ATP-generating pathways in mammalian metabolism. The balance between these two pathways is often shifted to execute cell-specific functions in response to stimuli that promote activation, proliferation, or differentiation. However, measurement of these metabolic switches has remained mostly qualitative, making it difficult to discriminate between healthy, physiological changes in energy transduction or compensatory responses due to metabolic dysfunction. We therefore developed a broadly applicable method to calculate ATP production rates from oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis using Seahorse XF Analyzer data. We quantified the bioenergetic changes observed during macrophage polarization as well as cancer cell adaptation to in vitro culture conditions. Additionally, we detected substantive changes in ATP utilization upon neuronal depolarization and T cell receptor activation that are not evident from steady-state ATP measurements. This method generates a single readout that allows the direct comparison of ATP produced from oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in live cells. Additionally, the manuscript provides a framework for tailoring the calculations to specific cell systems or experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePost-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a common long-term outcome following ACL injury. However, early changes to bone and synovial fluid after ACL injury are not sufficiently understood. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate whether acute bone loss one week after ACL injury is accompanied by altered subchondral bone plate modulus, (2) determine if bone changes are localized to the injured limb or extend to the contralateral-to-injured limb compared with sham-loaded controls, and (3) identify shifts in synovial fluid metabolism unique to injured limbs.\n\nDesignFemale C57Bl\\6N mice (19 weeks at injury) were subjected to either a single tibial compression overload to simulate ACL injury (n=8) or a small pre-load (n=8). Mice were euthanized 7 days after injury, and synovial fluid was immediately harvested for metabolomic profiling. Bone microarchitecture, bone formation, and subchondral bone modulus at the proximal tibia were studied using microCT, histomorphometry, and nanoindentation, respectively. Osteoclast number density was assessed at the distal femur. For each bone measure a mixed model ANOVA was generated to determine the effects of injury and loaded side.\n\nResultsEpiphyseal and subchondral bone microarchitecture decreased while subchondral bone tissue modulus was unchanged after ACL injuries. Bone resorption increased but bone formation was not changed. Loss of bone microarchitecture also occurred for the contralateral-to-injured limb, demonstrating that the early response to ACL injury extended beyond the injured joint. While the metabolomic profiles of the injured and contralateral-to-injured limbs had many similarities, there were also distinct metabolic shifts present in only the injured limbs. The most prominent of the pathways was cysteine and methionine metabolism, which is associated with osteoclast activity.\n\nConclusionThese results add to the understanding of early bone changes following ACL injury. Confirming prior reports, we observe a decline in epiphyseal and subchondral bone microarchitecture. We add the finding that subchondral bone modulus remains unchanged at one week after ACL injury. A potential biomarker of this initial bone catabolic response may be synovial fluid cysteine and methionine metabolism, which was only dysregulated in injured knees. Our results implicate a rapidly changing biological and mechanical environment within both the injured and contralateral joints that has the potential for influencing the progression to PTOA.",

    "abstract": "The number of annotated genes in the human genome has increased tremendously, and understanding their biological role is challenging through experimental methods alone. There is a need for a computational approach to infer the function of genes, particularly for non-coding RNAs, with reliable explainability. We have utilized genomic features that are present across both coding and non-coding genes like transcription factor (TF) binding pattern, histone modifications, and DNase hypersensitivity profiles to predict ontology-based functions of genes. Our approach for gene function prediction (GFPred) made reliable predictions (>90% balanced accuracy) for 486 gene-sets. Further analysis revealed that predictability using only TF-binding patterns at promoters is also high, and it paved the way for studying the effect of their combinatorics. The predicted associations between functions and genes were validated for their reliability using PubMed abstract mining. Clustering functions based on shared top predictive TFs revealed many latent groups of gene-sets involved in common major biological processes. Available CRISPR screens also supported the inferred association of genes with the major biological processes of latent groups of gene-sets. For the explainability of our approach, we also made more insights into the effect of combinatorics of TF binding (especially TF-pairs) on association with biological functions.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, a great interest has emerged in the study and characterisation of the microbiota, especially the human gut microbiota, demonstrating that commensal microorganisms play a pivotal role in normal anatomical development and physiological function of the human body. To better understand the complex bacterial dynamics that characterize different environments, bacteriophage predation and gene transfer need to be considered as well, as they are important factors that may contribute to controlling the density, diversity, and network interactions among bacterial communities. To date, a variety of bacteriophage identification tools have been developed, differing on phage mining strategies, input files requested and results produced; however, new users approaching the bacteriophage analysis might struggle in untangling the variety of methods and comparing the different results produced. Here we present MetaPhage, a comprehensive reads-to-report pipeline that streamlines the use of multiple miners and generates an exhaustive report to both summarize and visualize the key findings and to enable further exploration of specific results with interactive filterable tables. The pipeline is implemented in Nextflow, a widely adopted workflow manager, that enables an optimized parallelization of the tasks on different premises, from local server to the cloud, and ensures reproducible results using containerized packages. MetaPhage is designed to allow scalability, reproducibility and to be easily expanded with new miners and methods, in a field that is constantly expanding.

    "abstract": "The assembly and dynamic reorganization of plasma membrane nanodomains (also known as \"lipid rafts\") play key roles in host cell infection by human pathogens (e.g. viruses and bacteria). Viruses and bacteria can trigger the reorganization of lipid rafts which leads to membrane invaginations and downstream signaling that promote infection. Such reorganizations can be induced by interactions of bacterial or viral carbohydrate proteins (so-called lectins) with lipid raft glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Here, we studied the GSL globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) which is a key receptor involved in the cellular uptake of the gram-negative bacterium P. aeruginosa. The bacterial surface lectin LecA targets Gb3 and promotes bacterial invasion via the \"lipid zipper\" mechanism. However, the impact of LecA on the organization of membrane nanodomains is unknown yet. We mimicked of the plasma membrane using supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) that contained liquid-ordered (Lo, \"raft-like\", enriched in sphingolipids and GSLs) and liquid-disordered (Ld, \"non-raft-like\" enriched in DOPC) lipid domains. Upon interaction with LecA, the Lo domains in the SLBs reshaped and dispersed. Moreover, deformation of SLBs was observed as LecA formed membrane multilayers on SLBs surface. We further dissected this process to reveal the impact of Gb3 structure, bilayer composition and LecA valence on the Lo reorganization.",

    "abstract": "In tomato cultivation, a rare natural mutation in the flowering repressor antiflorigen gene SELF-PRUNING (sp-classic) induces precocious shoot termination and is the foundation in determinate tomato breeding for open field production. Heterozygosity for induced mutations in the florigen gene SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS in the background of sp-classic provides a heterosis-like effect by delaying shoot termination, suggesting subtle suppression of determinacy by genetic modification of florigen-antiflorigen balance could improve yield. Here, we isolated three new sp alleles from the tomato germplasm that show modified determinate growth compared to sp-classic, including one allele that mimics the effect of sft heterozygosity. Two deletion alleles eliminate functional transcripts and showed similar shoot termination, determinate growth, and yields as sp-classic. In contrast, amino acid substitution allele sp-5732 showed semi-determinate growth with more leaves and sympodial shoots on all shoots. This translated to greater yield compared to the other stronger alleles by up to 42%. Transcriptome profiling of axillary (sympodial) shoot meristems (SYM) from sp-classic and wild type plants revealed six mis-regulated genes related to the floral transition, which were used as biomarkers to show that the maturation of SYMs in the weaker sp-5732 genotype is delayed compared to sp-classic, consistent with delayed shoot termination and semi-determinate growth. Assessing sp allele frequencies from over 500 accessions indicated that one of the strong sp alleles (sp-2798) arose in early breeding cultivars but was not selected. The newly discovered sp alleles are potentially valuable resources to quantitatively manipulate shoot growth and yield in determinate breeding programs, with sp-5732 providing an opportunity to develop semi-determinate field varieties with higher yields.",

    "abstract": "Many eukaryotic transcription factors (TF) form homodimer or heterodimer complexes to regulate gene expression. For example, dimerization properties of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family play a critical role in regulating the unique biological functions in all eukaryotes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the binding sequence and functional specificity of homo- versus heterodimers remains elusive. To fill this gap, we developed a double DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (dDAP-seq) technique that maps heterodimer DNA binding sites in an endogenous genome context. Our genome-wide binding profiles of twenty pairs of C/S1 bZIP heterodimers and S1 homodimers in Arabidopsis revealed that heterodimerization significantly expands the DNA binding preferences of bZIP TFs. Analysis of the heterodimer target genes in stress response and development suggest heterodimerization gives rise to regulatory responses that are distinct from the homodimers. In addition to the classic ACGT elements recognized by plant bZIPs, we found that the C/S1 heterodimers bound to motifs that might share an origin with the GCN4 cis-elements in yeast that diverged from plants more than one billion years ago. Importantly, heterodimer binding specificities can be distinguished by their relative preference for ACGT motifs versus GCN4-related motifs. More broadly, our study demonstrates the potential of dDAP-seq in deciphering the DNA binding specificities of interacting TFs that are key for combinatorial gene regulation.",

In this study, we are reporting a new member of sirtuin in Oryza sativa indica. It shares approx. 89% sequence identity with bacterial sirtuin, a class III sirtuin member. This protein is mostly present in mitochondria with trace amounts in the nucleus. It can physically interact with histones H3 and H4 and can specifically deacetylate histone H3 at K9 and K18 positions. In mitochondria, acetyl coA synthetase (AcS) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) are the targets for its deacetylation. This removal of acetyl group is the mode of regulation under certain stress conditions. Thus, this is the first mitochondrial cobB targeting important plant machinery under changing growth environment. The OscobB deacetylase activity is not majorly affected by its products, NAM & ADP ribose but are sensitive to certain metal ions like Fe2+ and Mg2+.

Time-course single-cell gene expression with genome-wide footprinting reveal that HOPX interacts with and controls core cardiac networks by regulating the activity of mutually exclusive developmental gene programs. Upstream hypertrophy and proliferation pathways compete to regulate HOPX transcription. Mitogenic signals override hypertrophic growth signals to suppress HOPX and maintain cardiomyocyte progenitor gene programs. Physiological studies show HOPX directly governs genetic control of cardiomyocyte cell stress responses, electro-mechanical coupling, proliferation, and contractility. We use human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to show that genetic variation in the HOPX-regulome is significantly associated with complex traits affecting cardiac structure and function. Collectively, this study provides a mechanistic link situating HOPX between competing upstream pathways where HOPX acts as a molecular switch controlling gene regulatory programs underpinning metabolic, signaling, and functional maturation of cardiomyocytes.",
