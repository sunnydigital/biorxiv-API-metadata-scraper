    "abstract": "Pathogens found within local environments are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in Indonesia, where infectious diseases such as malaria or dengue are a significant part of the disease burden within the country. One way to strengthen the control of infectious diseases is through better surveillance, however unequal investment in medical funding throughout Indonesia, particularly in rural areas, has resulted in under-reporting of cases. Here, we use transcriptome data from 117 healthy individuals living on the islands of Mentawai, Sumba, and the Indonesian side of New Guinea Island to explore which pathogens are present within whole blood. We are able to detect a broad range of taxa within RNA-sequencing data generated from whole blood, including bacteria, viruses, archaea, and eukaryotes. Using independent component analysis, we find that two of these pathogens--Flaviviridae and Plasmodium--have the most noticeable effects on expression profiles. We also identify specific genes linked with Plasmodium and Flavivirus abundance and find that both of these infections are most pronounced in the easternmost island within our Indonesian dataset. This study provides a framework for novel applications of RNA-seq as surveillance and a better understanding of environmental contributors affecting gene expression within Indonesia.",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinsons disease and previously we showed that activated LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases (Steger et al., 2017). Moreover, Golgi-associated Rab29 can recruit LRRK2 to the surface of the Golgi and activate it there for both auto- and Rab substrate phosphorylation. Here we define the precise Rab29 binding region of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain between residues 360-450 and show that this domain, termed \"Site #1\", can also bind additional LRRK2 substrates, Rab8A and Rab10. Moreover, we identify a distinct, N-terminal, higher affinity interaction interface between LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8 and Rab10 termed \"Site #2\", that can retain LRRK2 on membranes in cells to catalyze multiple, subsequent phosphorylation events. Kinase inhibitor washout experiments demonstrate that rapid recovery of kinase activity in cells depends on the ability of LRRK2 to associate with phosphorylated Rab proteins, and phosphorylated Rab8A stimulates LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab10 in vitro. Reconstitution of purified LRRK2 recruitment onto planar lipid bilayers decorated with Rab10 protein demonstrates cooperative association of only active LRRK2 with phospho-Rab10-containing membrane surfaces. These experiments reveal a feed-forward pathway that provides spatial control and membrane activation of LRRK2 kinase activity.",

    "abstract": "Molecular aggregation induced photo-properties alteration has been found to play a crucial role in the light induced processes, such as aggregation induced emission (AIE) and J aggregation induced dramatic absorption red shift. The light induced acoustic process (photoacoustic) is also considered to be one of the most essential characters of the light absorbing molecules. However, to the best of our knowledge, the molecular aggregation induced photoacoustic effect (MAIPA) has never been reported. Herein, we report the first MAIPA effect for which the PA intensity is dominated by the molecular aggregation, rather than by absorbance as usual concerned. Molecular aggregation induces a strong electronic coupling effect, resulting in significant absorption suppression from the individual state to highly aggregated state (around 5 molecules aggregated). However, the corresponding PA efficiency was found to be about 2-orders of magnitude greater for the latter. A well-behaved linear correlation between the molecular aggregation level and MAIPA effect was observed. The surprisingly significant MAIPA effect was realized via novel NIR-II squaraine-benzothiopyrylium dyes. Excellent photophysical properties of the novel NIR-II dyes were achieved, such as large absorption extinction coefficient and high photostability. Thanks to the relatively narrow FWHM and the high PA efficiency of SQN2@PMAOPEG and ZC825@BSA, in vivo multiplex PA imaging was demonstrated for tumor tissue and macrophage cells, blood and lymphoid vessels.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) can be drivers of cancer and also trigger drug resistance in patients under chemotherapy treatment based on kinase inhibitors use. A priori knowledge of the impact of EGFR variants on drug sensitivity would help to optimize chemotherapy and to design new drugs effective against resistant variants. To this end, we have explored a variety of in silico methods, from sequence-based to  state-of-the-art atomistic simulations. We did not find any sequence signal that can provide clues on when a drug-related mutation appears and what will be the impact in drug activity. Low-level simulation methods provide limited qualitative information on regions where mutations are likely to produce alterations in drug activity and can predict around 70% of the impact of mutations on drug efficiency. High-level simulations based on non-equilibrium alchemical free energy calculations show predictive power. The integration of these  state-of-the-art methods in a workflow implementing an interface for parallel distribution of the calculations allows its automatic and high-throughput use, even for researchers with moderate experience in molecular simulations.",

How the receptors interact in the membrane to enable their signaling crosstalk is poorly understood. Here, we reveal the nanoscale organization of TLR2 and Dectin-1, a receptor pair known to cooperate in regulating antifungal immunity, through their synergistic signaling crosstalk at macrophage cell membranes. Using super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy, we show that discrete non-colocalized nanoclusters of Dectin-1 and TLR2 are partially overlapped during their synergistic crosstalk. Compared to when one type of receptor is activated alone, the simultaneous activation of Dectin-1 and TLR2 leads to a higher percentage of both receptors being activated by their specific ligands, and consequently an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results depict, in nanoscale detail, how Dectin-1 and TLR2 achieve synergistic signaling through the spatial organization of their receptor nanoclusters.",

Currently, a 4-week soil bioassay and a 2-day culture-based assay are used to diagnose presence of A. cochlioides. However, these assays can be time-consuming and lack sensitivity. In this study we developed a sensitive, specific, and rapid assay to detect and quantify DNA of A. cochlioides. We developed a TaqMan qPCR assay targeting a region of the mitochondrial genome of A. cochlioides representing a unique gene order for Aphanomyces with genus-specific primers and a species-specific probe. The qPCR assay detected A. cochlioides in 12 naturally infested field soil samples with disease severity index (DSI) values of 48-100, in sugar beet seedlings 5-7 days after planting, and with as little as 1 fg of pure A. cochlioides DNA. Adult sugar beet roots with ARR symptoms were sampled to further validate this qPCR assay. Aphanomyces cochlioides was detected in 95% of these samples using this qPCR assay, while only 23% of the same samples were positive using a culture-based assay. This shows the improved sensitivity of this qPCR assay for disease diagnosis and could provide growers with ARR risk of a field, which would help them make informed disease management decisions. However, further research is required to translate the results of this study to growers fields to quantify A. cochlioides with a high degree of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome is characterized by an early period of typical development and then, regression of learned motor and speech skills in girls. Loss of MECP2 protein is thought to cause Rett syndrome phenotypes. The specific underlying mechanisms from typical developmental trajectory to regression features throughout life are unclear. Lack of established timelines to study the molecular, cellular, and behavioral features of regression in female mouse models is a major contributing factor. Due to random X-chromosome inactivation, female patients with Rett syndrome and female mouse models for Rett syndrome (Mecp2Heterozygous, Het) express a functional copy of wild-type MECP2 protein in approximately half of all cells. As MECP2 expression is regulated during early postnatal development and experience, we characterized the expression of wild-type MECP2 in the primary somatosensory cortex of female Het mice. Here, we report increased MECP2 levels in non-parvalbumin-positive neurons of 6-week-old adolescent Het relative to age-matched wild-type controls, while also displaying similar levels of perineuronal net expression, mild tactile sensory perception deficits, and efficient pup retrieval behavior. In contrast, 12-week-old adult Het express MECP2 at levels similar to age-matched wild-type mice, show increased perineuronal net expression in the cortex, and display significant tactile sensory perception deficits. Thus, we have identified a set of behavioral metrics and the cellular substrates to study regression during a specific time in the female Het mouse model, which coincide with changes in wild-type MECP2 expression. We speculate that the precocious increase in MECP2 expression within specific cell types of adolescent Het may provide compensatory benefits at the behavioral level, while the inability to further increase MECP2 levels leads to regressive behavioral phenotypes over time.",

    "abstract": "Bats are important natural reservoir hosts of a diverse range of viruses that can be transmitted to humans and have been suggested that could play an important role in the Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission cycle. However, the exact role of these animals as reservoirs for Flaviviruses is still controversial. To further expand our understanding of the role of bats in the ZIKV transmission cycle in Latin America, we carried an experimental infection in wild-caught Artibeus bats and sampled several free-living neotropical bats over three countries of the region. Experimental ZIKV infection was made in free-ranging adult bats (4 females and 5 males). The most relevant gross findings were hemorrhages in the bladder, stomach and patagium. Significant histological findings included inflammatory infiltrate consisting of a predominance of neutrophils and lymphocytes, in addition to degeneration in the reproductive tract of males and females. This suggests that bat reproduction might be at some level affected by ZIKV. Leukopenia was also observed in some inoculated animals. Hemorrhages, genital alterations, and leukopenia are suggestive to be caused by ZIKV, however, since these are wild-caught bats, we can not exclude other agents. Excretion of ZIKV by qPCR was detected (low titles) in only two urine samples in two inoculated animals. All other animals and tissues tested negative. Finally, no virus-neutralizing Abs were found in any animal. To determine ZIKV infection in nature, a total of 2056 bats were blood sampled for ZIKV detection by qPCR. Most of the sampled individuals belonged to the genus Pteronotus sp. (23%), followed by the species Carollia sp. (17%); Anoura sp. (14%), and Molossus sp. (13.7 %). No sample of any tested species resulted positive to ZIKV by qPCR.\n\nThese results together suggest that bats are not efficient amplifiers or reservoirs of ZIKV and may not have an important role in ZIKV transmission dynamics.\n\nAuthor summaryIn previous works made in 2008-2009, we have found the presence of antibodies against Flaviviruses and viral RNA has been detected in Neotropical chiropterans of Mexico, which led us to support the hypothesis that these animals could be reservoirs of Flaviviruses. As controversial opinions have been exposed, and based on a previous (2019) experimental ZIKV infection made in Colorado State University using adult Artibeus males from a captive colony, in this work we also experimentally infected adult Artibeus males complementarily adding females and using free-living animals instead of laboratory bats. We also monitored a diverse range of natural bat populations in Latin America for the presence of viral RNA against ZIKV in blood. A plaque reduction seroneutralization test was used for the detection of antibodies against ZIKV. Similar to the previous work, we found histopathological alteration in male testicles but also in ovaries and oviducts of females, as well as gliosis and multifocal necrosis in pyramidal neurons and Purkinge cells of inoculated animals. Only two urine samples from inoculated animals showed viral RNA. Additionally, leukopenia and lymphoid follicular splenic hyperplasia were evidenced. Differing to what was reported, no neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV were detected in any sample. Viral RNA within the blood was not present in any of the 2056 bat samples collected in French Guyana, Peru and Costa Rica and proceeding from 33 bat genera. These results together suggest that bats are not efficient amplifiers or reservoirs of ZIKV and might not have an important role on ZIKV transmission dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Spliced leader trans splicing is the addition of a short, capped sequence to the 5 end of mRNAs. It is widespread in eukaryotic evolution, but factors that influence trans splicing acceptor site choice have been little investigated. In Kinetoplastids, all protein-coding mRNAs are 5 trans spliced. A polypyrimidine tract is usually found upstream of the AG splice acceptor, but there is no branch point consensus; moreover, splicing dictates polyadenylation of the preceding mRNA. We here describe a trans splicing reporter system that can be used for studies and screens concerning the roles of sequences and proteins in processing site choice and efficiency. Splicing was poor with poly(U) tracts less than 9 nt long, and was influenced by nearby secondary structures. A screen for signals resulted in selection of sequences that were on average 45% U and 35% C. Tethering of either the splicing factor SF1, or the cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPSF3 within the intron stimulated processing in the correct positions, while tethering of two possible homologues of Opisthokont PTB inhibited processing. In contrast, tethering of SR-domain proteins RBSR1, RBSR2, or TSR1 or its interaction partner TSR1IP, promoted use of alternative signals upstream of the tethering sites. RBSR1 interacts predominantly with proteins implicated in splicing, whereas the interactome of RBSR2 is more diverse. These results suggest that the functions of PTB and SR-domain proteins in splice site definition were already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "All tRNAs have numerous modifications, lack of which often results in growth defects in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and neurological or other disorders in humans. In S. cerevisiae, lack of tRNA body modifications can lead to impaired tRNA stability and decay of a subset of the hypomodified tRNAs. Mutants lacking 7-methylguanosine at G46 (m7G46), N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G26), or 4-acetylcytidine (ac4C12), in combination with other body modification mutants, target certain mature hypomodified tRNAs to the rapid tRNA decay (RTD) pathway, catalyzed by 5-3 exonucleases Xrn1 and Rat1, and regulated by Met22. The RTD pathway is conserved in the phylogenetically distant fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe for mutants lacking m7G46. In contrast, S. cerevisiae trm6 mutants with reduced 1-methyladenosine (m1A58) specifically target pre-tRNAiMet(CAU) to the nuclear surveillance pathway for 3-5 exonucleolytic decay by the TRAMP complex and nuclear exosome.\n\nWe show here that the RTD pathway has an unexpected major role in the biology of m1A58 and tRNAiMet(CAU) in both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. We find that S. pombe trm6{Delta} mutants lacking m1A58 are temperature sensitive due to decay of tRNAiMet(CAU) by the RTD pathway. Thus, trm6{Delta} mutants had reduced levels of tRNAiMet(CAU) and not of eight other tested tRNAs, overexpression of tRNAiMet(CAU) restored growth, and spontaneous suppressors that restored tRNAiMet(CAU) levels had mutations in dhp1/RAT1 or tol1/MET22. In addition, deletion of cid14/TRF4 in the nuclear surveillance pathway did not restore growth. Furthermore, re-examination of S. cerevisiae trm6 mutants revealed a major role of the RTD pathway in maintaining tRNAiMet(CAU) levels, in addition to the known role of the nuclear surveillance pathway. These findings provide evidence for the importance of m1A58 in the biology of tRNAiMet(CAU) throughout eukaryotes, and fuel speculation that the RTD pathway has a major role in quality control of body modification mutants throughout fungi and other eukaryotes.\n\nAuthor SummarytRNA modifications are highly conserved, and their lack frequently results in growth defects in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and neurological disorders in humans. In S. cerevisiae lack of 1-methyladenosine at N58 (m1A58) in the tRNA body is lethal due to 3-5 decay of pre-tRNAiMet by the nuclear surveillance pathway. By contrast, lack of any of three other body modifications causes growth defects due to 5-3 decay of specific hypomodified tRNAs by the rapid tRNA decay (RTD) pathway. Despite their importance, little is known about either tRNAiMet quality control or tRNA decay pathways in eukaryotes other than S. cerevisiae.\n\nHere we show an unexpected role of the RTD pathway in quality control of tRNAiMet lacking m1A58 in the phylogenetically distant yeast species Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae. We find that S. pombe trm6{Delta} mutants, lacking m1A58, are temperature sensitive due to decay of tRNAiMet(CAU) primarily by the RTD pathway. Furthermore, re-investigation of S. cerevisiae trm6 mutants revealed a significant role of the RTD pathway, in addition to the nuclear surveillance pathway, in decay of tRNAiMet(CAU). Our results suggest that throughout eukaryotes the RTD pathway has a major role in decay of hypomodified tRNAs and that m1A58 is crucial to tRNAiMet(CAU) biology.",

    "abstract": "ASARs are long noncoding RNA genes that control replication timing of entire human chromosomes in cis. The three known ASAR genes are located on human chromosomes 6 and 15, and are essential for chromosome integrity. To identify ASARs on all human chromosomes we utilized a set of distinctive ASAR characteristics that allowed for the identification of hundreds of autosomal loci with epigenetically controlled, allele-restricted behavior in expression and replication timing of coding and noncoding genes, and is distinct from genomic imprinting. Disruption of noncoding RNA genes at five of five tested loci resulted in chromosome-wide delayed replication and chromosomal instability, validating their ASAR activity. In addition to the three known essential cis-acting chromosomal loci, origins, centromeres, and telomeres, we propose that all mammalian chromosomes also contain \"Inactivation/Stability Centers\" that display allele-restricted epigenetic regulation of protein coding and noncoding ASAR genes that are essential for replication and stability of each chromosome.",

The identification of loci that underlie differences in these traits provides insights into the genetic contributions to development. Leveraging Caenorhabditis elegans as a tractable metazoan model for quantitative genetics, we can identify genomic regions that underlie differences in growth. We measured post-embryonic growth of the laboratory-adapted wild-type strain (N2) and a wild strain from Hawaii (CB4856), and found differences in body size. Using linkage mapping, we identified three distinct quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes IV, V, and X that are associated with variation in body size. We further examined these size-associated QTL using chromosome substitution strains and near-isogenic lines, and validated the chromosome X QTL. Additionally, we generated a list of candidate genes for the chromosome X QTL. These genes could potentially contribute to differences in animal growth and should be evaluated in subsequent studies. Our work reveals the genetic architecture underlying animal growth variation and highlights the genetic complexity of body size in C. elegans natural populations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic variation influences both chromatin accessibility, assessed in chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL) studies, and gene expression, assessed in expression QTL (eQTL) studies. Genetic variants can impact either nearby genes (local eQTLs) or distal genes (trans eQTLs). Colocalization between caQTL and eQTL, or local- and distant-eQTLs suggests that they share causal variants. However, pairwise colocalization between these molecular QTLs does not guarantee a causal relationship. Mediation analysis can be applied to assess the evidence supporting causality versus independence between molecular QTLs. Given that the function of QTLs can be cell-type-specific, we performed mediation analyses to find epigenetic and distal regulatory causal pathways for genes within two major cell types of the developing human cortex, progenitors and neurons.\n\nResultsWe found that expression of 168 and 38 genes were mediated by chromatin accessibility in progenitors and neurons, respectively. We also found that the expression of 781 and 200 downstream genes were mediated by upstream genes in progenitors and neurons. Moreover, we discovered that a genetic locus associated with inter-individual differences in brain structure showed evidence for mediation of SLC26A7 through chromatin accessibility, identifying molecular mechanisms of a common variant association to a brain trait.\n\nConclusionsIn this study, we identified cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks whereby the impacts of variants on gene expression were mediated by chromatin accessibility or distal gene expression. Identification of these causal paths will enable identifying and prioritizing actionable regulatory targets perturbing these key processes during neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics is a mainstream approach for investigating the metabolic underpinnings of complex biological phenomena and is increasingly being applied to large scale studies involving hundreds or thousands of samples. Although metabolomics methods are robust in smaller scale studies, they can be challenging to apply in larger cohorts due to the inherent variability of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Much of this difficulty results from the time-dependent changes in the LC-MS system, which affects both the qualitative and quantitative performance of the instrument. Herein, we introduce an analytical strategy for addressing this problem in large-scale microbial studies. Our approach quantifies microbial boundary fluxes using two zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) columns that are plumbed to enable offline column equilibration. Using this strategy, we show that over 360 common metabolites can be resolved in 4.5 minutes per sample and that metabolites can be quantified with a median coefficient of variation of 0.127 across 1,100 technical replicates. We illustrate the utility of this strategy via an analysis of 960 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from blood stream infections. These data capture the diversity of metabolic phenotypes observed in clinical isolates and provide an example of how large-scale investigations can leverage our novel analytical strategy.",

Using DNA origami-based reconstructions we show that clusters of human CLASP2 form a load-bearing bond with terminal GDP-tubulins at the stabilized microtubule tip. This activity relies on the unconventional TOG2 domain of CLASP2, which releases its high-affinity bond with the GDP-dimers upon their conversion into polymerization-competent GTP-tubulin. By tethering dynamic microtubule ends near immobilized CLASP2, we show that the targets for CLASP2 binding at the polymerizing tip arise stochastically, leading to nanoscale disruptions in microtubule tip integrity. The ability of CLASP2 to recognize nucleotide-specific tubulin conformation and stabilize the catastrophe-promoting GDP-tubulins intertwines with the previously underappreciated exchange between GDP and GTP at terminal tubulins, providing a distinct molecular mechanism to suppress microtubule catastrophe without affecting tubulin incorporation.",

    "abstract": "The membrane-embedded injectisome, the structural component of the virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS), is used by gram-negative bacterial pathogens to inject species-specific effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells. The cytosolic injectisome proteins are required for export of effectors and display both stationary, injectisome-bound populations as well as freely-diffusing cytosolic populations. How the cytosolic injectisome proteins interact with each other in the cytosol and associate with membrane-embedded injectisomes remains unclear. Here, we utilize 3D single-molecule tracking to resolve distinct cytosolic complexes of injectisome proteins in living Yersinia enterocolitica cells. Tracking of the eYFP-labeled ATPase, YeSctN, and its regulator, YeSctL, reveals that these proteins form a cytosolic complex with each other and then further with YeSctQ. YeSctNL and YeSctNLQ complexes can be observed both in wild type cells and in {Delta}sctD mutants, which cannot assemble injectisomes. In {Delta}sctQ mutants, the relative abundance of the YeSctNL complex is considerably increased. These data indicate that distinct cytosolic complexes of injectisome proteins can form prior to injectisome binding, which has important implications for how injectisomes are functionally regulated.\n\nImportanceInjectisomes are membrane-embedded, multiprotein assemblies used by bacterial pathogens to inject virulent effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells. Protein secretion is regulated by cytosolic proteins that dynamically bind and unbind at injectisomes. However, how these regulatory proteins interact with each other remains unknown. By measuring the diffusion rates of single molecules in living cells, we show that cytosolic injectisome proteins form distinct oligomeric complexes with each other prior to binding to injectisomes. We additionally identify the molecular compositions of these complexes and quantify their relative abundances. Quantifying to what extent cytosolic proteins exist as part of larger complexes in living cells has important implications for deciphering the complexity of biomolecular mechanisms. The results and methods reported here are thus relevant for advancing our understanding of how injectisomes, and related multiprotein assemblies, such as bacterial flagellar motors, are functionally regulated.",

    "abstract": "Xylella fastidiosa infects several economically important crops in the Americas, and it also recently emerged in Europe. Here, using a set of Xylella genomes reflective of the genus-wide diversity, we performed a pan-genome analysis based on both core and accessory genes, for two purposes: i) to test associations between genetic divergence and plant host species and ii) to identify positively selected genes that are potentially involved in arms-race dynamics. For the former, tests yielded significant evidence for specialization of X. fastidiosa to plant host species. This observation contributes to a growing literature suggesting that the phylogenetic history of X. fastidiosa lineages affects host range. For the latter, our analyses uncovered evidence of positive selection across codons for 5.3% (67 of 1,257) of core genes and 5.4% (201 of 3,691) of accessory genes; these genes are candidates to encode interacting factors with plant and insect hosts. Most of these genes had unknown functions, but we identified some tractable candidates including nagZ_2, which encodes a beta-glucosidase that is important for Neisseria gonorrhoeae biofilm formation; cya, which modulates gene expression in pathogenic bacteria; and barA, a membrane associated histidine kinase that has roles in cell division, metabolism, and pili formation.\n\nABSTRACT IMPORTANCEXylella fastidiosa causes devasting diseases to several critical crops. Because X. fastidiosa colonizes and infects many plant species, it is important to understand whether the genome of X. fastidiosa has genetic determinants that underlie specialization to specific host plants. We analyzed genome sequences of X. fastidiosa to investigate evolutionary relationships and to test for evidence of positive selection on specific genes. We found a significant signal between genome diversity and host plants, consistent with bacterial specialization to specific plant hosts. By screening for positive selection, we identified both core and accessory genes that may affect pathogenicity, including genes involved in biofilm formation.",

Within Cactaceae, spatial diversity patterns are poorly explored, as well as the abiotic factors that may predict these patterns. We gathered geographic and genetic data from 922 cactus species, which are tightly associated with drylands, to evaluate diversity patterns, such as phylogenetic diversity and endemism, paleo-, neo-, and superendemism, and the environmental predictor variables of such patterns in a global analysis. Hotspot areas of cacti diversity are scattered along the Neotropical and Nearctic regions, mainly in the desertic portion of Mesoamerica, Caribbean Island, and the dry diagonal of South America. The geomorphological features of these regions may create a complexity of areas that work as locally buffered zones over time, which triggers local events of diversification and speciation. Desert and dryland/dry forest areas comprise paleo- and superendemism and may act as both museums and cradles of species, displaying great importance for conservation. Past climates, topography, soil features, and solar irradiance seem to be the main predictors of distinct endemism types. The hotspot areas that encompass a major part of the endemism cells are outside or poorly covered by formal protection units. The current legally protected areas are not able to conserve cactus evolutionary history. Given the rapid anthropogenic disturbance, efforts must be reinforced to monitor biodiversity and the environment and to define/plan current and new protected areas.",

    "abstract": "We report a computational study of mitochondria transport in a branched axon with two branches of different sizes. For comparison, we also investigate mitochondria transport in an axon with symmetric branches and in a straight (unbranched) axon. The interest in understanding mitochondria transport in branched axons is motivated by the large size of arbors of dopaminergic neurons, which die in Parkinsons disease. Since the failure of energy supply of multiple demand sites located in various axonal branches may be a possible reason for the death of these neurons, we were interested in investigating how branching affects mitochondria transport. Besides investigating mitochondria fluxes between the demand sites and mitochondria concentrations, we also studied how the mean age of mitochondria and mitochondria age densities depend on the distance from the soma. We established that if the axon splits into two branches of unequal length, the mean ages of mitochondria and age density distributions in the demand sites are affected by how the mitochondria flux splits at the branching junction (what portion of mitochondria enter the shorter branch and what portion enter the longer branch). However, if the axon splits into two branches of equal length, the mean ages and age densities of mitochondria are independent of how the mitochondria flux splits at the branching junction. This even holds for the case when all mitochondria enter one branch, which is equivalent to a straight axon. Because the mitochondrial membrane potential (which many researchers view as a proxy for mitochondrial health) decreases with mitochondria age, the independence of mitochondria age on whether the axon is symmetrically branched or straight (providing the two axons are of the same length), and on how the mitochondria flux splits at the branching junction, may explain how dopaminergic neurons can sustain very large arbors and still maintain mitochondrial health across branch extremities.",

    "abstract": "Massive biological databases of species occurrences, or georeferenced locations where a species has been observed, are essential inputs for modeling present and future species distributions. Location accuracy is often assessed by determining whether the observation geocoordinates fall within the boundaries of the declared political divisions. This otherwise simple validation is complicated by the difficulty of matching political division names to the correct geospatial object. Spelling errors, abbreviations, alternative codes, and synonyms in multiple languages present daunting name disambiguation challenges. The inability to resolve political division names reduces usable data and analysis of erroneous observations can lead to flawed results.\n\nHere, we present the Geographic Name Resolution Service (GNRS), an application for the correction, standardization and indexing of world political division names. The GNRS resolves political division names against a reference database that combines names and codes from GeoNames with geospatial object identifiers from the Global Administrative Areas Database (GADM). In a trial resolution of political division names extracted from >270 million species occurrences, only 1.9%, representing just 6% of occurrences, matched exactly to GADM political divisions in their original form. The GNRS was able to resolve, completely or in part, 92% of the remaining 378,568 political division names, or 86% of the full biodiversity occurrence dataset. In an assessment of geocoordinate accuracy for >239 million species occurrences, resolution of political divisions by the GNRS enabled detection of an order of magnitude more errors and an order of magnitude more error-free occurrences. By providing a novel solution to a major data quality impediment, the GNRS liberates a tremendous amount of biodiversity data for quantitative biodiversity research. The GNRS runs as a web service and can be accessed via an API, an R package, and a web-based graphical user interface. Its modular architecture is easily integrated into existing data validation workflows.",

    "abstract": "Great-tailed Grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) are a social, polygamous bird species whose populations have rapidly expanded their geographic range across North America over the past century. Before 1865, Great-tailed Grackles were only documented in Central America, Mexico, and southern Texas in the USA. Given the rapid northern expansion of this species, it is relevant to study its role in the dynamics of avian blood parasites. Here, 87 Great-tailed grackles in Arizona (a population in the new center of the range) were screened for haemosporidian parasites using microscopy and PCR targeting the parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Individuals were caught in the wild from January 2018 until February 2020. Haemosporidian parasite prevalence was 60.9% (53/87). A high Plasmodium prevalence was found (59.8%, 52/87), and one grackle was infected with Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) sp. (lineage SIAMEX01). Twenty-one grackles were infected with P. cathemerium, sixteen with P. homopolare, four with P. relictum (strain GRW04), and eleven with three different genetic lineages of Plasmodium spp. that have not been characterized to species level (MOLATE01, PHPAT01, and ZEMAC01). Gametocytes were observed in birds infected with three different Plasmodium lineages, revealing that grackles are competent hosts for some parasite species. This study also suggests that grackles are highly susceptible and develop chronic infections consistent with parasite tolerance, making them competent to transmit some generalist haemosporidian lineages. It can be hypothesized that, as the Great-tailed Grackle expands its geographic range, it may affect local bird communities by increasing the transmission of local parasites but not introducing new species into the parasite species pool.",

    "abstract": "As small and stable high-affinity antigen binders, VHHs boast attractive characteristics both for therapeutic use in various disease indications, and as versatile reagents in research and diagnostics. To further increase the versatility of VHHs, we explored the VHH scaffold in a structure-guided approach to select regions where the introduction of an N-glycosylation N-X-T sequon and its associated glycan should not interfere with protein folding or epitope recognition. We expressed variants of such glycoengineered VHHs in the Pichia pastoris GlycoSwitchM5 strain, allowing us to pinpoint preferred sites at which Man5GlcNAc2-glycans can be introduced at high site occupancy without affecting antigen binding. A VHH carrying predominantly a Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycan at one of these preferred sites showed highly efficient, glycan-dependent uptake by Mf4/4 macrophages in vitro and by alveolar lung macrophages in vivo, illustrating one potential application of glyco-engineered VHHs: a glycan-based targeting approach for lung macrophage endolysosomal system delivery. The set of optimal artificial VHH N-glycosylation sites identified in this study can serve as a blueprint for targeted glyco-engineering of other VHHs, enabling site-specific functionalization through the rapidly expanding toolbox of synthetic glycobiology.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) induced competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) play crucial roles in various biological process by regulating target gene expression. However, the studies of ceRNA networks in the regulation of ovarian ovulation process of chicken remains deficient compared to that in mammals. In the present study, it was revealed that circEML1 was differential expressed in hens ovarian tissue at different ages (15W, 20W, 30W and 68W) and identified as a loop structure from EML1 pre-mRNA, which promoted the expressions of CYP19A1 and StAR and the production of E2 and P4 in follicular granulosa cells (GCs) using qRT-PCR and ELISA. Furthermore, circEML1 was proved to serve as a sponge of gga-miR-449a to participate in the steroidogenesis using the dual luciferase reporter, RNA FISH assays, qRT-PCR and ELISA assays. In addition, we evaluated several potential target genes of gga-miR-449a and found that IGF2BP3 was targeted by gga-miR-449a and promoted steroidogenesis and E2/P4 secretions in GCs, which may act the regulatory role via mTOR/p38MAPK pathways. Meanwhile, we implemented a rescue experiment and demonstrated that gga-miR-449a reversed the promoting role of circEML1 on IGF2BP3 expression and steroidogenesis. Eventually, this study suggested that circEML1/gga-miR-449a/IGF2BP3 axis exerted an important role in the regulation of steroidogenesis and steroid hormones production possibly through mTOR/p38MAPK pathways in follicular GCs of chicken and may contribute a better understanding of ceRNA network in the modulatory mechanism of hens ovarian development and ovulation cycle.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how populations adapt to local environments is increasingly important to prevent biodiversity loss due to climate change. Here we examined whole-genome variation of twelve Atlantic horse mackerel samples from the North Sea to North Africa, and the western Mediterranean Sea. This marine migratory benthopelagic fish is one of the most widely distributed and commercially important species in the eastern Atlantic. We found low population structure at neutral loci, but high differentiation at adaptive loci distinguishing the western Mediterranean and the North Sea populations from other Atlantic locations. Candidate genes distinctive of the Mediterranean include a green-sensitive-opsin harbouring two missense mutations that might fine-tune the spectral sensitivity to blue-green light conditions. Candidate genes characteristic of the North Sea could play a critical role in cold tolerance (energy metabolism and cell membrane structure) and increased sensitivity to odours, presumably to compensate reduced visibility in turbid waters. We also discovered a putative chromosomal inversion (9.9 Mb) that follows a climate-related latitudinal cline with a break near mid Portugal. Genome-environment association analysis indicated that seawater-dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature are likely the main environmental drivers of local adaptation. Our genomic data broadly supports the current stock divisions, but recommends revision of the western and southern stock boundaries. We developed a reduced SNP panel that genetically discriminate the North Sea and North Africa from neighbouring populations. Our study highlights the importance of life history and chromosomal inversions in adaptation with gene flow, and the complexity of evolutionary and ecological processes involved in local adaptation.",
