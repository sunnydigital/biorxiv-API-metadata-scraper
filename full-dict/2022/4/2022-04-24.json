    "abstract": "Aberrant methylation is a hallmark of cancer, but bulk tumor data is confounded by admixed normal cells and copy number changes. Here, we introduce Copy number-Aware Methylation Deconvolution Analysis of Cancers (CAMDAC; https://github.com/VanLoo-lab/CAMDAC), which outputs tumor purity, allele-specific copy number and deconvolved methylation estimates. We apply CAMDAC to 122 multi-region samples from 38 TRACERx non-small cell lung cancers profiled by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. CAMDAC copy number profiles parallel those derived from genome sequencing and highlight widespread chromosomal instability. Deconvolved polymorphism-independent methylation rates enable unbiased tumor-normal and tumor-tumor differential methylation calling. Read-phasing validates CAMDAC methylation rates and directly links genotype and epitype. We show increased epigenetic instability in adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma, frequent hypermethylation at sites carrying somatic mutations, and parallel copy number losses and methylation changes at imprinted loci. Unlike bulk methylomes, CAMDAC profiles recapitulate tumor phylogenies and evidence distinct patterns of epigenetic heterogeneity in lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Movement and posture depend on sensory feedback that is regulated by specialized GABAergic neurons (GAD2+) that form axo-axonic contacts onto myelinated proprioceptive sensory axons and are thought to be inhibitory. However, we report here that activating GAD2+ neurons, directly with optogenetics or indirectly by cutaneous stimulation, facilitates sensory feedback to motoneurons in awake rodents and humans. GABAA receptors and GAD2+ innervation at or near nodes of Ranvier of sensory axons cause this facilitation, preventing spike propagation failure at the many axon branch points, which is otherwise common without GABA. In contrast, GABAA receptors are generally lacking from axon terminals (unlike GABAB) and do not presynaptically inhibit transmitter release onto motoneurons. GABAergic innervation near nodes and branch points allows individual branches to function autonomously, with GAD2+ neurons regulating which branches conduct, adding a computational layer to the neuronal networks generating movement and likely generalizing to other CNS axons.",

    "abstract": "O_LIEcologists have long recognized that the losses and gains in local species abundances can either decrease or increase spatial beta diversity, phenomena often referred to as biotic homogenization and differentiation, respectively. However, quantifying such dynamic impacts of species abundances on beta diversity has remained a methodological challenge.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we develop a numerical method to additively partition the temporal changes in beta diversity into distinct components that reflect the losses and gains in local species abundances. Our method is based on Ru[z]i[c]ka and Bray-Curtis indices and the normalized abundance-based Whittakers beta diversity. The temporal changes in these measures are partitioned into components that represent biotic homogenization and differentiation driven by abundance losses and gains at both species and community levels.\nC_LIO_LIApplication of the method to a Swedish fish community dataset revealed decreases in beta diversity between 1990 and 2018. The homogenization of fish communities was explained by gains, but not losses, in species abundances across sites. Species-level partitioning further showed that the homogenization was largely caused by the increased population sizes of a particular species in sites where it was already present.\nC_LIO_LIThe results highlight that our partitioning method effectively identifies local population and community processes embedded in regional biodiversity patterns. We believe that explicit analyses of the losses and gains in species abundances should bring deeper insights into the dynamics of beta diversity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Working memory provides flexible storage of information in service of upcoming behavioral goals. Some models propose specific fixed loci and mechanisms for the storage of visual information in working memory, such as sustained spiking in parietal and prefrontal cortex during working memory maintenance. An alternative view is that information can be remembered in a flexible format that best suits current behavioral goals. For example, remembered visual information might be stored in sensory areas for easier comparison to future sensory inputs, or might be re-coded into a more abstract action-oriented format and stored in motor areas. Here, we tested this hypothesis using a visuo-spatial working memory task where the required behavioral response was either known or unknown during the memory delay period. Using fMRI and multivariate decoding, we found that there was less information about remembered spatial position in early visual and parietal regions when the required response was known versus unknown. Further, a representation of the planned motor action emerged in primary somatosensory, primary motor, and premotor cortex during the same task condition where spatial information was reduced in early visual cortex. These results suggest that the neural networks supporting working memory can be strategically reconfigured depending on specific behavioral requirements during a canonical visual working memory paradigm.",

This study aims to evaluate the impact of tacrolimus on a lineage of proximal tubular cells using a multi-omics approach.\n\nMethodsLLC-PK1 cells were exposed to 5 M of tacrolimus for 24h. Intracellular proteins and metabolites, and extracellular metabolites were extracted and analysed by LC-MS/MS. The transcriptional expression of the dysregulated proteins PCK-1, FBP1 and FBP2 was measured using RT-qPCR.\n\nResultsIn our cell model, tacrolimus impacted different metabolic pathways including those of arginine (e.g., citrulline, ornithine) (p < 0.0001), amino acids (e.g., valine, isoleucine, aspartic acid) (p < 0.0001) and pyrimidine (p<0.01). In addition, it induced oxidative stress (p < 0.01) as shown by a decrease in total cell glutathione quantity. It impacted cell energy through an increase in Krebs cycle intermediates (e.g., citrate, aconitate, fumarate) (p < 0.01) and down-regulation of PCK-1 (p < 0.05) and FPB1 (p < 0.01), which are key enzymes in gluconeogenesis. Apart from glucose synthesis, gluconeogenesis is an important process in kidney mediated acid-base balance control.\n\nConclusionThe variations found using this multi-omics approach clearly point towards a dysregulation of energy production in epithelial cells of the renal tubule, and potentially of their functions, that may be implicated in tacrolimus nephrotoxicity in the clinics.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the design principles of regulatory networks driving cellular decision-making has important implications in understanding cell differentiation and guiding the design of synthetic circuits. Mutually repressing feedback loops between  master regulators of cell-fates can exhibit multistable dynamics, thus enabling multiple \"single-positive\" phenotypes: (high A, low B) and (low A, high B) for a toggle switch, and (high A, low B, low C), (low A, high B, low C) and (low A, low B, high C) for a toggle triad. However, the dynamics of these two network motifs has been interrogated in isolation in silico, but in vitro and in vivo, they often operate while embedded in larger regulatory networks. Here, we embed these network motifs in complex larger networks of varying sizes and connectivity and identify conditions under which these motifs maintain their canonical dynamical behavior, thus identifying hallmarks of their functional resilience. We show that an increased number of incoming edges onto a motif leads to a decay in their canonical stand-alone behaviors, as measured by multiple metrics based on pairwise correlation among nodes, bimodality of individual nodes, and the fraction of \"single-positive\" states. We also show that this decay can be exacerbated by adding self-inhibition, but not self-activation, loops on the  master regulators. These observations offer insights into the design principles of biological networks containing these motifs, and can help devise optimal strategies for integration of these motifs into larger synthetic networks.",

In this paper, we revealed a novel related movement gene module, called Tetra-Cistron Movement Block (TCMB). It was found to be encoded by virus-like transcriptome assemblies of moss Dicranum scoparium and Antarctic flowering plant Colobanthus quitensis. These TCMBs are encoded by second RNA components of the putative two-component viruses related to plant benyviruses. Like RNA-2 of benyviruses, TCMB RNA-2 contains the 5-terminal coat protein gene. General organization of TCMB is very similar to TGB: it includes RNA helicase gene which is followed by two small overlapping cistrons encoding hydrophobic proteins with a distant sequence similarity to TGB2 and TGB3 genes. However, TCMB includes also forth 5-terminal gene coding for protein with an obvious similarity to double-stranded RNA-binding proteins belonging to the DSRM AtDRB-like superfamily. Finally, we suggest the proposed involvement of replicative beny-like helicases in evolution of the BMB and TCMB movement genetic modules.",

    "abstract": "Profiling gametes of an individual enables the construction of personalised haplotypes and meiotic crossover landscapes, now achievable at larger scale than ever through the availability of high-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies. However, high-throughput single-gamete data commonly have low depth of coverage per gamete, which challenges existing gametebased haplotype phasing methods. In addition, haplotyping a large number of single gametes from high-throughput singlecell DNA sequencing data and constructing meiotic crossover profiles using existing methods requires intensive processing. Here, we introduce efficient software tools for the essential tasks of generating personalised haplotypes and calling crossovers in gametes from single-gamete DNA sequencing data (sgcocaller), and constructing, visualising, and comparing individualised crossover landscapes from single gametes (comapr). With additional data pre-possessing, the tools can also be applied to bulk-sequenced samples. We demonstrate that sgcocaller is able to generate impeccable phasing results for high-coverage datasets, on which it is more accurate and stable than existing methods, and also performs well on low-coverage single-gamete sequencing datasets for which current methods fail. Our tools achieve highly accurate results with user-friendly installation, comprehensive documentation, efficient computation times and minimal memory usage.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has had a tremendous impact on cancer treatment in the past decade, with hitherto unseen responses at advanced and metastatic stages of the disease. However, the aggressive brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) is highly immunosuppressive and remains largely refractory to current immunotherapeutic approaches. The cGAS-STING cytoplasmic double stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensing pathway has emerged as a next-generation immunotherapy target with potent local immune stimulatory properties.\n\nHere, we investigated the status of the STING pathway in GBM and the modulation of the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) with the STING agonist ADU-S100. Our data reveal the presence of STING in human GBM specimens, where it stains strongly in the tumor vasculature. We show that human GBM explants can respond to STING agonist treatment by secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In murine GBM models, we show a profound shift in the tumor immune landscape after STING agonist treatment, with massive infiltration of the tumor-bearing hemisphere with innate immune cells including inflammatory macrophages, neutrophils and NK populations. Treatment of established murine intracranial GL261 and CT-2A tumors by biodegradable ADU-S100-loaded intracranial implants demonstrated a significant increase in survival in both models and long-term survival with immune memory in GL261. Responses to treatment were abolished by NK cell depletion. This study reveals therapeutic potential and deep remodeling of the TME by STING activation in GBM and warrants the further examination of STING agonists alone or in combination with other immunotherapies such as cancer vaccines, CAR T cells, NK therapies or immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nSignificance statementModulation of the immune microenvironment is critical for immunosuppressive and therapy refractory tumors like glioblastoma. Activation of the STING pathway deeply remodels the brain tumor environment and attracts innate immune cells and natural killer cell populations, producing a robust antitumor effect with long-term immune memory. We further show that human glioblastoma tissue can respond to the therapy and lay the foundations for combined intracranial immunotherapies by using crosslinked biodegradable brain implants.",

    "abstract": "Mentalising ability, indexed as the ability to understand others beliefs, feelings, intentions, thoughts and traits, is a pivotal and fundamental component of human social cognition. However, considering the multifaceted nature of mentalising ability, little research has focused on characterising individual differences in different mentalising components. And even less research has been devoted to investigating how the variance in the structural and functional patterns of the amygdala and hippocampus, two vital subcortical regions of the  social brain, are related to inter-individual variability in mentalising ability. Here, as a first step toward filling these gaps, we exploited inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) to assess relationships between amygdala and hippocampal morphometry (surface-based multivariate morphometry statistics, MMS), connectivity (resting-state functional connectivity, rs-FC) and mentalising ability (interactive mentalisation questionnaire (IMQ) scores) across the participants (N = 24). In IS-RSA, we proposed a novel pipeline, i.e., computing patching and pooling operations-based surface distance (CPP-SD), to obtain a decent representation for high-dimensional MMS data. On this basis, we found significant correlations (i.e., secondorder isomorphisms) between these three distinct modalities, indicating that a trinity existed in idiosyncratic patterns of brain morphometry, connectivity and mentalising ability. Notably, a region-related mentalising specificity emerged from these associations: self-self and self-other mentalisation are more related to the hippocampus, while other-self mentalisation shows a closer link with the amygdala. Furthermore, by utilising the dyadic regression analysis, we observed significant interactions such that subject pairs with similar morphometry had even greater mentalising similarity if they were also similar in rs-FC. Altogether, we demonstrated the feasibility and illustrated the promise of using IS-RSA to study individual differences, deepening our understanding of how individual brains give rise to their mentalising abilities.",

    "abstract": "The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a major therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Following activation, GLP-1Rs are rapidly desensitised by {beta}-arrestins, scaffolding proteins that terminate G protein interactions but also act as independent signalling mediators. While GLP-1R interacts with {beta}-arrestins 1 and 2, expression of the latter is greatly enhanced in beta cells, making this the most relevant isoform. Here, we have assessed in vivo glycaemic responses to the pharmacological GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 in adult beta cell-selective {beta}-arrestin 2 knockout (KO) mice. Lean female and high-fat, high-sucrose-fed KO mice of both sexes displayed worse acute responses versus control littermates, an effect that was inverted 6 hours post-agonist injection, resulting in prolonged in vivo cell-cell connectivity in KO islets implanted in mouse eyes. Similar effects were observed for the clinically relevant semaglutide and tirzepatide but not with exendin-phe1, an agonist biased away from {beta}-arrestin recruitment. Ex vivo acute cAMP was impaired, but overnight desensitisation was reduced in KO islets. The acute signalling defect was attributed to enhanced {beta}-arrestin 1 and phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 activity in the absence of {beta}-arrestin 2, while the reduced desensitisation correlated with altered GLP-1R trafficking, involving impaired recycling and lysosomal targeting and increased trans-Golgi network (TGN) localisation and signalling, as well as reduced GLP-1R ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4. This study has unveiled fundamental aspects of the role of {beta}-arrestin 2 in regulating pharmacological GLP-1R responses with direct application to the rational design of improved GLP-1R-targeting therapeutics.",

Quantitative proteomic analysis of Ishikawa cells transfected with mimic or inhibitor (48 hrs: n=3 biological replicates) for each of the P4-regulated miRNAs was carried out to identify targets of these miRNAs. Excluding off target effects, mir-340-5p mimic altered 1,369 proteins while inhibition changed expression of 376 proteins (p < 0.05) of which, 72 were common to both treatments. A total of 280 proteins were identified between predicted (mirDB) and confirmed (in vitro) targets. In total, 171 proteins predicted to be targets by mirDB were altered in vitro by treatment with miR-340-5p mimic or inhibitor and were also altered by treatment of endometrial epithelial cells with P4. In vitro targets of miR-542-3p identified 1,378 proteins altered by mimic while inhibition altered 975 a core of 200 proteins were changed by both. 100 protein targets were predicted and only 46 proteins were P4 regulated. miR-671-mimic altered 1,252 proteins with inhibition changing 492 proteins of which 97 were common to both, 95 were miDB predicted targets and 46 were also P4-regulated. All miRNAs were detected in endometrial biopsies taken from patients during the luteal phase of their cycle, irrespective of prior or future pregnancy outcomes Expression of mir-340-5p showed an overall increase in patients who had previously suffered a miscarriage and had a subsequent miscarriage, as compared to those who had infertility or previous miscarriage and subsequently went on to have a life birth outcome. The regulation of these miRNAs and their protein targets regulate the function of transport and secretion, and adhesion of the endometrial epithelia required for successful implantation in humans. Dysfunction of these miRNAs (and therefore the targets they regulate) may contribute to endometrial-derived recurrent pregnancy loss in women.",

    "abstract": "Caveolin-1 (CAV1) and CAV3 are membrane sculpting proteins driving formation of plasma membrane caveolae. Caveola formation is unique as it requires oligomerisation of newly synthesised caveolins through the biosynthetic-secretory pathway. Here, we combine structural, biochemical, and microscopy analyses to examine the early proteostasis of caveolin family members and mutants. We describe striking trafficking differences between newly synthesised caveolins, with CAV1 rapidly exported to the Golgi but CAV3 showing ER retention and targeting to lipid droplets. Only monomeric/low oligomeric caveolins are efficiently exported from the ER, with oligomers assembling beyond the cis-Golgi and disease-causing mutations leading to detrimental non-functional complexes. Caveolins in the ER are maintained at low levels by active proteasomal degradation, avoiding premature oligomerisation and ER stress. Increasing lipid availability, cholesterol for CAV1 and fatty acids for CAV3, enhances trafficking and reduces proteasomal degradation. In conclusion, we identify proteostatic mechanisms that modulate stability and trafficking of newly synthesised caveolins, protecting cells against ER stress but perturbed in caveolin-related disease.\n\nSummaryUnderstanding the unique proteostasis of caveolins has important implications for cell biology and physiopathology. Combining structural, microscopy, and biochemical analyses, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that differentiate the early biosynthetic steps of caveolin family members, isoforms, and pathogenic mutants.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are rapidly mobilized from the circulation to sites of inflammation. The mechanisms of neutrophil trafficking in the lung are distinct from those in the periphery, in part because the pulmonary capillaries are the primary site of neutrophil emigration rather than postcapillary venules. Since the diameter of a neutrophil is greater than the width of most pulmonary capillary segments, they must deform to transit through this capillary network, even at homeostasis. Resistance to deformation is primarily due to cortical actin that is rapidly assembled when a neutrophil is exposed to a priming or activation stimulus, resulting in neutrophil stiffening and subsequent sequestration within the pulmonary capillary network. In the current study, we use a microfluidic assay to characterize neutrophil transit through model capillary-like channels. Using techniques from single-particle tracking, we analyzed the cumulative distribution of neutrophil transit times and resolve population-based effects. We found that vinculin, an actin-binding adaptor protein, plays an essential role in neutrophil stiffening in response to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Vinculin-deficient neutrophils lack the development of a population with slow transit through narrow channels that was observed in both wild-type murine bone marrow neutrophils and HoxB8-conditional progenitor-derived neutrophils. Atomic force microscopy studies provide further evidence that vinculin is required for neutrophil stiffening. Consistent with these findings, we observed that neutrophil sequestration in the lungs of mice is attenuated in the absence of vinculin. Together, our studies indicate that vinculin mediates actin-dependent neutrophil stiffening that leads to their sequestration in capillaries.",

We describe a new family of diffeomorphic mapping technologies called Projective LDDMM which generate diffeomorphic mappings of dense human MRI atlases at tissue scales onto sparse measurements at micron scales associated with histological and more general optical imaging modalities. We solve the problem of dense mapping surjectively onto histological sections by incorporating new technologies for crossing modalities that use non-linear scattering transforms to represent multiple radiomic-like textures at micron scales and incorporating a Gaussian mixture-model frame-work for modelling tears and distortions associated to each section.

We used cryo-FIB-milling and cryo-electron tomography to visualize the 3D-structure of the apical complex in its protruded and retracted states. Averages of conoid-fibers revealed their polarity and unusual nine-protofilament arrangement with associated proteins connecting and likely stabilizing the fibers. Neither the structure of the conoidfibers nor the architecture of the spiral-shaped conoid complex change during protrusion or retraction. Thus, the conoid moves as a rigid body, and is not spring-like and compressible, as previously suggested. Instead, the apical-polar-rings (APR), previously considered rigid, dilate during conoid protrusion. We identified actin-like filaments connecting the conoid and APR during protrusion, suggesting a role during conoid movements. Furthermore, our data capture the parasites in the act of secretion during conoid protrusion.",

    "abstract": "Many tyrosine kinases cannot be expressed readily in E. coli, limiting facile production of these proteins for biochemical experiments. We used ancestral sequence reconstruction to generate a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) variant that can be expressed in bacteria and purified in soluble form, unlike the human members of this family (Syk and ZAP-70). The catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and regulation by phosphorylation of this Syk variant are similar to the corresponding properties of human Syk and ZAP-70. Taking advantage of the ability to express this novel Syk-family kinase in bacteria, we developed a two-hybrid assay that couples the growth of E.coli in the presence of an antibiotic to successful phosphorylation of a bait peptide by the kinase. Using this assay, we screened a site-saturation mutagenesis library of the kinase domain of this reconstructed Syk-family kinase. Sites of loss-of-function mutations identified in the screen correlate well with residues established previously as critical to function and/or structure in protein kinases. We also identified activating mutations in the regulatory hydrophobic spine and activation loop, which are within key motifs involved in kinase regulation. Strikingly, one mutation in an ancestral Syk-family variant increases the soluble expression of the protein by 75-fold. Thus, through ancestral sequence reconstruction followed by deep mutational scanning, we have generated Syk-family kinase variants that can be expressed in bacteria with very high yield.",

    "abstract": "The lifespans of proteins can range from minutes to years within mammalian tissues. Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes. These data indicate that cell turnover, sequence-encoded features, and other environmental factors modulate protein lifespan in vivo. In the future, TRAIL can be used to explore how environment, aging, and disease affect tissue homeostasis.",

ADPKD shares parallels with cancer where immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to reactivate CD8+ T cells and slow tumor growth. We have shown that, in PKD, CD8+ T cell loss worsens disease. This study used orthologous early-onset and adult-onset ADPKD models (Pkd1 p.R3277C) to evaluate the role of immune checkpoints in PKD. Flow cytometry of kidney cells showed increased levels of PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 on macrophages and epithelial cells in Pkd1RC/RC mice versus wildtypes, paralleling disease severity. PD-L1 was also upregulated in ADPKD human cells and patient kidney tissue versus controls. Genetic PD-L1 loss or treatment with an anti-PD-1 antibody did not impact PKD severity in early-onset or adult-onset ADPKD models. However, treatment with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4, blocking two immune checkpoints, improved PKD outcomes in adult-onset ADPKD mice; neither monotherapy altered PKD. Combination therapy resulted in increased kidney CD8+ T cell numbers/activation and decreased kidney regulatory T cell numbers.

This insertion, which helps maintain and determine the shape of the cell, is guided by a complex protein machinery called the rod complex or elongasome. Although most of the proteins in this complex are essential under normal growth conditions, cell viability can be rescued, for reasons that are not understood, by the presence of a high (mM) Mg2+ concentration. We screened for natural product compounds that could rescue the growth of mutants affected in rod-complex function. By screening >2,000 extracts from a diverse collection of actinobacteria, we identified a new compound, mirubactin B, related to the known iron siderophore mirubactin A, which rescued growth in the low micromolar range, and this activity was confirmed by synthesising mirubactin B. The compound also displayed toxicity at higher concentrations, and this effect appears related to iron homeostasis. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the mirubactin B rescuing activity is not due simply to iron sequestration. The results demonstrate a novel antibacterial compound and add to growing evidence that bacterial siderophores have a range of activities beyond simple iron sequestration.",

    "abstract": "The Notch pathway converts receptor-ligand interactions at the cell surface into a transcriptional response in the receiver cell. In recent years, synthetic Notch systems (SynNotch) that respond to different inputs and transduce different transcriptional responses have been engineered. One class of synNotch systems uses antibody-antigen interactions at the cell surface to induce the proteolytic cleavage cascade of the endogenous Notch autoregulatory core and the consequent release of a synNotch intracellular domain (ICD), converting surface antigen detection into a cellular response. However, whereas the activation of endogenous Notch requires ubiquitylation and subsequent endocytosis of the ligand ICD, these synNotch systems do not seem to have such a requirement because the synNotch ligands completely lack an ICD. This observation raises questions about existing models for the Notch activation mechanism. Here, we test how different structural and biochemical factors affect the dependence of endogenous and synthetic Notch activation on ligand ICD. We compare the behavior of antibody-antigen synNotch (aa-synNotch) to that of endogenous Notch, and to a synNotch system that uses induced FKBP-FRB dimerization with rapamycin (ff-synNotch), which still requires a ligand ICD. We found that differences in receptor-ligand affinity, in the identity of the transmembrane domain, or in the presence or absence of extracellular EGF repeats cannot explain the differences in ligand ICD requirement that distinguishes aa-synNotch from endogenous Notch or ff-synNotch. These findings suggest that the aa-SynNotch systems bypass the ligand ICD requirement because antigen-antibody pairs are able to promote other adhesive cell-cell interactions that provide the mechanical tension needed for ligand activation.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal sampling of the stool has yielded important insights into the ecological dynamics of the human gut microbiome. However, due to practical limitations, the most densely sampled time series from the human gut are collected at a frequency of about once per day, while the population doubling times for gut commensals are on the order of minutes-to-hours. Despite this, much of the prior work on human gut microbiome time series modeling has, implicitly or explicitly, assumed that day-to-day fluctuations in taxon abundances are related to population growth or death rates, which is likely not the case. Here, we propose an alternative model of the human gut as a flow-through ecosystem at a dynamical steady state, where population dynamics occur internally and the bacterial population sizes measured in a bolus of stool represent an endpoint of these internal dynamics. We formalize this idea as stochastic logistic growth of a population in a system held at a semi-constant flow rate. We show how this model provides a path toward estimating the growth phases of gut bacterial populations in situ. We validate our model predictions using an in vitro Escherichia coli growth experiment. Finally, we show how this method can be applied to densely-sampled human stool metagenomic time series data. Consistent with our model, stool donors with slower defecation rates tended to harbor a larger proportion of taxa in later growth phases, while faster defecation rates were associated with more taxa in earlier growth phases. We discuss how these growth phase estimates may be used to better inform metabolic modeling in flow-through ecosystems, like animal guts or industrial bioreactors.",

To gain a greater understanding of the evolution and functions of the GNL3 gene, we have performed studies in the hydrozoan cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, a colonial hydroid that continuously generates pluripotent stem cells throughout its life cycle and presents impressive regenerative abilities. We show that Hydractinia GNL3 is expressed in stem and germline cells. The knockdown of GNL3 reduces the number of mitotic and S-phase cells in Hydractinia larvae of different ages. Genome editing of Hydractinia GNL3 via CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in colonies with reduced growth rates, polyps with impaired regeneration capabilities, gonadal morphological defects, and low sperm motility. Collectively, our study shows that GNL3 is an evolutionarily-conserved stem cell and germline marker involved in cell proliferation, animal growth, regeneration, and sexual reproduction in Hydractinia, and sheds new light into the evolution of GNL3 and of stem cell systems.",

    "abstract": "p38 kinases are key elements of the cellular stress response in animals. They mediate the cell response to a multitude of stress stimuli, from osmotic shock to inflammation and oncogenes. However, it is unknown how such diversity of function in stress evolved in this kinase subfamily. Here, we show that the p38 kinase was already present in a common ancestor of animals and fungi. Later, in animals, it diversified into three JNK kinases and four p38 kinases. Moreover, we identified a fifth p38 paralog in fishes and amphibians. Our analysis shows that each p38 paralog has specific amino acid substitutions around the hinge point, a region between the N-terminal and C-terminal protein domains. We showed that this region can be used to distinguish between individual paralogs and predict their specific. Finally, we showed that the response to hyperosmotic stress in Capsaspora owczarzaki, a close unicellular relative of animals, follows a typical for the p38 kinases pattern of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. At the same time, Capsasporas cells upregulate the expression of GPD1 protein resembling an osmotic stress response in yeasts. Overall, our results show that the ancestral p38 stress pathway originated in the root of opisthokonts, most likely as a cells reaction to salinity change in the environment. In animals, the pathway became more complex and incorporated more stimuli and downstream targets due to the p38 sequence evolution in the docking and substrate binding sites around the hinge region. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the p38 evolution and opens new perspectives for the p38 research.",

    "abstract": "The principal component of the protein homeostasis network is the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination is mediated by an enzymatic cascade involving, i.e., E3 ubiquitin ligases, many of which belong to the cullin-RING ligases family. Genetic defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system components, including cullin-RING ligases, are known causes of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using exome sequencing to diagnose a pediatric patient with developmental delay, pyramidal signs, and limb ataxia, we identified a de novo missense variant c.376G>C; p.(Asp126His) in the FEM1C gene encoding a cullin-RING ligase substrate receptor. This variant alters a conserved amino acid located within a highly constrained coding region and is predicted as pathogenic by most in silico tools. In addition, a de novo FEM1C mutation of the same residue p.(Asp126Val) was associated with an undiagnosed developmental disorder, and the relevant variant (FEM1CAsp126Ala) was found to be functionally compromised in vitro. Our computational analysis showed that FEM1CAsp126His hampers protein substrate binding. To further assess its pathogenicity, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that the FEM-1Asp133His animals (expressing variant homologous to the FEM1C p.(Asp126Val)) had normal muscle architecture yet impaired mobility. Mutant worms were sensitive to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb but not levamisole (acetylcholine receptor agonist), showing that their disabled locomotion is caused by synaptic abnormalities and not muscle dysfunction. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence from an animal model suggesting that a mutation in the evolutionarily conserved FEM1C Asp126 position causes a neurodevelopmental disorder in humans.",

    "abstract": "Short polypeptides encoded by small open reading frames (smORFs) are ubiquitously found in eukaryotic genomes and are important regulators of physiology, development, and mitochondrial processes. Here, we focus on a subset of 298 smORFs that are evolutionarily conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and humans. Many of these smORFs are conserved broadly in the bilaterian lineage, with [~]182 conserved in plants. Within these conserved smORFs, we observed remarkably heterogenous spatial and temporal expression patterns - indicating wide-spread tissue-specific and stage-specific mitochondrial architectures. In addition, an analysis of annotated functional domains revealed a predicted enrichment of smORF polypeptides localizing to mitochondria. We conducted an embryonic ribosome profiling experiment finding support for translation of 137 of these smORFs during embryogenesis. We further embarked on functional characterization using CRISPR knockout/activation, RNAi knockdown, and cDNA overexpression, revealing diverse phenotypes.

    "abstract": "In bacterial cells, DNA damage tolerance is manifested by the action of translesion DNA polymerases that can synthesize DNA across template lesions that typically block the replicative DNA polymerase III. It has been suggested that one of these TLS DNA polymerases, DNA polymerase IV, can either act in concert with the replisome, switching places on the {beta} sliding clamp with DNA polymerase III to bypass the template damage, or act subsequent to the replisome skipping over the template lesion in the gap in nascent DNA left behind as the replisome continues downstream. Evidence exists in support of both mechanisms. Using single-molecule analyses we show that DNA polymerase IV associates with the replisome in a concentration-dependent manner and remains associated over long stretches of replication fork progression under unstressed conditions. This association slows the replisome, requires DNA polymerase IV binding to the {beta} clamp but not its catalytic activity, and is reinforced by the presence of the {gamma} subunit of the {beta} clamp-loading DnaX complex in the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Thus, DNA damage is not required for association of DNA polymerase IV with the replisome. We suggest that under stress conditions such as induction of the SOS response, the association of DNA polymerase IV with the replisome provides both a surveillance/bypass mechanism and a means to slow replication fork progression, thereby reducing the frequency of collisions with template damage and the overall mutagenic potential.\n\nSignificanceDamage to the nucleotide bases that make up the DNA in chromosomes creates a problem for their subsequent accurate duplication each time a cell divides. Typically, the cellular enzymatic machinery that replicates the DNA cannot copy a damaged base and specialized trans-lesion DNA polymerases, which are prone to making errors that result in mutations, are required to copy the damaged base, allowing replication to proceed. We demonstrate that the bacterial replisome, which is comprised of the enzymes required to replicate the chromosome, can associate with one of these specialized trans-lesion polymerases over long distances of replicated DNA. This association slows the speed of replication, thereby reducing the chance of mutations arising in the cell under conditions of stress.",

Mapping such responses in human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is of great interest for cardiotoxicity and personalized medicine applications.\n\nAimWe introduce and validate a very low-cost compact mapping system for macroscopic all-optical electrophysiology in layers of hiPSC-CMs.\n\nApproachThe system uses oblique trans-illumination, low-cost cameras, light-emitting diodes and off-the-shelf components (total < $15,000) to capture voltage, calcium and mechanical waves under electrical or optical stimulation.\n\nResultsOur results corroborate the equivalency of electrical and optogenetic stimulation of hiPSC-CMs, and Vm - [Ca2+]i similarity in conduction under pacing. Green-excitable optical sensors are combinable with blue optogenetic actuators (Chanelrhodopsin2) only under very low green light (< 0.05mW/mm2). Measurements in warmer culture medium yield larger spread of action potential duration and higher conduction velocities compared to Tyrodes solution at room temperature.\n\nConclusionsAs multiple optical sensors and actuators are combined, our results can help handle the \"spectral congestion\" and avoid parameter distortion. We illustrate the utility of the system for uncovering the action of cellular uncoupling agents and show extensibility to an epi-illumination mode for future imaging of thicker native or engineered tissues.",

    "abstract": "Many soft biclustering algorithms have been developed and applied to various biological and biomedical data analyses. However, until now, few mutually exclusive (hard) biclustering algorithms have been proposed although they can be extremely useful for identify disease or molecular subtypes based on genomic or transcriptomic data. We considered the biclustering problem of expression matrices as a bipartite graph partitioning problem and developed a novel biclustering algorithm, MESBC, based on Dhillons spectral method to detect mutually exclusive biclusters. MESBC simultaneously detects relevant features (genes) and corresponding subgroups, and therefore automatically uses the signature features for each subtype to perform the clustering, improving the clustering performance. MESBC could accurately detect the pre-specified biclusters in simulations, and the identified biclusters were highly consistent with the true labels. Particularly, in setting with high noise, MESBC outperformed existing NMF and Dhillons method and provided markedly better accuracy. Analysis of two TCGA datasets (LUAD and BRAC cohorts) revealed that MESBC provided similar or more accurate prognostication (i.e., smaller p value) for overall survival in patients with breast and lung cancer, respectively, compared to the existing, gold-standard subtypes for breast (PAM50) and lung cancer (integrative clustering). In the TCGA lung cancer patients, MESBC detected two clinically relevant, rare subtypes that other biclustering or integrative clustering algorithms could not detect. These findings validated our hypothesis that MESBC could improve molecular subtyping in cancer patients and potentially facilitate better individual patient management, risk stratification, patient selection, therapeutic assignments, as well as better understanding gene signatures and molecular pathways for development of novel therapeutic agents.",

We further show that sequence and structural aspects of TNKSs are well conserved even between highly diverged species. We also experimentally characterized an anciently diverged tankyrase homolog from the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica and show that the basic functional aspects, such as poly-ADP-ribosylation activity and interaction with the canonical tankyrase binding peptide motif, are conserved. Conversely, the presence of tankyrase binding motifs in orthologs of confirmed interaction partners vary greatly between species, indicating that tankyrases have different sets of interaction partners depending on the animal lineage. Overall, our analysis suggests a remarkable degree of conservation for tankyrases, although their regulatory functions in cells have likely changed considerably throughout evolution.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTWith sparse treatment options, cardiac disease remains a significant cause of death among humans. As a person ages, mitochondria break down and the heart becomes less efficient. Heart failure is linked to many mitochondria-associated processes, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial bioenergetics, insulin signaling, autophagy, and oxidative stress. The roles of key mitochondrial complexes that dictate the ultrastructure, such as the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), in aging cardiac muscle are poorly understood. To better understand the cause of age-related alteration in mitochondrial structure in cardiac muscle, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and serial block facing-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to quantitatively analyze the 3D networks in cardiac muscle samples of male mice at aging intervals of 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Here, we present the loss of cristae morphology, the inner folds of the mitochondria, across age. In conjunction with this, the 3D volume of mitochondria decreased. These findings mimicked observed phenotypes in murine cardiac fibroblasts with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of Mitofilin, Chchd3, Chchd6 (some members of the MICOS complex), and Opa1, which showed poorer oxidative consumption rate and mitochondria with decreased mitochondrial length and volume. In combination, these data show the need to explore if loss of the MICOS complex in the heart may be involved in age-associated mitochondrial and cristae structural changes.",

However, in vitro tumour spheroid experiments, used to understand cancer progression and develop cancer therapies, have been routinely performed for the past fifty years in constant external environments. Furthermore, spheroids are typically grown in ambient atmospheric oxygen (normoxia), whereas most in vivo tumours exist in hypoxic environments. Therefore, there are clear discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo conditions. We explore these discrepancies by combining tools from experimental biology, mathematical modelling, and statistical uncertainty quantification. Focusing on oxygen variability to develop our framework, we reveal key biological mechanisms governing tumour spheroid growth. Growing spheroids in time-dependent conditions, we identify and quantify novel biological adaptation mechanisms, including unexpected necrotic core removal, and transient reversal of the tumour spheroid growth phases.",

    "abstract": "Undruggability of RAS proteins has necessitated alternative strategies for the development of effective inhibitors. In this respect, phosphorylation has recently come into prominence as this reversible post-translational modification attenuates sensitivity of RAS towards RAF. As such, in this study, we set out to unveil the impact of phosphorylation on dynamics of HRASWT and aim to invoke similar behavior in HRASG12D mutant by means of small therapeutic molecules. To this end, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using phosphorylated HRAS and showed that phosphorylation of Y32 distorted Switch I, hence the RAS/RAF interface. Consequently, we targeted Switch I in HRASG12D by means of approved therapeutic molecules and showed that the ligands enabled detachment of Switch I from the nucleotide-binding pocket. Moreover, we demonstrated that displacement of Switch I from the nucleotide-binding pocket was energetically more favorable in the presence of the ligand. Importantly, we verified computational findings in vitro where HRASG12D/RAF interaction was prevented by the ligand in HEK293T cells that expressed HRASG12D mutant protein. Therefore, these findings suggest that targeting Switch I, hence making Y32 accessible might open up new avenues in future drug discovery strategies that target mutant RAS proteins.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the prognostic and therapeutic potentials of multiple Proteasome 26S Subunit, ATPase (PSMC) family of genes (PSMC1-5) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) diagnosis and treatment. All the PSMCs were found to be differentially expressed (upregulated) at the mRNA and protein levels in LUAD tissues. The promoter and multiple coding regions of PSMCs were reported to be differentially and distinctly methylated, which may serve in the methylation-sensitive diagnosis of LUAD patients. Multiple somatic mutations (alteration frequency: 0.6-2%) were observed along the PSMCs coding regions in LUAD tissues that could assist in the high-throughput screening of LUAD patients. A significant association between PSMCs overexpression and LUAD patients poor overall and relapse-free survival (p<0.05, HR:>1.3) and individual cancer stages (p<0.001) was discovered, which justifies PSMCs as the ideal targets for LUAD diagnosis. Multiple immune cells and modulators (i.e., CD274, IDO1) were found to be associated with PSMCs expression in LUAD tissues that could aid in formulating PSMC-based diagnostic measures and therapeutic interventions for LUAD. Functional enrichment analysis of neighbor genes of PSMCs in LUAD tissues revealed different genes (i.e., SLIRP, PSMA2, NUDSF3) previously known to be involved in oncogenic processes and metastasis co-expressed with PSMCs, which could also be investigated further. Overall, this study recommends that PSMCs and their transcriptional and translational products are potential candidates for LUAD diagnostic and therapeutic measure discovery.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is the major enzyme responsible for metabolizing toxic acetaldehyde to acetate and acts as a protective or defensive protein against various disease states associated with alcohol used disorder (AUD), including alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and elevated oxidative stress. We hypothesized that Aldh2-knockout (KO) mice are susceptible to binge alcohol-mediated liver injury than wild-type (WT) mice through increased gut leakiness and endotoxemia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective role of ALDH2 in binge alcohol-induced gut permeability, endotoxemia, and acute inflammatory liver injury by exposing Aldh2-KO or WT mice to a single oral dose of binge alcohol 3.5, 4.0, or 5.0 g/kg. Our findings showed for the first time that ALDH2 deficiency in Aldh2-KO mice increases their sensitivity to alcohol-induced oxidative and nitrative stress, enterocyte apoptosis, and nitration of gut tight junction (TJ) and adherent junction (AJ) proteins, leading to their degradation. These resulted in gut leakiness and endotoxemia in Aldh2-KO mice after exposure to a single dose of ethanol even at 3.5 g/kg, while no changes were observed in the corresponding WT mice. The elevated serum endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and/or bacterial translocation contributed to systemic inflammation, hepatocyte apoptosis, and subsequently acute liver injury, indicating the disruption in the gut-liver axis. Furthermore, treatment with Daidzin, an ALDH2 inhibitor, exacerbated ethanol-induced cell permeability and reduced TJ/AJ proteins in T84 human colonic cells. These changes were reversed by Alda-1, an ALDH2 activator, indicating a crucial role of ALDH2 in protecting against alcohol-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction. All these findings suggest that ALDH2 deficiency or gene mutation in humans is a risk factor to alcohol-mediated gut and liver injury, and ALDH2 could be an important therapeutic target against alcohol-associated tissue/organ damage.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBinge alcohol increases oxidative and nitrative stress in the intestine and liver.\nC_LIO_LIBinge alcohol causes gut leakiness, endotoxemia, and acute liver injury.\nC_LIO_LILeaky gut is caused by elevated degradation of nitrated intestinal TJ/AJ proteins.\nC_LIO_LIAldh2-KO mice are susceptible to binge-alcohol-induced leaky gut and liver injury.\nC_LIO_LIALDH2 inhibition increases alcohol-induced T84 colonic epithelial cell permeability.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Low protein (LP) diets are associated with a decreased risk of diabetes in humans, and a low protein diet promotes leanness and glycemic control in both rodents and humans. While the effects of a LP diet on glycemic control are mediated by reduced dietary levels of the branched- chain amino acids (BCAAs), we have observed that reducing dietary levels of the other six essential amino acids leads to changes in body composition. Here, we find that dietary histidine plays a key role in the response to a LP diet in male C57BL/6J mice. Specifically reducing dietary levels of histidine by 67% reduces weight gain of young, lean male mice, reducing both adipose and lean mass gain, without altering glucose metabolism. Specifically reducing dietary histidine rapidly reverses diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese male mice, increasing insulin sensitivity; this normalization of metabolic health was associated not with caloric restriction or increased activity, but with increased energy expenditure. We find that the effects of histidine restriction surprisingly does not require the energy balance hormone Fgf21. Histidine restriction started in mid-life promoted leanness and glucose tolerance in aged males but not females, but did not affect frailty or lifespan in either sex. Finally, we demonstrate that variation in dietary histidine levels helps to explain body mass index differences in humans. Overall, our findings demonstrate that dietary histidine is a key regulator of weight and body composition in male mice and in humans, and suggest that reducing dietary levels of histidine may be a highly translatable option for the treatment of obesity.\n\nKey PointsO_LIProtein restriction (PR) promotes metabolic health in rodents and humans and extends rodent lifespan.\nC_LIO_LIRestriction of specific individual essential amino acids can recapitulate the benefits of PR.\nC_LIO_LIReduced histidine promotes leanness and increased energy expenditure in mice.\nC_LIO_LIReduced histidine does not extend the lifespan of mice when begun in mid-life.\nC_LIO_LIDietary levels of histidine are positively associated with BMI in humans.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Inducible promoters, such as the lac and tet promoters, are ubiquitous biotechnology tools. Inducible bacterial promoters have a consistent architecture including two key elements: the operator region recognized by the transcriptional regulator proteins (e.g., LacI and TetR, and the -10 and -35 consensus sequences required to recruit the sigma ({sigma}) subunits of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. Despite their widespread use in molecular biology, there remain problems with current inducible expression systems. Leaky transcription in the OFF state remains a particular challenge. Here we have updated the architecture of the lac and tet expression systems to improve their strength, control, and portability. We modified the genetic architecture of the lac and tet expression systems to contain consensus -10 and -35 sequence boxes to be strongly targeted by {sigma}70, to incorporate of a strong ribosome binding site recognized broadly by gram-negative bacteria, and to independently control of the transcriptional regulators by optimized constitutive promoters. To test the promoters, we use the far-red fluorescent protein mCardinal, which we demonstrate significantly improves the signal-to-background ratio of promoter measurement assays over widely utilized green fluorescent proteins. We validate the improvement in OFF state control and inducibility by demonstrating production of the toxic and aggregate-prone cocaine esterase enzyme CocE. We further demonstrate portability of the promoters to additional gram-negative species Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio natriegens. Our results represent a significant improvement over existing protein expression systems that will enable advances in protein production for various biotechnology applications.\n\nSignificanceMany of the latest advances in pharmaceuticals, materials, and foods involve the production of recombinant proteins from bacterial hosts. However, the regulated production of enzymes and functional protein products that are toxic to their microbial hosts remains a challenge. Our work provides new tools that enable tight control over expression of protein products in bacterial host strains. We show that our tools function not only in the broadly utilized Escherichia coli, but also in other gram-negative bacteria including the soil organism Pseudomonas putida and the marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens. Our technology will facilitate more efficient production of a broader range of protein products in diverse microbial hosts.",

    "abstract": "Infantile amnesia is possibly the most ubiquitous form of memory loss in mammals. Despite its widespread relevance, little is known about the biological conditions for infantile amnesia to occur and its effect on the engram cells that encode a memory. We investigated how memories are stored in the brain throughout development by integrating engram labeling technology with mouse models of infantile amnesia. We discovered a sex-specific phenomenon in which male offspring in maternal immune activation models of autism spectrum disorder do not experience infantile amnesia. We rescued the same apparently forgotten infantile memories in mice by optogenetically reactivating dentate gyrus engram cells that were labeled during complex experiences in infant development. Further, we were able to permanently reinstate lost infantile memories by artificially updating the memory engram, demonstrating that infantile amnesia is a reversible process. Our findings suggest that immune activation during development modulates innate, and reversible, forgetting switches that determine whether infantile amnesia will occur.",

    "abstract": "Gamma oscillations are believed to underlie cognitive processes by shaping the formation of transient neuronal partnerships on a millisecond scale. These oscillations are coupled to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas, possibly reflecting local computations driven by sensory inputs sampled at each breath. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform (olfactory) cortex of awake mice to understand their dependence on breathing and how they relate to local spiking activity. Mechanistically, we find that respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, which correlate with local feedback inhibition and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. Moreover, respiration-driven gamma oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Functionally, we demonstrate that they locally segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. Our results shed new light on the mechanisms of gamma oscillations, bridging computation, cognition and physiology.",

    "abstract": "Place cells are hippocampal neurons encoding the position of an animal in space. Studies of place cells are essential to understanding the processing and transmission of information by neural networks of the brain. An important characteristic of place cell spike trains is phase precession. When an animal is running through the place field, the discharges of the place cells shift from the ascending phase of the theta rhythm through the minimum to the descending phase. The role of excitatory inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons along the Schaffer collaterals and the perforant pathway in phase precession is described, but the role of inputs from local interneurons to CA1 pyramidal cell is poorly understood. We have set the goal the contribution of field CA1 interneurons to the phase precession of place cells using mathematical methods. The CA1 field was chosen because it provides the largest set of experimental data required to build and verify the model. We have solved the optimization problem and found the parameters of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the pyramidal neuron of the CA1 field so that the neuron generates a spike train with the effect of phase precession. We have discovered that the uniform inhibition of field CA1 pyramidal neurons best explains the effect of phase precession. Among interneurons, axo-axonal neurons make the greatest contribution to the inhibition of pyramidal cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen consisting of three phylogroups (hereafter named A, B, and C) of unevenly distributed size. Here, we assessed phylogroup-specific evolutionary dynamics in a collection of P. aeruginosa genomes.\n\nMethodsIn this genomic analysis, using phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses, we generated 18 hybrid assemblies from a phylogenetically diverse collection of clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa isolates, and contextualised this information with 1991 publicly available genomes of the same species. We explored to what extent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, defence systems, and virulence genes vary in their distribution across regions of genome plasticity (RGPs) and \"masked\" (RGP-free) genomes, and to what extent this variation differs among the phylogroups.\n\nFindingsWe found that members of phylogroup B possess larger genomes, contribute a comparatively larger number of pangenome families, and show lower abundance of CRISPR-Cas systems. Furthermore, AMR and defence systems are pervasive in RGPs and integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements (ICEs/IMEs) from phylogroups A and B, and the abundance of these cargo genes is often significantly correlated. Moreover, inter- and intra-phylogroup interactions occur at the accessory genome level, suggesting frequent recombination events. Finally, we provide here a panel of diverse P. aeruginosa strains to be used as reference for functional analyses.\n\nInterpretationAltogether, our results highlight distinct pangenome characteristics of the P. aeruginosa phylogroups, which are possibly influenced by variation in the abundance of CRISPR-Cas systems and that are shaped by the differential distribution of other defence systems and AMR genes.\n\nFundingGerman Science Foundation, Max-Planck Society, Leibniz ScienceCampus Evolutionary Medicine of the Lung, BMBF program Medical Infection Genomics, Kiel Life Science Postdoc Award.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo date, pangenome studies exploring the epidemiology and evolution dynamics of bacterial pathogens have been limited due to the use of gene frequencies across whole species dataset without accounting for biased sampling or the population structure of the genomes in the dataset. We searched PubMed without language restrictions for articles published before September 1, 2021, that investigated the phylogroup-specific evolutionary dynamics across bacterial species. In this literature search we used the search terms \"pangenome\" and \"phylogroup\" or \"uneven\", which returned 14 results. Of these, only one study used a population structure-aware approach to explore pangenome dynamics in a bacterial species consisting of multiple phylogroups with unevenly distributed members.\n\nAdded value of this studyTo our knowledge, this study is the first to assess phylogroup-specific evolutionary dynamics in a collection of genomes belonging to the nosocomial pathogen P. aeruginosa. Using a refined approach that challenges traditional pangenome analyses, we found specific signatures for each of the three phylogroups, and we demonstrate that members of phylogroup B contribute a comparatively larger number of pangenome families, have larger genomes, and have a lower prevalence of CRISPR-Cas systems. Additionally, we observed that antibiotic resistance and defence systems are pervasive in regions of genome plasticity and integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements from phylogroups A and B, and that antibiotic resistance and defence systems are often significantly correlated in these mobile genetic elements.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThese results indicate that biases inherent to traditional pangenome approaches can obscure the real distribution of important cargo genes in a bacterial species with a complex population structure. Furthermore, our findings pave the way to new pangenome approaches that are currently under-explored in comparative genomics and, crucially, shed a new light on the role that integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements may play in protecting the host against foreign DNA.",
