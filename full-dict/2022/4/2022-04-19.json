    "abstract": "Background/objectivesCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients exhibit lipid metabolic alterations, but the mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) impairs lipid metabolism in host cells.\n\nMethodsA Spike cell line in HEK293 was generated using the pcDNA vector carrying the Spike gene expression cassette. A control cell line was generated using the empty pcDNA vector. Gene expression profiles related to lipid metabolic, autophagic, and ferroptotic pathways were investigated. Palmitic acid (PA)-overload was used to assess lipotoxicity-induced necrosis.\n\nResultsAs compared with controls, the Spike cells showed a significant increase in lipid depositions on cell membranes as well as dysregulation of expression of a panel of molecules involved lipid metabolism, autophagy, and ferroptosis. The Spike cells showed an upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a multifunctional transcriptional factor, in response to PA. Furthermore, the Spike cells exhibited increased necrosis in response to PA-induced lipotoxicity compared to control cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner via ferroptosis, which could be attenuated by the Nrf2 inhibitor trigonelline.\n\nConclusionsThe Spike protein impairs lipid metabolic and autophagic pathways in host cells, leading to increased susceptibility to lipotoxicity via ferroptosis which can be suppressed by a Nrf2 inhibitor. This data also suggests a central role of Nrf2 in Spike-induced lipid metabolic impairments.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe Spike protein increases lipid deposition in host cell membranes\nC_LIO_LIThe Spike protein impairs lipid metabolic and autophagic pathways\nC_LIO_LIThe Spike protein exaggerates PA-induced lipotoxicity in host cells via ferroptosis\nC_LIO_LINrf2 inhibitor Trigonelline can mitigate the Spike protein-induced necrosis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible coronavirus and has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has a deep impact on public health as one of the most serious pandemics in the last century. Tracking SARS-CoV-2 is important for monitoring and assessing its evolution. This is only possible by detecting all mutations in the viral genome through genomic sequencing. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 and tracking its mutations is also required for its correct diagnosis. Potential effects of mutations on the prognosis of the disease can be observed. Assignment of epidemiological lineages in an emerging pandemic requires efforts. To address this, we collected 1000 SARS-CoV-2 samples from different geographical regions in Turkey and analyze their genome comprehensively. To track the virus across Turkey we focus on 10 distinct cities in different geographic regions. Each SARS-CoV-2 genome was analyzed and named according to the nomenclature system of Nextclade and Pangolin Lineage. Furthermore, the frequency of the variations observed in 10 months was also determined by region. In this way, we have observed how the virus mutations and what kind of transmission mechanism it has. The effects of age and disease severity on lineage distribution were other considered parameters. The temporal rates of SARS-CoV-2 variants by time in Turkey were close to the global trend. This study is one of the most comprehensive whole genome analyses of SARS-CoV-2 that represents a general picture of the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variations in Turkey in 2021.\n\nAuthor SummarySince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 was analysed intensively all over the world both to detect its zoonotic origin and the emerging variants worldwide together with the variants effect on the prognosis and treatment, respectively, of the infection. Remarkable COVID-19 studies were also made in Turkey as it was in the rest of the world. To date, indeed, almost all studies on COVID-19 in Turkey either sequenced only a small number of the viral genome or analysed the viral genome which was obtained from online databases. In respect thereof, our study constitutes a milestone regarding both the huge sample size consisting of 1000 viral genomes and the widespread geographic origin of the viral genome samples. Our study provides new insights both into the SARS-CoV-2 landscape of Turkey and the transmission of the emerging viral pathogen and its interaction with its vertebrate host.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing has played an important role in documenting the emergence of polymorphisms in the viral genome and its continuing evolution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we present data from over 360 patients to characterize the complex sequence diversity of individual infections identified during multiple variant surges (e.g., Alpha and Delta; requiring [&ge;] 80% genome coverage and [&ge;]100X read depth). Across our survey, we observed significantly increasing SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity during the pandemic and frequent occurrence of multiple biallelic sequence polymorphisms in all infections. This sequence polymorphism shows that SARS-CoV-2 infections are heterogeneous mixtures. Convention for reporting microbial pathogens guides investigators to report a majority consensus sequence. In our study, we found that this approach would under-report at least 79% of the observed sequence variation. As we find that this sequence heterogeneity is efficiently transmitted from donors to recipients, our findings illustrate that infection complexity must be monitored and reported more completely to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission dynamics involving both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Many of the nucleotide changes that would not be reported in a majority consensus sequence have now been observed as lineage defining SNPs in Omicron BA.1 and/or BA.2 variants. This suggests that minority alleles in earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may play an important role in the continuing evolution of new variants of concern.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEvolution of the virus causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with significant transmission surges. With evolution of SARS-CoV-2, evidence has accumulated regarding increased transmissibility of lineages, varying severity of illness, evasion of vaccines and diagnostic tests. Continuous tracking of SARS-CoV-2 lineage evolution distills very large and complex viral sequence data sets down to consensus sequences that report the majority nucleotide at each of over 29,000 positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observe that this eliminates considerable sequence variation and leads to a significant underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection diversity and transmission complexity. Additionally, concentration on the majority consensus sequence diverts attention from genetic variation that may contribute significantly to the continuing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The Na+-pumping NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) couples electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone with Na+-pumping, generating an electrochemical Na+ gradient that is essential for energy-consuming reactions in bacteria. Since Na+-NQR is exclusively found in prokaryotes, it is a promising target for highly selective antibiotics. However, the molecular mechanism of inhibition is not well-understood for lack of the atomic structural information about an inhibitor-bound state. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of Na+- NQR from Vibrio cholerae with or without a bound inhibitor at 2.5- to 3.1-[A] resolution. The structures reveal the arrangement of all six redox cofactors including riboflavin, whose position has been under debate, and a newly assigned 2Fe-2SNqrD/E cluster located between the membrane embedded NqrD and NqrE subunits. A large part of the hydrophilic NqrF near the cytoplasmic membrane surface is barely visible in the density map, suggesting a high degree of flexibility. This flexibility may be responsible to reducing the long distance between the 2Fe- 2S centers in NqrF and NqrD/E, consistent with physiologically relevant electron transfer. Two different types of specific inhibitors (korormicin A and aurachin D-42) bind to the N-terminal region of NqrB, which is disordered in the absence of inhibitors. The current inhibitor-bound structures reasonably explain our previous biochemical findings obtained by different chemistry-based experiments. This study provides a definite foundation for understanding the function of Na+-NQR and the molecular mechanism of its specific inhibitors to support molecular design of new antibiotics targeting the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Purification is essential before differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into cells that fully express particular differentiation marker genes. High-quality iPSC clones are typically purified through gene expression profiling or visual inspection of the cell morphology; however, the relationship between the two methods remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between gene expression levels and morphology by analyzing live-cell phase-contrast images and mRNA profiles collected during the purification process. We employed this data and an unsupervised image feature extraction method to build a model that predicts gene expression levels from morphology. As a benchmark, we confirmed that the method can predict the gene expression levels from tissue images for cancer genes, performing as well as state-of-the-art methods. We then applied the method to iPSCs and identified two genes that are well-predicted from cell morphology. Although strong batch effects resulting from the reprogramming process preclude the ability to use the same model to predict across batches, prediction within a reprogramming batch is sufficiently robust to provide a practical approach for estimating expression levels of a few genes and monitoring the purification process.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodelers use a helicase-type ATPase motor to shift DNA around the histone core. Although not directly reading out the DNA sequence, some chromatin remodelers are biased by DNA sequences, suggesting that they may be sensitive to properties of the DNA duplex. Here, we present a high-throughput method for determining nucleosome positioning in vitro using site-specific DNA cleavage coupled with next-generation sequencing. This method allowed us to systematically test how the introduction of poly(dA:dT) tracts and other perturbations affected the distribution of nucleosomes remodeled by the Chd1 remodeler. We found that Chd1 is sensitive to poly(dA:dT) tracts as short as 3 bp, and that its nucleosome sliding activity is severely perturbed by DNA mismatches and single-nucleotide insertions. These results suggest that remodelers rely on the integrity of duplex DNA for nucleosome sliding. We also discovered that DNA on the nucleosome can shift in the absence of a remodeler when multiple mismatches are placed at superhelix location 2 (SHL2). This DNA movement in response to a disruption of the double helix may explain why SHL2 is the preferred site of engagement by most chromatin remodelers.",

    "abstract": "The Kv1.3 potassium channel is expressed abundantly on activated T cells and mediates the cellular immune response. This role has made the channel a target for therapeutic immunomodulation to block its activity and suppress T cell activation. We determined structures of human Kv1.3 alone, with a nanobody inhibitor, and with an antibody-toxin fusion blocker. Rather than block the channel directly, four copies of the nanobody bind the tetramers voltage sensing domains and the pore domain to induce an inactive pore conformation. In contrast, the antibody-toxin fusion docks its toxin domain at the extracellular mouth of the channel to insert a critical lysine into the pore. The lysine induces an active conformation of the pore yet blocks ion permeation. This study visualizes Kv1.3 pore dynamics, defines two distinct mechanisms to suppress Kv1.3 channel activity with exogenous inhibitors, and provides a framework to aid development of emerging T cell immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities typically comprise multiple different species with an intricate network of interactions, ranging from competitive to cooperative, between them. How does the nature of these inter-species interactions impact overall community behavior? While the influence of purely competitive interactions is well-studied, the opposite case of mutualistic interactions--which are also prevalent in many naturally-occurring communities--is poorly understood. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by mathematically modeling a well-mixed two-species community of aerobes and anaerobes having mutualistic metabolic interactions between them. Despite the simplicity of the model, we find that it reproduces three characteristic experimental findings. In particular, in response to changes in the fluxes of exogenously-supplied carbon and oxygen, the community adopts two distinct stable states with differing fractions of aerobes and anaerobes. These states are bistable, capable of arising under identical environmental conditions; transitions between the two are therefore history-dependent and can give rise to oscillations in the bacterial and chemical concentrations. Moreover, using the model, we establish biophysical principles describing how oxygen depletion and nutrient sharing jointly dictate the characteristics of the different states as well as the transitions between them. Altogether, this work thus helps disentangle and highlight the pivotal role of mutualism in governing the overall stability and functioning of microbial communities. Moreover, our model provides a foundation for future studies of more complex communities that play important roles in agriculture, environment, industry, and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Current clinical treatment for neurodegenerative diseases and neural injuries falls short of success, and one primary reason is that neurons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) lose their regeneration ability as they mature. Previous studies indicated that the regeneration ability of neurons is governed by complex signaling networks involving many genes. Therefore, here we investigated the roles of Ezh2, a histone methyltransferase, in regulation of mammalian axon regeneration at the epigenetic level. We found that Ezh2 level was gradually downregulated in the mouse nervous system during maturation but significantly upregulated in mature sensory neurons during spontaneous axon regeneration in the peripheral nerve system (PNS), suggesting its role in supporting axon regeneration. Indeed, Ezh2 loss-of-function in sensory neurons impaired PNS axon regeneration in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of Ezh2 in retinal ganglion cells in the CNS induced optic nerve regeneration after optic nerve injury in both methyltransferase-dependent and -independent manners. Mechanistic exploration with multiomics sequencing, together with functional analyses, revealed that Ezh2 supported axon regeneration by systematically silencing the transcription of genes regulating synaptic function and axon regeneration inhibitory signaling, while broadly activating factors promoting axon regeneration. Our study not only reveals that Ezh2 coordinates axon regeneration via epigenetically regulating multiple key regenerative pathways, but also suggests that modulating chromatin accessibility is a promising strategy to promote CNS axon regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The Sin3 transcriptional regulator homolog A (Sin3A) is the core member of a multi-protein chromatin-modifying complex known to control gene transcription via epigenetic mechanisms. Its inactivation in developing thymocytes halts T cell maturation. We and others had previously shown that Sin3A controls STAT3 transcriptional activity. Given the role of STAT3 in the differentiation of T helper 17 cells critical in inflammatory disorders and against opportunistic infections, we asked whether Sin3A could also contribute to their differentiation. To this aim, we exploited CD4-Cre and CD4-CreERT2deleter strains for conditional and inducible Sin3A deletion in CD4 cell subsets. We report that Sin3A inactivation in vivo arrested thymocyte development at the double positive stage, hindering the characterization of mature T cells. At difference, tamoxifen-inducible Sin3A deletion proved permissive for in vitro proliferation of T cells in Th17 skewing conditions and the acquisition of memory markers. Transcriptional profiling indicated that while Sin3A inactivation imprinted T cells with a mTORC1 signaling gene signature, Sin3A deficient cells lacked the expression of IL-17A, the signature Th17 cytokine. This reflected a defective induction of Il17a, and also of the Il23R and Il22 genes, which occurred in spite of proper upregulation of the lineage defining transcription factor ROR{gamma}t. We found that Sin3A inactivation was paralleled by increased STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear representation, and by higher fractions of IL-2 and FoxP3 expressing cells. Such events proved causally linked as inhibiting Foxp3 partially rescued IL-17A expression, and neutralizing IL-2 simultaneously lowered the representation of FoxP3+cells, while rescuing IL- 17A+ ones. Thus, together our data underline a previously unappreciated role for Sin3A in Th17 differentiation and the shaping of their immunoregulatory potential.\n\nStatementThis study identifies a new role for the transcriptional regulator Sin3A in the shaping of Th17 cell differentiation. Data indicate that by controlling IL-2 expression, and mTORC1 signaling, it balances IL-17A and Foxp3 levels, shaping Th17 inflammatory potentials.",

    "abstract": "Polysaccharide breakdown by bacteria requires the activity of enzymes that degrade polymers extracellularly. This generates a localized pool of breakdown products that are accessible to the enzyme producers themselves as well as to other organisms. Marine bacterial taxa often show marked differences in the production and secretion of degradative enzymes that break down polysaccharides. These differences can have profound effects on the pool of diffusible breakdown products and hence on the ecological dynamics. However, the consequences of differences in enzymatic secretions on cellular growth dynamics and interactions are unclear. Here we combine experiments and models to study the growth dynamics of single cells within populations of marine Vibrionaceae strains that grow on the abundant marine polymer alginate, using microfluidics coupled to quantitative single-cell analysis and mathematical modelling. We find that strains that have low extracellular secretions of alginate lyases show stronger aggregative behaviors compared to strains that secrete high levels of enzymes. One plausible reason for this observation is that low secretors require a higher cellular density to achieve maximal growth rates in comparison with high secretors. Our findings indicate that increased aggregation increases intercellular synergy amongst cells of low-secreting strains. By mathematically modelling the impact of the level of degradative enzyme secretion on the rate of oligomer loss to diffusion, we find that enzymatic capability modulates the propensity of cells within clonal populations to cooperate or compete with each other. Our experiments and models demonstrate that marine bacteria display distinct aggregative behaviors and intercellular interactions based on their enzymatic secretion capabilities when growing on polysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "Azo dye decolorizing acclimatized decolorizing consortia are enriched microbial sources of potential azoreductase-efficient bioremediation strains. Here, we characterized eight selected consortial members for their azo decolorization and azoreductase profiling. These efficient dye decolorizing bacterial isolates were affiliated to two major phyla viz. Firmicute (genus-Enterococcus) and Proteobacteria ({gamma}-group). Redox-mediators such as AQDS and AQS were found to significantly increase decolorization except for menadione, and IR functional group signatures highlighted the azo bond reduction and degraded metabolites profiles of each strain. Among isolates, Enterococcus sp. L2 was found to be the most effective strain as it could reduce >90mg/L Reactive violet 5R (RV5R) dye in 3h of incubation. Furthermore, strain L2 possesses profound high NADH and NADPH-dependent azoreductase activity which also corroborated with its superior azo decolorization. As per physicochemical parameters, strain L2 showed an optimum decolorization at pH 8, 40 {degrees}C and up to 2% w/v salinity. To channelize reducing equivalence (NADH) to further enhance the dye decolorization in NADH-azoreductase efficient Enterococcus sp. L2, we augmented an NADH co-factor regeneration system. Using pMGS100, a Gram-positive expression vector a constitutive heterologous expression of Mycobacterium vaccae encoded NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase enhanced NADH pool which led to a significant 3.2 fold increased dye decolorization in Enterococcus sp. L2 harboring pMGS100 fdh along with a positive effect on growth. Ultimately, an augmentation of formate utilization step could further accelerate azo dye decolorization by fulfilling the co-factor (NADH) requirement of azoreductase along with a growth advantage in the non-model azoreductase-efficient environmentally important strain L2.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWExtensive remodeling of the host gene expression environment by coronaviruses nsp1 proteins is a well-documented and conserved piece of the coronavirus-host takeover battle. However, whether and how the underlying mechanism of regulation or the transcriptional target landscape differ amongst coronaviruses remains mostly uncharacterized. In this study we use comparative transcriptomics to investigate the diversity of transcriptional targets between four different coronavirus nsp1 proteins (from MERS, SARS1, SARS2 and 229E). In parallel, we performed Affinity Purification followed by Mass-Spectrometry to identify common and divergent interactors between these different nsp1. For all four nsp1 tested, we detected widespread RNA destabilization, confirming that both - and {beta}-Coronavirus nsp1 broadly affect the host transcriptome. Surprisingly, we observed that even closely related nsp1 showed little similarities in the clustering of genes targeted. Additionally, we show that the RNA targeted by nsp1 from the -CoV 229E partially overlapped with MERS nsp1 targets. Given MERS nsp1 preferential targeting of nuclear transcripts, these results may indicate that these nsp1 proteins share a similar targeting mechanism. Finally, we show that the interactome of these nsp1 proteins differ widely. Intriguingly, our data indicate that the 229E nsp1, which is the smallest of the nsp1 proteins tested here, interacts with the most host proteins, while MERS nsp1 only engaged with a few host proteins. Collectively, our work highlights that while nsp1 is a rather well-conserved protein with conserved functions across different coronaviruses, its precise effects on the host cell is virus specific.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWCoronaviruses extensively co-opt their host gene expression machinery in order to quicky benefit from the host resources. The viral protein nsp1 plays a major role in this takeover as nsp1 is known to induce a widespread shutdown of the host gene expression, both at the RNA and the translational level. Previous work characterized the molecular basis for nsp1-mediated host shutdown. However, this was mostly conducted in the context of {beta}-coronaviruses and in particular SARS-CoV1, CoV2 and MERS due to the important public health burden that these viruses represent. Here instead, we explored the impact of nsp1 on the host using a comparative approach, defining the influence of 4 nsp1 protein from - and {beta}-coronaviruses. We delineated the impact of these 4 nsp1 on the host transcriptome and mapped their interactome. We revealed that host target range and interactomes vary widely among different nsp1, suggesting a viral-specific targeting. Understanding how these differences shape infection will be important to better inform antiviral drug development.",

    "abstract": "Cellular invasion is a complex process that requires several interdependent biological mechanisms, which are initiated by changes in adhesion that establish a morphology favorable for migration. Hence, the regulation of adhesion potential is a rate-limiting step in metastasis. Our previous work revealed that de novo translation is necessary to regulate the adhesion of mesenchymal-like cells; however, the underlying translational regulatory mechanism and the identity of newly synthesized proteins needed for the adhesion process remain unidentified. Here, we describe a translational regulatory mechanism that modulates mesenchymal cell adhesion. We observed a drastic decrease in translation during the initial phase of adhesion, followed by a reprogramming of the translatome, characterized by an orchestrated wave of mRNA translation that increases the expression of specific proteins involved in adhesion. We observed that phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2), which inhibits general translation initiation, was drastically increased at the beginning of cell adhesion. As adhesion progressed, the selective increase in the translation of adhesion-related mRNAs intensified as eIF2 phosphorylation gradually decreased over time in mensenchymal cells, but not in epithelial cells. Taken together, we have identified a translational regulatory mechanism specifically affecting the adhesion process of mesenchymal cells, as well as metastatic cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.\n\nOne sentence summaryTranslation regulates mesenchymal cell adhesion",

In contrast, the renal lesion in Cys1cpk/cpk (cpk) mice with loss of the cystin protein, closely phenocopy ARPKD. Recent identification of patients with CYS1-related ARPKD prompted the investigations described herein. We analyzed cystin and FPC expression in mouse models (cpk, rescued-cpk (r-cpk), Pkhd1 mutants) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell lines (wild type (wt), cpk). We found that cystin deficiency led to diminished FPC in both cpk kidneys and CCD cells. In r-cpk kidneys, FPC increased and siRNA of Cys1 in wt CCD cells reduced FPC. Conversely, FPC deficiency in Pkhd1 mutants did not affect cystin levels. Cystin deficiency and the associated reduction in FPC levels impacted the architecture of the primary cilium, but not ciliogenesis. Similar Pkhd1 mRNA levels in wt, cpk kidneys and CCD cells suggested posttranslational mechanisms directed FPC loss and studies of cellular protein degradation systems revealed selective autophagy as a possible mechanism. Loss of FPC from the NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes caused reduced polyubiquitination and elevated levels of functional epithelial sodium channel (NEDD4 target) in cpk cells. We propose that cystin is necessary to stabilize FPC and loss of cystin leads to rapid FPC degradation. FPC removal from E3-ligase complexes alters the cellular proteome and may contribute to cystogenesis through multiple mechanisms, that include MYC transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells display persistent underlying chromosomal instability that results in chromosome mis-segregation, the formation of micronuclei, and abnormal numbers of chromosomes (aneuploidy). These features are common to nearly all human cancers, with individual tumour types intriguingly exhibiting characteristic subsets of whole, and sub-chromosomal aneuploidies. To date, few methods to induce specific aneuploidies at will exist, hampering the investigation of functional consequences of recurrent aneuploidies. Moreover, although some human cell lines with specific aneuploidies exist, the acute cellular responses to specific chromosomal instability events remain unknown. We therefore investigated the possibility of sabotaging the mitotic segregation of specific chromosomes using nuclease-dead CRISPR-Cas9 (dCas9) as a cargo carrier to specific genomic loci. We recruited the kinetochore-nucleating domain of centromere protein CENP-T to assemble ectopic kinetochores either near the centromere of chromosome 9, or the telomere of chromosome 1. Ectopic kinetochore assembly led to increased chromosome instability and aneuploidy of the target chromosomes, providing the potential to create  designer karyotypes and study their immediate downstream cellular responses in a wide range of cell types. Overall, our findings provide new insights into ectopic kinetochore biology, and also represent an important step towards investigating the role of specific aneuploidy and chromosome mis-segregation events in diseases associated with aneuploidy.",

We investigated the roles of NIPBL and WAPL, two regulators of cohesin activity, in chromatin folding and transcription in human cells. Consistent with their opposing roles in cohesin regulation, depletion of these factors showed opposite effects on levels of chromatin-bound cohesin and spatial insulation of neighboring domains. We find that NIPBL or WAPL depletion each alter the expression of ~2,000 genes, most of which are uniquely sensitive to either regulator. We find that each set of differentially expressed genes are enriched at chromatin loop anchors and clustered within the genome, suggesting there are genomic regions sensitive to either more or less cohesin. Remarkably, co-depletion of both regulators rescued chromatin misfolding and gene misexpression compared to either single knockdown.

A better understanding of the peripheral blood transcriptional response of Mycobacterium bovis-infected animals after bovine purified protein derivative (PPD-b) stimulation of whole blood--an important component of current bTB diagnostics--will provide new information for development of better diagnostics.\n\nMethodsRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to study the peripheral blood transcriptome after stimulation with PPD-b across four time points (-1 wk pre-infection, and +1 wk, +2 wk, and +10 wk post-infection) from a 14-week M. bovis infection time course experiment with ten age-matched Holstein-Friesian cattle.\n\nResultsIn vitro PPD-b stimulation of peripheral blood from M. bovis-infected and non-infected cattle elicited a strong transcriptional response. Comparison of PPD-b stimulated, and unstimulated samples revealed higher expression of genes encoding cytokine receptors, transcription factors, and interferon-inducible proteins. Lower expression was seen for genes encoding proteins involved in antimicrobial activity, C-type lectin receptors, inhibition of signal transduction, and genes encoding metal ion transporters.\n\nConclusionsA transcriptional signature associated with the peripheral blood response to PPD-b stimulation consisting of 170 genes was identified exclusively in the post-infection time points.

    "abstract": "Targeted DNA sequences conservation analyses of 17 primate species demonstrated that human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) LTR7/HERVH and LTR5_Hs/HERVK appear to have distinct evolutionary histories charted by evidence of the earliest presence and expansion of highly-conserved (HC) LTR sequences. HC-LTR7 loci were mapped to genomes of Old World Monkeys (18% of all HC-LTR7 loci), suggesting that LTR7/HERVH have entered germlines of primates in Africa after the separation of the New World Monkey lineage. HC-LTR5_Hs loci have been identified in the Gibbons genome (24% of all HC-LTR5_Hs loci), suggesting that LTR5_Hs/HERVK successfully colonized primates germlines after the segregation of Gibbons species. Subsequently, both LTR7 and LTR5_Hs undergo a marked [~]4-5-fold expansion in genomes of Great Apes. Timelines of quantitative expansion of both LTR7 and LTR5_Hs loci during evolution of Great Apes appear to replicate the consensus evolutionary sequence of increasing cognitive and behavioral complexities of non-human primates, which seems particularly striking for LTR7 loci and 11 distinct LTR7 subfamilies.\n\nConsistent with previous reports, identified in this study 351 human-specific (HS) insertions of LTR7 (175 loci) and LTR5_Hs (176 loci) regulatory sequences have been linked to genes implicated in establishment and maintenance of naive and primed pluripotent states and preimplantation embryogenesis phenotypes. Unexpectedly, HS regulatory LTRs appear linked with genes encoding markers of 12 distinct cells populations of fetal gonads, as well as genes implicated in physiology and pathology of human spermatogenesis, including Y-linked spermatogenic failure, oligo- and azoospermia.\n\nGranular investigations of genes linked with eleven LTR7 subfamilies revealed that mammalian offspring survival (MOS) genes seem to remain one of consistent regulatory targets throughout [~]30 MYA of the divergent evolution of LTR7 loci. Differential GSEA of MOS versus non-MOS genes identified clearly discernable dominant enrichment patterns of phenotypic traits affected by MOS genes linked with LTR7 (562 MOS genes) and LTR5_Hs (126 MOS genes) regulatory loci across the large panel of genomics and proteomics databases reflecting a broad spectrum of human physiological and pathological traits. GSEA of LTR7-linked MOS genes identified more than 2200 significantly enriched records of human common and rare diseases and gene signatures of 466 significantly enriched records of Human Phenotype Ontology traits, including 92 genes of Autosomal Dominant Inheritance and 93 genes of Autosomal Recessive Inheritance.\n\nOne of the most informative categories of genes linked with LTR7 elements were genes implicated in functional and morphological features of central nervous system, including genes regulating synaptic transmission and protein-protein interactions at synapses, as well as gene signatures differentially regulated in cells of distinct neurodevelopmental stages and morphologically diverse cell types residing and functioning in human brain. These include Neural Stem/Precursor cells, Radial Glia cells, Bergman Glia cells, Pyramidal cells, Tanycytes, Immature neurons, Interneurons, Trigeminal neurons, GABAergic neurons, and Glutamatergic neurons. GSEA of LTR7-linked regulatory targets identified significantly enriched sets of genes encoding markers of more than 80 specialized types of neurons and markers of 521 human brain regions, most prominently, subiculum and dentate gyrus amongst top significantly enriched records. These observations were validated and extended by identification and characterization of 1944 genes comprising high-fidelity down-steam regulatory targets of LTR7 and/or LTR5_Hs loci, which are markedly enriched for genes implicated in neoplasm metastasis, intellectual disability, autism, multiple cancer types, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and other brain disorders. Despite distinct evolutionary histories of retroviral LTRs, genes representing down-stream regulatory targets of LTR7 and LTR5_Hs elements exert the apparently cooperative and exceedingly broad phenotypic impacts on human physiology and pathology. Observations reported in this contribution highlight the need to accelerate the in-depth experimental and translational explorations of these important genomic determinants of Modern Humans health and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the TAFAZZIN gene result in the X-linked genetic disease Barth Syndrome. The protein product tafazzin is a transacylase enzyme that remodels the phospholipid cardiolipin with fatty acids. Some Barth syndrome boys exhibit a lean phenotype. In addition, whole body knockdown of tafazzin in mice protects them from diet-induced obesity through increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation and reduced basal insulin secretion. We thus hypothesized that tafazzin deficiency in both the liver and beta cells of the pancreas contribute to this lean phenotype. Through a Cre-Lox approach we generated control, liver-specific, pancreatic beta cell-specific and liver and pancreatic beta cell-specific double knockout male mice. The animals were fed a high fat diet for 8 weeks and body weight, liver weight and fat pad weights determined. Liver-specific or pancreatic beta cell-specific male tafazzin knockout mice accumulated weight gain ({asymp}40% increase in body weight) at the same rate as control animals. In contrast, the liver- and beta cell-specific double tafazzin knockout mice exhibited a reduced rate of weight gain by 8 weeks ({asymp}26% increase in body weight) compared to control or the single tafazzin knockout animals. In addition, at 8 weeks the double tafazzin knockout mice exhibited reduced weight gain in tissues known to accumulate fat including the liver, the gonadal, inguinal and perirenal white adipose tissues and the brown adipose tissue. Thus, liver- and pancreatic beta cell-specific double tafazzin knockout male mice are protected from high fat diet induced weight gain and fat accumulation. These results may partially explain why some Barth Syndrome boys exhibit a lean phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Relaxin-2 is a peptide hormone with important roles in human cardiovascular and reproductive biology. Its ability to activate cellular responses such as vasodilation, angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects have led to significant interest in using relaxin-2 as a therapeutic for heart failure and several fibrotic conditions. However, recombinant relaxin-2 has a very short serum half-life, limiting its clinical applications. Here we present protein engineering efforts targeting the relaxin-2 hormone in order to increase its serum half-life, while maintaining its ability to activate the G protein-coupled receptor RXFP1. To achieve this, we optimized a fusion between relaxin-2 and an antibody Fc fragment, generating a version of the hormone with a circulating half-life of up to five days in mice while retaining potent agonist activity at the RXFP1 receptor both in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascades play important roles in the regulation of eukaryotic defense against various pathogens. Activation of the extracellular ATP (eATP) receptor P2K1 triggers MAP kinase 3 and 6 (MPK3/6) phosphorylation, which leads to elevated defense responses in Arabidopsis. However, the mechanism by which P2K1 activates the MAPK cascade is unclear. In this study, we identified Raf-like MAPKKK ILK5 as a downstream substrate of the P2K1 kinase. P2K1 phosphorylates ILK5 on serine 192. The interaction between P2K1 and ILK5 was confirmed both in vitro and in planta and their interaction was enhanced by ATP treatment. Similar to P2K1 expression, ILK5 expression levels were highly induced by treatment with ATP, flg22, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, and various abiotic stresses, such as wounding. ILK5 interacts with both MKK4 and MKK5, but only MKK5 is phosphorylated by ILK5. Moreover, phosphorylation of MPK3/6 was significantly reduced upon ATP treatment in ilk5 mutant plants, relative to wild-type. The ilk5 mutant plants showed higher susceptibility to P. syringae pathogen infection relative to wild-type plants. Plants expressing only the mutant ILK5S192A protein, lacking kinase activity, did not activate the MAPK cascade upon ATP addition. Taken together, the results suggest that eATP activation of P2K1 results in transphosphorylation of the Raf-like MAPKKK ILK5, which subsequently triggers the MAPK cascade, culminating in activation of MAPK3 and 6 associated with an elevated innate immunity response.\n\nSignificance statementPathogens invasion and subsequent wound stress activates extracellular ATP-mediated purinergic signaling cascades, a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signal, which induces phosphorylation of MAPKs. Previous studies revealed that the P2K1 purinergic receptor increases MPK3/6 phosphorylation in response to eATP signaling cascades in Arabidopsis. However, the specific mechanism by which this occurs remains unknown. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of Raf-like MAPKKK ILK5 (Integrin-linked Kinase 5) as a downstream substrate of P2K1 kinase activity. Initiation of an eATP-dependent signaling pathway by phosphorylation of ILK5 with subsequent activation of MKK5, leading to activation of MPK3/6 and downstream events is crucial to the plant innate immunity response.",

In many crops, generation of knock-out mutants in host genes controlling susceptibility to DM, such as Downy Mildew Resistant 6 (DMR6) is a strategy of proven success to obtain resistant plants, while the effect of mutations in DMR6 genes has yet to be demonstrated in grapevine. In addition, small mutations in genes governing important traits can be obtained by gene-editing while maintaining the genetic background of commercially important clones. Moreover, very recent advances in the technology of gene-editing allowed to produce non-transgenic grapevine mutants, by regeneration of protoplasts previously edited with the CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This approach may revolutionize the production of new grapevine varieties and clones, but it requires knowledge on the targets, and an extensive evaluation of the impact of their mutation on plant phenotype and fitness. In this work we generated single and double knock-out mutants in DMR6 susceptibility (S) genes in multiple grapevine cultivars with improved resistance to DM.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) plays an outstanding role in psychiatric disorders. Still, gene expressional changes in its major component, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), have not been characterized. We used RNA-sequencing in postmortem DMPFC samples to investigate suicide victims compared to control subjects. Most of the data variance (79%) was associated with expression changes between suicide and control samples. 1400 genes differed using log2FC > {+/-} 1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 criteria between groups. Genes associated with depressive disorder, schizophrenia and impaired cognition were strongly overexpressed in top differentially expressed genes. Gene set enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that pathways related to cytokine receptor signaling were enriched in downregulated while glutamatergic synaptic signaling in upregulated genes in suicide individuals. A validated differentially expressed gene, which is known to be associated with mGluR5, was the N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding proteins 2 (NECAB2). In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry proved that NECAB2 is expressed in 2 different types of inhibitory neurons located in layers II-IV and VI, respectively. Our results imply extensive gene expressional alterations in the DMPFC related to suicidal behavior. Some of these genes may contribute to the altered mental state and behavior of suicide victims.",

We developed a novel therapeutic DNA vaccine construct involving fusion of the relMtb gene with the immature dendritic cell-targeting gene encoding chemokine MIP-3/CCL20. To augment mucosal immune responses, intranasal delivery was also evaluated. We found that the intramuscular MIP-3/relMtb (fusion) vaccine potentiates isoniazid activity more than a similar DNA vaccine expressing relMtb alone in a chronic TB mouse model (absolute reduction of Mtb burden: 0.63 log10 colony-forming units, P=0.0001), inducing pronounced Mtb-protective immune signatures. The intranasal fusion vaccine, an approach combining relMtb fusion to MIP-3 and intranasal delivery, demonstrated the greatest therapeutic effect compared to each approach alone, as evidenced by robust Th1 and Th17 responses systemically and locally and the greatest mycobactericidal activity when combined with isoniazid (absolute reduction of Mtb burden: 1.13 log10, P<0.0001, when compared to the intramuscular vaccine targeting relMtb alone). This DNA vaccination strategy may be a promising adjunctive approach combined with standard therapy to shorten curative TB treatment, and also serve as proof-of-concept for treating other chronic infections.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell driven autoimmune disease that attacks the myelin of the central nervous system and currently has no cure. MS etiology is linked to both the gut flora and external environmental factors but this connection is not well understood. One immune system regulator responsive to non-pathogenic external stimuli is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR, which binds diverse molecules present in the environment in barrier tissues, is a therapeutic target for MS. However, AHRs precise function in T lymphocytes, the orchestrators of MS, has not been described. Here we show that in a mouse model of MS, T cell specific Ahr knockout leads to recovery driven by a decrease in T cell fitness. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrate that the absence of AHR changes the gut microenvironment composition to generate metabolites that impact T cell viability, such as bile salts and short chain fatty acids. Our study demonstrates a newly emerging role for AHR in mediating the interdependence between T lymphocytes and the microbiota, while simultaneously identifying new potential molecular targets for the treatment of MS and other autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "With the advances in genomic sequencing, many organisms with novel biological properties are ripe for use as emerging model organisms. However, to make full use of them, transformation methods need to be developed to permit genome editing. Here, we present development of transformation for the fungus fly Sciara (Bradysia) coprophila; this may serve as a paradigm for development of transformation for other emerging systems, especially insects. Sciara has a variety of unique biological features including locus-specific developmentally-regulated DNA amplification; chromosome imprinting; a monopolar spindle in male meiosis I; non-disjunction of the X chromosome in male meiosis II; X chromosome elimination in early embryogenesis; germ line limited (L) chromosomes; high resistance to radiation. Mining the unique biology of Sciara requires a transformation system to test mutations of DNA sequences that may play roles for these features. We describe a Sciara transformation system using a modified piggyBac transformation vector and detailed protocols we have developed to accommodate Sciara-specific requirements. This advance will provide a platform for us and others in the growing Sciara community to take advantage of this unique biological system. In addition, the versatile piggyBac vectors described here and transformation methods will be useful for other emerging model systems.\n\nAuthor BiographiesSusan A.

    "abstract": "In shotgun metagenomics (SM), the state of the art bioinformatic workflows are referred to as high resolution shotgun metagenomics (HRSM) and require intensive computing and disk storage resources. While the increase in data output of the latest iteration of high throughput DNA sequencing systems can allow for unprecedented sequencing depth at a minimal cost, adjustments in HRSM workflows will be needed to properly process these ever-increasing sequence datasets. One potential adaptation is to generate so-called shallow SM datasets that contain fewer sequencing data per sample as compared to the more classic high coverage sequencing. While shallow sequencing is a promising avenue for SM data analysis, detailed benchmarks using real data are lacking. In this case study, we took four public SM datasets, one massive and the others moderate in size and subsampled each dataset at various levels to mimic shallow sequencing datasets of various sequencing depths. Our results suggest that shallow SM sequencing is a viable avenue to obtain sound results regarding microbial community structures and that high depth sequencing does not bring additional elements for ecological interpretation. More specifically, results obtained by subsampling as little as 0.5M sequencing clusters per sample were similar to the results obtained with the largest subsampled dataset for the human gut and agricultural soil datasets. For the Antarctic dataset, which contained only a few samples, 4M sequencing clusters per sample was found to generate comparable results to the full dataset. One area where ultra-deep sequencing and maximizing the usage of all data was undeniably beneficial was in the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).\n\nKey points- Three public multi-sample shotgun metagenomic NovaSeq datasets totalling 12,389,583 and 202 Gb, respectively were analyzed at various sequencing depths to evaluate the accuracy of shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing using a high resolution shotgun metagenomic bioinformatic workflow. A synthetic mock community of 20 bacterial genomes was also analyzed for validation purposes.\n- Datasets subsampled to low sequencing depths gave nearly identical ecological patterns (taxonomic and functional composition and beta-alpha-diversity) compared to high depth subsampled datasets.\n- Rare taxa and functions could be uncovered with high sequencing depth vs. low sequencing depth datasets, but did not affect global ecological patterns.\n- High sequencing depth was positively correlated with both quantity and quality of recovered metagenome-assembled genomes.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem engineers are organisms able to modify their environment by changing the distribution of materials and energy, with effects on biotic and abiotic ecosystem components. Several ecosystem engineers are known, but for most of them the mechanisms behind their influence are poorly known. We detail the role of bats as ecosystem engineers in iron ore caves in the Carajas National Forest, Brazilian Amazonia, an area with > 1,500 caves, some holding [~]150,000 bats. We analyzed the chemical composition of guano deposits in bat caves, radiocarbon-dated those deposits, and elucidated the chemical mechanisms involved and the role the bat guano has on structuring those caves. The insect-composed guano was rich in organic matter, with high concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide and ferric oxide, plus potassium oxide, calcium and sulfur trioxide. Radiocarbon dating indicated guano deposits between 22,000 and 1,800 years old. The guano pH was mainly acid (from 2.1 to 5.6). Percolating waters in those bat caves were also acid (pH reaching 1.5), with the presence of phosphate, iron, calcium, nitrate and sulfate. Acid solutions due to guano decomposition and possible microbial activity produced various forms of corrosion on the cave[s] floor and walls, resulting in their enlargement. Caves with active or inactive bat colonies had, on average, horizontal projections 4.5 times larger, areas 4.4 times larger, and volumes 5.0 times bigger than the reginal average, plus more abundant, diversified and bigger speleothems. In an example of bioengineering, the long-term presence of bats (> 22,000 years) and the guano deposits they produce, mediated by biological and chemical interactions along millennia, resulted in very unique ecological, evolutionary and geomorphological processes, whose working are just beginning to be better understood by science. However, the current expansion of mineral activities coupled with the loosening of licensing and cave protection rules is a real conservation threat to the bat caves in Carajas. The destruction of those caves would represent and unacceptable loss of both speleological and biological heritage and we urge that, whenever they occur, bat caves and their colonies must be fully protected and left off-limits of mineral extraction.",
