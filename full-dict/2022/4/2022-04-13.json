    "abstract": "In neocortical layer-5 pyramidal neurons, the action potential (AP) is generated in the axon initial segment (AIS) when the membrane potential (Vm) reaches the threshold for activation of two diverse voltage-gated Na+ channels, that differ in spatial distribution and biophysical properties. Yet, the understanding of specific functional differences between these two channels remains elusive. Here, using ultrafast Na+, Vm and Ca2+ imaging in combination with partial block of Nav1.2 by a recent peptide, we demonstrate an exclusive role of Nav1.2 in shaping the generating AP. Precisely, Ca2+ influx via Nav1.2 activates BK Ca2+-activated K+ channels determining the amplitude and the early phase of repolarisation of the AP in the AIS. We mimicked this result with a NEURON model where the role of the different ion channels tested reproduced the experimental evidence. The exclusive role of Nav1.2 reported here is important for understanding the physiology and pathology of neuronal excitability.",

    "abstract": "The Reln gene encodes for the extracellular glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates several brain functions from development to adulthood, including neuronal migration, dendritic growth and branching, and synapse formation and plasticity. Human studies have implicated Reelin signaling in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Mouse studies using the heterozygous Reeler (HR) mice have shown that reduced levels of Reln expression are associated with deficits in learning and memory and increased disinhibition. Although these traits are relevant to substance use disorders, the role of Reelin in cellular and behavioral responses to addictive drugs remains largely unknown. Here, we compared HR mice to wild-type (WT) littermate controls to investigate the contribution of Reelin signaling to the hyper-locomotor and rewarding effects of cocaine. After a single cocaine injection, HR mice showed enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity compared to WT controls. After repeated injections of cocaine, Reelin deficiency also led to increased cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, which persisted after withdrawal. In contrast, Reelin deficiency did not affect the rewarding effects of cocaine measured in the conditioned place preference assay. The elevated cocaine-induced hyper-locomotion in HR mice resulted in increased Fos expression in the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) compared to WT. Lastly, we found that Reln was highly co-expressed with the Drd1 gene, which encodes for the dopamine receptor D1, in the DMS.\n\nThese findings demonstrated that Reelin signaling contributes to the locomotory effects of cocaine and improved our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cellular and behavioral effects of cocaine.",

    "abstract": "As we learn, dynamic memory processes build structured knowledge across our experiences. Such knowledge enables the formation of internal models of the world that we use to plan, make decisions, and act. Recent theorizing posits that mnemonic mechanisms of differentiation and integration - which at one level may seem to be at odds - both contribute to the emergence of structured knowledge. We tested this possibility using fMRI as human participants learned to navigate within local and global virtual environments over the course of three days. Pattern similarity analyses on entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex patterns revealed evidence that differentiation and integration work concurrently to build local and global environmental representations, and that variability in integration relates to differences in navigation efficiency. These results offer new insights into the neural machinery and the underlying mechanisms that translate experiences into structured knowledge that allows us to navigate to achieve goals.",

    "abstract": "In vitro transcribed synthetic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) represent a novel therapeutic modality and are currently being evaluated for a wide range of clinical indications. To overcome the inherent immunogenicity of the synthetic mRNAs, as well as to increase the therapeutic efficacy of the molecules, RNA sequence optimization is routinely performed and modified uridine analogs--such as pseudouridine ({Psi}) and N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1{Psi}), are incorporated in the synthetic mRNA. To decipher the fidelity with which these modifications are incorporated during the in vitro transcription (IVT) process, here, we compared, the incorporation fidelity of uridine, {Psi}, or m1{Psi} in multiple RNA sequences with different single-subunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (ssRNAPs). By comparing the incorporation of each modified base to that of the unmodified equivalent, we demonstrate that m1{Psi} is incorporated with higher fidelity than {Psi}. Furthermore, the various ssRNAPs exhibit different error rates; however, the spectrum of mutations observed between the RNAPs is similar. We also show that the array of nucleotide misincorporation is not dependent on the template DNA sequence context and that the distribution of these misincorporated nucleotides is not localized to any specific region along the length of the RNA. Based on our findings, we introduce a novel protocol to improve uridine analog incorporation--without affecting total RNA yield--during IVT. Our proof-of-concept experiments and protocol for higher-fidelity incorporation of uridine analogs during IVT provide guidelines when choosing ssRNAPs for the generation of modified uridine--containing mRNAs in vitro.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus is the hallmark of eukaryotic life and transport to and from the nucleus occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). There is a multitude of data connecting the nuclear transport machinery - i.e. the NPCs and associated nuclear transport factors - to neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we systematically studied how the expression of polyPR and polyGA related to C9Orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis impacts the nuclear transport machinery. We measured the abundance and localization of NPC components and transport factors, and assessed the kinetics of import and export by four transport receptors. PolyPR and polyGA cause distinct, and transport receptor dependent effects. We compared the specific changes in transport to those obtained when cells were exposed to different stress situations or mutations. This comparison showed similar patterns of transport defects in cells lacking specific NTRs and cells expressing polyPR. In contrast, polyGA expressing cells bear resemblance to stress conditions where energy maintenance is decreased. The similarity of the patterns of transport deficiencies suggests that polyPR has a direct effect on nuclear transport via NTRs, while polyGA impacts the energy state of the cell and subsequently changes transport.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring autophagic flux is necessary for most autophagy studies. The autophagic flux assays currently available for mammalian cells are generally complicated and do not yield highly quantitative results. Yeast autophagic flux is routinely monitored with the GFP-based processing assay, whereby the amount of GFP proteolytically released from GFP-containing reporters (e.g., GFP-Atg8), detected by immunoblotting, reflects autophagic flux. However, this simple and effective assay is typically inapplicable to mammalian cells because GFP is efficiently degraded in lysosomes while the more proteolytically resistant RFP accumulates in lysosomes under basal conditions. Here, we report a HaloTag (Halo)-based reporter processing assay to monitor mammalian autophagic flux. We found that Halo is sensitive to lysosomal proteolysis but becomes resistant upon ligand binding. When delivered into lysosomes by autophagy, pulse-labeled Halo-based reporters (e.g., Halo-LC3 and Halo-GFP) are proteolytically processed to generate Haloligand when delivered into lysosomes by autophagy. Hence, the amount of free Haloligand detected by immunoblotting or in-gel fluorescence imaging reflects autophagic flux. We demonstrate the applications of this assay by monitoring the autophagy pathways, macroautophagy, selective autophagy, and even bulk nonselective autophagy. With the Halo-based processing assay, mammalian autophagic flux and lysosome-mediated degradation can be monitored easily and precisely.",

    "abstract": "We have carried out a systems-level analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of cell cycle regulators in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In a comprehensive single cell analysis we have precisely quantified the levels of 38 proteins previously identified as regulators of the G2 to mitosis transition, and of 7 proteins acting at the G1 to S-phase transition. Only two of the 38 mitotic regulators exhibit changes in concentration at the whole cell level, the mitotic B-type cyclin Cdc13 which accumulates continually throughout the cell cycle, and the regulatory phosphatase Cdc25 which exhibits a complex cell cycle pattern. Both proteins show similar patterns of change within the nucleus as in the whole cell but at higher concentrations. In addition, the concentrations of the major fission yeast cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) Cdc2, the CDK regulator Suc1 and the inhibitory kinase Wee1 also increase in the nucleus peaking at mitotic onset but are constant in the whole cell. The significant increase in concentration with size for Cdc13 supports the model that mitotic B-type cyclin accumulation acts as a cell size sensor. We propose a two-step process for the control of mitosis. First, Cdc13 accumulates in a size-dependent manner which drives increasing CDK activity. Second, from mid G2 the increasing nuclear accumulation of Cdc25 and the counteracting Wee1 introduces a bistability switch that results in a rapid rise of CDK activity at the end of G2 and thus brings about an orderly progression into mitosis.\n\nSignificance StatementAcross eukaryotes the increasing level of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activity drives progression through the cell cycle. As most cells divide at specific sizes, information responding to the size of the cell must feed into the regulation of CDK activity. In this study, we use fission yeast to precisely measure how proteins that have been previously identified in genome wide screens as cell cycle regulators change in their levels with cell cycle progression. We identify the mitotic B-type cyclin Cdc13 and mitotic inhibitory phosphatase Cdc25 as the only two proteins that change in both whole cell and nuclear concentration through the cell cycle, making them candidates for universal cell size sensors at the onset of mitosis and cell division.",

    "abstract": "An ageing global population brings with it a significant burden of age-related morbidities. Recently, a novel intervention strategy to mitigate this burden has emerged, involving the use of Extracellular Vesicles (EV), comprising use of Microvesicles (MV) and Exosomes (Exo). These membranous vesicles are secreted by cells and mediate repair of cellular and tissue damage via paracrine mechanisms, involving interaction of their bioactive cargoes with stem cells. The actions of EV under normative and morbid conditions in the context of ageing remains largely unexplored. We now show that MV, but not Exo, from Pathfinder cells (PC), a putative stem cell regulatory cell type, enhance the repair of Human Dermal Fibroblast (HDF) and Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) co-cultures following both mechanical and genotoxic stress. Critically, this effect was found to be both cellular age and stress-specific. Notably, MV treatment was unable to repair mechanical injury in older co-cultures, but still remained therapeutic following genotoxic stress. These observations were further confirmed in HDF and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell (VSMC) co-cultures of increasing cellular age. In a model of comorbidity, comprising co-cultures of HDF and highly senescent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) VSMC, MV administration appeared to be senolytic following both mechanical and genotoxic stress, prior to enabling regeneration. To our knowledge, this is the first description of EV-based senolysis. It provides novel insight into understanding the biology of EV and the specific roles they play during tissue repair and ageing. These data will potentiate development of novel cell-free therapeutic interventions capable of attenuating age-associated morbidities and avoiding undesired effects. Ultimately, this might act as a possible intervention strategy to extend human healthspan.",

Dynein connects to chromosome telomeres via KASH5 and SUN1 or SUN2, which together span the nuclear envelope.

KASH5 interacts with either dynein light intermediate chain (DYNC1LI1 or DYNC1LI2) via a conserved helix in the LIC C-terminal, and this region is also needed for dyneins recruitment to other cellular membranes. KASH5s N-terminal EF-hands are essential, as the interaction with dynein is disrupted by mutation of key calcium-binding residues, although it is not regulated by cellular calcium levels. Dynein can be recruited to KASH5 at the nuclear envelope independently of dynactin, while LIS1 is essential for dynactin incorporation into the KASH5-dynein complex. Altogether, we show that the trans-membrane protein KASH5 is an activating adaptor for dynein, and shed light on the hierarchy of assembly of KASH5-dynein-dynactin complexes.",

Multiple depletion lasers may introduce misalignment and bleaching. Hence, a single depletion wavelength is preferable for multi-color analyses. However, this limits the number of usable spectral channels. Using cultured cells, common staining protocols, and commercially available fluorochromes and microscopes we exploit that the number of fluorochromes in STED or confocal microscopy can be increased by phasor based fluorescence lifetime separation of two dyes with similar emission spectra but different fluorescent lifetimes. In our multi-color FLIM-STED approach two fluorochromes in the near red (exc. 594 nm, em. 600-630) and two in the far red channel (633/641-680), supplemented by a single further redshifted fluorochrome (670/701-750) were depleted with 775 nm. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first published five color STED images. Generally, this approach doubles the number of fully distinguishable colors in laser scanning microscopy. We provide evidence that eight color FLIM-STED with a single depletion laser would be possible if suitable fluorochromes were identified and we confirm that a fluorochrome may have different lifetimes depending on the molecules to which it is coupled.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the testis-specific SUN domain protein Sun4 is a vital player in spermatogenesis, critically involved in the directed shaping of the spermatid nucleus. Its molecular properties relating to this crucial function, however, have remained largely unknown. Previous studies presented quite controversial data for the general organization and orientation of Sun4 within the spermatid nuclear envelope. In the present study, we have re-evaluated this issue in detail and present new robust data on the Sun4 topology and its interactions at the nucleo-cytoplasmic junction. We identified Sun4 as an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, sharing a classical SUN domain protein topology. Similar to other SUN domain proteins, the C-terminal SUN domain of Sun4 locates to the perinuclear space and the N-terminus is directed to the nucleoplasm, where it interacts with the spermiogenesis specific Lamin B3. We found that Sun4 in its natural environment forms heteromeric assemblies with Sun3 and, beyond this, it is crucially involved in the regulation of Sun3 expression. Together, our results contribute to a better understanding of the specific function of Sun4 at the spermatid nucleo-cytoplasmic junction and the entire process of sperm-head formation.\n\nSummary statementIn our current study, we have analyzed in detail the biochemical and dynamic properties of the testis-specific SUN domain protein Sun4 and we provide novel insights into its interaction behavior at the spermatid nucleo-cytoplasmic junction.",

    "abstract": "Dinoflagellates from the family Symbiodiniaceae are phototrophic marine protists that engage in symbiosis with diverse hosts. Their large and distinct genomes show pervasive gene duplication and large-scale retroposition events. However, little is known about the role and scale of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the genomic evolution of this algal family. In other dinoflagellates, higher levels of HGTs have been observed, linked to major genomic transitions, such as the appearance of a viral acquired nucleoprotein that originated via HGT from a large DNA algal virus. Previous work showed Symbiodiniaceae from different hosts being actively infected by several viral groups, such as giant DNA viruses and ssRNA viruses, that may play an important role in coral health. This includes a hypothetical latent viral infection, whereby viruses could persist in the cytoplasm or integrate into the host genome as a provirus. This hypothesis received some experimental support however, the cellular localization of putative latent viruses and their taxonomic affiliation are still unknown. In addition, despite the finding of viral sequences in some genomes of Symbiodiniaceae, viral origin, taxonomic breadth, and metabolic potential have not been explored. To address these questions, we searched for evidence of protein sequences of putative viral origin in 13 Symbiodiniaceae genomes. We found 59 candidate viral-derived HGTs that give rise to 12 phylogenies across 10 genomes. We also describe the taxonomic affiliation of these virus-related sequences, their structure, and genomic context.

    "abstract": "Trait inference from mixed-species assemblages is a central problem in microbial ecology. Frequently, sequencing information from an environment is available, but phenotypic measurements from individual community members are not. With the increasing availability of molecular data for microbial communities, bioinformatic approaches that map metagenome to (meta)phenotype are needed. Recently, we developed a tool, gRodon, that enables the prediction of the maximum growth rate of an organism from genomic data on the basis of codon usage patterns. Our work and that of other groups suggests that such predictors can be applied to mixed-species communities in order to derive estimates of the average community-wide maximum growth rate. Here, we present an improved maximum growth rate predictor designed for metagenomes that corrects a persistent GC bias in the original gRodon model for metagenomic prediction. We benchmark this predictor with simulated metagenomic datasets to show that it has superior performance on mixed-species communities relative to earlier models. We go on to provide guidance on data pre-processing, and show that calling genes from assembled contigs rather than directly from reads dramatically improves performance. Finally, we apply our predictor to large-scale metagenomic datasets from marine and human microbiomes to illustrate how community-wide growth prediction can be a powerful approach for hypothesis-generation. Altogether, we provide an updated tool with clear guidelines for users about the uses and pitfalls of metagenomic prediction of the average community-wide maximal growth rate.",

    "abstract": "Non-native conformations drive protein misfolding diseases, complicate bioengineering efforts, and fuel molecular evolution. No current experimental technique is well-suited for elucidating them and their phenotypic effects. Especially intractable are the transient conformations populated by intrinsically disordered proteins. We describe an approach to systematically discover, stabilize, and purify native and non-native conformations, generated in vitro or in vivo, and directly link conformations to molecular, organismal, or evolutionary phenotypes. This approach involves high-throughput disulfide scanning (HTDS) of the entire protein. To reveal which disulfides trap which chromatographically resolvable conformers, we devised a deep-sequencing method for double-Cys variant libraries of proteins that precisely and simultaneously locates both Cys residues within each polypeptide. HTDS of the abundant E. coli periplasmic chaperone HdeA revealed distinct classes of disordered hydrophobic conformers with variable cytotoxicity depending on where the backbone was cross-linked. HTDS can bridge conformational and phenotypic landscapes for many proteins that function in disulfide-permissive environments.",

    "abstract": "Viruses utilize a plethora of strategies to manipulate the host pathways and hijack its machineries for efficient replication. Several DNA as well as handful of RNA viruses are reported to interact with proteins involved in DNA damage responses (DDR). As the DDR pathways have never been explored in Alphaviruses, this investigation intended to determine the importance of the DDR pathways in CHIKV infection through in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo models. The study reveals that CHIKV infection activates the Chk2 and Chk1 proteins associated with DDR signaling pathways and increases DNA damage by 95%. Inhibition of both ATM-ATR kinases by ATM/ATR kinase inhibitor (AAKi) shows drastic reduction in viral particle formation in vitro. Next, the treatment of mice with this drug has been shown to reduce the disease score substantially in CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice with 71% decrement in the viral copy and the same has been established in hPBMC-derived monocyte-macrophage populations. Additionally, gene silencing of Chk2 and Chk1 reduces viral progeny formation around 73.7% and 78% respectively. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that CHIKV-nsP2 interacts with Chk2 and Chk1 during CHIKV infection and docking analysis depicts the specific amino acids responsible for these interactions. Further, the data suggests that CHIKV infection induces cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 phases.\n\nIn conclusion, this work demonstrated for the first time the mechanistic insight of the induction of DDR pathways by CHIKV that might contribute to the designing of effective therapeutics for the control of this virus infection in future.\n\nIMPORTANCEViruses being intra-cellular parasite, need several host cell machineries so as to achieve effective replication of their own genome, along with virus-encoded enzymes. One of the strategies is to hijack the DDR pathways. Several DNA as well as handful of RNA viruses interact with the cellular proteins involved in DDR pathways, however, reports with respect to the association of Chk2 and Chk1 in alphavirus infection are scanty. Hence, this study is amongst the first to report that modulation of DDR pathways is crucial for effective CHIKV infection. This work also shows that there is interaction of CHIKV-nsP2 with two crucial host factors, Chk2 and Chk1 for efficient viral infection. Interestingly, CHIKV infection was found to cause DNA damage and arrest cell cycle in G1 and G2 phases to facilitate viral infection. This information might facilitate to develop effective therapeutics for the control of the CHIKV infection in future.",

Crystal structure analysis of one representative nanobody, 3-2A2-4, revealed a highly conserved epitope between the cryptic and the outer face of the receptor binding domain (RBD). The epitope is readily accessible regardless of RBD in \"up\" or \"down\" conformation and distinctive from the receptor ACE2 binding site.

Receptor binding studies reveal that the Omicron BA.2 spike trimer have 11-fold and 2-fold higher potency to human ACE2 than the spike trimer from the wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.1 strains. The structure of the BA.2 spike trimer complexed with human ACE2 reveals that all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in the spike trimer are in open conformation, ready for ACE2 binding, thus providing a basis for the increased infectivity of the BA.2 strain. JMB2002, a therapeutic antibody that was shown to have efficient inhibition of Omicron BA.1, also shows potent neutralization activities against Omicron BA.2. In addition, both BA.1 and BA.2 spike trimers are able to bind to mouse ACE2 with high potency. In contrast, the WT spike trimer binds well to cat ACE2 but not to mouse ACE2. The structures of both BA.1 and BA.2 spike trimer bound to mouse ACE2 reveal the basis for their high affinity interactions. Together, these results suggest a possible evolution pathway for Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants from human-cat-mouse-human circle, which could have important implications in establishing an effective strategy in combating viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Long COVID, a type of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC), has been associated with sustained elevated levels of immune activation and inflammation. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms that drive this inflammation remain unknown. Inflammation during acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be exacerbated by microbial translocation (from the gut and/or lung) to the blood. Whether microbial translocation contributes to inflammation during PASC is unknown. We found higher levels of fungal translocation - measured as {beta}-glucan, a fungal cell wall polysaccharide - in the plasma of individuals experiencing PASC compared to those without PASC or SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. The higher {beta}-glucan correlated with higher levels of markers of inflammation and elevated levels of host metabolites involved in activating N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (such as metabolites within the tryptophan catabolism pathway) with established neuro-toxic properties. Mechanistically, {beta}-glucan can directly induce inflammation by binding to myeloid cells (via the Dectin-1 receptor) and activating Syk/NF-{kappa}B signaling. Using an in vitro Dectin-1/NF-{kappa}B reporter model, we found that plasma from individuals experiencing PASC induced higher NF-{kappa}B signaling compared to plasma from SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. This higher NF-{kappa}B signaling was abrogated by the Syk inhibitor Piceatannol. These data suggest a potential targetable mechanism linking fungal translocation and inflammation during PASC.",

In this study, we have detected the presence of this new variant in domestic animals such as dogs and cats living with owners with COVID19 in Spain that have been sampled at the most optimal time for the detection of the disease. None of the RT-qPCR positive animals (10.13%) presented any clinical signs and the viral loads detected were very low. In addition, the shedding of viral RNA lasted a short period of time in the positive animals. Infection with the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) was confirmed by a specific RT-qPCR for the detection of this variant and by sequencing.

Hence, Btk and its toxins are used worldwide as microbial insecticide and in genetically modified crops, respectively, to fight crop pests. However, Btk belongs to the B. cereus group, some strains of which are well known human opportunistic pathogens. Therefore, ingestion of Btk along with food may threaten organisms not susceptible to Btk infection. Here we show that Cry1A toxins induce enterocyte death and intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation in the midgut of Drosophila melanogaster, an organism non-susceptible to Btk. Surprisingly, a high proportion of the ISC daughter cells differentiate into enteroendocrine cells instead of their initial enterocyte destiny. We show that Cry1A toxins weaken the Cadherin-dependent adherens junction between the ISC and its immediate daughter progenitor, leading the latter to adopt an enteroendocrine fate. Hence, though not lethal to non-susceptible organisms, Cry toxins can interfere with conserved cell adhesion mechanisms, thereby disrupting intestinal homeostasis and enteroendocrine functions.",

    "abstract": "N-linked glycosylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of proteins. While it plays an important role in the biological function of proteins, it often poses a major challenge for their analytical characterization. Currently available peptide N-glycanases (PNGases) are often inefficient at deglycosylating proteins due to sterically inaccessible N-glycosylation sites. This usually leads to poor sequence coverage in bottom-up analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and makes it impossible to obtain an intact mass signal in top-down MS analysis. In addition, most PNGases operate optimally only in the neutral to slightly acidic pH range and are severely compromised in the presence of reducing and denaturing substances, which limits their use for advanced bioanalysis based on hydrogen-deuterium exchange in combination with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).\n\nHere, we present a novel peptide N-glycanase from Rudaea cellulosilytica (PNGase Rc) for which we demonstrate broad substrate specificity for N-glycan hydrolysis from multiply occupied and natively folded proteins. Our results show that PNGase Rc is functional even under challenging, HDX quench conditions (pH 2.5, 0 {degrees}C) and in the presence of 0.4 M Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 4 M urea and 1 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl).

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are essential components for the formation of membraneless organelles, which play key functional and regulatory roles within biological systems. These complex assemblies form and dissolve spontaneously over time via liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs. Mutations in their amino acid sequence can alter their phase behavior, which has been linked to the emergence of severe diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this work, we study the conformation and phase behavior of a low-complexity domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), using coarse-grained implicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We systematically analyze how these properties are affected by the number of aromatic residues within the examined sequences. We find a significant compaction of the chains and an increase in the critical temperature with increasing number of aromatic residues within the IDPs. Comparing single-chain and condensed state simulations, we find much more collapsed polymer conformations in the dilute systems, even at temperatures well above the estimated{theta} -temperature of the solution. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that aromatic residues play a dominant role for condensation, which is further corroborated by a detailed analysis of the intermolecular contacts, and conversely that important properties of condensates are captured in coarse-grained simulations. Interestingly, we observe density inhomogeneities within the condensates near criticality, which are driven by electrostatic interactions. Finally, we find that the relatively small fraction of hydrophobic residues in the IDPs results in interfacial tensions which are significantly lower compared to typical combinations of immiscible simple liquids.",

    "abstract": "The Amino Acid-Polyamine-Organocation transporter GadC contributes to the survival of pathogenic bacteria under extreme acid stress by exchanging extracellular glutamate for intracellular GABA. Its structure, determined exclusively in an inward-facing conformation at alkaline pH, consists of the canonical LeuT-fold of a conserved five-helix inverted repeat, thereby resembling functionally divergent transporters such as the serotonin reuptake transporter SERT and the glucose-sodium symporter transporter SGLT1. However, despite this structural similarity, it is unclear if the conformational dynamics of antiporters such as GadC follows the blueprint of these or other well-studied LeuT-fold transporters. Here, we used double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to monitor the conformational dynamics of GadC in lipid bilayers in response to acidification and substrate binding. To guide experimental design and facilitate the interpretation of the DEER data, we generated an ensemble of structural models in multiple conformations using a recently introduced AlphaFold2 methodology. Our experimental results reveal acid-induced conformational changes that dislodge the C-terminus from the permeation pathway coupled with rearrangement of helices that enable isomerization between both inward- and outward-facing states. The substrate glutamate, but not GABA, modulates the dynamics of an extracellular thin gate without shifting the equilibrium between inward- and outward-facing conformations. In addition to introducing an integrated methodology for probing transporter conformational dynamics, the congruence of the DEER data with patterns of structural rearrangements deduced from ensembles of AlphaFold2 models illuminate the conformational cycle of GadC underpinning transport and exposes yet another example of the divergence between the dynamics of different functional families in the LeuT-fold.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe transporter GadC contributes to acid resistance in bacterial pathogens by exchanging two substrates, glutamate and GABA, using a mechanism termed alternating access. In this study, the conformational dynamics underlying alternating access was studied using a combination of spectroscopy and computational modeling. A conformationally diverse ensemble of models, generated using AlphaFold2, guided the design and interpretation of double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy experiments. We found that whereas GadC was inactive and conformationally homogeneous at neutral pH, low pH induced isomerization between two conformations. From our integrated computational/experimental investigation emerges a transport model that may be relevant to eukaryotic homologs that are involved in other cellular processes.",

We examined the relative effect of migration, genetic drift, natural selection and human activities on the genetic repertoire of Agave angustifolia var. pacifica, an agave used for bacanora (an alcoholic spirit similar to tequila) production in northwestern Mexico. We sampled 34 wild and cultivated sites and used over eleven thousand genome-wide SNPs. We found shallow genetic structure among wild samples, although, detected differentiation between coastal and inland sites. Surprisingly, no differentiation was found between cultivated and wild populations. Moreover, we detected moderate inbreeding (FIS [~] 0.13) and similar levels of genomic diversity in wild and cultivated agaves. Nevertheless, the cultivated plants had almost no private alleles and presented evidence of clonality. The overall low genetic structure in A. angustifolia var. pacifica is apparently the result of high dispersibility promoted by pollinators and possibility of clonal reproduction. Incipient cultivation history and reliance on wild seeds and plants are probably responsible for the observed patterns of high genetic connectivity and considerable diversity in cultivated samples.",

    "abstract": "The proneural transcription factor Achaete-scute complex-like 1 (Ascl1) is a major regulator of neural progenitor fate, implicated both in neurogenesis and oligodendrogliogenesis. Ascl1 has been widely used to reprogram non-neuronal cells into induced neurons. In vitro, Ascl1 induces efficient reprogramming of proliferative astroglia from the early postnatal cerebral cortex into interneuron-like cells. Here, we examined whether Ascl1 can similarly induce neuronal reprogramming of glia undergoing proliferation in the postnatal mouse cerebral cortex in vivo. Toward this, we targeted cortical glia at the peak of proliferative expansion (i.e., postnatal day 5) by injecting a retrovirus encoding for Ascl1 into the mouse cerebral cortex. In sharp contrast to the very efficient reprogramming in vitro, Ascl1-transduced glial cells were converted into doublecortin-immunoreactive neurons only with low efficiency in vivo. Interfering with the phosphorylation of Ascl1 by mutation of six conserved proline-directed serine/threonine phosphorylation sites (Ascl1SA6) has been previously shown to increase its neurogenic activity in the early embryonic cerebral cortex. We therefore tested whether transduction of proliferative glia with a retrovirus encoding Ascl1SA6 improved their conversion into neurons. While in vitro glia-to-neuron conversion was markedly enhanced, in vivo reprogramming efficiency remained low. However, both wild-type and mutant Ascl1 reduced the relative number of cells expressing the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and increased the relative number of cells expressing the oligodendroglial marker Sox10 in vivo. Together, our results indicate that the enhanced neurogenic response of proliferative postnatal glia to Ascl1SA6 versus Ascl1 observed in vitro is not recapitulated in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is upregulated in IL-4-stimulated (alternatively activated) macrophages (M(IL-4)). We examined the effect of loss of function of the enzyme Cpt1a, which facilitates the entry of long chain fatty acids (FA) into mitochondria for FAO, on alternative activation. Expression of M(IL-4) markers ARG1, CD301 and RELM, was impaired in tamoxifen-treated ERT2Cre x Cpt1afl/fl macrophages and in macrophages expressing shRNA targeting Cpt1a (Cpt1a-shRNA). In contrast, VaviCre x Cpt1afl/fl and LysmCre x Cpt1afl/fl M(IL-4) responded normally to IL-4. Reduced alternative activation due to Cpt1a loss of function was linked to decreased cellular pools of -ketoglutarate, glutamate, and glutathione, diminished commitment of glucose carbon to serine/glycine synthesis, and decreased expression of genes in the Nrf2-oxidative stress response pathway. Consistent with this, reactive oxygen species were increased. Restoration of glutathione pools with N-acetyl cysteine normalized oxidative stress and allowed alternative activation in the face of Cpt1a-deficiency, pointing to a role for FAO in the control of ROS and as being important for alternative activation. In VaviCre x Cpt1afl/fl M(IL-4), glutamine uptake was increased, compensating for the loss of FAO to meet necessary metabolic demands, to allow alternative activation. The data indicate that macrophages are able to regulate glutamine metabolism to compensate for chronic disruption of FAO to meet metabolic needs.",

    "abstract": "Due to the costly energy demands of N2 fixation, diazotrophic bacteria have evolved complex regulatory networks that permit expression of the N2-fixing catalyst nitrogenase only under conditions of N starvation, whereas the same condition stimulates upregulation of high-affinity NH3 assimilation by glutamine synthetase (GS), preventing excess release of excess NH3 for plants. Diazotrophic bacteria can be engineered to excrete NH3 by interference with GS, however control is required to minimise growth penalties and prevent unintended provision of NH3 to non-target plants. Here, we attempted two strategies to control GS regulation and NH3 excretion in our model cereal symbiont Azorhizobium caulinodans AcLP, a derivative of ORS571. We first attempted to recapitulate previous work where mutation of both PII homologues glnB and glnK stimulated GS shutdown but found that one of these genes was essential for growth. Secondly, we expressed unidirectional adenylyltransferases (uATs) in a {Delta}glnE mutant of AcLP which permitted strong GS shutdown and excretion of NH3 derived from N2 fixation and completely alleviated negative feedback regulation on nitrogenase expression. We placed a uAT allele under control of the NifA-dependent promoter PnifH, permitting GS shutdown and NH3 excretion specifically under microaerobic conditions, the same cue that initiates N2 fixation, then deleted nifA and transferred a rhizopine-inducible nifAL94Q/D95Q-rpoN controller plasmid into this strain, permitting coupled rhizopine-dependent activation of N2 fixation with NH3 excretion. In future, this highly sophisticated and multi-layered control circuitry could be used to activate N2 fixation and NH3 excretion specifically by AcLP colonising transgenic rhizopine producing cereals, targeting delivery of fixed N to the crop, and preventing interaction with non-target plants.\n\nAuthor SummaryInoculation of cereal crops with associative \"diazotrophic\" bacteria that convert atmospheric N2 to NH3 could be used to sustainably improve delivery of nitrogen in agriculture. However, due to the costly energy demands of N2 fixation, natural diazotrophic bacteria have evolved to conserve energy by preventing excess production of NH3 and release to the plants. Diazotrophs can be engineered for excess NH3 production and release, however genetic control is required to minimise growth penalties and prevent unintended provision of NH3 to non-target weed species. Here, we engineer control of N2 fixation and NH3 excretion in response to the signalling molecule rhizopine which is produced by transgenic barley. This control could be used to establish plant host-specific activation of N2 fixation and NH3 release following root colonisation in the field, minimising bacterial energy requirements in the bulk soil and preventing provision of NH3 to non-target plants.",

This revealed an unexpected level of structural and architectural diversity so far not observed in other organisms. Microtubules in migrating mosquito forms consist of 13 protofilaments reinforced by interrupted luminal helices. Conversely, gametocyte microtubules consist of 13 to 18 protofilaments with doublets, triplets and quadruplets of varying arrangements. We show the microtubule cytoskeleton within the native cellular context, highlighting structurally diverse apical rings which act as microtubule organising centres.

    "abstract": "Heavy metals (HMs) are known to modify bacterial communities both in the laboratory and in situ. As a consequence, soils in HM contaminated sites like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites are predicted to have altered ecosystem functioning, with potential ramifications for the health of organisms, including humans, that live nearby. Further, several studies have shown that metal tolerant bacteria are often also resistant to antimicrobial agents (AMR), and therefore HM contaminated soils could potentially act as reservoirs that could disseminate AMR genes into human-associated pathogenic bacteria. To explore this possibility soil samples were collected from six public locations in the zip code 35207 (the home of the North Birmingham 35th Avenue Superfund site) and in six public areas in a neighboring reference zip code (35214). Sequencing of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that elevated concentrations of HMs As, Mn, Pb, and Zn reduced microbial diversity and altered community structure within each zip code. While there was no difference between zip codes in the proportion of total culturable microbes that survived antimicrobial or metal exposure, bacterial isolates with HMR almost always also exhibited AMR. Metagenomes inferred using PICRUST2 also predicted significantly higher mean relative frequencies in 35207 for several AMR genes related to both specific and broad-spectrum AMR phenotypes. Together, these results support the hypothesis that chronic HM pollution alters soil bacterial community structure in ecologically meaningful ways and may also select for bacteria with increased potential to contribute to AMR in human bacterial disease.",

    "abstract": "Phages are key drivers of genomic diversity in bacterial populations as they impose strong selective pressure on the evolution of bacterial defense mechanisms across closely related strains. The pan-immunity model suggests that such diversity is maintained because the effective immune system of a bacterial species is the one distributed across all strains present in the community. However, only few studies have analyzed the distribution of bacterial defense systems at the community-level, mostly focusing on CRISPR and comparing samples from complex environments. Here, we studied 2778 bacterial genomes and 158 metagenomes from cheese-associated communities, which are dominated by a few bacterial taxa and occur in relatively stable environments. We find that nearly identical strains of cheese-associated bacteria contain diverse and highly variable arsenals of innate and adaptive (i.e CRISPR-Cas) immunity suggesting rapid turnover of defense mechanisms in these communities. CRISPR spacer abundance correlated with the abundance of matching target sequences across the metagenomes providing evidence that the identified defense repertoires are functional and under selection. While these characteristics align with the pan-immunity model, the detected CRISPR spacers only covered a subset of the phages previously identified in cheese, suggesting that CRISPR does not provide complete immunity against all phages, and that the innate immune mechanisms may have complementary roles. Our findings show that the evolution of bacterial defense mechanisms is a highly dynamic process and highlight that experimentally tractable, low complexity communities such as those found in cheese, can help to understand ecological and molecular processes underlying phage-defense system relationships.\n\nImportanceBacteria are constantly exposed to phage predation and hence harbor highly diverse defense arsenals. According to the pan-immunity hypothesis the effective immune system of a bacterial species is not the one encoded in a single genome but in the entire community. However, few studies have investigated how defense systems are distributed within communities. Here, we carried out (meta)genomic analyses of bacterial communities used in cheesemaking. These are tractable communities of biotechnological interest which house few bacterial species and are exposed to high phage pressure. In line with the pan-immunity hypothesis, we find that nearly identical strains of cheese-associated bacteria contain highly variable arsenals of innate and adaptive immunity. We provide evidence for the functional importance of this diversity, and reveal that CRISPR alone does not provide complete immunity against all phages. Our findings can have implications for the design of robust synthetic communities used in biotechnology and the food industry.",

    "abstract": "Targeted genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) is critical for basic and translational research, and can be achieved with site-specific endonucleases. Class 2 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cpf1 represents a class of RNA programmable DNA endonucleases with features that could be complementary to the widely used Class 1 CRISPR-Cas9 system. Here we engineered a single vector system to deliver both Cpf1 and guide RNA, and achieved efficient knockin in transformed human cells. We then adopted the system to function in hPSCs by increasing expression levels of Cpf1, and showed that Cpf1 efficiently mediate homology directed repair in multiple loci (including knockin of a 6 kb cassette at the INS) in multiple hPSC lines, resulting in clones with transgenic cassettes integrated only at the targeted loci in the genome. Furthermore, with delivery of Cpf1 and a single U6 promoter-driven guide RNA array composed of an AAVS1-targeting guide and a MAFB-targeting guide, we demonstrated efficient multiplex genome editing in hPSCs at the AAVS1 (knockin) and MAFB (knockout) loci. Targeted hPSCs expressed pluripotency markers, and could be directed to differentiate to pancreatic {beta}-like cells, neural progenitor cells, and neurons in vitro. Generated INS reporter cells differentiated into {beta}-like cells that express tdTomato and luciferase specifically in insulin-expressing cells, allowing for in vivo tracking of human {beta}-like cells in humanized mice. By targeted screening of potential off-target sequences with most homology to guide RNA targeted sequences, we could not detect off-target mutations for all guide RNAs at the condition of efficient genome editing with Cpf1 in hPSCs. This work provides a system complementary to Cas9 for potentially precise genome editing in hPSCs.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental mechanism that all eukaryotic cells use to adapt to their environment is dynamic protein modification with monosaccharide sugars. In humans, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is rapidly added to and removed from diverse protein sites as a response to fluctuating nutrient levels, stressors, and signaling cues. Two aspects remain challenging for tracking functional O-GlcNAc events with chemical strategies: spatial control over subcellular locations and time control during labeling. The objective of this study was to create intracellular proximity labeling tools to identify functional changes in O-GlcNAc patterns with spatiotemporal control. We developed a labeling strategy based on the TurboID proximity labeling system for rapid protein biotin conjugation that we directed to O-GlcNAc protein modifications inside cells, a set of tools we called \"GlycoID.\" Localized variants to the nucleus and cytosol, nuc-GlycoID and cyt-GlycoID, labeled O-GlcNAc proteins and their interactomes in subcellular space. Labeling during insulin as well as serum stimulation revealed functional changes in O-GlcNAc proteins as soon as 30 minutes of signaling. We demonstrated using proteomic analysis that the GlycoID strategy captured O-GlcNAcylated \"activity hubs\" consisting of O-GlcNAc proteins and their associated protein-protein interactions. The ability to follow changes in O-GlcNAc hubs during physiological events like insulin stimulation poises these tools to be used for determining mechanisms of glycobiological cell regulation. Our functional O-GlcNAc datasets in human cells will be a useful resource for O-GlcNAc-driven mechanisms.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/488185v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dbfde0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8a27eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17430f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a3e30_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In eutherian embryos, pluripotency is maintained from naive states in peri-implantation to primed pluripotency at gastrulation. To understand how these states emerged, we reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of the Pou5 gene family, which contains the central pluripotency factor OCT4. By coupling evolutionary sequence analysis with functional studies in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), we found that the ability of POU5 proteins to support pluripotency originated in the gnathostome lineage, prior to the generation of two paralogues, Pou5f1 and Pou5f3 via gene duplication. In osteichthyans, retaining both genes, the paralogues differ in their support of naive and primed pluripotency. This specialization of these duplicates enables the diversification of function in self-renewal and differentiation. By integrating sequence evolution, ESC phenotypes, developmental contexts and structural modelling, we pinpoint OCT4 regions sufficient for naive pluripotency and describe their adaptation over evolutionary time.",

The interferometric plasmonic microscopy (iPM) capable of imaging single biological nanoparticles with the diameter down to 30 nm is employed to detect small EVs at the single-particle level. Small EVs population with mixed sizes are directly imaged, individually sized and digitally counted during their binding onto different aptamer-coated iPM sensor surfaces. The protein expression levels and binding kinetics of three size-dependent subpopulations are analyzed, forming a multidimensional data matrix for cancer diagnosis. Using small EVs derived from different cancer cell lines, highly heterogeneous protein profiles are recorded in the three subpopulations.

    "abstract": "Large datasets contribute new insights to subjects formerly investigated by exemplars. We used co-evolution data to create a large, high-quality database of transmembrane {beta}-barrels (TMBB). By applying simple feature detection on generated evolutionary contact maps, our method (IsItABarrel) achieves 95.88% balanced accuracy when discriminating among protein classes. Moreover, comparison with IsItABarrel revealed a high rate of false positives in previous TMBB algorithms. In addition to being more accurate than previous datasets, our database (available online) contains 1,894,206 bacterial TMBB proteins from 20 evolutionary classes, respectively 17 and 2.2 times larger than the previous sets TMBB-DB and OMPdb. We anticipate that due to its quality and size the database will serve as a useful resource where high quality TMBB sequence data is required. We found that TMBBs can be divided into 10 types, three of which have not been previously reported. We find tremendous variance in proteome percentage among TMBB-containing organisms with some using 6.79% of their proteome for TMBBs and others using as little as 0.27% of their proteome. The distribution of the lengths of the TMBBs is suggestive of previously hypothesized duplication events. In addition, we find that the C-terminal {beta}-signal varies among different classes of bacteria though it is most commonly HyGHyGY+F. However, this {beta}-signal is only characteristic of prototypical TMBBs. The nine non-prototypical barrel types have other C-terminal motifs and it remains to be determined if these alternative motifs facilitate TMBB insertion or perform any other signaling function.\n\nSignificance StatementOuter membrane proteins (OMPs) control all interactions between Gram negative bacteria and their environments including uptake and efflux of antibiotics. We created an algorithm that identifies bacterial OMPs from sequence. The quality of our algorithm allows us to identify most OMPs ([~]1.8 million) from prokaryotic genomes including >240,000 unrelated to previously structurally-resolved OMPs. We identify ten types of OMPs in our database. The largest types signal sequence--used for targeting the membrane-insertion machinery--varies by phylogenetic class. All other types of OMPs do not have a related signal sequence, raising new questions of how these proteins fold. Our web-accessible database will allow for further exploration of the varieties of outer membrane proteins to uncover new targets for controlling antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Cassava mosaic disease suppresses cassava yields across the tropics. The dominant CMD2 locus confers resistance to the cassava mosaic geminiviruses. It has been reported that CMD2-type landraces lose resistance after regeneration through de novo morphogenesis. As full genome bisulfite sequencing failed to uncover an epigenetic mechanism for loss of resistance, we performed whole genome sequencing and genetic variant analysis and fine-mapped the CMD2 locus to a 190 kilobase interval. Data suggest that CMD2-type resistance is caused by a nonsynonymous, single nucleotide polymorphism in DNA polymerase {delta} subunit 1 (MePOLD1) located within this region. Virus-induced gene silencing of MePOLD1 in a Cassava mosaic disease-susceptible cassava variety produced a recovery phenotype typical of CMD2-type resistance. Analysis of other CMD2-type cassava varieties identified additional resistance alleles within MePOLD1. MePOLD1 resistance alleles represent important genetic resources for resistance breeding or genome editing, and elucidating mechanisms of resistance to geminiviruses.",

    "abstract": "ContextDiseases are increasingly contributing to wildlife population declines. Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations have locally declined by 82% largely due to the morbidity and mortality associated with two independent transmissible devil facial tumours (DFT1 and DFT2). Toxic baits are often used as a management tool for controlling vertebrate pest populations in Australia, but in other areas of the world oral baits are also used to deliver vaccines or pharmaceuticals to wildlife. Oral vaccine bait products have been distributed for more than 50 years at a landscape scale to protect wildlife from rabies virus and contributed to the elimination of fox rabies from more than ten European nations. An oral bait vaccine to protect against devil facial tumours has been proposed as a management tool to improve the population health, resiliency and fitness of wild Tasmanian devils.\n\nAimOur goal was to evaluate the potential use of edible baits as vehicles for vaccine delivery to Tasmanian devils.\n\nMethodWe tested placebo versions of baits that are already used in Australia.\n\nKey resultsCaptive devils consumed all types of placebo baits but exhibited a preference for ruminant- and fish-based baits. Captive devils also consumed inert capsules inserted into placebo baits. Bait fate trials in the field revealed that baits were generally removed within 24 hours. Tasmanian pademelons (Thylogale billardierii), brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), and Eastern quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus) were the most common nontarget bait competitors at six private properties in southern Tasmania; wild devils removed approximately 5% of ground baits at these sites. We also evaluated an automated bait dispenser, which reduced nontarget uptake and resulted in over 50% of the baits being removed by devils.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that captive and wild devils will accept and consume placebo versions of commercial baits. Bait dispensers or modified baits or baiting strategies are needed to increase bait uptake by devils.\n\nImplicationsBait dispensers can be used at a regional scale to deliver baits to Tasmanian devils. These could act as vehicles for preventive or therapeutic vaccines to mitigate the impacts of disease on devil populations.\n\nShort summaryThis study aimed to test oral baits as potential vaccine delivery vehicles for Tasmanian devils. Captive and wild devils consumed placebo versions of commercial baits used on mainland Australia. Abundant non-target species, such as brushtail possums, Tasmanian pademelons, and eastern quolls consumed most baits in the wild. Implementation of automated bait dispensers increased bait uptake by devils to over 50% at the same regional field sites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCell groups containing catecholamines provide a useful model to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the morphogenesis, physiology, and pathology of the central nervous system. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish a system to induce catecholaminergic group-specific expression of Cre recombinase. Recently, we introduced a gene cassette encoding 2A peptide fused to Cre recombinase into the site between the C-terminus and translational termination codons of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) open reading frame by the Combi-CRISPR technology, which is a genomic editing method to enable an efficient knock-in (KI) of long DNA sequence into a target site. However, the expression patterns of the transgene and its function as well as the effect of the mutation on the biochemical and behavioral phenotypes in the KI strains have not been characterized yet.\n\nNew MethodWe aimed to evaluate the usefulness of TH-Cre KI rats as an experimental model for investigating the structure and function of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain.\n\nResultsWe detected cell type-specific expression of Cre recombinase and site-specific recombination activity in the representative catecholaminergic groups in the TH-Cre KI rat strains. In addition, we measured TH expression level and catecholamine accumulation in the brain regions, and spontaneous locomotion, indicating that catecholamine metabolism and general behavior are apparently normal in these KI rats.\n\nConclusionsTH-Cre KI rat strains produced by the Combi-CRISPR system offer a beneficial model to study the molecular and cellular mechanics for the morphogenesis, physiology, and pathology of catecholamine-containing neurons in the brain.",

The present study examined the population structure, antimicrobial resistance, and virulent factors of methicillin-resistant M. caseolyticus isolates in retail meat from Shanghai (n=10) and global isolates from GenBank (n=87). All strains were divided into five lineages that distributed in Europe (82.4%, n = 80), Asia (11.3%, n = 11), North America (4.1%, n = 4), Oceania (1%, n = 1) and Africa (1%, n = 1). MLST typing revealed novel alleles in Chinese M. caseolyticus strains. Furthermore, a total of 24 AMR genes associated with 10 classes of antimicrobial agents were identified in the isolates from global lineages, carried by dominant plasmids such as rep7a, rep22 and repUS56. Comparing to other lineages, genomes from the Chinese lineage carried significantly more AMR genes (p<0.005) and less virulent factors (p<0.001), which may be explained by the local evolution of M. caseolyticus in China. Finally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were enrolled for morphology comparison between M. caseolyticus and S. aureus, showing that M. caseolyticus has a larger diameter and thicker cell wall. The present study showed geographical variation with regards to MLST profiles, antimicrobial resistance, and virulent factors in global M. caseolyticus lineages. This study suggests that such local evolution of foodborne or livestock origin M. caseolyticus may serve as vehicles for domestic transmission of methicillin resistance in retail meat in China.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGlobal M. caseolyticus strains were divided into five lineages from A to E.\nC_LIO_LIMLST typing revealed novel alleles in Chinese M. caseolyticus strains.\nC_LIO_LIChinese lineage carried significantly more AMR genes and less virulent factors.\nC_LIO_LIMacrococcus caseolyticus has a larger diameter and thicker cell wall compared with S.aureus.\nC_LIO_LIMacrococcus caseolyticus may enhance the domestic transmission of methicillin resistance in China.\nC_LI",

To explore the function and mechanism of the transcription factor RXRA in myoblasts, and to further explore the key factors that RXRA regulates the target gene CD36 signaling network to regulate lipid metabolism. We found that the transcription factor RXRA inhibited the accumulation of triglycerides (TGs), cholesterol (CHOL) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in CS2 cells by regulating CD36 as well as the fatty acid beta oxidation pathway. CD36 functions similar to RXRA in myoblasts. CD36 overexpression reduced the levels of TGs, CHOL, NEFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in these cells, while CD36 knockout increased the levels of TGs, CHOL, NEFAs, SFAs and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUPAs) in these cells. GRB2, MAP1B, SLC38A1, SLC4A7, NCOA3, PKIA, MOB2, SAA2 and RXRA are involved in the CD36 promotion of lipid efflux through lipid metabolism, endocytosis and amino acid metabolism. Considering these results, we propose that RXRA regulates lipid metabolism in myoblasts by regulating the CD36 signaling network.",

We report that Dicers highly conserved DExD/H helicase domain is the key structural element supporting accurate miRNA biogenesis. While ATPase activity of the domain is non-essential, its loss is lethal in mice. It is required during canonical miRNA biogenesis for efficient recognition, high-fidelity cleavage, and strand selection. Structure of Dicer-miRNA precursor complexes showed that the DExD/H domain acquired helicase-unrelated function defining Dicer conformations, which affect substrate loading and facilitate pre-selection of miRNA precursors. Dicer lacking the DExD/H domain favors conformations enabling reduced substrate selectivity and supporting RNA interference, a different small RNA pathway. Therefore, Dicers DExD/H domain ensures indispensable high-fidelity precursor processing of mammalian miRNAs, which constitutes a structural \"mold\" for adaptive miRNA evolution.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular aggregation of destabilized transthyretin (TTR) variants is implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of familial TTR-related amyloid diseases. One strategy to reduce toxic, extracellular aggregation of TTR is to decrease the population of aggregation-prone protein secreted from mammalian cells. Stress-independent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated transcription factor ATF6 preferentially decreases secretion and subsequent aggregation of destabilized, aggregation-prone TTR variants. However, the mechanism of this reduced secretion was previously undefined. Here, we implement a mass spectrometry-based interactomics approach to identify endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis factors involved in ATF6-dependent reductions of destabilized TTR secretion. We show that ATF6 activation reduces amyloidogenic TTR secretion and subsequent aggregation through a mechanism involving ER retention that is mediated by increased interactions with ATF6-regulated ER proteostasis factors including BiP and PDIA4. Intriguingly, the PDIA4-dependent retention of TTR is independent of both the single TTR cysteine residue and the redox activity of PDIA4, indicating that PDIA4 retains destabilized TTR in the ER through a redox-independent chaperoning activity. Our results define a mechanistic basis to explain the ATF6 activation-dependent reduction of destabilized, amyloidogenic TTR secretion that could be therapeutically accessed to improve treatments of TTR-related amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "ContextHuman-induced changes in landscape structure are among the main causes of biodiversity loss. Despite their important contribution to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, microbes - and particularly protists - remain spatially understudied. Soil microbiota are most often driven by local soil properties, but the influence of the surrounding landscape is rarely assessed.\n\nObjectivesWe assessed the effect of landscape structure on soil protist alpha and beta diversity in meadows in the western Swiss Alps.\n\nMethodsWe sampled 178 plots along an elevation gradient representing a broad range of environmental conditions and land-use. We measured landscape structure around each plot at 5 successive spatial scales (i.e. neighbourhood windows of increasing radius, ranging from 100 to 2000 m around a plot). We investigated the changes of protist alpha and beta diversity as a function of landscape structure, local environmental conditions and geographic distance.\n\nResultsLandscape structures played a key role for protist alpha and beta diversity. The percentage of meadows, forests, or open habitats had the highest influence among all landscape metrics. The importance of landscape structure was comparable to that of environmental conditions and spatial variables, and increased with the size of the neighbourhood window considered.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that dispersal from neighbouring habitats is a key driver of protist alpha and beta diversity which highlight the importance of landscape-scale assembly mechanisms for microbial diversity. Landscape structure emerges as a key driver of microbial communities which has profound implications for our understanding of the consequences of land-use change on soil microbial communities and their associated functions.",

    "abstract": "The process of protein translocation is essential to the maintenance of cellular life and has been critically addressed in eukaryotes and bacteria. However, little information is available regarding protein translocation across archaeal membranes. The signal recognition particle (SRP) plays an important role in this process. It binds the signal peptide at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain and interacts with the cognate SRP receptor (FtsY) located on the target membrane to form a targeting complex (TC). Concomitant GTP hydrolysis by SRP and FtsY delivers the polypeptide to the adjacent protein-conducting channel. The present study aims to characterize the structural domains of FtsY contributing to the targeting complex (TC) formation in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a thermo-acidophilic crenarchaeon. The contacting residues between SRP54 and FtsY were mapped along the N1-N3 helices. Interestingly, the previously reported crystal structure did not take the N-terminal A domain into account - a region rich in negatively charged residues. Such observation led us to investigate the contribution of each of the three participating helices (N1-3) in terms of membrane association and functional TC formation. Through biophysical analyses of SRP-FtsY and FtsY-membrane interaction, and biochemical characterization of the reciprocal GTPase activity, this work sought to elucidate the minimal structural motif controlling the archaeal TC assembly.",

BCL-xL loss relocalizes KRAS to the vicinity of mitochondrial proteins. Proximal proteins include the mitochondrial scaffold prohibitin 2 (PHB2), which also interacts with BCL-xL and the downregulation of which prevents BCL-xL sensitive effects of KRAS induced contacts between mitochondria and endosomes, and mitochondrial mass decrease.
