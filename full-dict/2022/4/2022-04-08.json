    "abstract": "Unlike globular proteins, mutational effects on the function of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are not well-studied. Deep Mutational Scanning of a yeast surface displayed mutant library yields insights into sequence-function relationships in the CcdA IDP. The approach enables facile prediction of interface residues and local structural signatures of the bound conformation. In contrast to previous titration-based approaches which use a number of ligand concentrations, we show that use of a single rationally chosen ligand concentration can provide quantitative estimates of relative binding constants for large numbers of protein variants. This is because the extended interface of IDP ensures that energetic effects of point mutations are spread over a much smaller range than for globular proteins. Our data also provides insights into the much-debated role of helicity and disorder in partner binding of IDPs. Based on this exhaustive mutational sensitivity dataset, a model was developed to predict mutational effects on binding affinity of IDPs that form alpha-helical structures upon binding.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy, an imbalance in chromosome copy numbers, causes genetic disorders, and drives cancer progression, drug tolerance, and antimicrobial resistance. While aneuploidy can confer stress resistance, it is not well understood how cells overcome the fitness burden caused by aberrant chromosomal copy numbers. Studies using both systematically generated 1-5 and natural aneuploid yeasts 6-8 triggered an intense debate about the role of dosage compensation, concluding that aneuploidy is transmitted to the transcriptome and proteome without significant buffering at the chromosome-wide level, and is, at least in lab strains, associated with significant fitness costs. Conversely, systematic sequencing and phenotyping of large collections of natural isolates revealed that aneuploidy is frequent and has few - if any - fitness costs in nature 9. To address these discrepant findings at the proteomic level, we developed a platform that yields highly precise proteomic measurements across large numbers of genetically diverse samples, and applied it to natural isolates collected as part of the 1011 genomes project 9. For 613 of the isolates, we were able to match the proteomes to their corresponding transcriptomes and genomes, subsequently quantifying the effect of aneuploidy on gene expression by comparing 95 aneuploid with 518 euploid strains. We find, as in previous studies, that aneuploid gene dosage is not buffered chromosome-wide at the transcriptome level. Importantly, in the proteome, we detect an attenuation of aneuploidy by about 25% below the aneuploid gene dosage in natural yeast isolates. Furthermore, this chromosome-wide dosage compensation is associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is expressed at higher levels and has increased activity across natural aneuploid strains. Thus, through systematic exploration of the species-wide diversity of the yeast proteome, we shed light on a long-standing debate about the biology of aneuploids, revealing that aneuploidy tolerance is mediated through chromosome-wide dosage compensation at the proteome level.",

    "abstract": "The dominant theoretical framework to account for reinforcement learning in the brain is temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning. The normative motivation for TD theory is that the brain needs to learn about expected future rewards in order to learn how to maximize these rewards. The TD framework predicts that some neuronal elements should represent the reward prediction error (RPE), which means they signal the difference between the expected future rewards and the actual rewards. What makes the TD learning theory so prominent is that the firing properties of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) appear similar to those of RPE model-neurons in TD learning. Biologically plausible implementations of TD learning assume a fixed temporal basis for each stimulus that might eventually predict a reward. Here we show on the basis of first principles that such a fixed temporal basis is implausible. We also show that certain predictions of TD learning are inconsistent with experimental data. We propose instead an alternative theoretical framework, coined FLEX (Flexibly Learned Errors in Expected Reward). In FLEX, feature specific representations of time are learned, allowing for neural representations of stimuli to adjust their timing and relation to rewards in an online manner. As an indirect consequence, dopamine in FLEX resembles, but is not equivalent to RPE. In FLEX dopamine acts as an instructive signal which helps build temporal models of the environment. FLEX is a general theoretical framework that has many possible biophysical implementations. In order to show that FLEX is a feasible approach, we present a specific biophysically plausible model which implements the principles of FLEX. We show that this implementation can account for various reinforcement learning paradigms, and that its results and predictions are consistent with a preponderance of both existing and reanalyzed experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Spoken language comprehension requires rapid and continuous integration of information, from lower-level acoustic to higher-level linguistic features. Much of this processing occurs in the cerebral cortex. Its neural activity exhibits, for instance, correlates of predictive processing, emerging at delays of a few hundred milliseconds. However, the auditory pathways are also characterized by extensive feedback loops from higher-level cortical areas to lower-level ones as well as to subcortical structures. Early neural activity can therefore be influenced by higher-level cognitive processes, but it remains unclear whether such feedback contributes to linguistic processing. Here, we investigated early speech-evoked neural activity that emerges at the fundamental frequency. We analyzed EEG recordings obtained when subjects listened to a story read by a single speaker. We identified a response tracking the speakers fundamental frequency that occurred at a delay of 11 ms, while another response elicited by the high-frequency modulation of the envelope of higher harmonics exhibited a larger magnitude and longer latency of about 18 ms. Subsequently, we determined the magnitude of these early neural responses for each individual word in the story. We then quantified the context-independent frequency of each word and used a language model to compute context-dependent word surprisal and precision. The word surprisal represented how predictable a word is, given the previous context, and the word precision reflected the confidence about predicting the next word from the past context. We found that the word-level neural responses at the fundamental frequency were predominantly influenced by the acoustic features: the average fundamental frequency and its variability. Amongst the linguistic features, only context-independent word frequency showed a weak but significant modulation of the neural response to the high-frequency envelope modulation. Our results show that the early neural response at the fundamental frequency is already influenced by acoustic as well as linguistic information, suggesting top-down modulation of this neural response.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) and their binding sites have evolved to interact cooperatively or competitively with each other. Here we examine in detail, across multiple cell lines, such cooperation or competition among TFs both in sequential and spatial proximity (using chromatin conformation capture assays) on one hand, and based on both in vivo binding as well as TF binding motifs on the other. We ascertain significantly co-occurring (\"attractive\") or avoiding (\"repulsive\") TF pairs using robust randomized models that retain the essential characteristics of the experimental data. Across human cell lines TFs organize into two groups, with intra-group attraction and inter-group repulsion. This is true for both sequential and spatial proximity, as well as for both in vivo binding and motifs. Attractive TF pairs exhibit significantly more physical interactions suggesting an underlying mechanism. The two TF groups differ significantly in their genomic and network properties, as well in their function--while one group regulates housekeeping function, the other potentially regulates lineage-specific functions, that are disrupted in cancer. We also show that weaker binding sites tend to occur in spatially interacting regions of the genome. Our results suggest a complex pattern of spatial cooperativity of TFs that has evolved along with the genome to support housekeeping and lineage-specific functions.",
