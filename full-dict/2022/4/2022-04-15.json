    "abstract": "Precise mechanism-based gene expression signatures (GESs) have been developed in appropriate in vitro and in vivo model systems, to identify important cancer-related signalling processes. However, some GESs originally developed to represent specific disease processes, primarily with an epithelial cell focus, are being applied to heterogeneous tumour samples where the expression of the genes in the signature may no longer be epithelial-specific. Therefore, unknowingly, even small changes in tumour stroma percentage can directly influence GESs, undermining the intended mechanistic signalling.\n\nUsing colorectal cancer as an exemplar, we deployed numerous orthogonal profiling methodologies, including laser capture microdissection, flow cytometry, bulk and multiregional biopsy clinical samples, single cell RNAseq and finally spatial transcriptomics, to perform a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the most widely-used GESs to be influenced, or confounded, by stromal content in tumour tissue. To complement this work, we generated a freely-available resource, ConfoundR; https://confoundr.qub.ac.uk/, that enables users to test the extent of stromal influence on an unlimited number of the genes/signatures simultaneously across colorectal, breast, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer datasets.\n\nFindings presented here demonstrate the clear potential for misinterpretation of the meaning of GESs, due to widespread stromal influences, which in-turn can undermine faithful alignment between clinical samples and preclinical data/models, particularly cell lines and organoids, or tumour models not fully recapitulating the stromal and immune microenvironment. As such, efforts to faithfully align preclinical models of disease using phenotypically-designed GESs must ensure that the signatures themselves remain representative of the same biology when applied to clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "WNT signaling presents an attractive target for cancer therapy due to its widespread oncogenic role. However, the molecular players involved in WNT signaling and the impact of their perturbation remain unknown for numerous recalcitrant cancers including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Here we show that beta-catenin, a master mediator of canonical WNT signaling, is not required for SCLC development in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and its transcriptional program is largely silenced during tumor development. Instead, inactivation of p130 in SCLC cells induces expression of WNT5A, a ligand for beta-catenin-independent WNT pathways. WNT5A is both sufficient and required for SCLC development and cell proliferation and selectively induces Rhoa transcription and activates RHOA protein to drive SCLC. Rhoa knockout suppresses SCLC development in vivo, and chemical perturbation of RHOA selectively inhibits SCLC cell proliferation. These findings suggest a novel requirement for the WNT5A-RHOA axis in SCLC that is distinct from other noncanonical WNT pathways. This vulnerability of p130-WNT5A-RHOA pathway provides critical insight into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the recalcitrant cancer, as well as the stratification of patients who may benefit from them. This study also sheds new light on the heterogeneity of WNT signaling and the molecular determinants of its cell-type specificity.",

Citrus oil glands in particular contain essential oils which include plant secondary metabolites associated with flavor and aroma. Capturing and analyzing nuanced information behind the citrus fruit shape and its oil gland distribution provides a morphology-driven path to further our insight into phenotype-genotype interactions.\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated the shape of citrus fruit of 51 accessions based on 3D X-ray CT scan reconstructions. Accessions include all three ancestral citrus species, accessions from related genera, and several interspecific hybrids. We digitally separate and compare the size of fruit endocarp, mesocarp, exocarp, and oil gland tissue. Based on the centers of the oil glands, overall fruit shape is approximated with an ellipsoid. Possible oil gland distributions on this ellipsoid surface are explored using directional statistics.\nC_LIO_LIThere is a strong allometry along fruit tissues; that is, we observe a strong linear relationship between the volume of any pair of major tissues. This suggests that the relative growth of fruit tissues with respect to each other follows a power law. We also observe that on average, glands distance themselves from their nearest neighbor following a square root relationship, which suggests normal diffusion dynamics at play.\nC_LIO_LIThe observed allometry and square root models point to the existence of biophysical developmental constraints that govern novel relationships between fruit dimensions from both evolutionary and breeding perspectives. Understanding these biophysical interactions prompt an exciting research path on fruit development and breeding.\nC_LI\n\nSocietal Impact StatementCitrus are intrinsically connected to human health and culture, including preventing human diseases like scurvy, and inspiring sacred rituals. Citrus fruits come in a stunning number of different sizes and shapes, ranging from small clementines to oversized pummelos, and fruits display a vast diversity of flavors and aromas. These qualities are key in both traditional and modern medicine and the production of cleaning and perfume products.

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T cells are genetically engineered to express a specific T cell receptor of interest, such as to target a cancer-specific antigen. Signaling events in chimeric antigen receptor T cells are essential for their proliferation, survival, and function. To achieve optimal antitumor efficacy, signaling motifs as well as the structure of the transmembrane domain of the chimeric antigen receptor have to be carefully designed. However, it remains unclear whether the arrangement, and therefore the movement and elasticity, of tumor antigens influence their stimulation of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Here we show that MUC1 molecules tethered to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor drastically increased its stimulation of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. In particular, MUC1 molecules containing one tandem repeat sequence showed significantly greater stimulatory activity than five tandem repeat sequences. Thus glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, tumor antigen epitope pillars in parallel are attractive targets for the design of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. These novel findings, which we propose as the parallel lipid-carried epitope model, emphasize the importance of epitope arrangement in selecting highly effective chimeric antigen receptor T cells, potentially revolutionizing the applicability of this therapy. Furthermore, our data have implications for the necessity of methodologies to measure the elasticity, movement, and density of antigen pillars in parallel, as key tools to guide future chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy.",

Although it has been hypothesized that the dynamics of these interactions influence the outcome of T cell activation, methodological limitations have hindered its formal demonstration. Here, we have engineered the Light-inducible T cell engager (LiTe) system, a recombinant optogenetics-based molecular tool targeting the T Cell Receptor (TCR). The LiTe system constitutes a reversible molecular switch displaying exquisite reactivity. As proof of concept, we dissect how specific temporal patterns of TCR stimulation shape T cell activation patterns. We established that CD4+ T cells respond to intermittent TCR stimulation more efficiently than their CD8+ T cells counterparts and provide evidence that distinct sequences of TCR stimulation encode different cytokine programs. Finally, we show that the LiTe system could be exploited to create light-activated bispecific T cell engagers and manipulate tumor cell killing. Overall, the LiTe system provides new opportunities to understand how T cells integrate TCR stimulations and to trigger T cell cytotoxicity with a high spatiotemporal control.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense recent research interest in archaea, the scientific community has experienced a bottleneck in the study of genome-scale gene expression experiments by RNA-seq due to the lack of commercial and specifically designed rRNA depletion kits. The high ratio rRNA:mRNA (80-90%: [~]10%) in prokaryotes hampers global transcriptomic analysis. Insufficient ribodepletion results in low sequence coverage of mRNA and therefore requires a substantially higher number of replicate samples and/or sequencing reads to achieve statistically reliable conclusions regarding the significance of differential gene expression between case and control samples. Here we show that after the discontinuation of the previous version of RiboZero (Illumina) that was useful to partially deplete rRNA from halophilic archaea, archaeal transcriptomics studies have experienced a standstill. To overcome this limitation, here we analyze the efficiency for four different hybridization-based kits from three different commercial suppliers, each with two sets of sequence-specific probes to remove rRNA from four different species of halophilic archaea. We conclude that the key for transcriptomic success with the currently available tools is the probe-specificity for the rRNA sequence hybridization. With this paper we provide insights to the archaeal community for selecting certain reagents and strategies over others depending on the archaeal species of interest. These methods yield improved RNA-seq sensitivity and enhanced detection of low abundance transcripts.",

    "abstract": "The ovary is the key organ in insect female oviposition. For the continuation of populations in nature, the whole life cycle of female adults is centred on reproduction. Vg and VgR genes are important in determining the synthesis and transport of vitellogenin. Therefore, Vg and VgR gene expression in insect females affects the formation of mature eggs in the ovary, which is very important. RNAi interference of Vg and VgR genes may become an important means to control D. citri populations. A study found that the expression of the DicVg4 and DicVgR genes was significantly affected by DicdsVg4 and DicdsVgR. DicVg4 and DicVgR gene expression interference could prevent the accumulation of vitellogenin in the ovaries of females, rendering ovaries unable to form mature eggs normally and leading to the production of abnormal eggs and nymphs. After knockdown of DicVg4 and DicVgR gene expression, the proportion of ovarian mature eggs was only 8.33 {+/-} 1.67% and 7.75 {+/-} 0.5% in the 10-d developmental stage, the proportion of negative control group ovarian mature eggs was 13.19 {+/-} 0.14% in the 10-d developmental stage, and the proportion of ovarian mature eggs in the interference group was 0.00 {+/-} 0.00% in the 5, 15, 20, 25, and 30-d developmental stages.

    "abstract": "Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that causes difficult to treat infections, have significant genomic heterogeneity including the presence of diverse accessory genes that are only present in some strains or clades. Both core genes, which are conserved across strains, and accessory genes have been associated with traits such as biofilm formation and virulence. Much of what we know about core and accessory gene content comes from genome analyses. Here, we use a newly assembled transcriptome compendium to analyze the transcriptional patterns of core and accessory gene expression in PAO1 and PA14 strains across thousands of samples from hundreds of distinct experiments. We found that a subset of core genes were stable, having consistent correlated expression patterns across samples regardless of strain background, with a focus on strains PAO1 and PA14. These stable core genes had fewer co-expressed neighbors that were accessory genes.\n\nSignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous pathogen. There is a lot of diversity amongst P. aeruginosa strains, some which are clinically relevant. Understanding how these different strain-level traits manifest is important for identifying targets that regulate different traits of interest. With the availability of a PAO1-mapped and PA14-mapped RNA-seq compendium, which contain hundreds of strains, it is now possible to examine the effect of different strains on expression, which can mediate different traits. In this study we developed an approach to compare expression profiles across different P. aeruginosa gene groups - core and accessory genes. This approach revealed a subset of core genes with different transcriptional patterns across strains, which could contribute to trait differences.",

    "abstract": "A major hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the accumulation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}). Structural polymorphism observed among A{beta} fibrils in AD brains seem to correlate with the clinical sub-types suggesting a link between fibril polymorphism and pathology. Since fibrils emerge from a templated growth of low-molecular weight oligomers, understanding the factors affecting oligomer generation is important. The membrane lipids are key factors that influence early stages of A{beta} aggregation and oligomer generation, and cause membrane disruption. We have previously demonstrated that conformationally discrete A{beta} oligomers can be generated by modulating the charge, composition, chain length of lipids and surfactants. Here, we extend our studies into liposomal models by investigating A{beta} oligomerization on large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of total brain extracts (TBE), reconstituted lipid rafts (LRs) or 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). Specifically, we varied the vesicle composition by varying the amount of GM1 gangliosides added as a constituent. We found that liposomes enriched in GM1 induce the formation of toxic, low-molecular weight oligomers that are isolable in a lipid-complexed form. Importantly, the data indicate that oligomer formation and membrane disruption are highly cooperative processes. Numerical simulations on the experimental data confirm cooperativity and reveal that GM1-enriched liposomes form twice as many numbers of pores as those without GM1. Overall, this study uncovers mechanisms of cooperativity between oligomerization and membrane disruption under controlled lipid compositional bias, and refocuses the significance of the early stages of A{beta} aggregation in polymorphism, propagation, and toxicity in AD.\n\nTOC figure O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "PurposePhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (PI3Ki) are approved for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While patients may show an initial response, development of treatment intolerance or resistance remains a clinically challenging. Prediction of individual treatment responses based on clinically actionable biomarkers is needed to overcome these challenges. Here, we investigated whether ex vivo functional responses to targeted therapies can stratify responders to idelalisib and guide precision medicine in CLL.\n\nExperimental designCLL cells from treatment naive, idelalisib-responding, and idelalisib-refractory/intolerant patients (n=33 in total) were profiled against ten PI3Ki and the Bcl-2 antagonist venetoclax. Cell signaling and immune phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell viability was monitored by detection of cleaved caspase-3 and the CellTiter-Glo assay.\n\nResultsAmong the ten PI3Ki studied, pan-PI3Ki were most effective at inhibiting PI3K signaling and cell viability, and they showed activity also in CLL cells from idelalisib-refractory/intolerant patients. The pan-PI3Ki copanlisib, but not the p110{delta} inhibitor idelalisib, inhibited PI3K signaling in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in addition to CD19+ B cells, while it did not significantly affect T cell numbers. Combination treatment with a PI3Ki and venetoclax resulted in synergistic induction of apoptosis. Based on ex vivo drug sensitivity testing, a relapsed CLL patient was treated with idelalisib plus venetoclax, and the patient achieved a partial response. A more systematic analysis revealed that CLL cells from patients with a long-term response to idelalisib showed significantly higher drug sensitivities to 73 drug combinations at baseline compared to short-term responders.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest novel treatment vulnerabilities in idelalisib-refractory/intolerant CLL, and demonstrate that ex vivo functional profiling may guide precision medicine and predict treatment responses of individual CLL patients.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEThe phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (PI3Ki) idelalisib and duvelisib are approved for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but their use has been limited by severe toxicity and acquired resistance. Identification of biomarkers that predict individual treatment responses, as well as alternative treatment vulnerabilities in PI3Ki refractory/intolerant patients, is needed to optimally tailor CLL therapy. We performed functional analyses of CLL cells from treatment naive, idelalisib-responding and idelalisib-refractory/intolerant patients to identify clinically actionable biomarkers. We show that CLL cells from idelalisib-refractory/intolerant patients remain sensitive to pan-PI3Ki and PI3Ki plus venetoclax combinations. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing was used to guide treatment of a relapsed CLL patient who obtained a partial response after idelalisib plus venetoclax therapy. A systematic analysis of drug sensitivities to 73 drug combinations stratified responders to idelalisib using baseline samples from short-term and long-term responders to idelalisib. Our study demonstrates the power of functional precision medicine in relapsed CLL.",

    "abstract": "The serine/threonine protein kinase AKT is a critical mediator of growth factor signaling that broadly impacts mRNA translation, metabolism, programmed cell death and stress responses. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a large dsDNA virus in the herpesvirus family, dramatically remodels host cell signaling pathways during lytic infection. Here, we show that AKT accumulates in an inactive form during HCMV infection, as indicated by hypo-phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473, as well as nuclear localization of FOXO3a. Moreover, we find that expression of constitutively active myristoylated AKT (myr-AKT) causes a 1-log defect in viral replication, accompanied by defects in viral DNA synthesis and viral late gene expression. These findings suggest that HCMV shutoff of AKT is not merely incidental to viral factors such as pUL38 that maintain high levels of mTORC1 activity independently of extracellular growth factor signals. Short interfering RNA knockdown of FOXO3a, but not FOXO1, phenocopied the replication defects seen during expression of myr-AKT, corroborating a role for FOXO3a during HCMV infection. Accordingly, a chimeric FOXO3a-estrogen receptor fusion protein, whose nuclear localization is regulated by the small molecule ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen instead of AKT activity, rescues virtually all the replication defects induced by myr-AKT expression. Taken together, our results argue that HCMV dampens AKT signaling to promote nuclear localization of FOXO transcription factors, which are required for efficient viral replication.\n\nIMPORTANCEEvidence from a diverse herpesvirus infection models suggests that the PI3K / AKT signaling pathway suppresses reactivation from latency, and that inactivation of the pathway stimulates viral lytic replication. Here, we show that AKT accumulates in an inactive state during HCMV infection of lytically permissive cells while the presence of constitutive AKT activity causes substantial viral replication defects. Although AKT phosphorylates a diverse array of cellular substrates, we identify an important role for the Forkhead box class O transcription factors. Our findings show that when FoxO3a nuclear localization is decoupled from its negative regulation by AKT, the viral replication defects observed in the presence of constitutively active AKT are reversed. Collectively, our results reveal that HCMV inactivates AKT to promote the nuclear localization of FOXO transcription factors, which strongly implies that FOXOs play critical roles in transactivating cellular and/or viral genes during infection.",

    "abstract": "Sperm acrosomal membrane proteins, such as IZUMO1 and SPACA6, play an essential role in mammalian sperm-egg fusion. How their biosynthesis is regulated during spermiogenesis has largely remained unknown. Here, we show that the 1700029I15Rik knockout male mice are severely subfertile and their spermatozoa do not fuse with eggs. 1700029I15Rik encodes a type-II transmembrane protein that is expressed in early spermatids but not in mature spermatozoa. 1700029I15Rik is associated with proteins involved in N-glycosylation, disulfide isomerisation, and ER- Golgi trafficking, suggesting its involvement in nascent protein processing. 1700029I15Rik knockout testis has a normal level of sperm plasma membrane proteins, but decreased expression of multiple acrosomal membrane proteins. The knockout sperm exhibit elevated ubiquitinated proteins and upregulated ER-associated degradation; strikingly, SPACA6 becomes undetectable. Our results support for a specific, 1700029I15Rik-mediated pathway in spermiogenesis for the assembly of acrosomal membrane proteins.\n\nSignificance StatementIn sexually reproducing species, life begins with the fusion between a sperm and an egg. Multiple sperm acrosomal membrane proteins have been reported indispensable for sperm-egg fusion in mammals, yet the mechanism underlying their biosynthesis remains unknown. The present study demonstrates the existence of a 1700029I15Rik-mediated pathway specifically coordinating the processing and assembly of acrosomal membrane proteins. It represents an intriguing paradigm where the biosynthesis of proteins destined for various subcellular compartments might be orchestrated in a spatiotemporal manner. Given 1700029I15Rik is highly conserved in human, our findings provide potential insights into the aetiology of idiopathic male infertility and the development of a novel contraceptive approach involving molecular interventions in the maturation of gamete fusion-required acrosomal proteins.",

    "abstract": "Spatially-resolved transcriptomics uncovers patterns of gene expression at supercellular, cellular, or subcellular resolution, providing insights into spatially variable cellular functions, diffusible morphogens, and cell-cell interactions. However, for practical reasons, multiplexed single cell RNA-sequencing remains the most widely used technology for profiling transcriptomes of single cells, especially in the context of large-scale anatomical atlassing. Devising techniques to accurately predict the latent physical positions as well as the latent cell-cell proximities of such dissociated cells, represents an exciting and new challenge. Most of the current approaches rely on an  autocorrelation assumption, i.e., cells with similar transcriptomic profiles are located close to each other in physical space and vice versa. However, this is not always the case in native biological contexts due to complex morphological and functional patterning. To address this challenge, we developed SageNet, a graph neural network approach that spatially reconstructs dissociated single cell data using one or more spatial references. SageNet first estimates a gene-gene interaction network from a reference spatial dataset. This informs the structure of the graph on which the graph neural network is trained to predict the region of dissociated cells. Finally, SageNet produces a low-dimensional embedding of the query dataset, corresponding to the reconstructed spatial coordinates of the dissociated tissue. Furthermore, SageNet reveals spatially informative genes by extracting the most important features from the neural network model. We demonstrate the utility and robust performance of SageNet using molecule-resolved seqFISH and spot-based Spatial Transcriptomics reference datasets as well as dissociated single-cell data, across multiple biological contexts.

    "abstract": "Anticancer drug response is determined by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. To identify the epigenetic regulators of anticancer drug response, we conducted a chemical epigenetics screen using chemical probes that target different epigenetic modulators. In this screen, we tested 31 epigenetic probes in combination with 14 mechanistically diverse anticancer agents and identified 8 epigenetic probes that significantly potentiate the cytotoxicity of TAK-243, a first-in-class ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBA1) inhibitor evaluated in several solid and hematologic malignancies. These probes are TP-472, GSK-864, A-196, UNC1999, SGC-CBP30 and PFI-4 (and its related analogs GSK6853 and GSK5959), and they target BRD9/7, mutant IDH1, SUV420H1/2, EZH2/1, p300/CBP and BRPF1B, respectively. In contrast to epigenetic probes, negative control compounds did not have a significant impact on TAK-243 cytotoxicity. Potentiation of TAK-243 cytotoxicity was associated with reduced ubiquitylation and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, epigenetic probes exerted their potentiation by inhibiting the efflux transporter ABCG2 without inducing significant changes in the ubiquitylation pathways or ABCG2 expression levels. The identified probes shared chemical scaffold similarities with TAK-243 and could potentially interact with ABCG2 as assessed by docking analysis. Based on these data, we have developed a cell-based assay that can quantitatively evaluate ABCG2 inhibition by drug candidates. In conclusion, our study identifies epigenetic chemical probes that profoundly potentiate TAK-243 cytotoxicity through off-target ABCG2 inhibition. We also provide experimental evidence that several negative control compounds cannot exclude a subset of off-target effects of chemical probes. Finally, potentiation of TAK-243 cytotoxicity can serve as a quantitative measure of ABCG2-inhibitory activity.",

    "abstract": "Plants possess a unique transcriptional regulatory system in which two related MYB-related transcription factors (TFs) coordinate gene expression according to phosphate (Pi) and nitrogen (N) availability. The Phosphorus Starvation Response (PSR) type TFs are transcriptional activators integrating the cellular Pi sensing machinery and gene regulation majorly under Pi starvation. The Hypersensitivity To Low Pi-Elicited Primary Root Shortening (HRS) type TFs are transcriptional repressors integrating the Pi and N availability signals through different feedback loops. They are highly connected through multiple signaling loops to finetune the transcriptional responses according to nutrient availability. Molecular functions of these TFs are fairly uncovered in model systems; however, how plants evolved this activator-repressor system is currently unknown. In this study, using sensitive evolutionary analysis, we identified a stepwise origin of the PSR-HRS regulatory system in plants. The PSR TFs were originated before the split of Prasinodermophyta and Chlorophyta. The HRS TFs were originated later in the Streptrophycean algae. We also identified the asymmetric expansion of this TF repertoire in land plants majorly shaped by genome duplication and triplication events. The phylogenetic reconstruction coupled with motif analysis revealed that the origin of the specific accessory motifs is a major contributing factor in the functional divergence which led to the evolution of different sub-families preceding the angiosperm radiation. The spatiotemporal gene expression analysis in different developmental stages and nutrient availability conditions in angiosperms identified a critical role of expression divergence in shaping the functions of these TF families which is essential for adaptive plasticity of plants.",

In the absence of distractors, second target detection performance fluctuated at the theta rhythm, but the fluctuation frequency shifted toward alpha rhythm when distractors were interspersed with the targets. We further show, in magnetoencephalography experiments, that a change in the dominant frequency of ongoing neural oscillations accompanied those in perceptual performance, with the parietal theta being more pronounced in the no-distractor and the occipital alpha in the distractor conditions, respectively. We propose that perceptual rhythms may depend on the power balance between ongoing neural oscillations, determined by the task-specific demand.",

Thus, the current study evaluated the effect of perforant path fiber loss on neuronal activity in CA3 and layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) in relation to mnemonic similarity task performance. Expression of the immediate early gene Arc was quantified in rats that received a unilateral right hemisphere transection of the perforant path or sham surgery that cut the cortex but left the fibers intact. Behavior-related expression of Arc mRNA was measured to test the hypothesis that fiber loss leads to elevated activation of CA3 and LEC neurons, as previously observed in aged rats that were impaired on the mnemonic similarity task. Transection of perforant path fibers, which has previously been shown to lead to a decline in mnemonic similarity task performance, did not alter Arc expression. Arc expression in CA3, however, was correlated with task performance on the more difficult discrimination trials across both surgical groups. These observations further support a link between CA3 activity and mnemonic similarity task performance but suggest the reduced input from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, as observed in old age, does not causatively elevate CA3 activity.",

    "abstract": "An essential step toward reconstructing pathogen transmission and answering epidemiologically relevant questions from genomic data is obtaining pairwise genetic distance between infections. For recombining organisms such as malaria parasites, relatedness measures quantifying recent shared ancestry would provide a meaningful distance, suggesting methods based on identity by descent (IBD). While the concept of relatedness and consequently an IBD approach is fairly straightforward for individual parasites, the distance between polyclonal infections, which are prevalent in malaria, presents specific challenges and awaits a general solution that could be applied to infections of any clonality and accommodate multiallelic (e.g. microsatellite or microhaplotype) and biallelic (SNP) data. Filling this methodological gap, we present Dcifer (Distance for complex infections: fast estimation of relatedness), a method for calculating genetic distance between polyclonal infections, which is designed for unphased data, explicitly accounts for population allele frequencies and complexity of infection, and provides reliable inference. Dcifers IBD-based framework allows us to define model parameters that represent interhost relatedness and to propose corresponding estimators with attractive statistical properties. By using combinatorics to account for unobserved phased haplotypes, Dcifer is able to quickly process large datasets and estimate pairwise relatedness along with measures of uncertainty. We show that Dcifer delivers accurate and interpretable results and detects related infections with statistical power that is 2-4 times greater than that of approaches based on identity by state. Applications to real data indicate that relatedness structure aligns with geographic locations. Dcifer is implemented in a comprehensive publicly available software package.",

    "abstract": "Creating and curating knowledge resources has been a paramount activity in the biomedical domain. In recent years, automated methods for knowledge base construction have flourished and have enabled large scale construction and curation of such resources. In the biological domain, techniques such as next generation sequencing produce new data at exponential rate, making mere manual curation of knowledge resources simply unfeasible. The major technology to automate knowledge base construction is Information Extraction -- specifically tasks such as Named Entity Recognition or Relation Extraction. The major hurdle for IE methods is the availability of labelled data for training, which can be prohibitively expensive and challenging to obtain due to the need of domain experts. Active learning aims at minimizing the cost of manual labelling by only requiring it for smaller and more useful portions of the data. With this motivation, we devised a method to quickly construct highly curated datasets to enable biomedical knowledge base construction. The method, named BioAct, is based on a partnership between automatic annotation methods (leveraging SciBERT with other machine learning models) and subject matter experts and uses active learning to create training datasets in the biological domain. The main contribution of this work is twofold; in addition to the BioAct method itself, we publicly release an annotated dataset on antimicrobial resistance, produced by a team of subject matter experts using BioAct. Additionally, we simulate a knowledge base construction task using the MegaRes and CARD knowledge bases to provide insight and lessons learned about the usefulness of the annotated dataset for this task.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel, scan-centric method for characterizing peaks from direct injection multi-scan Fourier transform mass spectra of complex samples that utilizes frequency values derived directly from the spacing of raw m/z points in spectral scans. Our peak characterization method utilizes intensity independent noise removal and normalization of scan-level data to provide a much better fit of relative intensity to natural abundance probabilities for low abundance isotopologues that are not present in all of the acquired scans. Moreover, our method calculates both peak- and scan-specific statistics incorporated within a series of quality control steps that are designed to robustly derive peak centers, intensities and intensity ratios with their scan-level variances. These cross-scan characterized peaks are suitable for use in our previously published peak assignment methodology, Small Molecule Isotope Resolved Formula Enumeration (SMIRFE).",

    "abstract": "Plants have developed intricate mechanisms to adapt to changing light conditions. Besides photo- and heliotropism (the differential growth towards light and the diurnal motion with respect to sunlight), chloroplast motion acts as a fast mechanism to change the intracellular structure of leaf cells. While chloroplasts move towards the sides of the plant cell to avoid strong light, they accumulate and spread out into a layer on the bottom of the cell at low light to increase the light absorption efficiency. Although the motion of chloroplasts has been studied for over a century, the collective organelle-motion leading to light adapting self-organized structures remains elusive. Here, we study the active motion of chloroplasts under dim light conditions, leading to an accumulation in a densely packed quasi-2D layer. We observe burst-like re-arrangements and show that these dynamics resemble systems close to the glass transition by tracking individual chloroplasts. Furthermore, we provide a minimal mathematical model to uncover relevant system parameters controlling the stability of the dense configuration of chloroplasts. Our study suggests that the meta-stable caging close to the glass-transition in the chloroplast mono-layer serves a physiological relevance: chloroplasts remain in a spread-out configuration to increase the light uptake, but can easily fluidize when the activity is increased to efficiently rearrange the structure towards an avoidance state. Our research opens new questions about the role that dynamical phase transitions could play in self-organized intracellular responses of plant cells towards environmental cues.",

    "abstract": "Availability of essential food resources is one of the most important drivers of survival. Animals must either relocate or adapt to persist in environments where critical resource abundance is changing. Investigating a species ability to respond to alternative conditions can reveal a myriad of responses. An optimal diet balances energy gain, water regulation, and nutrition. We used flow-through respirometry to characterize metabolic phenotypes of the desert-adapted cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus) under diurnally variable environmental conditions that mimic the environment of the Sonoran Desert. We treated mice with two different energy-controlled diets, a standard diet and a low-fat diet, and measured energy expenditure, rate of water loss, respiratory quotient, weight, and electrolyte levels. Mice fed the low-fat diet lost significantly more water than those on the standard diet. Our results suggest that cactus mice may have limited capacity to tolerate water deprivation if optimal foods become less abundant. Given that climate change is predicted to modify the distribution of food items, understanding these links may have important implications for long-term population viability for desert and non-desert adapted animals alike.",

    "abstract": "Structured synopsisO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe current mutagenesis tools for Acinetobacter baumannii leave selection markers or residual sequences behind, or involve tedious counterselection and screening steps. Furthermore, they are usually adapted for model strains, rather than to multidrug resistant (MDR) clinical isolates.\n\nObjectivesTo develop a scar-free genome editing tool suitable for chromosomal and plasmid modifications in MDR A. baumannii AB5075.\n\nMethodsWe prove the efficiency of our adapted genome editing system by deleting the multidrug efflux pumps craA and cmlA5, as well as curing plasmid p1AB5075. We then characterised the antibiotic sensitivity phenotype of the mutants compared to the wild type for chloramphenicol, tobramycin and amikacin by disc diffusion assays and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration for each strain.\n\nResultsWe successfully adapted the genome editing protocol to A. baumannii AB5075, achieving a double recombination frequency close to 100% and securing the construction of a mutant within 10 work days. Furthermore, we show that the {Delta}craA has a strong sensitivity to chloramphenicol, tobramycin and amikacin, whereas the {Delta}cmlA5 mutant does not show a significant decrease in viability for the antibiotics tested. On the other hand, the removal of p1AB5075 produced an increased sensitivity to tobramycin and amikacin.\n\nConclusionWe have adapted a highly efficient genome editing tool for A. baumannii and proved that craA has a broader substrate range than previously thought. On the other hand, whereas cmlA5 is annotated as a chloramphenicol efflux pump and is encoded within an aminoglycoside resistance island, it does not provide resistance to any of those compounds.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural intensification and urban development have drastically influenced pollinators living in semi-natural grasslands. Pollinators are likely to have different responses to these land-use changes; some decline rapidly while others maintain or increase their populations. We predicted differences in interspecific response to land-use changes are partly attributed to differences in habitat preference. We examined the distribution and flower use patterns of two closely related Eucera species with different habitat preferences. Study sites were meadows surrounding traditional, intensified, and urbanised agricultural lands in the Osaka-Kobe metropolitan area, Japan. Forest-associated Eucera nipponensis were significantly fewer in consolidated and urbanised meadows than traditional meadows, whereas open land-associated E. spurcatipes exhibited the opposite. A significant negative relationship between their abundances was also found. Both species foraged on legume flowers most frequently (83.5%), but floral use pattern was significantly different in traditional and consolidated meadows. Bee species preferring stable habitats were vulnerable to land consolidation and urbanisation, while species associated with disturbed habitats maintained or increased population size in meadows with the land-use changes. Thus, recent land uses may have different impacts on species with different habitat preferences.",
