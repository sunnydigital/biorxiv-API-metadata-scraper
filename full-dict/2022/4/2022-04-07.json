    "abstract": "Due to the vital roles of macrophages in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, targeting macrophages could be a new therapeutic direction. Here, we investigated the efficacy of niclosamide for the resolution of perturbed microenvironment caused by dysregulated macrophages in a mouse model of endometriosis. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed the heterogeneity of macrophage subpopulations including three newly identified intermediate subtypes with sharing characteristics of traditional \"small\" or \"large\" peritoneal macrophages (SPMs and LPMs) in the peritoneal cavity. Endometriosis-like lesions (ELL) enhanced the differentiation of recruited macrophages, promoted the replenishment of resident LPMs, and increased ablation of embryo-derived LPMs, which were stepwise suppressed by niclosamide. In addition, niclosamide reversed intercellular communications between macrophages and B cells which were disrupted by ELL. Therefore, niclosamide rescued the perturbed microenvironment in endometriosis through its fine regulations on the dynamic progression of macrophages and could be a new promising therapy for endometriosis.\n\nSummaryNiclosamide tunes the dynamic progression of peritoneal macrophages and their intercellular communications with B cells to rescue the disrupted microenvironment in the peritoneal cavity in a mouse model of endometriosis.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487220v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e6700eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c6c557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c60b92org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@121bce6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphic AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The -keto acid dehydrogenase complex family catalyzes the essential oxidative decarboxylation of -keto acids to yield acyl-CoA and NADH. Despite performing the same overarching reaction, members of the family have different component structures and structural organization between each other and across phylogenetic species. While native structures of -keto acid dehydrogenase complexes from bacteria and fungi became available recently, the atomic structure and organization of their mammalian counterparts in their native states remain unknown. Here, we report the cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of the endogenous cubic 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) and icosahedral pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cores from bovine kidney determined at 3.5 [A] and 3.8 [A] resolution, respectively. The structures of multiple protein were reconstructed from a single lysate sample, allowing direct structural comparison without the concerns of differences arising from sample preparation and structure determination. Although native and recombinant E2 core scaffold structures are similar, native structures are decorated with their peripheral E1 and E3 subunits. Asymmetric sub-particle reconstructions support heterogeneity in the arrangements of these peripheral subunits. Additionally, despite sharing a similar monomeric fold, OGDC and PDC E2 cores have distinct interdomain and intertrimer interactions, which suggests a means of modulating self-assembly to mitigate heterologous binding between mismatched E2 species. The lipoyl moiety lies near a mobile gatekeeper within the interdomain active site of OGDC E2 and PDC E2. Analysis of the two-fold related intertrimer interface identified secondary structural differences and chemical interactions between icosahedral and cubic geometries of the core. Taken together, our study provides direct structural comparison of OGDC and PDC from the same source and offers new insights into determinants of interdomain interactions and of architecture diversity among -keto acid dehydrogenase complexes.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, mRNAs with long poly(A) tails are translationally active, whereas deadenylation of the tails decreases translation and uridylation of the short poly(A) tails causes the mRNA to be degraded. In this study, we confirmed that maternal cyclin B mRNAs with long poly(A) tails in blastula embryos of invertebrate starfish were deadenylated and uridylated, followed by decay. In starfish oocytes, however, cyclin B mRNAs with uridylated short poly(A) tails are stable. They are polyadenylated and translationally active immediately following hormonal stimulation for resumption of meiosis. Similarly, maternal ribosomal protein mRNAs, Rps29 and Rpl27a, which become uridylated following deadenylation upon hormonal stimulation, remain stable even after fertilisation and early development. At the morula stage, the uridylated maternal ribosomal protein mRNAs are modified to yield non-canonical poly (A) tails rich in U and G residues in the 5 region and in A residues at the 3 end, rendering them translationally active. These results indicate that the fates of uridylated mRNAs in starfish are decay and/or recycling.",

    "abstract": "Selection can be described as a process of information accumulation21. The present work extends this for frequency-dependent selection. For recombination, it is shown that the total entropy change can be calculated by summing the contributions of the individual gene loci in this case as well.\n\nFor more complex replicator systems with and without recombination with randomly selected interaction matrix values (defining the fitness landscape), a detailed investigation is made of how the number of replicators (\"genotypes\") surviving, the mean fitness, and the entropy change depend on the number of replicators initially present, on their initial frequencies, and on certain properties (symmetry: aij=aji versus aij=aji) of the interaction matrix. Survival of several to many replicators is the norm rather than the exception. The more survive, the smaller the entropy change due to selection, although this is no longer generally true for asymmetric interaction matrices. Cases deviating from the rule were studied, but their systematic classification is still lacking. Finally, how evolution alters replicator systems of greater complexity was analyzed. It is shown that different evolutionary algorithms can lead to an increase in mean fitness and/or an increase in the number of surviving replicators. In contrast to simple replicator systems, coexistence in more complex ones apparently results naturally as a consequence of selection and evolution. It results that the view that: \"Evolution is based on a fierce competition between individuals and should therefore reward only selfish behavior\"16 is merely an artifact that follows from the study of unrealistically simple systems.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSexually dimorphic behaviours, such as parental care, have long been thought to be driven mostly, if not exclusively, by gonadal hormones. In the past two decades, a few studies have challenged this view, highlighting the direct influence of the sex chromosome complement (XX vs XY or ZZ vs ZW). The African pygmy mouse, Mus minutoides, is a wild mouse species with naturally occurring XY sex reversal induced by a third, feminizing X* chromosome, leading to three female genotypes: XX, XX* and X*Y. Here, we show that sex reversal in X*Y females shapes a divergent maternal care strategy from both XX and XX* females, rather than altering care quality. In addition, we show that sex reversal may also impact the dopaminergic system in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, consistent with one component of maternal care: pup retrieval. Combining behavioural ecology and neurobiology in a rodent subject to natural selection, we evaluate potential candidates for the neural basis of maternal behaviours and strengthen the underestimated role of the sex chromosomes in shaping sex differences in brain and behaviours. All things considered, we further highlight the emergence of a third sexual phenotype, challenging the binary view of phenotypic sexes.",

    "abstract": "On macroevolutionary timescales, extensive mutations and phylogenetic uncertainty mask the signals of genotype-phenotype associations underlying convergent evolution. To overcome this problem, we extended the widely used framework of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratios and developed the novel metric{omega} C, which measures the error-corrected convergence rate of protein evolution. While{omega} C distinguishes natural selection from genetic noise and phylogenetic errors in simulation and real examples, its accuracy allows an exploratory genome-wide search of adaptive molecular convergence without phenotypic hypothesis or candidate genes. Using gene expression data, we explored over 20 million branch combinations in vertebrate genes and identified the joint convergence of expression patterns and protein sequences with amino acid substitutions in functionally important sites, providing hypotheses on undiscovered phenotypes. We further extended our method with a heuristic algorithm to detect highly repetitive convergence among computationally nontrivial higher-order phylogenetic combinations. Our approach allows bidirectional searches for genotype-phenotype associations, even in lineages that diverged for hundreds of millions of years.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria species that must obligately replicate in vertebrate host cells make up a large proportion of the prokaryotic pathogens with human and veterinary health implications. In such bacterial taxa, extrinsic processes play an important role in influencing the phylogenetic diversity of viable hosts ( host range). These processes include both changes in host population densities and shifts in host geographic distributions. In Europe, distinct genetic strains of the tick-vectored bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum circulate among mammals in three discrete enzootic cycles. To date, the factors that contributed to the emergence of these strains have been poorly studied. Here we show that the strain which predominately infects roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is evolutionarily derived. Its divergence from a likely host-generalist ancestor occurred after the last glacial maximum as mammal populations, including roe deer, recolonized the European mainland from southern refugia. We also provide evidence that this host-specialist strains effective population size (Ne) has tracked changes in the population of its roe deer host. Specifically, both host and bacterium appear to have undergone substantial increases in Ne over the past 1,500 years. In contrast, we show that while it appears to have undergone a major population expansion starting [~]3,500 years ago, in the past 500 years the contemporary host-generalist strain has experienced a substantial reduction in genetic diversity levels, possible as the result of reduced transmission opportunities between competent hosts.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe findings of this study are some of the first to examine specific events in the evolution of host specialization in a naturally occurring, obligately intracellular bacterial species. They show that host range shifts and the emergence of host specialization may occur during periods of population growth in a host-generalist ancestor. The results discussed here also show the close correlation between demographic patterns in host and pathogen for a specialist system. These findings have important relevance for our understanding of the evolution of host-range diversity. They may inform future work on host-range dynamics and provide insights for understanding the emergence of pathogens which have human and veterinary health implications.",

There is increasing evidence that antibodies utilize transient homotypic interactions to enhance function, and elucidation of such interactions can provide insights into their biology and new opportunities for their optimization as drugs. Yet the transitory nature of weak interactions makes them difficult to investigate. Capitalizing on their rich structural data and high conservation, we have characterized all the ways that antibody Fab regions interact crystallographically. This approach led to the discovery of previously unrealized interfaces between antibodies. While diverse interactions exist, {beta}-sheet dimers and variable-constant elbow dimers are recurrent motifs. Disulfide engineering enabled interactions to be trapped and investigated structurally and functionally, providing experimental validation of the interfaces and illustrating their potential for optimization. This work provides first insight into previously undiscovered oligomeric interactions between antibodies, and enables new opportunities for their biotherapeutic optimization.",

    "abstract": "AniA, the nitrite reductase from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been shown to play a crucial role in the infection mechanism of this microorganism by producing NO and abolishing epithelial exfoliation. This enzyme is a trimer with one type-1 copper center per subunit and one type 2 copper center in the subunits interface, with the latter being the catalytic site. The two centers were characterized by visible, EPR and CD spectroscopy for the first time, indicating that AniAs type 1 copper center has a high rhombicity, which is attributed to its tetrahedral geometry, and shorter Met-Cu bond, while type 2 copper center has the usual properties, though with a shorter hyperfine coupling constant (A//= 9.1 mT). The thermostability of AniA was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry showing a single endothermic transition in the thermogram, with a maximum at 95 {degrees}C, while the CD spectra in the visible region indicates the presence of copper centers at 85-90 {degrees}C. The reoxidation rates of AniA in the presence of nitrite were analyzed by visible spectroscopy showing a pH dependence and being higher at pH 6.0. The high thermostability of this enzyme might be important for maintaining a high activity in the extracellular space and be less prone to denaturation and proteolysis, contributing to the proliferation of N. gonorrhoeae.",

    "abstract": "The coenzyme F420-dependent sulfite reductase (Fsr group I) protects hydrogenotrophic methanogens, one of the main contributors in worldwide methane emission, from toxic sulfite. Fsr is a single peptide composed of a F420H2-oxidase and a novel class of sulfite reductase. Both catalytic domains have been proposed to be the ancestors of modern F420-oxido/reductases and dissimilatory/assimilatory sulfite reductases. Here, we describe the X-ray crystal structures of Fsr natively isolated from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjFsr) and Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus (MtFsr), respectively refined to 2.30 [A] and 1.55 [A] resolution. In both organisms, Fsr oligomerizes as a 280-kDa homotetramer, where each siroheme-[4Fe-4S] is catalytically active, in contrast to dissimilatory homologues. The siroheme-[4Fe-4S], embedded in the sulfite reductase domain, is electronically connected to the flavin in the F420H2-oxidase domain by five [4Fe-4S]-clusters. EPR spectroscopy determined the redox potentials of these [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ clusters (-435 to -275 mV), through which electrons flow from FAD to the siroheme-[4Fe-4S]2+/1+ (siroheme, -114 mV; [4Fe-4S] -445 mV). The electron relay is mainly organized by two inserted ferredoxin modules, which stabilize the higher degree of oligomerization. While the F420H2-oxidase part is similar to the {beta}-subunit of F420-reducing hydrogenases, the sulfite reductase domain is structurally analogous to dissimilatory sulfite reductases, whereas its siroheme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor is bound in the same way as in assimilatory ones. Accordingly, the reaction of MtFsr is unidirectional, reducing sulfite or nitrite with F420H2. Our results provide the first structural insights into this unique fusion, a snapshot of a primitive sulfite reductase that turns a poison into an elementary block of Life.",

It is not yet understood how these structures vary throughout a single organ or amongst the same organs within the human population. We have developed an extensive lipid and cellular atlas of the human kidney consisting of over 3 million cells comprising 75,000 functional tissue units (i.e., glomeruli, proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts) from 13 human subjects. This atlas was developed using spatially registered and integrated technologies consisting of imaging mass spectrometry, multiplexed immunofluorescence, stained microscopy, and autofluorescence microscopy, to comprehensively probe large (i.e., centimeter-sized) areas of tissue. The cellular organization and lipid profiles of glomeruli, proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts were discovered through these multimodal imaging data as well as their intra- and inter-subject variance. Relating the lipid profiles obtained from imaging mass spectrometry to distinct cell types obtained from immunofluorescence allowed us to hypothesize the functional role of specific phospholipids that have not previously been described. These hypotheses include subject characteristics, such as BMI and sex. The integrated data from the aforementioned datasets provide a valuable reference for kidney researchers, are publicly available through the NIH Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/), and discussed below.",

However, co-profiling of inner proteins remains challenging. Here, we present the high-throughput, multiplexed analysis of extracellular vesicle inner and outer proteins (EVPio). We describe the optimization of fixation and heat-induced protein epitope retrieval for EVs, along with oligo-barcoded antibodies and branched DNA signal amplification for sensitive, multiplexed and high-throughput assays. We captured 4 subpopulations of EVs from colorectal cancer cell lines HT29 and SW403 based on EpCAM, CD9, CD63 and CD81 expression, and quantified the co-expression of 8 outer (integrins and tetraspanins) and 4 inner (heat shock, endosomal and inner leaflet) proteins. The differences in co-expression patterns were consistent with the literature and known biological function. In conclusion, EVPio analysis can simultaneously detect multiple inner and outer proteins in EVs immobilized on a surface, opening the way to extensive combinatorial protein profiles for both discovery and clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology has provided a simple yet powerful system for targeted genome editing. Compared with previous gene-editing tools, the CRISPR-Cas9 system identifies target sites by the complementarity between the guide RNA (gRNA) and the DNA sequence, which is less expensive and time-consuming, as well as more precise and scalable. To effectively apply the CRISPR-Cas9 system, researchers need to identify target sites that can be cleaved efficiently and for which the candidate gRNAs have little or no cleavage at other genomic locations. For this reason, numerous computational approaches have been developed to predict cleavage efficiency and exclude undesirable targets. However, current design tools cannot robustly predict experimental success as prediction accuracy depends on the assumptions of the underlying model and how closely the experimental setup matches the training data. Moreover, the most successful tools implement complex machine learning and deep learning models, leading to predictions that are not easily interpretable.\n\nHere, we introduce CRISPRedict, a simple linear model that provides accurate and inter-pretable predictions for guide design. Comprehensive evaluation on twelve independent datasets demonstrated that CRISPRedict has an equivalent performance with the currently most accurate tools and outperforms the remaining ones. Moreover, it has the most robust performance for both U6 and T7 data, illustrating its applicability to tasks under different conditions. Therefore, our system can assist researchers in the gRNA design process by providing accurate and explainable predictions. These predictions can then be used to guide genome editing experiments and make plausible hypotheses for further investigation.

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) is associated with lung cancer, yet its role in the tumorigenesis remains uncertain. Herein we find that SP attaches to lung cancer cells via binding pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) to platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), a receptor overexpressed in lung tumors. Interaction between PspC and PAFR stimulates cell proliferation and activates PI3K/AKT and NF-kB signaling pathways, which triggers a pro-inflammatory response. Lung cancer cells infected with SP rapidly form larger tumors in BALB/C mice compared to untreated cells. Mice treated with tobacco carcinogen and SP develop more lung tumors and had shorter survival than mice treated with the carcinogen alone. Mutating PspC or deleting PAFR abolishes the tumor-promoting effects of SP. Overabundance of SP is found in lung tumors of patients with lung cancer and associated with the survival. SP plays a driving role in lung tumorigenesis by activating PI3K/AKT and NF-kB pathways via binding PspC to PAFR and provides a microbial target for diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder defined by the onset of intrusive, avoidant, negative cognitive or affective, and/or hyperarousal symptoms after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. Previous voxel-based morphometry studies have provided insight into structural brain alterations associated with PTSD with notable heterogeneity across these studies. Furthermore, how structural alterations may be associated with brain function, as measured by task-free and task-based functional connectivity, remains to be elucidated.\n\nMethodsUsing emergent metaanalytic techniques, we sought to first identify a consensus of structural alterations in PTSD using the anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Next, we generated functional profiles of identified convergent structural regions utilizing resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and meta-analytic coactivation modeling (MACM) methods. Finally, we performed functional decoding to examine mental functions associated with our ALE, rsFC, and MACM brain characterizations.\n\nResultsWe observed convergent structural alterations in a single region located in the medial prefrontal cortex. The resultant rsFC and MACM maps identified functional connectivity across a widespread, whole-brain network that included frontoparietal and limbic regions. Functional decoding revealed overlapping associations with attention, memory, and emotion processes.\n\nConclusionsConsensus-based functional connectivity was observed in regions of the default mode, salience, and central executive networks, which play a role in the tripartite model of psychopathology. Taken together, these findings have important implications in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with PTSD.",

    "abstract": "Cyst formation is a key feature of the T. gondii life cycle but the genetic networks that drive this process are not yet fully characterized. To identify new components of this network, we compared T. gondii to its nearest extant relative Hammondia hammondi given the critical differences between these species in the timing and efficiency of cyst formation. Using transcriptional data from critical developmental and pH exposure time points from both species, we identified the gene TGVEG_311100, which we named Regulator of Cystogenesis 1 (ROCY1), as being both necessary and sufficient for cyst formation in T. gondii. Compared to WT parasites, TGVEG{Delta}ROCY1 parasites formed significantly fewer tissue cysts in response to alkaline pH stress in vitro and cysts were nearly undetectable in mouse brains for up to 9 weeks post-infection. Overexpression of tagged ROCY1 in WT parasites was sufficient to induce cyst formation in vitro in both WT and ROCY1-deficient parasites, demonstrating that ROCY1 is both necessary and sufficient for cyst formation. Moreover this induction of cyst formation required at least 1 of 3 predicted CCCH Zinc finger domains. Mice chronically infected with {Delta}ROCY1 parasites had detectable tachyzoites in the brain for up to 37 days post-infection (while mice infected with WT parasites did not), and CNS transcriptional analyses at day 30 post-infection throughout the chronic phase of infection revealed inflammatory signatures consistent with acute infection in {Delta}ROCY1 parasites compared to WT. Despite our inability to detect brain cysts in infected mice, both WT and {Delta}ROCY1 knockout parasites reactivated after dexamethasone treatment with similar timing and magnitude for up to 5 months post infection, challenging the paradigm that long term parasite persistence in the CNS requires cyst formation. These data identify a new regulator of cyst formation in T. gondii that is both necessary and sufficient for cyst formation, and whose function relies on its conserved nucleic acid binding motif.",

    "abstract": "Iron-bound cyclic tetrapyrroles (hemes) are key redox-active cofactors in membrane-integrated oxygen reductases and other bioenergetic enzymes. However, the mechanisms of heme transport and insertion into respiratory chain complexes remain unclear. Here, we used a combination of cellular, biochemical, structural and computational methods to resolve ongoing controversies around the function of the heterodimeric bacterial ABC transporter CydDC. We provide multi-level evidence that CydDC is a heme transporter required for assembly and functional maturation of cytochrome bd, a pharmaceutically relevant drug target. Our systematic single-particle cryo-EM approach combined with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations provides detailed insight into the conformational landscape of CydDC during substrate binding and occlusion. Our simulations reveal that heme binds laterally from the membrane space to the transmembrane region of CydDC, enabled by a highly asymmetrical inward-facing CydDC conformation. During the binding process, heme propionates interact with positively charged residues on the surface and later in the substrate-binding pocket of the transporter, causing the heme orientation to flip 180 degrees. The membrane-accessible heme entry site of CydDC is primarily controlled by the conformational plasticity of CydD transmembrane helix 4, the extended cytoplasmic segment of which also couples heme confinement to a rotational movement of the CydC nucleotide-binding domain. Our cryo-EM data highlight that this signal transduction mechanism is necessary to drive conformational transitions toward occluded and outward-facing states.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe heterodimeric bacterial ABC transporter CydDC is a heme flippase essential for the functional maturation of cytochrome bd.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a common commensal bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract as well as a frequent nosocomial pathogen. The secreted metalloprotease gelatinase (GelE) is an important E. faecalis virulence factor that contributes to numerous cellular activities such as autolysis, biofilm formation, and biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. Expression of gelE has been extensively studied and is regulated by the Fsr quorum-sensing system. Here, we identify two additional factors regulating gelatinase expression and activity in E. faecalis OG1RF. The Bph phosphatase is required for expression of gelE in an Fsr-dependent manner. Additionally, the membrane-anchored protein foldase PrsA is required for GelE activity, but not fsr or gelE gene expression. Disrupting prsA also leads to increased antibiotic sensitivity in biofilms independent of the loss of GelE activity. Together, our results expand the model for gelatinase production in E. faecalis, which has important implications for fundamental studies of GelE function in Enterococcus and also E. faecalis pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceIn Enterococcus faecalis, gelatinase (GelE) is a virulence factor that is also important for biofilm formation and interactions with other microbes as well as the host immune system. The long-standing model for GelE production is that the Fsr quorum sensing system positively regulates expression of gelE. Here, we update that model by identifying two additional factors that contribute to gelatinase production. The biofilm-associated Bph phosphatase regulates the expression of gelE through Fsr, and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PrsA is required for production of active GelE through an Fsr-independent mechanism. This provides important insight into how regulatory networks outside of the fsr locus coordinate expression of gelatinase.",

We found that isNS1 appeared as an approximately 250 kDa complex of NS1 and ApoA1 and further determined the cryoEM structures of isNS1 and its complex with a monoclonal antibody/Fab.

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a globally prominent human-specific pathogen responsible for an enormous burden of human illnesses, including >600 million pharyngeal and >100 million skin infections each year. Despite intensive efforts that focus on invasive indications, much remains unknown about this bacterium in its natural state during colonization of the nasopharynx and skin. Using acute experimental infection models in HLA-transgenic mice, we evaluated how the hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule contributes to S. pyogenes MGAS8232 infection within these limited biological niches. Herein, we demonstrate that HA capsule expression promotes bacterial burden in murine nasal turbinates and skin lesions by resisting neutrophil-mediated killing. HA capsule production is encoded by the hasABC operon and compared to wildtype S. pyogenes infections, mice infected with a {Delta}hasA mutant exhibited over a 1000-fold CFU reduction at 48-hours post{-}nasal challenge, and a 10,000-fold CFU reduction from skin lesions 72-hours post-skin challenge. HA capsule expression contributed substantially to skin lesion size development following subdermal inoculations. In the absence of capsule expression, S. pyogenes revealed drastically impeded growth in whole human blood and increased susceptibility to killing by isolated neutrophils ex vivo, highlighting its important role in resisting phagocytosis. Furthermore, we establish that neutrophil depletion in mice, but not macrophage depletion, recovered the reduced burden by the {Delta}hasA mutant in both the nasopharynx and skin. Together, this work confirms that the HA capsule is a key virulence determinant during acute infections by S. pyogenes and demonstrates that its predominant function is to protect S. pyogenes against neutrophil-mediated killing.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYStreptococcus pyogenes is a globally disseminated and human-adapted bacterial pathogen that has evolved an arsenal of evasion strategies to overcome and escape host immune clearing mechanisms. Many strains of S. pyogenes are covered by a polysaccharide capsule composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) that is widely recognized to promote severe infections. In this study, we demonstrate using the encapsulated S. pyogenes MGAS8232 strain that the HA capsule is a key virulence factor that facilitates non-invasive infections of the nasopharynx and skin. Although bacterial adhesion and entry into host cells was impeded by HA capsule expression, we show that the key function for both nasal and skin infections is to protect S. pyogenes from neutrophil-mediated killing. Depletion of neutrophils, but not macrophages, recovered the low bacterial burden by unencapsulated S. pyogenes at both sites of infection. Our findings outline an important interaction between the HA capsule and neutrophils in the establishment of acute upper respiratory and skin infections by S. pyogenes.",

    "abstract": "The major nutrients available to the human colonic microbiota are complex glycans derived from the diet. To degrade this highly variable mix of sugar structures, gut microbes have acquired a huge array of different carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), predominantly glycoside hydrolases, many of which have specificities that can be exploited for a range of different applications. Plant N-glycans are prevalent on proteins produced by plants and thus components of the diet, but the breakdown of these complex molecules by the gut microbiota has not been explored. Plant N-glycans are also well characterised allergens in pollen and some plant-based foods, and when plants are used in heterologous protein production for medical applications, the N-glycans present can pose a risk to therapeutic function and stability. Here we use a novel genome association approach for enzyme discovery to identify a breakdown pathway for plant complex N-glycans encoded by a gut Bacteroides species and biochemically characterise five CAZymes involved, including structures of the PNGase and GH92 -mannosidase. These enzymes provide a toolbox for the modification of plant N-glycans for a range of potential applications. Furthermore, the keystone PNGase also has activity against insect-type N-glycans, which we discuss from the perspective of insects as a nutrient source.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of artificial intelligence provides us with new and powerful tools for studying the mysterious relationship between organism evolution and protein evolution. In this work, based on the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB), we perform comparative analyses of the proteins of different organisms. The statistics of AlphaFold-predicted structures show that, for organisms with higher complexity, their constituent proteins will have larger radii of gyration, higher coil fractions, and slower vibrations, statistically. By conducting normal mode analysis and scaling analyses, we demonstrate that higher organismal complexity correlates with lower fractal dimensions in both the structure and dynamics of the constituent proteins, suggesting that higher functional specialization is associated with higher organismal complexity. We also uncover the topology and sequence bases of these correlations. As the organismal complexity increases, the residue contact networks of the constituent proteins will be more assortative, and these proteins will have a higher degree of hydrophilic-hydrophobic segregation in the sequences. Furthermore, by comparing the statistical structural proximity across the proteomes with the phylogenetic tree of homologous proteins, we show that, statistical structural proximity across the proteomes may indirectly reflect the phylogenetic proximity, indicating a statistical trend of protein evolution in parallel with organism evolution. This study provides new insights into how the diversity in the functionality of proteins increases and how the dimensionality of the manifold of protein dynamics reduces during evolution, contributing to the understanding of the origin and evolution of lives.",

Besides, AT1aR knockout promoted energy expenditure and fatty acids oxidation in adipose tissue. cAMP levels and PKA phosphorylation in the adipose tissue were significantly increased in AT1aR-/- rats fed with high-fat. Activated PKA could promote adipose lipolysis and thus improved adipose histomorphology and insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet rats.\n\nConclusionsAT1aR deficiency alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy in high-fat diet rats by promoting adipose lipolysis via cAMP/PKA pathway, and thereby delayed the onset of obesity and related metabolic diseases.",

This study aims to assess the degree of concordance between signals based on irregular incremental lines (ILs) and reported pregnancies.\n\nMaterial and Methods23 recent and 24 archaeological human teeth with known birth history were included in this investigation. 129 histological sections of tooth roots were assessed for irregularities in appearance and width using a standardized protocol. Similarity of observed irregularities at the section level allowed us to define signals at the tooth level. The sensitivity of signals to detect pregnancies was determined and related to the signal prevalence.\n\nResultsPregnancy signals were frequently visually observed. However, applying a standardized process we could only reach signal sensitivities to identify pregnancies up to 20 percentage points above chance level.\n\nConclusionsBased on a standardized and reproducible method it could be confirmed that some pregnancies leave visible signals in the tooth cementum. The results show the potential of the tooth cementum to support reconstruction of life courses in paleopathology. However, it seems that not all pregnancies affect the cementogenesis in such a way that irregular ILs are identifiable. Further research is needed to better understand which type of pregnancies and other conditions are recorded in the tooth cementum.",

    "abstract": "Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) provides a process that uses spatial data and models to evaluate environmental, social, economic, cultural, and management trade-offs when siting ocean industries. Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector in the world. The U.S. has substantial opportunity for offshore aquaculture development given the size of its exclusive economic zone, habitat diversity, and variety of candidate species for cultivation. However, many protected species rely upon habitats that overlap with promising aquaculture areas. Siting surveys, farm construction, operations, and decommissioning can alter the habitat and behavior of animals in the vicinity of these activities. Vessel activity, underwater noise, and physical interactions between protected species and farms can potentially increase the risk of injury or cause direct mortality. In 2020, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was identified as one of the first regions to be evaluated for offshore aquaculture opportunities as directed by a Presidential Executive Order. We developed a generalized scoring model for protected species data layers that captures vulnerability using species conservation status and demographic information. We applied this approach to data layers for eight species listed under the Endangered Species Act, including five species of sea turtles, Rices Whale, Smalltooth Sawfish, and Giant Manta Ray. We evaluated several methods for scoring (e.g., arithmetic mean, geometric mean, product, lowest scoring layer) and created a combined protected species data layer that was used within a multi-criteria decision-making modeling framework for MSP. The product approach for scoring provided the most logical ordering of and the greatest contrast in site suitability scores. This approach provides a transparent and repeatable method to identify aquaculture site alternatives with the least conflict with protected species. These modeling methods are transferable to other regions, to other sensitive or protected species, and for spatial planning for other ocean-uses.",

    "abstract": "An integrated assessment of geographic distribution, genetic variation and interpopulation reproductive barriers of the Great Plains and Great Lakes populations of the Hemileuca maia-nevadensis species complex is presented. The taxonomic circumscription of Hemileuca nevadensis Stretch, key to understanding the complex evolutionary history of the group, has previously been misinterpreted. Detailed distribution maps based on historic, literature, and contemporary occurrence records, combined with analysis of genetic variation using mtDNA-COI barcode sequences and pheromone compatibility trials, indicate that Great Plains H. \"nevadensis\" are disjunct and genetically divergent from nominate H. nevadensis, instead being more closely related to Great Lakes populations. Despite the genomic differentiation of the bog buckmoth established in recent studies, similar or identical mtDNA-COI haplotypes indicate past genetic linkages among now-isolated populations across the northern range periphery of the maia-complex. Based on the current evidence, northern Great Plains Hemileuca latifascia Barnes & McDunnough stat. nov. and eastern Great Lakes (bog buckmoth) Hemileuca menyanthevora Pavulaan stat. nov. (= Hemileuca iroquois Dirig & Cryan syn. nov.) should be considered as species distinct from others in the maia-group. Post-glacial dispersal hypotheses are evaluated in light of molecular variation and ecology, and key knowledge gaps are identified to guide future research.",

    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is responsible for the synthesis of ADP-ribose polymers, which are involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as preservation of genome integrity, DNA damage signaling and repair, molecular switch between distinct cell death pathways and cell cycle progression. Previously, we demonstrated that the only PARP present in T. cruzi migrates to the nucleus upon genotoxic stimulus. In this work, we identify the N-terminal domain as being sufficient for TcPARP nuclear localization and describe for the first time that TcPARP is enriched in the parasite nucleolus. We also describe that TcPARP is present in a thread that connects two dividing nuclei and co-localizes with nucleolar material and microtubules. Furthermore, ADP-ribose polymers could also be detected in this wire during mitosis. These findings represent a first approach to new potential TcPARP functions inside the nucleus and will help understand its role well beyond the largely described DNA damage response protein in trypanosomatids.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe causative link between brain death and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis is unclear, and the distortion in liver metabolism caused by brain death requires further exploration.\n\nMaterial and MethodsA rat model of brain death was constructed and sustained for 9 hours. Intestinal contents and portal vein plasma were collected for microbiota sequencing and microbial metabolite detection. Liver tissue was resected to investigate metabolic alterations, and the results were compared with those of a sham group.\n\nResultsMicrobiota dysbiosis occurred at the family and genus levels after 9 hours of brain death. Microbial metabolites remained unchanged in both the intestinal contents and portal vein plasma. Liver metabolic function deteriorated, and the levels of 80% of the differential metabolites decreased in the brain-dead rats. Most of the differential metabolites were related to energy metabolism.\n\nConclusionsBrain death resulted in microbiota dysbiosis in rats; however, this dysbiosis did not alter microbial metabolites. Deterioration in liver metabolic function during extended periods of brain death may reflect a continuous worsening in energy deficiency.",
