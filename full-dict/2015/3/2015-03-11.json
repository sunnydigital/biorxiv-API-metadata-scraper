    "abstract": "A method for de novo assembly of data from the Oxford Nanopore MinION instrument is presented which is able to reconstruct the sequence of an entire bacterial chromosome in a single contig. Initially, overlaps between nanopore reads are detected. Reads are then subjected to one or more rounds of error correction by a multiple alignment process employing partial order graphs. After correction, reads are assembled using the Celera assembler. Finally, the assembly is polished using signal-level data from the nanopore employing a novel hidden Markov model. We show that this method is able to assemble nanopore reads from Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 into a single contig of length 4.6Mb permitting a full reconstruction of gene order. The resulting draft assembly has 98.4% nucleotide identity compared to the finished reference genome. After polishing the assembly with our signal-level HMM, the nucleotide identity is improved to 99.4%. We show that MinION sequencing data can be used to reconstruct genomes without the need for a reference sequence or data from other sequencing platforms.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the regulatory processes that orchestrate stem cell maintenance is a cornerstone in developmental biology. Here, we present a mathematical model based on a branching process formalism that predicts average rates of proliferative and differentiative divisions in a given stem cell population. In the context of vertebrate spinal neurogenesis, the model predicts complex non-monotonic variations in the rates of pp, pd and dd modes of division as well as in cell cycle length, in agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the model shows that the differentiation probability follows a binomial distribution, allowing us to develop equations to predict the rates of each mode of division. A phenomenological simulation of the developing spinal cord informed with the average cell cycle length and division rates predicted by the mathematical model reproduces the correct dynamics of proliferation and differentiation in terms of average numbers of progenitors and differentiated cells. Overall, the present mathematical framework represents a powerful tool to unveil the changes in the rate and mode of division of a given stem cell pool by simply quantifying numbers of cells at different times.",

    "abstract": "P-bodies (PB) are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that aggregate into cytoplasmic foci when cells are exposed to stress. While the conserved mRNA decay and translational repression machineries are known components of PB, how and why cells assemble RNP complexes into large foci remain unclear. Using mass spectrometry to analyze proteins immunoisolated with the core PB protein Dhh1, we show that a considerable number of proteins contain low-complexity (LC) sequences, similar to proteins highly represented in mammalian RNP granules. We also show that the Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1, which contains an LC domain and controls prion protein aggregation, is required for the formation of Dhh1-GFP foci upon glucose depletion. New classes of proteins that reproducibly co-enrich with Dhh1-GFP during PB induction include proteins involved in nucleotide or amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, tRNA aminoacylation, and protein folding. Many of these proteins have been shown to form foci in response to other stresses. Finally, analysis of RNA associated with Dhh1-GFP shows enrichment of mRNA encoding the PB protein Pat1 and catalytic RNAs along with their associated mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins, suggesting an active role for RNA in PB function. Thus, global characterization of PB composition has uncovered proteins and RNA that are important for PB assembly.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal synaptic activity is probabilistic and because synaptic plasticity depends on its history, the amount of information that can be stored at a synapse is limited. The strong correlation between the size and efficacy of a synapse allowed us to estimate the precision of synaptic plasticity. In an electron microscopic reconstruction of hippocampal neuropil we found single axons making two or more synaptic contacts onto the same dendrites which would have shared histories of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. The postsynaptic spine heads, but not the spine necks, of these pairs were nearly identical in size. The precision is much greater than previous estimates and requires postsynaptic averaging over a time window many seconds to minutes in duration depending on the rate of input spikes and probability of release.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySpine heads on the same dendrite that receive input from the same axon are the same size.",

    "abstract": "\\\"Candidatus Liberibacter africanus\\\" (Laf) has long been recognised as a causal agent of the devastating citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening. This species is currently restricted to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean islands and vectored by the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae. Blotchy mottle on citrus leaves is characteristic of the disease.\\n\\nSomewhat similar symptoms in the Rutaceous tree Calodendrum capensis (Cape Chestnut) resulted in the discovery of Laf outside commercial citrus crops in South Africa. This was classed as a subspecies of Laf (capensis, hence LafC). In subsequent surveys of both commercial citrus crops and Calodendrum, both natural and ornamental specimens, LafC was not found in the citrus crop, nor has Laf been found in C. capensis. HLB was reported from Madagascar in 1968 but no sequences from this source have so far been published.\\n\\nUntil fairly recently, only the reference 16S rRNA gene sequences of Laf (L22533) and LafC (AF137368) had been deposited in GenBank. Both of these reference sequences contain a number of unresolved nucleotides. Resolving these nucleotide positions by aligning against more recently available sequences, it becomes evident that these unresolved positions represent one percentage point difference in similarity between Laf and LafC. The originally reported 97.4% similarity is therefore incorrect based on this new information. Recalculating the similarity on the full length 16S rDNA sequence results in 99.54% similarity, a value too high to justify a subspecies status. LafC should therefore be reduced to that of a haplotype of Laf.\\n\\nFurther, the six 16S rRNA gene sequences currently available in GenBank identified as the species Laf separate into 2 haplotype groups. The 3 haplotypes of Laf are therefore LafA designated as the first accession sequenced (L22533), LafC for the former capensis subspecies and to recognise the prior use of this term, and LafB for the third haplotype not previously recognised. Thus the cryptic presence of 3 haplotypes is revealed by this review of the Laf 16S rDNA sequences.",

    "abstract": "Development, homeostasis and regeneration of tissues result from the interaction of genetics and mechanics. Kinematics and rheology are two main classes of measurements respectively providing deformations and mechanical properties of a material. They are now applied to living tissues and have contributed to the better understanding of their mechanics. Due to the complexity of living tissues, however, a third class of mechanical measurements, that of in situ forces and stresses, appears to be increasingly important to elaborate realistic models of tissue mechanics. We review here several emerging techniques of this class, their fields of applications, their advantages and limitations, and their validations. We argue that they will strongly impact on our understanding of developmental biology in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete lineage sorting can cause incongruencies of the overall species-level phylogenetic tree with the phylogenetic trees for individual genes or genomic segments. If these incongruencies are not accounted for, it is possible to incur several biases in species tree estimation. Here, we present a simple maximum likelihood approach that accounts for ancestral variation and incomplete lineage sorting. We use a POlymorphisms-aware phylogenetic MOdel (PoMo) that we have recently shown to efficiently estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from within and between-species variation data. We extend this model to perform efficient estimation of species trees. We test the performance of PoMo in several different scenarios of incomplete lineage sorting using simulations and compare it with existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed. In contrast to other approaches, our model does not use coalescent theory but is allele-frequency based. We show that PoMo is well suited for genome-wide species tree estimation and that on such data it is more accurate than previous approaches.",
