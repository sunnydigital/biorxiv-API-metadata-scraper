    "abstract": "Documenting the full extent of gene flow during speciation poses a challenge, as species ranges change over time and current rates of hybridisation might not reflect historical trends. Theoretical work has emphasized the potential for speciation in the face of ongoing hybridisation, and the genetic mechanisms that might facilitate this process. However, elucidating how the rate of gene flow between species may have changed over time has proved difficult. Here we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit a model of speciation between the Neotropical butterflies Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno. These species are ecologically divergent, rarely hybridize and display female hybrid sterility. Nevertheless, previous genomic studies suggests pervasive gene flow between them, extending deep into their past, and potentially throughout the speciation process. By modelling the rates of gene flow during early and later stages of speciation, we find that these species have been hybridising for hundreds of thousands of years, but have not done so continuously since their initial divergence. Instead, it appears that gene flow was rare or absent for as long as a million years in the early stages of speciation. Therefore, by dissecting the timing of gene flow between these species, we are able to reject a scenario of purely sympatric speciation in the face of continuous gene flow. We suggest that the period of minimal contact early in speciation may have allowed for the accumulation of genomic changes that later enabled these species to remain distinct despite a dramatic increase in the rate of hybridisation.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk, and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves LD-pruning markers and applying a P-value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and may reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce a new method, LDpred, which infers the posterior mean causal effect size of each marker using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the pruning/thresholding approach, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, prediction R2 increased from 20.1% to 25.3% in a large schizophrenia data set and from 9.8% to 12.0% in a large multiple sclerosis data set. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease data sets and when predicting in non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.",

    "abstract": "SummaryLarge resequencing projects require a significant amount of storage for raw sequences, as well as alignment files. Since the raw sequences are redundant once the alignment has been generated, it is possible to keep only the alignment files. We present BamHash, a checksum based method to ensure that the read pairs in FASTQ files match exactly the read pairs stored in BAM files, regardless of the ordering of reads. BamHash can be used to verify the integrity of the files stored and discover any discrepancies. Thus, BamHash can be used to determine if it is safe to delete the FASTQ files storing raw sequencing reads after alignment, without the loss of data.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe software is implemented in C++, GPL licensed and available at https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/BamHash\\n\\nContactpmelsted@hi.is",

    "abstract": "Much recent debate has focused on the role of rare variants in complex phenotypes. However, it is well known that rare alleles can only contribute a substantial proportion of the phenotypic variance when they have much larger effect sizes than common variants, which is most easily explained by natural selection constraining trait-altering alleles to low frequency. It is also plausible that demographic events will influence the genetic architecture of complex traits. Unfortunately, most rare variant association tests do not explicitly model natural selection or non-equilibrium demography. Here, we develop a novel evolutionary model of complex traits. We perform numerical calculations and simulate phenotypes under this model using inferred human demographic and selection parameters. We show that rare variants only contribute substantially to complex traits under very strong assumptions about the relationship between effect size and selection strength. We then assess the performance of state-of-the-art rare variant tests using our simulations across a broad range of model parameters. Counterintuitively, we find that statistical power is lowest when rare variants make the greatest contribution to the additive variance, and that power is substantially lower under our model than previously studied models. While many empirical studies have attempted to identify causal loci using rare variant association methods, few have reported novel associations. Some authors have interpreted this to mean that rare variants contribute little to heritability, but our results show that an alternative explanation is that rare variant tests have less power than previously estimated.",

    "abstract": "We have fully sequenced the genome of an individual from the region of Saudi Arabia. In order to facilitate comparative analysis, an initial characterization of the new genome was undertaken based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The SNP data having associated population statistics, essentially the HapMap, served to identify features that were rare by comparison. Methods were developed and applied to tag observed SNPs as different and were extended to identify strings or clusters of difference in the individual relative to comparison populations to effectively increase the significance over single SNP comparison. Difference strings identified in the individual relative to each comparison population showed a genome location pattern with various levels of overlap between the comparison populations. The SNP frequencies from the HapMap population samples Ceu and Yri showed a difference inversion relative to the sample genome. The total SNP difference count was greatest between the individual and the Yri population sample while the number and total span of SNP difference clusters was greatest in comparison with the Ceu population sample. The final pattern of difference clusters has served to define distinctive features in the individual genome toward preliminary characterization.",

    "abstract": "The cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling is a broad specificity pathway that plays important roles in the transduction of environmental signals triggering precise physiological responses. cAMP-signal transduction specificity is achieved and controlled at several levels. The Saccharomyces cereviciae PKA holoenzyme consists of two catalytic subunits encoded by TPK1, TPK2 and TPK3 genes, and two regulatory subunits encoded by BCY1 gene. In this work we studied the activity of these gene promoters using a reporter-synthetic genetic array screen, with the goal of identifying novel regulators of PKA subunits expression. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the regulators identified showed that these regulators were enriched for annotations associated with roles in several GO biological process, as lipid and phosphate metabolism or transcription regulation and regulate all or some of the four promoters. Further characterization of the effect of these pathways on promoter activity and mRNA levels pointed to inositol, inositol polyphosphates, choline and phosphate as novel upstream signals that regulate transcription of PKA subunit genes. In addition, within each category there are genes that regulate only one of the promoters and genes that regulate more than one of them at the same time. These results support the role of transcription regulation of each PKA subunit in cAMP specificity signaling. Interestingly, many of the known targets of PKA phosphorylation are associated with the identified pathways, opening the possibility of a reciprocal regulation in which PKA would be coordinating different metabolic pathways and these processes would in turn, regulate expression of the kinase subunits.",
