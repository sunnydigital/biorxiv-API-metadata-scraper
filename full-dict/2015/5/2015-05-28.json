    "abstract": "Metabolomic profiling is an emerging technique in life sciences. Human studies using these techniques have been performed in a small number of individuals or have been targeted at a restricted number of metabolites. In this article, we propose a data analysis workflow to perform non-targeted metabolomic profiling in large human population-based studies using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We describe challenges and propose solutions for quality control, statistical analysis and annotation of metabolic features. Using the data analysis workflow, we detected more than 8,000 metabolic features in serum samples from 2,489 fasting individuals. As an illustrative example, we performed a non-targeted metabolome-wide association analysis of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and detected 407 metabolic features corresponding to 90 unique metabolites that could be replicated in an external population. Our results reveal unexpected biological associations, such as metabolites identified as monoacylphosphorylcholines (LysoPC) being negatively associated with hsCRP. R code and fragmentation spectra for all metabolites are made publically available. In conclusion, the results presented here illustrate the viability and potential of non-targeted metabolomic profiling in large population-based studies.",

    "abstract": "One of the major goals of population genetics is to quantitatively understand variation of genetic polymorphisms among individuals. To this end, researchers have developed sophisticated statistical methods to capture the complex population structure that underlies observed genotypes in humans, and such methods have been effective for analyzing modestly sized genomic data sets. However, the number of genotyped humans has grown significantly in recent years, and it is accelerating. In aggregate about 1M individuals have been genotyped to date. Analyzing these data will bring us closer to a nearly complete picture of human genetic variation; but existing methods for population genetics analysis do not scale to data of this size. To solve this problem we developed TeraStructure. TeraStructure is a new algorithm to fit Bayesian models of genetic variation in human populations on tera-sample-sized data sets (1012 observed genotypes, e.g., 1M individuals at 1M SNPs). It is a principled approach to Bayesian inference that iterates between subsampling locations of the genome and updating an estimate of the latent population structure of the individuals. On data sets of up to 2K individuals, TeraStructure matches the existing state of the art in terms of both speed and accuracy. On simulated data sets of up to 10K individuals, TeraStructure is twice as fast as existing methods and has higher accuracy in recovering the latent population structure. On genomic data simulated at the tera-sample-size scales, TeraStructure continues to be accurate and is the only method that can complete its analysis.\\n\\nSoftwareTeraStructure is available for download at https://github.com/premgopalan/terastructure.\\n\\nFundingThis research was supported in part by NIH grant R01 HG006448 and ONR grant N00014-12-1-0764.",

    "abstract": "There is high variability in the level of herbivory between individual plants from the same species with potential effects on population dynamics, community composition, and ecosystem structure and function. This variability can be partly explained by associational effects i.e. the impact of the presence of neighboring plants on the level of herbivory experienced by a focal plant, but it is still unclear how the spatial scale of plant neighborhood modulates foraging choice of herbivores; an inherently spatial process in itself. Using a meta-analysis, we investigated how spatial scale modifies associational effects on the susceptibility to browsing by herbivores with movement capacities similar to deer. From 2496 articles found in literature databases, we selected 46 studies providing a total of 168 differences of means in damage by herbivores or survival to woody plants (mostly) with and without neighboring plants. Spatial scales were reported as distance between plants or as plot size. We estimated the relationships between the effect sizes and spatial scale, type of associational effects and nature of the experiment using meta-analysis mixed models. The strength of associational effects declined with increasing plot size, regardless of the type of associational effects. Associational defences (i.e. decrease in herbivory for focal plants associated with unpalatable neighbors) had stronger magnitude than associational susceptibilities. The high remaining heterogeneity among studies suggests that untested factors modulate associational effects, such as nutritional quality of focal and neighboring plants, density of herbivores, timing of browsing, etc. Associational effects are already considered in multiple restoration contexts worldwide, but a better understanding of these relationships could improve their use in conservation, restoration and forest exploitation when browsing is a concern. This study is the first to investigate spatial patterns of associational effects across species and ecosystems, an issue that is essential to determine differential herbivory damages among plants.",

    "abstract": "Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) open up new opportunities for targeted mutagenesis in eukaryotic genomes. Similar to zinc-finger nucleases, sequence-specific DNA-binding domains can be fused with effector domains like the nucleolytically active part of FokI in order to induce double strand breaks (DSBs) and thereby modify the host genome on a predefined target site via non-homologous end joining. More sophisticated applications of programmable endonucleases involve the use of a DNA repair template facilitating homology-directed repair (HDR) so as to create predefined rather than random DNA sequence modifications. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of editing the barley genome by precisely modifying a defined target DNA sequence resulting in a predicted alteration of gene function. We used gfp-specific TALENs along with a repair template that, via HDR, facilitates conversion of gfp into yfp which is associated with a single amino acid exchange in the gene product. As a result of co-bombardment of leaf epidermis, we detected YFP accumulation in about 3 out of 100 mutated cells. The creation of a functional yfp gene via HDR was unambiguously confirmed by sequencing of the respective genomic site. Predictable genetic modifications comprising only a few genomic base pairs rather than entire genes are of particular practical relevance, because they might not fall under the European regulation of genetically engineered organisms. In addition to the allele conversion accomplished in planta, a readily screenable marker system is introduced that might be useful for optimization approaches in the field of genome editing.",
