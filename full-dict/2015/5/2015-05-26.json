    "abstract": "Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can also be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, based on controlling for indirect effects with linear or generalized linear models, also performed well. Indirect effects reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce incorrect inferences, however.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal distribution of recent human adaptation is a long standing question. We developed a new coalescent-based method that collectively assigned human genome regions to modes of neutrality or to positive, negative, or balancing selection. Most importantly, the selection times were estimated for all positive selection signals, which ranged over the last half million years, penetrating the emergence of anatomically modern human (AMH). These selection time estimates were further supported by analyses of the genome sequences from three ancient AMHs and the Neanderthals. A series of brain function-related genes were found to carry signals of ancient selective sweeps, which may have defined the evolution of cognitive abilities either before Neanderthal divergence or during the emergence of AMH. Particularly, signals of brain evolution in AMH are strongly related to Alzheimers disease pathways. In conclusion, this study reports a chronological atlas of natural selection in Human.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is precisely controlled in time and space through the integration of signals that act at gene promoters and gene-distal enhancers. Classically, promoters and enhancers are considered separate classes of regulatory elements, often distinguished by histone modifications. However, recent studies have revealed broad similarities between enhancers and promoters, blurring the distinction: active enhancers often initiate transcription, and some gene promoters have the potential of enhancing transcriptional output of other promoters. Here, we propose a model in which promoters and enhancers are considered a single class of functional element, with a unified architecture for transcription initiation. The context of interacting regulatory elements, and surrounding sequences, determine local transcriptional output as well as the enhancer and promoter activities of individual elements.",

    "abstract": "O_LIUnderstanding shallow water lakes is important because they are not only subjected to a number of natural and anthropogenic stressors but are also able to switch from clear states with high levels of biodiversity to dominance by suspended sediments, phytoplankton, or floating plants. Such switches are often influenced by high levels of nitrogen deposition, which may reduce the diversity of submerged plant communities, suppressing benthic animal and plant life. Therefore, it is important to predict potential effects of nitrogen on such a change.\\nC_LIO_LII modeled competition for light and nutrients between floating and submerged plants under low and high nutrient levels. Both types of plants were randomly chosen in their trait space by varying their average trait values by +/-25%.\\nC_LIO_LISurprisingly, I found that submerged plants could perform better under high nitrogen by having substantial growth rates. Further, I found that responsiveness to nitrogen deposition is greater in shallow lakes with low biomass than high biomass. My results suggest that shallow lakes with low productivity may respond strongly to nitrogen deposition. Moreover, albedo may increase in the future over shallow lakes. Thus, future warming over shallow lakes may be higher than current predictions. Earth System Models should allow the trait values of submerged and floating plants to vary when making predictions about future climatic conditions.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the mechanisms that allow the origin of species has shed light on many processes such as speciation, adaptation and extinction, but how to explain the existence of such a huge diversity of species on Earth still remains a mystery. Many theories and evidence have corroborated the processes that allow species to evolve or become extinct. Currently there are different hypotheses but no clear demonstrations of the factors that maintain the species diversity of ecosystems. Those based on competitive principles have been criticized from both theoretical and empirical approaches. Only by studying biodiversity in the context of evolution, natural history and ecology (taking into consideration the avoidance of competition and dispersal abilities, the phenotypic plasticity, the heterogeneous landscape, the facilitation and the endogenosymbiosis) we can understand values and gaps of past theories trying to provide a broader understanding of life on Earth towards a Unified Theory of Biodiversity.",
