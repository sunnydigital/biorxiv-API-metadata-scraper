    "abstract": "We elaborate a framework for investigating the evolutionary history of morphological characters. We argue that morphological character trees generated by phylogenetic analysis of transcriptomes provide a useful tool for identifying causal gene expression differences underlying the development and evolution of morphological characters. They also enable rigorous testing of different models of morphological character evolution and origination, including the hypothesis that characters originate via divergence of repeated ancestral characters. Finally, morphological character trees provide evidence that character transcriptomes undergo concerted evolution. We argue that concerted evolution of transcriptomes can explain the so-called \\\"species-specific clustering\\\" found in several recent comparative transcriptome studies. The species signal is the phenomenon that transcriptomes cluster by species rather than character type, even though the characters are older than the respective species. We suggest that concerted gene expression evolution results from mutations that alter gene regulatory network interactions shared by the characters under comparison. Thus, character trees generated from transcriptomes allow us to investigate the variational independence, or individuation, of morphological characters at the level of genetic programs.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe correction of sequencing errors contained in Illumina reads derived from genomic DNA is a common pre-processing step in many de novo genome assembly pipelines, and has been shown to improved the quality of resultant assemblies. In contrast, the correction of errors in transcriptome sequence data is much less common, but can potentially yield similar improvements in mapping and assembly quality. This manuscript evaluates several popular read-correction tools ability to correct sequence errors commonplace to transcriptome derived Illumina reads.\\n\\nResultsI evaluated the efficacy of correction of transcriptome derived sequencing reads using using several metrics across a variety of sequencing depths. This evaluation demonstrates a complex relationship between the quality of the correction, depth of sequencing, and hardware availability which results in variable recommendations depending on the goals of the experiment, tolerance for false positives, and depth of coverage. Overall, read error correction is an important step in read quality control, and should become a standard part of analytical pipelines.\\n\\nAvailabilityResults are non-deterministically repeatable using AMI:ami-3dae4956 (MacManes_EC_2015) and the Makefile available here: https://goo.gl/oVIuE0\\n\\nContactmatthew.macmanes@unh.edu and @PeroMHC",

    "abstract": "Mixed models are an effective statistical method for increasing power and avoiding confounding in genetic association studies. Existing mixed model methods have been designed for \\\"pooled\\\" studies where all individual-level genotype and phenotype data are simultaneously visible to a single analyst. Many studies follow a \\\"meta-analysis\\\" design, wherein a large number of independent cohorts share only summary statistics with a central meta-analysis group, and no one person can view individual-level data for more than a small fraction of the total sample. When using linear regression for GWAS, there is no difference in power between pooled studies and meta-analyses [1]; however, we show that when using mixed models, standard meta-analysis is much less powerful than mixed model association on a pooled study of equal size. We describe a method that allows meta-analyses to capture almost all of the power available to mixed model association on a pooled study without sharing individual-level genotype data. The added computational cost and analytical complexity of this method is minimal, but the increase in power can be large: based on the predictive performance of polygenic scoring reported in [2] and [3], we estimate that the next height and BMI studies could see increases in effective sample size of {approx}15% and {approx}8%, respectively. Last, we describe how a related technique can be used to increase power in sequencing, targeted sequencing and exome array studies.\\n\\nNote that these techniques are presently only applicable to randomly ascertained studies and will sometimes result in loss of power in ascertained case/control studies. We are developing similar methods for case/control studies, but this is more complicated.",

    "abstract": "Genotype List (GL) Strings use a set of hierarchical character delimiters to represent allele and genotype ambiguity in HLA and KIR genotypes in a complete and accurate fashion. A RESTful web service called Genotype List Service was created to allow users to register a GL String and receive a unique identifier for that string in the form of a URI. By exchanging URIs and dereferencing them through the GL Service, users can easily transmit HLA genotypes in a variety of useful formats. The GL Service was developed to be secure, scalable, and persistent. An instance of the GL Service is configured with a nomenclature and can be run in strict or non-strict modes. Strict mode requires alleles used in the GL String to be present in the allele database using the fully qualified nomenclature. Non-strict mode allows any GL String to be registered as long as it is syntactically correct.

    "abstract": "SummaryThe plain text Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) file format and its companion binary form (BAM) are a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences (and unmapped reads) together with structured meta-data (Li et al., 2009). Driven by the needs of the 1000 Genomes Project which sequenced many individual human genomes, early SAM/BAM usage focused on pairwise alignments of reads to a reference. However, through the CIGAR P operator multiple sequence alignments can also be preserved. Herein we describe clarifications and additions in version 1.5 of the specification to facilitate storing de novo sequence alignments: Padded reference sequences (with gap characters), annotation of reads or regions of the reference, and the option of embedding the reference sequence within the file.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe latest public release of the specification is at http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf, with in development drafts at https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/ under version control.\\n\\nContactpeter.cock@hutton.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "The now iconic moose of Isle Royale National Park arrived on the island sometime between 1910 and 1915 (Hickie, 1936; Murie, 1934). Prior to that period there is no evidence of moose in either naturalist reports or in the archaeological history of the island (Murie, 1934; Scarpino, 2011). Early naturalists-while observing the moose during their first 20 years on the island--noted both their dramatic expansion, and equally dramatic population crash in the 1930s, see Figure 1. Around 1950, and just as the moose were rebounding, wolves crossed a frozen Lake Superior and began what is now one of our most emblematic predator/prey systems (Peterson, 1995). Recently, the wolves on Isle Royale appear headed for local extinction (Mlot, 2015). Calls to repopulate the island have renewed the vigorous debate surrounding what is and what is not wild about Isle Royale (Scarpino, 2011; Cronon, 1996; Nelson & Callicott, 2008; Cronon, 2003; Peterson, 1999).\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/019984_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (12K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd3c26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77f332org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff6d66org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1675891_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO The early population dynamics of moose on Isle Royale.

    "abstract": "Starch synthesis requires several enzymatic activities including branching enzymes (BEs) responsible for the formation of (1[-&gt;]6) linkages. Distribution and number of these linkages are further controlled by debranching enzymes (DBEs) that cleave some of them, rendering the polyglucan water-insoluble and semi-crystalline. Although the activity of BEs and DBEs is mandatory to sustain normal starch synthesis, the relative importance of each in the establishment of the plant storage polyglucan (i.e. water-insolubility, crystallinity, presence of amylose) is still debated. Here, we have substituted the activity of BEs in Arabidopsis with that of the Escherichia coli glycogen branching enzyme (GlgB). The latter is the BE counterpart in the metabolism of glycogen, a highly branched water-soluble and amorphous storage polyglucan. GlgB was expressed in the be2 be3 double mutant of Arabidopsis that is devoid of BE activity and consequently free of starch. The synthesis of a water-insoluble, partly crystalline, amylose-containing starch-like polyglucan was restored in GlgB-expressing plants, suggesting that BEs origin only have a limited impact on establishing essential characteristics of starch. Moreover, the balance between branching and debranching is crucial for the synthesis of starch, as an excess of branching activity results in the formation of highly branched, water-soluble, poorly crystalline polyglucan.",

    "abstract": "Learning is a fundamental biological adaptation that is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. According to previous research, two conditions are necessary for learning to be adaptive: between-generation environmental variability and within-generation environmental predictability. In this paper, we show that between-generation variability is not necessary, and that instrumental learning can provide a selective advantage in complex environments, where an individual is exposed to a large number of different challenges during its lifespan. We construct an evolutionary model where individuals have a memory with limited storage capacity, and an evolving trait determines the fraction of that memory that should be allocated to innate responses to the environment versus learning these responses. The evolutionarily stable level of learning depends critically on the environmental process, but generally increases with environmental complexity. Overall, our work sheds light on the importance of global structural properties of the environment in shaping the evolution of learning.",

Here, we present Mirror bisulfite sequencing detects 5-hydroxymethylcytosines at a single CpG site by synthesizing a DNA strand to mirror the parental strand. This semi-conservative duplex is sequentially treated with {beta}- glucosyltransferase and M.SssI methylase. A glucosyl-5hmCpG in the parental strand inhibits methylation of the mirroring CpG site, and after bisulfite conversion, a thymine in the mirroring strand indicates a 5hmCpG site in the parental strand whereas a cytosine indicates a non-5hmC site. Using this method, the 5hmC levels of various human tissues and paired liver tissues were mapped genome-wide.",
