    "abstract": "Protein-coding genes evolve at different rates, and the influence of different parameters, from gene size to expression level, has been extensively studied. While in yeast gene expression level is the major causal factor of gene evolutionary rate, the situation is more complex in animals. Here we investigate these relations further, especially taking in account gene expression in different organs as well as indirect correlations between parameters. We used RNA-seq data from two large datasets, covering 22 mouse tissues and 27 human tissues. Over all tissues, evolutionary rate only correlates weakly with levels and breadth of expression. The strongest explanatory factors of purifying selection are GC content, expression in many developmental stages, and expression in brain tissues. While the main component of evolutionary rate is purifying selection, we also find tissue-specific patterns for sites under neutral evolution and for positive selection. We observe fast evolution of genes expressed in testis, but also in other tissues, notably liver, which are explained by weak purifying selection rather than by positive selection.",

    "abstract": "Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and, as such, structural alterations and fusion genes are common events in the cancer landscape. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful method for profiling cancers, but current methods for identifying fusion genes are optimized for short reads. JAFFA (https://code.google.com/p/jaffa-project/) is a sensitive fusion detection method that clearly out-performs other methods with reads of 100bp or greater. JAFFA compares a cancer transcriptome to the reference transcriptome, rather than the genome, where the cancer transcriptome is inferred using long reads directly or by de novo assembling short reads.",

    "abstract": "The folding of most integral membrane proteins follows a two-step process: Initially, individual transmembrane helices are inserted into the membrane by the Sec translocon. Thereafter, these helices fold to shape the final conformation of the protein. However, for some proteins, including Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), the folding appears to follow a more complicated path. AQP1 has been reported to first insert as a four-helical intermediate, where helix 2 and 4 are not inserted into the membrane. In a second step this intermediate is folded into a six-helical topology. During this process, the orientation of the third helix is inverted. Here, we propose a mechanism for how this reorientation could be initiated: First, helix 3 slides out from the membrane core resulting in that the preceding loop enters the membrane. The final conformation could then be formed as helix 2, 3 and 4 are inserted into the membrane and the reentrant regions come together. We find support for the first step in this process by showing that the loop preceding helix 3 can insert into the membrane. Further, hydrophobicity curves, experimentally measured insertion efficiencies and MD-simulations suggest that the barrier between these two hydrophobic regions is relatively low, supporting the idea that helix 3 can slide out of the membrane core, initiating the rearrangement process",

    "abstract": "The translocon recognizes transmembrane helices with sufficient level of hydrophobicity and inserts them into the membrane. However, sometimes less hydrophobic helices are also recognized. Positive inside rule, orientational preferences of and specific interactions with neighboring helices have been shown to aid in the recognition of these helices, at least in artificial systems. To better understand how the translocon inserts marginally hydrophobic helices, we studied three naturally occurring marginally hydrophobic helices, which were previously shown to require the subsequent helix for efficient translocon recognition. We find no evidence for specific interactions when we scan all residues in the subsequent helices. Instead, we identify arginines located at the N-terminal part of the subsequent helices that are crucial for the recognition of the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices, indicating that the positive inside rule is important. However, in two of the constructs these arginines do not aid in the recognition without the rest of the subsequent helix, i.e. the positive inside rule alone is not sufficient. Instead, the improved recognition of marginally hydrophobic helices can here be explained as follows; the positive inside rule provides an orientational preference of the subsequent helix, which in turn allows the marginally hydrophobic helix to be inserted, i.e. the effect of the positive inside rule is stronger if positively charged residues are followed by a transmembrane helix. Such a mechanism can obviously not aid C-terminal helices and consequently we find that the terminal helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than internal helices.",

    "abstract": "Annotators of text corpora and biomedical databases carry out the same labor-intensive task to manually extract structured data from unstructured text. Tasks are needlessly repeated because text corpora are widely scattered. We envision that a linked annotation resource unifying many corpora could be a game changer. Such an open forum will help focus on novel annotations and on optimally benefiting from the energy of many experts. As proof-of-concept, we annotated protein subcellular localization in 100 abstracts cited by UniProtKB. The detailed comparison between our new corpus and the original UniProtKB annotations revealed sustained novel annotations for 42% of the entries (proteins). In a unified linked annotation resource these could immediately extend the utility of text corpora beyond the text-mining community. Our example motivates the central idea that linked annotations from text corpora can complement database annotations.",

We present an automated method of analyzing nanopore data, by detecting regions of ionic current corresponding to the translocation of a biomolecule, and then segmenting the region. The segmenter uses a divide-and-conquer method to recursively discover boundary points, with an implementation that works several times faster than real time and that can handle low-pass filtered signals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnalysing tumour architecture for metastatic potential usually focuses on phenotypic differences due to cellular morphology or specific genetic mutations, but often ignore the cells position within the heterogeneous substructure. Similar disregard for local neighborhood structure is common in mathematical models.\\n\\nMethodsWe view the dynamics of disease progression as an evolutionary game between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modeling paradigm is that the probability of a given phenotypic strategy interacting with another depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard local heterogeneities. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki-Nowak transform to introduce spatial structure to the go vs. grow game.\\n\\nResultsWe show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go) strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary - such as a blood-vessel, organ capsule, or basement membrane - we show an edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this promotion of invasive (EMT positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate adenocarcinoma in bone marrow.\\n\\nInterpretationPathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of invasive cells. We expect our approach to extend to other evolutionary game models where interaction neighborhoods change at fixed system boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Estimates for the number of species in the sea vary by orders of magnitude. Molecular taxonomy can greatly speed up screening for diversity and evaluating species boundaries, while gaining insights into the biology of the species. DNA barcoding with a region of cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) is now widely used as a first pass for molecular evaluation of diversity, as it has good potential for identifying cryptic species and improving our understanding of marine biodiversity. We present the results of a large scale barcoding effort for holothuroids (sea cucumbers). We sequenced 3048 individuals from numerous localities spanning the diversity of habitats in which the group occurs, with a particular focus in the shallow tropics (Indo-Pacific and Caribbean) and the Antarctic region. The number of cryptic species is much higher than currently recognized. The vast majority of sister species have allopatric distributions, with species showing genetic differentiation between ocean basins, and some are even differentiated among archipelagos. However, many closely related and sympatric forms, that exhibit distinct color patterns and/or ecology, show little differentiation in, and cannotbe separatedby, COI sequence data. This pattern is much more common among echinoderms than among molluscs or arthropods, and suggests that echinoderms acquire reproductive isolation at a much faster pace than other marine phyla. Understanding the causes behind such patterns will refine our understanding of diversification and biodiversity in the sea.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that some functional categories of the genome contribute disproportionately to the heritability of complex diseases. Here, we analyze a broad set of functional elements, including cell-type-specific elements, to estimate their polygenic contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 17 complex diseases and traits spanning a total of 1.3 million phenotype measurements. To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while controlling for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes, and leverages genome-wide information. Our results include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits; a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers; and many cell-type-specific enrichments including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment, and smoking behavior. These results demonstrate that GWAS can aid in understanding the biological basis of disease and provide direction for functional follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Individuals within a species vary in their responses to a wide range of stimuli, partly as a result of differences in their genetic makeup. Relatively little is known about the genetic and neuronal mechanisms contributing to diversity of behavior in natural populations. By studying animal-to-animal variation in innate avoidance behavior to thermal stimuli in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncovered genetic principles of how different components of a behavioral response can be altered in nature to generate behavioral diversity. Using a thermal pulse assay, we uncovered heritable variation in responses to a transient temperature increase. Quantitative trait locus mapping revealed that separate components of this response were controlled by distinct genomic loci. The loci we identified contributed to variation in components of thermal pulse avoidance behavior in an additive fashion. Our results show that the escape behavior induced by thermal stimuli is composed of simpler behavioral components that are influenced by at least six distinct genetic loci. The loci that decouple components of the escape behavior reveal a genetic system that allows independent modification of behavioral parameters. Our work sets the foundation for future studies of evolution of innate behaviors at the molecular and neuronal level.",
