    "abstract": "The brain exhibits temporally complex patterns of activity with features similar to those of chaotic systems. Theoretical studies over the last twenty years have described various computational advantages for such regimes in neuronal systems. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether chaos requires specific cellular properties or network architectures, or whether it is a generic property of neuronal circuits. We investigate the dynamics of networks of excitatory-inhibitory (EI) spiking neurons with random sparse connectivity operating in the regime of balance of excitation and inhibition. Combining Dynamical Mean-Field Theory with numerical simulations, we show that chaotic, asynchronous firing rate fluctuations emerge generically for sufficiently strong synapses. Two different mechanisms can lead to these chaotic fluctuations. One mechanism relies on slow I-I inhibition which gives rise to slow subthreshold voltage and rate fluctuations. The decorrelation time of these fluctuations is proportional to the time constant of the inhibition. The second mechanism relies on the recurrent E-I-E feedback loop. It requires slow excitation but the inhibition can be fast. In the corresponding dynamical regime all neurons exhibit rate fluctuations on the time scale of the excitation. Another feature of this regime is that the population-averaged firing rate is substantially smaller in the excitatory population than in the inhibitory population. This is not necessarily the case in the I-I mechanism. Finally, we discuss the neurophysiological and computational significance of our results.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCortical circuits exhibit complex temporal patterns of spiking and are exquisitely sensitive to small perturbations in their ongoing activity. These features are all suggestive of an underlying chaotic dynamics. Theoretical works have indicated that a rich dynamical reservoir can endow neuronal circuits with remarkable computational capabilities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying chaos in circuits of spiking neurons remain unknown. We combine analytical calculations and numerical simulations to investigate this fundamental issue. Our key result is that chaotic firing rate fluctuations on the time scales of the synaptic dynamics emerge generically from the network collective dynamics. Our results pave the way in the study of the physiological mechanisms and computational significance of chaotic states in neuronal networks.",

    "abstract": "The widely used Translation Libration Screw (TLS) approximation describes concerted motions of atomic groups in X-ray refinement. TLS refinement often provides a better interpretation of diffraction data and the resulting rigid body motions may subsequently be assigned biochemical significance. In TLS refinement, three matrices (T, L and S) describe harmonic vibration, libration and their correlation. Because these matrices describe specific motions, they impose a number of conditions on their elements. Ignoring these conditions while refining the matrix elements may result in matrices that cannot be interpreted in terms of physically realistic motions. We describe a mathematical framework and the computational tools to analyze refined TLS matrices through their decomposition into descriptors of underlying motions. This allows for straightforward validation and identification of implausible TLS parameters. An algorithm for the generation of structural ensembles that are consistent with given TLS parameters, implemented as a part of the Phenix project, is also described.\\n\\nSynopsisProcedures for the decomposition of TLS matrices into elementary vibrations and librations indicates possible errors in the definition of these matrices and corrects them when possible. The program outputs the corresponding vibration-libration parameters and generates structural ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the intramolecular motions of proteins and nucleic acids is a major challenge in macromolecular X-ray crystallography. While Bragg diffraction describes the average positional distribution of crystalline atoms, many different models can fit this distribution equally well. Diffuse X-ray scattering can reduce this degeneracy by directly reporting on correlated atomic displacements. Although recent technological advances are increasing the potential to accurately measure diffuse scattering, computational modeling and validation tools are still needed to quantify the agreement between experimental data and different parameterizations of crystalline disorder. A new tool, phenix.diffuse, addresses this need by employing Guiniers equation to calculate diffuse scattering from Protein Data Bank (PDB)-formatted structural ensembles. As an example case, phenix.diffuse is applied to Translation-Libration-Screw (TLS) refinement, which models rigid body displacement for segments of the macromolecule. To enable calculation of diffuse scattering from TLS refined structures, phenix.tls_models builds multi-model PDB files that sample the underlying T, L and S tensors. In the glycerophosphodiesterase GpdQ, alternative TLS group partitioning and different motional correlations between groups yield markedly dissimilar diffuse scattering maps with distinct implications for molecular mechanism and allostery. These methods demonstrate how X-ray diffuse scattering can extend macromolecular structural refinement, validation, and analysis.\\n\\nSynopsisA method of simulating X-ray diffuse scattering from multi-model PDB files is presented. Despite similar agreement with Bragg data, different Translation-Libration-Screw refinement strategies produce unique diffuse intensity patterns.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we discuss data and methodological challenges for building bacterial communication networks using two examples: Escherichia coli as a flagellate bacterium and of Geobacter sulfurreducens as a biofilm forming bacterium. We first highlight the link between the bacterial network communication design with respect to metabolic information processing design. The potentialities of designing routing network schemes described previously in literature and based on bacteria motility and genetic message exchanges will depend on the genes coding for the intracellular and intercellular signalling pathways. In bacteria, the \\\"mobilome\\\" is related to horizontal gene transfer. Bacteria trade off the acquisition of new genes which could improve their survival (and often their communication bandwidth), keeping their genome enough small to assure quick DNA replication and increase fast the biomass to speed up cell division. First, by using a multi-objective optimisation procedure, we search for the optimal trade off between energy production, which is a requirement for the motility, and the biomass growth, which is related to the overall survival and fitness of the bacterium. We use flux balance analysis of genome-scale biochemical network of Escherichia coli k-13 MG1655. Then, as a second case study we analyze the electric properties and biomass trade-off of the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens which constructs an electric biofilm where electrons move across the nanowires. Here we discuss the potentialities of optimisation methodologies to design and select bacterial strains with desiderata properties. The optimisation methodologies establish also a relation between metabolism, network communication and computing. Moreover, we point to genetic design and synthetic biology as key areas to develop bacterial nano communication networks.",
