    "abstract": "1Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as species abundance and distribution, community structure, and ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental , and demographic stochasticity, evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial, and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.",

    "abstract": "1A capacity to predict the spread rate of populations is critical for understanding the impacts of climate change and invasive species. Despite sophisticated theory describing how populations spread, the prediction of spread rate remains a formidable challenge. As well as the inherent stochasticity in the spread process, spreading populations are subject to strong evolutionary forces (operating on dispersal and reproductive rates) that can cause accelerating spread. Despite these strong evolutionary forces, serial founder events and drift on the expanding range edge mean that evolutionary trajectories in the invasion vanguard may be highly stochastic. Here I develop a model of spatial spread in continuous space that incorporates evolution of continuous traits under a quantitative genetic model of inheritance. I use this model to investigate the potential role of evolution on the variation in spread rate between replicate model realisations. Models incorporating evolution exhibited more than four times the variance in spread rate across replicate invasions compared with nonevolving scenarios. Results suggest that the majority of this increase in variation is driven by evolutionary stochasticity on the invasion front rather than initial founder events: in many cases evolutionary stochasticity on the invasion front contributed more than 90% of the variance in spread rate over 30 generations. Our uncertainty around predicted spread rates - whether for invasive species or those shifting under climate change - may be much larger than we expect when the spreading population contains heritable variation in rates of dispersal and reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Maize offers an ideal system through which to demonstrate the potential of ancient population genomic techniques for reconstructing the evolution and spread of domesticates. The diffusion of maize from Mexico into the North American Southwest (SW) remains contentious with the available evidence being restricted to morphological studies of ancient maize plant material. We captured 1 Mb of nuclear DNA from 32 archaeological maize samples spanning 6000 years and compared them with modern landraces including those from the Mexican West coast and highlands. We found that the initial diffusion of domesticated maize into the SW is likely to have occurred through a highland route. However, by 2000 years ago a Pacific coastal corridor was also being used. Furthermore, we could distinguish between genes that were selected for early during domestication (such as zagl1 involved in shattering) from genes that changed in the SW context (e.g. related to sugar content and adaptation to drought) likely as a response to the local arid environment and new cultural uses of maize.",

    "abstract": "Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, or distal arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A), is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in MYH3 and characterized by multiple congenital contractures of the face and limbs and normal cognitive development. We identified a subset of five simplex cases putatively diagnosed with \\\"DA2A with severe neurological abnormalities\\\" in which the proband had Congenital Contractures of the LImbs and FAce, Hypotonia, and global Developmental Delay often resulting in early death, a unique condition that we now refer to as CLIFAHDD syndrome. Exome sequencing identified missense mutations in sodium leak channel, nonselective (NALCN) in four families with CLIFAHDD syndrome. Using molecular inversion probes to screen NALCN in a cohort of 202 DA cases as well as concurrent exome sequencing of six other DA cases revealed NALCN mutations in ten additional families with \\\"atypical\\\" forms of DA. All fourteen mutations were missense variants predicted to alter amino acid residues in or near the S5 and S6 pore-forming segments of NALCN, highlighting the functional importance of these segments. In vitro functional studies demonstrated that mutant NALCN nearly abolished the expression of wildtype NALCN, suggesting that mutations that cause CLIFAHDD syndrome have a dominant negative effect. In contrast, homozygosity for mutations in other regions of NALCN has been reported in three families with an autosomal recessive condition characterized mainly by hypotonia and severe intellectual disability. Accordingly, mutations in NALCN can cause either a recessive or dominant condition with varied though overlapping phenotypic features perhaps depending on the type of mutation and affected protein domain(s).",

    "abstract": "Cancers arise as a result of genetic and epigenetic alterations. These accumulate in cells during the processes of tissue development, homeostasis and repair. Many tumor types are hierarchically organized and driven by a sub-population of cells often called cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells are uniquely capable of recapitulating the tumor and can be highly resistant to radio-and chemotherapy treatment. We investigate tumor growth patterns from a theoretical standpoint and show how significant changes in pre-and post-therapy tumor dynamics are tied to the dynamics of cancer stem cells. We identify two characteristic growth regimes of a tumor population that can be leveraged to estimate cancer stem cell fractions in vivo using simple linear regression. Our method is a mathematically exact result, parameter free and does not require any microscopic knowledge of the tumor properties. A more accurate quantification of the direct link between the sub-population driving tumor growth and treatment response promises new ways to individualize treatment strategies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnder the cancer stem cell hypothesis a tumor population is driven by a fraction of self-renewing cancer stem cells. Absolute and relative size of this population in human cancers at any stage of the disease remains unknown. We formulate a mathematical model that describes the tumor cell populations growth dynamics and response to therapy. This allows to estimate cancer stem cell fraction from longitudinal measurements of tumor size (often available from imaging). Such estimates are critical because treatment outcome and risk of relapse depend on the tumors capacity to self-renew. Ideally, by tailoring patient treatment strategies based on the relative abundance of cancer stem cells could lead to radically different therapeutic regime and to the successful eradication of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The human T cell repertoire is complex and is generated by the rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments on the T cell receptor (TCR) loci. The T cell repertoire demonstrates selfsimilarity in terms clonal frequencies when defined by V, D and J gene segment usage; therefore to determine whether the structural ordering of these gene segments on the TCR loci contributes to the observed clonal frequencies, the TCR loci were examined for self-similarity and periodicity in terms of gene segment organization. Logarithmic transformation of numeric sequence order demonstrated that the V and J gene segments for both T cell receptor  (TRA) and {beta} (TRB) loci were arranged in a selfsimilar manner when the spacing between the adjacent segments was considered as a function of the size of the neighboring gene segment, with an average fractal dimension of 1.5. The ratio of genomic distance between either the J (in TRA) or D (in TRB) segments and successive V segments on these loci declined logarithmically with a slope of similar magnitude. Accounting for the gene segments occurring on helical DNA molecules in a logarithmic distribution, sine and cosine functions of the log transformed angular coordinates of the start and stop nucleotides of successive TCR gene segments showed an ordered progression from the 5 to the 3 end of the locus, supporting a log-periodic organization. T cell clonal frequencies, based on V and J segment usage, from three normal stem cell donors were plotted against the V and J segment on TRB locus and demonstrated a periodic distribution. We hypothesize that this quasi-periodic variation in gene-segment representation in the T cell clonal repertoire may be influenced by the location of the gene segments on the periodic-logarithmically scaled TCR loci. Interactions between the two strands of DNA in the double helix may influence the probability of gene segment usage by means of either constructive or destructive interference resulting from the superposition of the two helices.",
