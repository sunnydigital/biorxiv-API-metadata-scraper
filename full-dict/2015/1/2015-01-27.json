    "abstract": "The mind is a biological phenomenon. Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying a lower level of organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms lying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses--neural plasticity and neural activity--are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind-body explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDNA sequencing instruments are enabling genomic analyses of unprecedented scope and scale, widening the gap between our abilities to generate and interpret sequence data. Established methods for computational sequence analysis generally use nucleotide-level resolution of sequences, and while such approaches can be very accurate, increasingly ambitious and data-intensive analyses are rendering them impractical for applications such as genome and metagenome assembly. Comparable analytical challenges are encountered in other data-intensive fields involving sequential data, such as signal processing, in which dimensionality reduction methods are routinely used to reduce the computational burden of analyses. We therefore seek to address the question of whether it is possible to improve the efficiency of sequence alignment by applying dimensionality reduction methods to numerically represented nucleotide sequences.\\n\\nResultsTo explore the applicability of signal transformation and dimensionality reduction methods to sequence assembly, we implemented a short read aligner and evaluated its performance against simulated high diversity viral sequences alongside four existing aligners. Using our sequence transformation and feature selection approach, alignment time was reduced by up to 14-fold compared to uncompressed sequences and without reducing alignment accuracy. Despite using highly compressed sequence transformations, our implementation yielded alignments of similar overall accuracy to existing aligners, outperforming all other tools tested at high levels of sequence variation. Our approach was also applied to the de novo assembly of a simulated diverse viral population. Our results demonstrate that full sequence resolution is not a prerequisite of accurate sequence alignment and that analytical performance can be retained and even enhanced through appropriate dimensionality reduction of sequences.",

    "abstract": "Copper is essential for life but toxic, therefore all organisms control tightly its intracellular abundance. Bacteria have indeed whole operons devoted to copper resistance, with genes that code for efflux pumps, oxidases, etc. Recently, the CopM protein of the CopMRS operon was described as a novel important element for copper tolerance in Synechocystis. This protein consists of a domain of unknown function, and was proposed to act as a periplasmic/extracellular copper binder. This work describes a bioinformatic study of CopM including structural models based on homology modeling and on residue coevolution, to help expand on its recent biochemical characterization. The protein is predicted to be periplasmic but membrane-anchored, not secreted. Two disordered regions are predicted, both possibly involved in protein-protein interactions. The 3D models disclose a 4-helix bundle with several potential copper-binding sites, most of them largely buried inside the bundle lumen. Some of the predicted copper-binding sites involve residues from the disordered regions, suggesting they could gain structure upon copper binding and thus possibly modulate the interactions they mediate. All models are provided as PDB files in the Supporting Information and can be visualized online at http://lucianoabriata.altervista.org/modelshome.html Note (January 2017): Recent X-ray structures of apo, copper- and silver-bound CopM are < 3[A] RMSD away from the models, and reveal metal-dependent structural flexibility (Zhao et al Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2016)",

    "abstract": "SummaryCell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical intermediate cell-states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data might be formalized under a general framework composed of i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality reduction step), and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes new algorithms to provide cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies. Sincell functionalities are illustrated in a real case study where its ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell-state hierarchies is demonstrated.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationSincell is an open-source R/Bioconductor package available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.1/bioc/html/sincell.html.

    "abstract": "We present a population density and moment-based description of the stochastic dynamics of domain Ca2+-mediated inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels. Our approach accounts for the effect of heterogeneity of local Ca2+ signals on whole cell Ca2+ currents; however, in contrast with prior work, e.g., Sherman et al. (1990), we do not assume that Ca2+ domain formation and collapse are fast compared to channel gating. We demonstrate the population density and moment-based modeling approaches using a 12-state Markov chain model of an L-type Ca2+ channel introduced by Greenstein and Winslow (2002). Simulated whole cell voltage clamp responses yield an inactivation function for the whole cell Ca2+ current that agrees with the traditional approach when domain dynamics are fast. We analyze the voltage-dependence of Ca2+ inactivation that may occur via slow heterogeneous domains. Next, we find that when channel permeability is held constant, Ca2+-mediated inactivation of L-type channel increases as the domain time constant increases, because a slow domain collapse rate leads to increased mean domain [Ca2+] near open channels; conversely, when the maximum domain [Ca2+] is held constant, inactivation decreases as the domain time constant increases. Comparison of simulation results using population densities and moment equations confirms the computational efficiency of the moment-based approach, and enables the validation of two distinct methods of truncating and closing the open system of moment equations. In general, a slow domain time constant requires higher order moment truncation for agreement between moment-based and population density simulations.",

    "abstract": "Through theoretical analysis of the statistics of stochastic calcium (Ca2+) release (i.e., the amplitude, duration and inter-event interval of simulated Ca2+ puffs and sparks), we show that a Langevin description of the collective gating of Ca2+ channels may be a good approximation to the corresponding Markov chain model when the number of Ca2+ channels per Ca2+ release unit (CaRU) is in the physiological range. The Langevin description of stochastic Ca2+ release facilitates our investigation of correlations between successive puff/spark amplitudes, durations and inter-spark intervals, and how such puff/spark statistics depend on the number of channels per release site and the kinetics of Ca2+-mediated inactivation of open channels. When Ca2+ inactivation/de-inactivation rates are intermediate--i.e., the termination of Ca2+ puff/sparks is caused by the recruitment of inactivated channels--the correlation between successive puff/spark amplitudes is negative, while the correlations between puff/spark amplitudes and the duration of the preceding or subsequent inter-spark interval are positive. These correlations are significantly reduced when inactivation/deinactivation rates are extreme (slow or fast) and puff/sparks terminate via stochastic attrition.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the role of immigration in shaping bacterial communities or the factors that may dictate success or failure of colonization by bacteria from regional species pools. To address these knowledge gaps, the influence of bacterial colonization into an ecosystem (activated sludge bioreactor) was measured through a disturbance gradient (successive decreases in the parameter solids retention time) relative to stable operational conditions. Through a DNA sequencing approach, we show that the most abundant bacteria within the immigrant community have a greater probability of colonizing the receiving ecosystem, but mostly as low abundance community members. Only during the disturbance do some of these bacterial populations significantly increase in abundance beyond background levels and in few cases become dominant community members post-disturbance. Two mechanisms facilitate the enhanced enrichment of immigrant populations during disturbance: 1) the availability of resources left unconsumed by established species and 2) the increased availability of niche space for colonizers to establish and displace resident populations. Thus, as a disturbance decreases local diversity, recruitment sites become available to promote colonization. This work advances our understanding of microbial resource management and diversity maintenance in complex ecosystems.",

Sequencing of Ebola viruses from infected individuals has revealed extensive genetic variation, leading to speculation that the virus may be adapting to the human host and accounting for the scale of the 2014 outbreak. We show that so far there is no evidence for adaptation of EBOV to humans. We analyze the putatively functional changes associated with the current and previous Ebola outbreaks, and find no significant molecular changes. Observed amino acid replacements have minimal effect on protein structure, being neither stabilizing nor destabilizing. Replacements are not found in regions of the proteins associated with known functions and tend to occur in disordered regions. This observation indicates that the difference between the current and previous outbreaks is not due to the observed evolutionary change of the virus. Instead, epidemiological factors must be responsible for the unprecedented spread of EBOV.",

    "abstract": "The genetic basis of species differences remains understudied. Studies in insects have contributed significantly to our understanding of morphological evolution. Pigmentation traits in particular have received a great deal of attention and several genes in the insect pigmentation pathway have been implicated in inter- and intraspecific differences. Nonetheless, much remains unknown about many of the genes in this pathway and their potential role in understudied taxa. Here we genetically analyze the puparium color difference between members of the Virilis group of Drosophila. The puparium of Drosophila virilis is black, while those of D. americana, D. novamexicana, and D. lummei are brown. We used a series of backcross hybrid populations between D. americana and D. virilis to map the genomic interval responsible for the difference between this species pair. First, we show that the pupal case color difference is caused by a single Mendelizing factor, which we ultimately map to an ~11kb region on chromosome 5. The mapped interval includes only the first exon and regulatory region(s) of the dopamine N-acetyltransferase gene (Dat). This gene encodes an enzyme that is known to play a part in the insect pigmentation pathway. Second, we show that this gene is highly expressed at the onset of pupation in light-brown taxa (D. americana and D. novamexicana) relative to D. virilis, but not in the dark-brown D. lummei. Finally, we examine the role of Dat in adult pigmentation between D. americana (heavily melanized) and D. novamexicana (lightly melanized) and find no discernible effect of this gene in adults. Our results demonstrate that a single gene is entirely or almost entirely responsible for a morphological difference between species.",

The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use our method to estimate 300 genetic correlations among 25 traits, totaling more than 1.5 million unique phenotype measurements. Our results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity and associations between educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of genome-wide analyses, since there currently are no genome-wide significant SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment.",
