    "abstract": "Translational neuroscience in the field of spinal cord injuries (SCI) faces a strong disproportion between immense preclinical research efforts and a lack of therapeutic approaches successful in human patients: Currently, preclinical research on SCI yields more than 3,000 new publications per year (8,000 when including the whole central nervous system, growing at an exponential rate), whereas none of the resulting therapeutic concepts has led to functional recovery of neural tissue in humans. Improving clinical researchers information access therefore carries the potential to support more effective selection of promising therapy candidates from preclinical studies. Thus, automated information extraction from scientific publications contributes to enabling meta studies and therapy grading by aggregating relevant information from the entire body of previous work on SCI.\\n\\nWe present SCIE, an automated information extraction pipeline capable of detecting relevant information in SCI publications based on ontological entity and probabilistic relation detection. The input are plain text or PDF documents. As output, the user choses between an online visualization or a machine-readable format. Compared to human gold standard annotations, our system achieves an average extraction performance of 76 % precision and 52 % recall (F1-measure 0.59).\\n\\nAn instance of the webservice is available at http://scie.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/.

    "abstract": "Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and, as such, structural alterations and fusion genes are common events in the cancer landscape. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful method for profiling cancers, but current methods for identifying fusion genes are optimized for short reads. JAFFA (https://code.google.com/p/jaffa-project/) is a sensitive fusion detection method that clearly out-performs other methods with reads of 100bp or greater. JAFFA compares a cancer transcriptome to the reference transcriptome, rather than the genome, where the cancer transcriptome is inferred using long reads directly or by de novo assembling short reads.",
