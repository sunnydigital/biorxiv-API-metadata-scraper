    "abstract": "Semantic Web technologies have been widely applied in Life Sciences, for example by data providers like OpenLifeData and Web Services frameworks like SADI. The recent OpenLifeData2SADI project offers access to the OpenLifeData data store through SADI services. This paper shows how to merge data from OpenLifeData with other extant SADI services in the Galaxy bioinformatics analysis platform, making semantic data amenable to complex analyses, as a worked example demonstrates. The whole setting is reproducible through a Docker image that includes a pre-configured Galaxy server with data and workflows that constitute the worked example.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeep mutational scanning is a technique to estimate the impacts of mutations on a gene by using deep sequencing to count mutations in a library of variants before and after imposing a functional selection. The impacts of mutations must be inferred from changes in their counts after selection.\\n\\nResultsI describe a software package, dms_tools, to infer the impacts of mutations from deep mutational scanning data using a likelihood-based treatment of the mutation counts. I show that dms_tools yields more accurate inferences on simulated data than simply calculating ratios of counts pre-and post-selection. Using dms_tools, one can infer the preference of each site for each amino acid given a single selection pressure, or assess the extent to which these preferences change under different selection pressures. The preferences and their changes can be intuitively visualized with sequence-logo-style plots created using an extension to weblogo.\\n\\nConclusionsdms_tools implements a statistically principled approach for the analysis and subsequent visualization of deep mutational scanning data.",

    "abstract": "1Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as species abundance and distribution, community structure, and ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental , and demographic stochasticity, evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial, and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a key role in gene regulation. Previous studies have investigated its genetic basis by mapping genetic variants that are associated with DNA methylation at specific sites, but these have been limited to microarrays that cover less than 2% of the genome and cannot account for allele-specific methylation (ASM). Other studies have performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a few individuals, but these lack statistical power to identify variants associated with DNA methylation. We present a novel approach in which bisulfite-treated DNA from many individuals is sequenced together in a single pool, resulting in a truly genome-wide map of DNA methylation. Compared to methods that do not account for ASM, our approach increases statistical power to detect associations while sharply reducing cost, effort, and experimental variability. As a proof of concept, we generated deep sequencing data from a pool of 60 human cell lines; we evaluated almost twice as many CpGs as the largest microarray studies and identified over 2,000 genetic variants associated with DNA methylation. We found that these variants are highly enriched for associations with chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding but are less likely to be associated with traits indirectly linked to DNA, such as gene expression and disease phenotypes. In summary, our approach allows genome-wide mapping of genetic variants associated with DNA methylation in any tissue of any species, without the need for individual-level genotype or methylation data.",

    "abstract": "Putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) have long been implicated in regulation of DNA replication and transcription, though their actual roles are unknown. To gain insight into potential PQS transcriptional function, we map and analyze PQS motifs in promoters of genes differentially-expressed in Bloom Syndrome (BS) and Werner Syndrome (WS), two human genetic disorders resulting in loss of PQS-interacting RecQ helicases. Non-B-DNA structures at PQS might be stabilized in these syndromes. For BS and WS we demonstrate that PQS promoter abundance is generally higher in down-regulated genes and lower in up-regulated genes, and show that these effects are position-dependent. To interpret these correlations we determined genome-wide PQS correlations with transcription using epigenetic information to predict gene expression. We report that 33% and 35% of analyzed PQS positions in promoter antisense and sense strands, respectively, displayed statistically-significant correlation with gene expression. Of these statistically-significant positions, 100% and 84% on antisense and sense strands, respectively, were correlated with reduced expression. This suggests that promoter PQS repress transcription. Finally, we report neural network clustering analysis of PQS motifs to demonstrate that genes differentially-expressed in BS and WS are significantly biased in their PQS motifs, suggesting an unappreciated biological relationship between PQS, RecQ helicases, and transcription.\\n\\nREVIEWER LINKS TO DEPOSITED DATAftp://www.jsmes.net/PQS_Genomics",

    "abstract": "Renewable in vitro cell cultures, such as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), have facilitated studies that contributed to our understanding of genetic influence on human traits. However, the degree to which cell lines faithfully maintain differences in donor-specific phenotypes is still debated. We have previously reported that standard cell line maintenance practice results in a loss of donor-specific gene expression signatures in LCLs. An alternative to the LCL model is the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system, which carries the potential to model tissue-specific physiology through the use of differentiation protocols. Still, existing LCL banks represent an important source of starting material for iPSC generation, and it is possible that the disruptions in gene regulation associated with long-term LCL maintenance could persist through the reprogramming process. To address this concern, we studied the effect of reprogramming mature LCLs to iPSCs on the ensuing gene expression patterns within and between six unrelated donor individuals. We show that the reprogramming process results in a recovery of donor-specific gene regulatory signatures. Since environmental contributions are unlikely to be a source of individual variation in our system of highly passaged cultured cell lines, our observations suggest that the effect of genotype on gene regulation is more pronounced in the iPSCs than in the LCL precursors. Our findings indicate that iPSCs can be a powerful model system for studies of phenotypic variation across individuals in general, and the genetic association with variation in gene regulation in particular. We further conclude that LCLs are an appropriate starting material for iPSC generation.",
