    "abstract": "Little is known about the mechanisms that enable organisms to cope with unpredictable environments. To address this issue, we used replicate populations of Escherichia coli selected under complex, randomly changing environments. Under four novel stresses that had no known correlation with the selection environments, individual cells of the selected populations had significantly lower lag and greater yield compared to the controls. More importantly, there were no outliers in terms of growth, thus ruling out the evolution of population-based resistance. We also assayed the standing phenotypic variation of the selected populations, in terms of their growth on 94 different substrates. Contrary to expectations, there was no increase in the standing variation of the selected populations, nor was there any significant divergence from the ancestors. This suggested that the greater fitness in novel environments is brought about by selection at the level of the individuals, which restricts the suite of traits that can potentially evolve through this mechanism. Given that day-to-day climatic variability of the world is rising, these results have potential public health implications. Our results also underline the need for a very different kind of theoretical approach to study the effects of fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "The flagellum is a large proteinaceous organelle found at the surface of many bacteria, whose primary role is to allow motility through the rotation of a long extracellular filament. It is an essential virulence factor in many pathogenic species, and is also a priming component in the formation of antibiotic-resistant biofilms. The flagellum consists of the export apparatus and stator in the cytosol; the basal body, spanning the bacterial membrane(s) and periplasm; and the hook-filament, that protrudes away from the bacterial surface. Assembly of the bacterial flagellum is initiated by the formation of the basal body MS ring region, constituted of multiple copies of the protein FliF. Here, I report an analysis of the FliF sequence from various bacterial species, demonstrating that its periplasmic region is composed of a domain homologuous to that of the type III secretion system proteins PrgK, and of a second globular domain that possesses a similar fold to that of the sporulation complex component SpoIIIAG. I also describe that Chlamydia possesses an unusual FliF protein, lacking part of the PrgK homology domain and the SpoIIIAG-like domain, and fused to FliG at its C-terminus. Finally, I have combined the sequence analysis of FliF with the EM map of the MS ring, to propose the first atomic model for the FliF oligomer. These results further emphasize the similarity between the flagellum, T3SS and sporulation complex, and will facilitate further structural studies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe evolution of resistance against antimicrobial peptides has long been considered unlikely due to their mechanism of action, yet experimental selection with AMPs results in rapid evolution of resistance in several species of bacteria. Although numerous studies have utilized mutant screens to identify loci that determine AMP susceptibility, there is a dearth of data concerning the genomic changes which accompany experimental evolution of AMP resistance.\\n\\nMethodsUsing genome re-sequencing we analysed the mutations which arise during experimental evolution of resistance to the cationic AMPs iseganan, melittin and pexiganan, as well as to a combination of melittin and pexiganan, or to the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin.\\n\\nResultsAnalysis of 17 independently replicated Staphylococcus aureus selection lines, including unselected controls, showed that each AMP selected for mutations at distinct loci. We identify mutations in genes involved in the synthesis and maintenance of the cell envelope. This includes genes previously identified from mutant screens for AMP resistance, and genes involved in the response to AMPs and cell-wall-active antibiotics. Furthermore, transposon insertion mutants were used to verify that a number of the identified genes are directly involved in determining AMP susceptibility.\\n\\nConclusionsStrains selected for AMP resistance under controlled experimental evolution displayed consistent AMP-specific mutations in genes which determine AMP susceptibility. This suggests that different routes to evolve resistance are favored within a controlled genetic background.",

    "abstract": "What are the structural determinants of protein sequence evolution? A number of site-specific structural characteristics have been proposed, most of which are broadly related to either the density of contacts or the solvent accessibility of individual residues. Most importantly, there has been disagreement in the literature over the relative importance of solvent accessibility and local packing density for explaining site-specific sequence variability in proteins. We show here that this discussion has been confounded by the definition of local packing density. The most commonly used measures of local packing, such as the contact number and the weighted contact number, represent by definition the combined effects of local packing density and longer-range effects. As an alternative, we here propose a truly local measure of packing density around a single residue, based on the Voronoi cell volume. We show that the Voronoi cell volume, when calculated relative to the geometric center of amino-acid side chains, behaves nearly identically to the relative solvent accessibility, and both can explain, on average, approximately 34% of the site-specific variation in evolutionary rate in a data set of 209 enzymes. An additional 10% of variation can be explained by non-local effects that are captured in the weighted contact number. Consequently, evolutionary variation at a site is determined by the combined action of the immediate amino-acid neighbors of that site and of effects mediated by more distant amino acids. We conclude that instead of contrasting solvent accessibility and local packing density, future research should emphasize the relative importance of immediate contacts and longer-range effects on evolutionary variation.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent (e.g. parallel or convergent) evolution is widely cited as evidence for natural selections central role in evolution but can also highlight constraints affecting evolution. Here we describe the evolution of green and melanistic color phenotypes in two species of stick insect: Timema podura and T. cristinae. We show that similar color phenotypes of these species (1) cluster in phenotypic space and (2) confer crypsis on different plant microhabitats. We then use genome-wide association mapping to determine the genetic architecture of color in T. podura, and compare this to previous results in T. cristinae. In both species, color is under simple genetic control, dominance relationships of melanistic and green alleles are the same, and SNPs associated with color phenotypes colocalize to the same genomic region. These results differ from those of  typical parallel phenotypes because the form of selection acting on color differs between species: a balance of multiple sources of selection acting within host species maintains the color polymorphism in T. cristinae whereas T. podura color phenotypes are under divergent selection between hosts. Our results highlight how different adaptive landscapes can result in the evolution of similar phenotypic variation, and suggest the same genomic region is involved.",
