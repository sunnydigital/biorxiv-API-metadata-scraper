    "abstract": "Despite the increasing opportunity to collect large-scale data sets for population genomic analyses, the use of high throughput sequencing to study populations of polyploids has seen little application. This is due in large part to problems associated with determining allele copy number in the genotypes of polyploid individuals (allelic dosage uncertainty-ADU), which complicates the calculation of important quantities such as allele frequencies. Here we describe a statistical model to estimate biallelic SNP frequencies in a population of autopolyploids using high throughput sequencing data in the form of read counts. We bridge the gap from data collection (using restriction enzyme based techniques [e.g., GBS, RADseq]) to allele frequency estimation in a unified inferential framework using a hierarchical Bayesian model to sum over genotype uncertainty. Simulated data sets were generated under various conditions for tetraploid, hexaploid and octoploid populations to evaluate the models performance and to help guide the collection of empirical data. We also provide an implementation of our model in the R package O_SCPLOWPOLYFREQSC_SCPLOW and demonstrate its use with two example analyses that investigate (i) levels of expected and observed heterozygosity and (ii) model adequacy. Our simulations show that the number of individuals sampled from a population has a greater impact on estimation error than sequencing coverage. The example analyses also show that our model and software can be used to make inferences beyond the estimation of allele frequencies for autopolyploids by providing assessments of model adequacy and estimates of heterozygosity.",

    "abstract": "Within populations of cells, fate decisions are controlled by an indeterminate combination of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors. In the case of stem cells, the stem cell niche is believed to maintain \\\"stemness\\\" through communication and interactions between the stem cells and one or more other cell-types that contribute to the niche conditions. To investigate the robustness of cell fate decisions in the stem cell hierarchy and the role that the niche plays, we introduce simple mathematical models of stem and progenitor cells, their progeny and their interplay in the niche. These models capture the fundamental processes of proliferation and differentiation and allow us to consider alternative possibilities regarding how niche-mediated signalling feedback regulates the niche dynamics. Generalised stability analysis of these stem cell niche systems enables us to describe the stability properties of each model. We find that although the number of feasible states depends on the model, their probabilities of stability in general do not: stem cell-niche models are stable across a wide range of parameters. We demonstrate that niche-mediated feedback increases the number of stable steady states, and show how distinct cell states have distinct branching characteristics. The ecological feedback and interactions mediated by the stem cell niche thus lend (surprisingly) high levels of robustness to the stem and progenitor cell population dynamics. Furthermore, cell-cell interactions are sufficient for populations of stem cells and their progeny to achieve stability and maintain homeostasis. We show that the robustness of the niche -- and hence of the stem cell pool in the niche -- depends only weakly, if at all, on the complexity of the niche make-up: simple as well as complicated niche systems are capable of supporting robust and stable stem cell dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Adult neurogenesis, generation of new functional cells in the mature central nervous system (CNS), has been documented in a number of diverse organisms, ranging from humans to invertebrates. However, the origin and evolution of this phenomenon is still poorly understood for many of the key phylogenetic groups. Echinoderms are one such phylum, positioned as a sister group to chordates within the monophyletic clade Deuterostomia. They are well known for the ability of their adult organs, including the CNS, to completely regenerate after injury. Nothing is known, however, about production of new cells in the nervous tissue under normal physiological conditions in these animals. In this study, we show that new cells are continuously generated in the mature radial nerve cord (RNC) of the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima. Importantly, this neurogenic activity is not evenly distributed, but is significantly more extensive in the lateral regions of the RNC than along the midline. Some of the new cells generated in the apical region of the ectoneural neuroepithelium leave their place of origin and migrate basally to populate the neural parenchyma. Gene expression analysis showed that generation of new cells in the adult sea cucumber CNS is associated with transcriptional activity of genes known to be involved in regulation of various aspects of neurogenesis in other animals. Further analysis of one of those genes, the transcription factor Myc showed that it is expressed, in some, but not all radial glial cells, suggesting heterogeneity of this CNS progenitor cell population in echinoderms.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative relations in protein and RNA folding are deduced from the quantum folding theory of macromolecules. It includes: deduction of the law on the temperature-dependence of folding rate and its tests on protein dataset; study on the chain-length dependence of the folding rate for a large class of biomolecules; deduction of the statistical relation of folding free energy versus chain-length; and deduction of the statistical relation between folding rate and chain length and its test on protein and RNA dataset. In the above quantum approach the influence of the solvent environment factor on folding rate has been taken into account automatically. The successes of the deduction of these new relations from the first principle and their successful comparison with experimental data afford strong evidence on the possible existence of a common quantum mechanism in the conformational change of biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvidence-based clinical practice relies on unbiased reporting of negative results. Meta-analysis of drug safety and efficacy across many clinical trials is difficult given the unconstrained nature of reasons that are provided to ClinicalTrials.gov to explain clinical trial terminations.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe scanned all trials in ClinicalTrials.gov marked with the \\\"terminated\\\" status (N=3122), meaning the trial had been stopped before the scheduled end date. Under the current reporting framework, any number of reasons may be given for termination, and these need not conform to a controlled vocabulary. Here we develop a controlled vocabulary for trial termination, and map each terminated trial to as many as three vocabulary terms. Mapping to this \\\"ontology of termination\\\" allows further analysis and conclusions. First, we identify the subset of terminated trials that ended citing safety concerns (6.2%) or failure to establish efficacy (10.8%), and were further able to stratify these rates across trials of different phases. Second, we examine termination reasons where a stricter data model could have preserved more evidentiary value, either because the data model was misused (7.6%) or because the given reason left unclear whether the decision to terminate was based on analysis of the data (74.9%, with 20.4% mentioning a decision-maker that may have had access to the data). Third, we show that imposing a controlled vocabulary of reasons for termination would avoid ambiguity and improve the evidentiary value of clinical trials.\\n\\nConclusionsWe encourage wider use of an \\\"ontology of termination\\\" and propose four questions that should be posed on trial termination. These simple steps would promote transparency and enable ready access to negative trial results for meta-analysis.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial persistence is a phenomenon wherein small proportion of a bacterial population attains transient antibiotic tolerance likely by virtue of metabolic minimization. Type II Toxin-Antitoxin systems (TAs), small overlapping bicistronic negative auto-regulons, were recently shown to induce the persistence state. Maisonneuve et al., 2013 reported that TAs are activated by a regulatory cascade consisting of stochastic accumulation of ppGpp leading to accumulation of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP). PolyP supposedly is essential for Lon protease-dependent-degradation of antitoxins resulting in activation of toxins and induction of persistence phenotype. In contrast, using semi-quantitative primer extension, we show that transcriptional up-regulation of yefM/yoeB loci, one of the well characterized TAs of Escherichia coli, is independent of ppGpp and polyP. Similarly, we show that chromosome-encoded YoeB-dependent target mRNA cleavage is independent of polyP. Our results and meta-analysis of literature we conclude that the regulation of yefM/yoeB TAs is independent of ppGpp and polyP.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed maximum entropy methods infer evolutionary constraints on protein function and structure from the millions of protein sequences available in genomic databases. The EVfold web server (at EVfold.org) makes these methods available to predict functional and structural interactions in proteins. The key algorithmic development has been to disentangle direct and indirect residue-residue correlations in large multiple sequence alignments and derive direct residue-residue evolutionary couplings (EVcouplings or ECs). For proteins of unknown structure, distance constraints obtained from evolutionarily couplings between residue pairs are used to de novo predict all-atom 3D structures, often to good accuracy. Given sufficient sequence information in a protein family, this is a major advance toward solving the problem of computing the native 3D fold of proteins from sequence information alone.\\n\\nAvailabilityEVfold server at http://evfold.org/\\n\\nContactevfoldtest@gmail.com\\n\\nAbbreviations",
