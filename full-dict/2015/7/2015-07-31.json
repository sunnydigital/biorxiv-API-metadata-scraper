    "abstract": "By combining Haar wavelets with Bayesian Hidden Markov Models, we improve detection of genomic copy number variants (CNV) in array CGH experiments compared to the state-of-the-art, including standard Gibbs sampling. At the same time, we achieve drastically reduced running times, as the method concentrates computational effort on chromosomal segments which are difficult to call, by dynamically and adaptively recomputing consecutive blocks of observations likely to share a copy number. This makes routine diagnostic use and re-analysis of legacy data collections feasible; to this end, we also propose an effective automatic prior.

    "abstract": "Biological organisms rely on their ability to sense and respond appropriately to their environment. The molecular mechanisms that facilitate these essential processes are however subject to a range of random effects and stochastic processes, which jointly affect the reliability of information transmission between receptors and e.g. the physiological downstream response. Information is mathematically defined in terms of the entropy; and the extent of information flowing across an information channel or signalling system is typically measured by the \\\"mutual information\\\", or the reduction in the uncertainty about the output once the input signal is known. Here we quantify how extrinsic and intrinsic noise affect the transmission of simple signals along simple motifs of molecular interaction networks. Even for very simple systems the effects of the different sources of variability alone and in combination can give rise to bewildering complexity. In particular extrinsic variability is apt to generate \\\"apparent\\\" information that can in extreme cases mask the actual information that for a single system would flow between the different molecular components making up cellular signalling pathways. We show how this artificial inflation in apparent information arises and how the effects of different types of noise alone and in combination can be understood.",

    "abstract": "Examples of phenotypic convergence in plumage coloration have been reported in a wide diversity of avian taxonomic groups, yet the underlying evolutionary mechanisms driving this phenomenon have received little scientific inquiry. Herein, we document a striking new case of plumage convergence in the Helmeted Woodpecker (Dryocopus galeatus) and explore the possibility of visual mimicry among Atlantic Forest woodpeckers. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analyses unequivocally place D. galeatus within Celeus, indicating the former has subsequently converged in appearance upon the distantly related and syntopic Dryocopus lineatus, to which it bears a remarkable resemblance in plumage coloration and pattern. Although details of the Helmeted Woodpeckers ecology and natural history are only now beginning to emerge, its smaller size and submissive behavior are consistent with predictions derived from evolutionary game theory models and the interspecific social dominance mimicry hypothesis (ISDM). Moreover, estimates of avian visual acuity suggest that size-related mimetic deception is plausible at distances ecologically relevant to Celeus and Dryocopus foraging behavior. In light of our results, we recommend taxonomic transfer of D. galeatus to Celeus and emphasize the need for detailed behavioral studies that examine the social costs and benefits of plumage convergence to explicitly test for ISDM and other forms of mimicry in these Atlantic Forest woodpecker communities. Future field studies examining potential cases of competitive mimicry should also take into account the mimics acoustic behavior, particularly in the presence of putative model species and other heterospecific competitors, as any discontinuity between morphological and behavioral mimicry would likely preclude the possibility of deception.",

    "abstract": "Life history invariants play a pivotal role in the study of social adaptation: they provide theoretical hypotheses that can be empirically tested, and benchmark frameworks against which new theoretical developments can be understood. Here we derive a novel invariant for dispersal evolution: the \\\"constant philopater hypothesis\\\" (CPH). Specifically, we find that, irrespective of variation in maternal fecundity, all mothers are favoured to produce exactly the same number of philopatric offspring, with high-fecundity mothers investing proportionally more, and low-fecundity mothers investing proportionally less, into dispersing offspring. This result holds for female and male dispersal, under haploid, diploid and haplodiploid modes of inheritance, irrespective of the sex ratio, local resource availability, and whether mother or offspring controls the latters dispersal propensity. We explore the implications of this result for evolutionary conflicts of interest - and the exchange and withholding of contextual information - both within and between families, and we show that the CPH is the fundamental invariant that underpins and explains a wider family of invariance relationships that emerge from the study of social evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven a valuable tool to explore the genetic basis of many traits. However, many GWAS lack statistical power and the commonly used single-point analysis method needs to be complemented to enhance power and interpretation. Multivariate region or gene-wide association are an alternative, allowing for identification of disease genes in a manner more robust to allelic heterogeneity. Gene-based association also facilitates systems biology analyses by generating a single p-value per gene. We have designed and implemented FORGE, a software suite which implements a range of methods for the combination of p-values for the individual genetic variants within a gene or genomic region. The software can be used with summary statistics (marker ids and p-values) and accepts as input the result file formats of commonly used genetic association software. When applied to a study of Crohns disease susceptibility, it identified all genes found by single SNP analysis and additional genes identified by large independent metaanalysis. FORGE p-values on gene-set analyses highlighted association with the Jak-STAT and cytokine signalling pathways, both previously associated with CD. We highlight the softwares main features, its future development directions and provide a comparison with alternative available software tools.

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsertions and deletions (indels) account for more nucleotide differences between two related DNA sequences than substitutions do, and thus it is imperative to develop a stochastic evolutionary model that enables us to reliably calculate the probability of the sequence evolution through indel processes. Recently, such probabilistic models are mostly based on either hidden Markov models (HMMs) or transducer theories, both of which give the indel component of the probability of a given sequence alignment as a product of either probabilities of column-to-column transitions or block-wise contributions along the alignment. However, it is not a priori clear how these models are related with any genuine stochastic evolutionary model, which describes the stochastic evolution of an entire sequence along the time-axis. Moreover, none of these models can fully accommodate biologically realistic features, such as overlapping indels, power-law indel-length distributions, and indel rate variation across regions.\\n\\nResultsHere, we theoretically tackle the ab initio calculation of the probability of a given sequence alignment under a genuine evolutionary model, more specifically, a general continuous-time Markov model of the evolution of an entire sequence via insertions and deletions. Our model allows general indel rate parameters including length distributions but does not impose any unrealistic restrictions on indels. Using techniques of the perturbation theory in physics, we expand the probability into a series over different numbers of indels. Our derivation of this perturbation expansion elegantly bridges the gap between Gillespies (1977) intuitive derivation of his own stochastic simulation method, which is now widely used in evolutionary simulators, and Fellers (1940) mathematically rigorous theorems that underpin Gillespie's method. We find a sufficient and nearly necessary set of conditions under which the probability can be expressed as the product of an overall factor and the contributions from regions separated by gapless columns of the alignment. The indel models satisfying these conditions include those with some kind of rate variation across regions, as well as space-homogeneous models. We also prove that, though with a caveat, pairwise probabilities calculated by the method of Miklos et al. (2004) are equivalent to those calculated by our ab initio formulation, at least under a space-homogenous model.\\n\\nConclusionsOur ab initio perturbative formulation provides a firm theoretical ground that other indel models can rest on.\\n\\n[This paper and three other papers (Ezawa, Graur and Landan 2015a,b,c) describe a series of our efforts to develop, apply, and extend the ab initio perturbative formulation of a general continuous-time Markov model of indels.]",

The unliganded IGF-IR inhibits glucose uptake by astrocytes while its stimulation with IGF-I, in concert with insulin activation of the insulin receptor, produces the opposite effect. In vivo imaging showed that shRNA interference of brain IGF-IR increased glucose uptake by astrocytes while pharmacological blockade of IGF-IR reduced it. Brain 18FGlucose-PET of IGF-IR shRNA injected mice confirmed an inhibitory role of unliganded IGF-IR on glucose uptake, whereas glucose-dependent recovery of neuronal activity in brain slices was blunted by pharmacological blockade of IGF-IR. Mechanistically, we found that the unliganded IGF-IR retains glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), the main glucose transporter in astrocytes, inside the cell while IGF-I, in cooperation with insulin, synergistically stimulates MAPK/PKD to promote association of IGF-IR with GLUT 1 via Rac1/GIPC1 and increases GLUT1 availability at the cell membrane.

    "abstract": "A long-standing problem is how memories can be stored for very long times despite the volatility of the underlying neural substrate, most notably the high turnover of dendritic spines and synapses. To address this problem, here we are using a generic and simple probabilistic model for the creation and removal of synapses. We show that information can be stored for several months when utilizing the intrinsic dynamics of multi-synapse connections. In such systems, single synapses can still show high turnover, which enables fast learning of new information, but this will not perturb prior stored information (slow forgetting), which is represented by the compound state of the connections. The model matches the time course of recent experimental spine data during learning and memory in mice supporting the assumption of multi-synapse connections as the basis for long-term storage.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIt is widely believed that information is stored in the connectivity, i.e. the synapses of neural networks. Yet, the morphological correlates of excitatory synapses, the dendritic spines, have been found to undergo a remarkable turnover on daily basis. This poses the question, how information can be retained on such a variable substrate.\\n\\nIn this study, using connections with multiple synapses, we show that connections which follow the experimentally measured bimodal distribution in the number of synapses can store information orders of magnitude longer than the lifetime of a single synapse. This is a consequence of the underlying bistable collective dynamic of multiple synapses: Single synapses can appear and disappear without disturbing the memory as a whole.\\n\\nFurthermore, increasing or decreasing neural activity changes the distribution of the number of synapses of multi-synaptic connections such that only one of the peaks remains. This leads to a desirable property: information about these altered activities can be stored much faster than it is forgotten. Remarkably, the resulting model dynamics match recent experimental data investigating the long-term effect of learning on the dynamics of dendritic spines.",

    "abstract": "In cognitive neuroscience, electrical brain activity is most commonly recorded at the scalp. In order to infer the contributions and connectivity of underlying neuronal sources within the brain, it is necessary to reconstruct sensor data at the source level. Several approaches to this reconstruction have been developed, thereby solving the so-called implicit inverse problem (Michel et al. 2004). However, a unifying premise against which to validate these source reconstructions is seldom available. The dataset provided in this work, in which brain activity is simultaneously recorded on the scalp (non-invasively) by electroencephalography (EEG) and on the cortex (invasively) by electrocorticography (ECoG), can be of a great help in this direction. These multimodal recordings were obtained from a macaque monkey under wakefulness and sedation. Our primary goal was to establish the connectivity architecture between two sources of interest (frontal and parietal), and to assess how their coupling changes over the conditions. We chose these sources because previous studies have shown that the connections between them are modified by anaesthesia (Boly et al. 2012). Our secondary goal was to evaluate the consistency of the connectivity results when analyzing sources recorded from invasive data (128 implanted ECoG sources) and source activity reconstructed from scalp recordings (19 EEG sensors) at the same locations as the ECoG sources. We conclude that the directed connectivity in the frequency domain between cortical sources reconstructed from scalp EEG is qualitatively similar to the connectivity inferred directly from cortical recordings, using both data-driven (directed transfer function; DTF) and biologically grounded (dynamic causal modelling; DCM) methods. Furthermore, the connectivity changes identified were consistent with previous findings (Boly et al. 2012). Our findings suggest that inferences about directed connectivity based upon non-invasive electrophysiological data have construct validity in relation to invasive recordings.",

    "abstract": "In proteomics, a large proportion of mass spectrometry (MS) data is ignored due to the lack of, or insufficient statistical evidence for mappable peptides. In reality, only a small fraction of features are expected to be differentially relevant anyway. Mapping spectra to peptides and subsequently, proteins, produces uncertainty at several levels. We propose it is better to analyze proteomic profiling data directly at MS level, and then relate these features to peptides/proteins. In a renal cancer data comprising 12 normal and 12 cancer subjects, we demonstrate that a simple rule-based binning approach can give rise to informative features. We note that the peptides associated with significant spectral bins gave rise to better class separation than the corresponding proteins, suggesting a loss of signal in the peptide-to-protein transition. Additionally, the binning approach sharpens focus on relevant protein splice forms rather than just canonical sequences. Taken together, the inverted raw spectra analysis paradigm, which is realised by the MZ-Bin method described in this article, provides new possibilities and insights, in how MS-data can be interpreted.",

    "abstract": "Although a large number of methods exist to control the dynamics of populations to a desired state, few of them have been empirically validated. This limits the scope of using these methods in real-life scenarios. To address this issue, we tested the efficacy of two well-known control methods in enhancing different kinds of stability in highly fluctuating, extinction-prone populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The Upper Limiter Control (ULC) method was able to reduce the fluctuations in population sizes as well as the extinction probability of the populations. On the negative side, it had no effect on the effective population size and required a large amount of effort. On the other hand, Lower Limiter Control (LLC) enhanced effective population size and reduced extinction probability at a relatively low amount of effort. However, its effects on population fluctuations were equivocal. We examined the population size distributions with and without the control methods, to derive biologically intuitive explanations for how these control methods work. We also show that biologically-realistic simulations, using a very general population dynamics model, are able to capture most of the trends of our data. This suggests that our results are likely to be generalizable to a wide range of scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Many classical ecological and evolutionary theoretical frameworks posit that competition between species is an important selective force. For example, in adaptive radiations, resource competition between evolving lineages plays a role in driving phenotypic diversification and exploration of novel ecological space. Nevertheless, current models of trait evolution fit to phylogenies and comparative datasets are not designed to incorporate the effect of competition. The most advanced models in this direction are diversity-dependent models where evolutionary rates depend on lineage diversity. However, these models still treat changes in traits in one branch as independent of the value of traits on other branches, thus ignoring the effect of species similarity on trait evolution. Here, we consider a model where the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in interspecific interactions are influenced by species similarity in trait values and where we can specify which lineages are in sympatry. We develop a maximum-likelihood based approach to fit this model to combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the approach accurately estimates the simulated parameter values across a broad range of parameter space. Additionally, we develop tools for specifying the biogeographic context in which trait evolution occurs. In order to compare models, we also apply these biogeographic methods to specify which lineages interact sympatrically for two diversity-dependent models. Finally, we fit these various models to morphological data from a classical adaptive radiation (Greater Antillean Anolis lizards). We show that models that account for competition and geography perform better than other models. The matching competition model is an important new tool for studying the influence of interspecific interactions, in particular competition, on phenotypic evolution. More generally, it constitutes a step toward a better integration of interspecific interactions in many ecological and evolutionary processes.",
