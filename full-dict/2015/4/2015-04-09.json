    "abstract": "We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of human influenza A H3 hemagglutinin evolution, considering three distinct predictors of evolutionary variation at individual sites: solvent accessibility (as a proxy for protein fold stability and/or conservation), experimental epitope sites (as a proxy for host immune bias), and proximity to the receptor-binding region (as a proxy for protein function). We found that these three predictors individually explain approximately 15% of the variation in site-wise dN/dS. The solvent accessibility and proximity predictors were largely independent of each other, while the epitope sites were not. In combination, solvent accessibility and proximity explained 32% of the variation in dN/dS. Incorporating experimental epitope sites into the model added only an additional 2 percentage points. We also found that the historical H3 epitope sites, which date back to the 1980s and 1990s, showed only weak overlap with the latest experimental epitope data. Finally, sites with dN/dS > 1, i.e., the sites most likely driving seasonal immune escape, are not correctly predicted by either historical or experimental epitope sites, but only by proximity to the receptor-binding region. In summary, proximity to the receptor-binding region, and not host immune bias, seems to be the primary determinant of H3 evolution.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe influenza virus is one of the most rapidly evolving human viruses. Every year, it accumulates mutations that allow it to evade the host immune response of previously infected individuals. Which sites in the virus genome allow this immune escape and the manner of escape is not entirely understood, but conventional wisdom states that specific \\\"immune epitope sites\\\" in the protein hemagglutinin are preferentially attacked by host antibodies and that these sites mutate to directly avoid host recognition; as a result, these sites are commonly targeted by vaccine development efforts. Here, we combine influenza hemagglutinin sequence data, protein structural information, experimental immune epitope data, and historical epitopes to demonstrate that neither the historical epitope groups nor epitopes based on experimental data are crucial for predicting the rate of influenza evolution. Instead, we find that a simple geometrical model works best: sites that are closest to the location where the virus binds the human receptor are the primary driver of hemagglutinin evolution. There are two possible explanations for this result. First, the existing historical and experimental epitope sites may not be the real antigenic sites in hemagglutinin. Second, alternatively, hemagglutinin antigenicity may not the primary driver of influenza evolution.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for assembling metabolic pathways require a process of repeated trial and error and have a long design-build-test cycle. Further, it remains a challenge to precisely tune enzyme expression levels for maximizing target metabolite production. Recently it was shown that a cell-free transcriptional-translation system (TX-TL) can be used to rapidly prototype novel complex biocircuits as well as metabolic pathways. TX-TL systems allow protein expression from multiple DNA pieces, opening up the possibility of modulating concentrations of DNA encoding individual pathway enzymes and testing the related effect on metabolite production. In this work, we demonstrate TX-TL as a platform for exploring the design space of metabolic pathways using a 1,4-BDO biosynthesis pathway as an example. Using TX-TL, we verified enzyme expression and enzyme activity and identified the conversion of 4-hydroxybutyrate to downstream metabolites as a limiting step of the 1,4-BDO pathway. We further tested combinations of various enzyme expression levels and found increasing downstream enzyme expression levels improved 1,4-BDO production.",

    "abstract": "In tropical forests, one of the most common relationships between parasites and insects is that between the fungus Ophiocordyceps (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales, Ascomycota) and ants, especially within the tribe Camponotini. These fungi have the ability to penetrate the exoskeleton of the ant and to manipulate the behavior of the host, making it leave the nest and ascend understorey shrubs, to die biting onto the vegetation: hence, the term zombie-ant fungi to describe this behavioral changes on the host. It is posited that this behavioral change aids spore dispersal and thus increases the chances of infection. Despite their undoubted importance for ecosystem functioning, these fungal pathogens are still poorly documented, especially regarding their diversity, ecology and evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe multiple new and host-specific species of the genus Ophiocordyceps on Camponotus and Polyrhachis ants from the central Amazonian region of Brazil, USA, Australia and Japan, which can readily be separated using classic taxonomic criteria, in particular ascospore morphology.",

    "abstract": "Metagenome studies are becoming increasingly widespread, yielding important insights into microbial communities covering diverse environments from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to human skin and gut. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms, the use of large scale shotgun sequencing approaches is now commonplace. However, a thorough independent benchmark comparing state-of-the-art metagenome analysis tools is lacking. Here we present a benchmark where the most widely used tools are tested on complex, realistic data sets. Our results clearly show that the most widely used tools are not necessarily the most accurate, that the most accurate tool is not necessarily the most time consuming, and that there is a high degree of variability between available tools. These findings are important as the conclusions of any metagenomics study are affected by errors in the predicted community composition and functional capacity.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPImputation of genotypes in a study sample can make use of sequenced or densely genotyped external reference panels consisting of individuals that are not from the study sample. It can also employ internal reference panels, incorporating a subset of individuals from the study sample itself. Internal panels offer an advantage over external panels, as they can reduce imputation errors arising from genetic dissimilarity between a population of interest and a second, distinct population from which the external reference panel has been constructed. As the cost of next-generation sequencing decreases, internal reference panel selection is becoming increasingly feasible. However, it is not clear how best to select individuals to include in such panels. We introduce a new method for selecting an internal reference panel--minimizing the average distance to the closest leaf (ADCL)--and compare its performance relative to an earlier algorithm: maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD). Employing both simulated data and sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that ADCL provides a significant improvement in imputation accuracy, especially for imputation of sites with low-frequency alleles. This improvement in imputation accuracy is robust to changes in reference panel size, marker density, and length of the imputation target region.",

    "abstract": "Projections from the substantia nigra and striatum traverse through the pallidum on the way to their targets. To date, in vivo characterization of these pathways remains elusive. Here we used high angular resolution diffusion imaging (N=138) to study the characteristics and structural subcompartments of the human pallidum. Our results show that the diffusion orientation distribution at the pallidum is asymmetrically oriented in a dorsolateral direction, consistent with the orientation of underlying fiber systems. Furthermore, compared to the outer pallidal segment, the internal segment has more peaks in the orientation distribution function and stronger anisotropy in the primary fiber direction, consistent with known cellular differences between the underlying nuclei. These differences in orientation, complexity, and degree of anisotropy are sufficiently robust to automatically segment the pallidal nuclei using diffusion properties. Thus the gray matter diffusion signal can be useful as an in vivo measure of the collective nigrostriatal and striatonigral pathways.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that non-annotated short open reading frames (sORFs) can encode functional micropeptides, but computational identification remains challenging. We expand our published method and predict conserved sORFs in human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly and the nematode C. elegans. Isolating specific conservation signatures indicative of purifying selection on encoded amino acid sequence, we identify about 2000 novel sORFs in the untranslated regions of canonical mRNAs or on transcripts annotated as non-coding. Predicted sORFs show stronger conservation signatures than those identified in previous studies and are sometimes conserved over large evolutionary distances. Encoded peptides have little homology to known proteins and are enriched in disordered regions and short interaction motifs. Published ribosome profiling data indicate translation for more than 100 of novel sORFs, and mass spectrometry data gives peptidomic evidence for more than 70 novel candidates. We thus provide a catalog of conserved micropeptides for functional validation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We present a mechanism by which organisms with only a single photoreceptor, that have a monochromatic view of the world, can achieve color discrimination. The combination of an off-axis pupil and the principle of chromatic aberration (where light of different colors focus at different distances behind a lens) can combine to provide \\\"color-blind\\\" animals with a way to distinguish colors. As a specific example we constructed a computer model of the visual system of cephalopods, (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish) that have a single unfiltered photoreceptor type. Nevertheless, cephalopods dramatically change color both to produce chromatically-matched camouflage and to signal conspecifics. This presents a paradox - an apparent ability to determine color in organisms with a monochromatic visual system - that has been a long-standing puzzle. We demonstrate that chromatic blurring dominates the visual acuity in these animals, and we quantitatively show how chromatic aberration can be exploited, especially through non-axial pupils that are characteristic of cephalopods, to obtain spectral information. This mechanism is consistent with the extensive suite of visual/behavioral and physiological data that have been obtained from cephalopod studies, and resolves the apparent paradox of vivid chromatic behaviors in \\\"color-blind\\\" animals. Moreover, this proposed mechanism has potential applicability in any organisms with limited photoreceptor complements, such as spiders and dolphins.",

    "abstract": "The central challenge in tumor sequencing studies is to identify driver genes and pathways, investigate their functional relationships and nominate drug targets. The efficiency of these analyses, particularly for infrequently mutated genes, is compromised when patients carry different combinations of driver mutations. Mutual exclusivity analysis helps address these challenges. To identify mutually exclusive gene sets (MEGS), we developed a powerful and flexible analytic framework based on a likelihood ratio test and a model selection procedure. Extensive simulations demonstrated that our method outperformed existing methods for both statistical power and the capability of identifying the exact MEGS, particularly for highly imbalanced MEGS. Our method can be used for de novo discovery, pathway-guided searches or for expanding established small MEGS. We applied our method to the whole exome sequencing data for fourteen cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified multiple previously unreported non-pairwise MEGS in multiple cancer types. For acute myeloid leukemia, we identified a novel MEGS with five genes (FLT3, IDH2, NRAS, KIT and TP53) and a MEGS (NPM1, TP53 and RUX1)s whose mutation status was strongly associated with survival (P=6.7x10-4). For breast cancer, we identified a significant MEGS consisting of TP53 and four infrequently mutated genes (ARID1A, AKT1, MED23 and TBL1XR1), providing support for their role as cancer drivers.",
