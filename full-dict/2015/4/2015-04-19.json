    "abstract": "Recently, psychophysical laws have been observed to be functional in certain factors working downstream of the Wnt pathway. This work tests the veracity of the prevalence of such laws, albeit at a coarse level, using sensitivity analysis on biologically inspired epigenetically influenced computational causal models. In this work, the variation in the effect of the predictive behaviour of the transcription complex (TRCMPLX) conditional on the evidences of gene expressions in normal/tumor samples is observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Preliminary analysis shows that the variation in predictive behaviour of TRCMPLX follows power-logarithmic psychophysical law, crudely. More recently, wet lab experiments have proved the existence of sensors that behave in a logarithmic fashion thus supporting the earlier proposed postulates based on computational sensitivity analysis of this manuscript regarding the existence of logarithmic behaviour in the signaling pathways. It also signifies the importance of systems biology approach where in silico experiments combined with in vivo/in vitro experiments have the power to explore the deeper mechanisms of a signaling pathway. Additionally, it is hypothesized that these laws are prevalent at gene-gene interaction level also. The interactions were obtained by thresholding the inferred conditional probabilities of a gene activation given the status of another gene activation. The deviation in the interactions in normal/tumor samples was similarly observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Analysis of deviation in interactions show prevalence of psychophysical laws and is reported for interaction between elements of pairs (SFRP3, MYC), (SFRP2, CD44) and (DKK1, DACT2). Based on crude static models, it is assumed that dynamic models of Bayesian networks might reveal the phenomena in a better way.",

    "abstract": "We present a mechanism by which organisms with only a single photoreceptor, that have a monochromatic view of the world, can achieve color discrimination. The combination of an off-axis pupil and the principle of chromatic aberration (where light of different colors focus at different distances behind a lens) can combine to provide \\\"color-blind\\\" animals with a way to distinguish colors. As a specific example we constructed a computer model of the visual system of cephalopods, (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish) that have a single unfiltered photoreceptor type. Nevertheless, cephalopods dramatically change color both to produce chromatically-matched camouflage and to signal conspecifics. This presents a paradox - an apparent ability to determine color in organisms with a monochromatic visual system - that has been a long-standing puzzle. We demonstrate that chromatic blurring dominates the visual acuity in these animals, and we quantitatively show how chromatic aberration can be exploited, especially through non-axial pupils that are characteristic of cephalopods, to obtain spectral information. This mechanism is consistent with the extensive suite of visual/behavioral and physiological data that have been obtained from cephalopod studies, and resolves the apparent paradox of vivid chromatic behaviors in \\\"color-blind\\\" animals. Moreover, this proposed mechanism has potential applicability in any organisms with limited photoreceptor complements, such as spiders and dolphins.",
