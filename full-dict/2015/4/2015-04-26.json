    "abstract": "Is visual cortex made up of general-purpose information processing machinery, or does it consist of a collection of specialized modules? If prior knowledge, acquired from learning a set of objects is only transferable to new objects that share properties with the old, then the recognition systems optimal organization must be one containing specialized modules for different object classes. Our analysis starts from a premise we call the invariance hypothesis: that the computational goal of the ventral stream is to compute an invariant-to-transformations and discriminative signature for recognition. The key condition enabling approximate transfer of invariance without sacrificing discriminability turns out to be that the learned and novel objects transform similarly. This implies that the optimal recognition system must contain subsystems trained only with data from similarly-transforming objects and suggests a novel interpretation of domain-specific regions like the fusiform face area (FFA). Furthermore, we can define an index of transformation-compatibility, computable from videos, that can be combined with information about the statistics of natural vision to yield predictions for which object categories ought to have domain-specific regions in agreement with the available data. The result is a unifying account linking the large literature on view-based recognition with the wealth of experimental evidence concerning domain-specific regions.",

    "abstract": "The chemically and physically induced pluripotency in a stem cell is studied from the point of quantum transition between differentiation and pluripotency states in genes. The quantum folding theory of a macromolecule is briefly reviewed. The relation of protein folding rate with the number N of torsion modes participating in the quantum transition (coherence degree) is discussed and a simple statistical relationship is obtained. As a unifying approach to conformational quantum transition the folding rate formula can be generalized from protein to nucleic acid. It is found that the formula of folding rate versus N well fits RNA folding data. Then the quantum folding theory is applied to study the pluripotency conversion in stem cell. We proved that the acquisition of pluripotency is essentially a quantum-stochastic event of small-probability through the comparison of the rate with protein folding. Due to the large coherence degree of DNA and the uphill nature of torsion transition the pluripotency-acquisition rate should be small. By establishing the reaction network of the conformational change of the pluripotency genes the characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition rate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape of the coherent domain of the gene is analyzed from the rate equation. Based on these studies an approach to the physically induced pluripotency with higher rate is proposed.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the consequences of genetic differences between humans is essential for understanding phenotypic diversity and personalized medicine. Although variation in RNA levels, transcription factor binding and chromatin have been explored, little is known about global variation in translation and its genetic determinants. We used ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a diverse group of individuals. We find significant differences in RNA, translation, and protein levels suggesting diverse mechanisms of personalized gene expression control. Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences. Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy - many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs. Our results reveal a new level of gene expression variation among humans and indicate that genetic variants can cause changes in protein levels through effects on translation.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and accurate detection of antibiotic resistance in pathogens is an urgent need, affecting both patient care and population-scale control. Microbial genome sequencing promises much, but many barriers exist to its routine deployment. Here, we address these challenges, using a de Bruijn graph comparison of clinical isolate and curated knowledge-base to identify species and predict resistance profile, including minor populations. This is implemented in a package, Mykrobe predictor, for S. aureus and M. tuberculosis, running in under three minutes on a laptop from raw data. For S. aureus, we train and validate in 495/471 samples respectively, finding error rates comparable to gold-standard phenotypic methods, with sensitivity/specificity of 99.3%/99.5% across 12 drugs. For M. tuberculosis, we identify species and predict resistance with specificity of 98.5% (training/validating on 1920/1609 samples). Sensitivity of 82.6% is limited by current understanding of genetic mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of an emerging single-molecule sequencing technique.",
