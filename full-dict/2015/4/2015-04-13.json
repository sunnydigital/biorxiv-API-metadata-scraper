    "abstract": "With massive amount of sequencing data generated for many epigenetic features in a variety of cell and tissue types, the chief challenges are to build effective and quantitative models explaining how the dynamics in multiple epigenomes lead to differential gene expression and diverse phenotypes. We developed a unified Bayesian framework for jointly annotating multiple epigenomes and detecting differential regulation among multiple tissues and cell types over regions of varying sizes. Our method, called IDEAS (integrative and discriminative epigenome annotation system), achieves superior power and accuracy over existing methods by modeling both position and cell type specific regulatory activities. Using 84 ENCODE epigenetic data sets in 6 cell types, we identified epigenetic variation of different sizes that are strongly associated with differential gene expression. The detected regions are significantly enriched in genetic variants associated with complex phenotypes. Our results yielded much stronger enrichment scores than achievable by existing approaches, and the enriched phenotypes are highly relevant to the corresponding cell types. IDEAS is a powerful statistical tool for integrative annotation of regulatory elements and detection of multivariate epigenetic variation in many tissues and cell types, which could be of important utility in elucidating the interplay between genetic variants, gene regulation and diseases.\\n\\nThe states generated by IDEAS can be visualized or downloaded from the \\\"Regulation\\\" section of http://main.genome-browser.bx.psu.edu/",

    "abstract": "Here we present the first genomic data for the African wolf (Canis aureus lupaster) and conclusively demonstrate that it is a unique taxon and not a hybrid between other canids. These animals are commonly misclassified as golden jackals (Canis aureus) and have never been included in any large-scale studies of canid diversity and biogeography, or in investigations of the early stages of dog domestication. Applying massive Restriction Site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, 110481 polymorphic sites across the genome of 7 individuals of African wolf were aligned and compared with other wolf-like canids (golden jackal, Holarctic grey wolf, Ethiopian wolf, side-striped jackal and domestic dog). Analyses of this extensive sequence dataset (ca. 8.5Mb) show conclusively that the African wolves represent a distinct taxon more closely related to the Holarctic grey wolf than to the golden jackal. Our results strongly indicate that the distribution of the golden jackal needs to be re-evaluated and point towards alternative hypotheses for the evolution of the rare and endemic Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis). Furthermore, the extension of the grey wolf phylogeny and distribution opens new possible scenarios for the timing and location of dog domestication.",

    "abstract": "The post-genomic era has brought opportunities to bridge traditionally separate fields on early history of life. New methods promote a deeper understanding of the origin of biodiversity. Relative stabilities of base triplexes are able to regulate base substitutions in triplex DNAs. We constructed a roadmap based on such a regulation to explain concurrent origins of the genetic code and the homochirality of life. Based on the recruitment order of codons in the roadmap and the complete genome sequences, we reconstructed the three-domain tree of life. The Phanerozoic biodiversity curve has been reconstructed based on genomic, climatic and eustatic data; this result supports tectonic cause of mass extinctions. Our results indicate that chirality played a crucial role in the origin and evolution of life.

    "abstract": "Dispersal, and the underlying movement behaviour, are processes of pivotal importance for understanding and predicting metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics. Generally, dispersal decisions are non-random and rely on information, such as the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard information use. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is informed and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta-)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement are informed and adjusted by the strength of inter-specific interactions. We found that predicting informed movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and inter-specific interaction strength. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking inter-specific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of information use for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsAll authors designed the study.

    "abstract": "Conserved genetic programs often predate the homologous structures and phenotypes to which they give rise; eyes, for example, have evolved several dozen times, but their development seems to involve a common set of conserved genes. Recently, the concept of orthologous phenotypes (or phenologs) offered a quantitative way to describe this property. Phenologs are phenotypes or diseases from separate species who share an unexpectedly large set of their associated gene orthologs. It has been shown that the phenotype pairs which make up a phenolog are mutually predictive in terms of the genes involved. Recently, we demonstrated the ranking of gene-phenotype association predictions using multiple phenologs from an array of species. In this work, we demonstrate a computational method which provides a more targeted view of the conserved pathways which give rise to diseases. Our approach involves the generation of synthetic pseudophenotypes made up of Boolean combinations (union, intersection, and difference) of the gene sets for phenotypes from our database. We search for diseases that overlap significantly with these Boolean phenotypes, and find a number of highly predictive combinations. While set unions produce less specific predictions (as expected), intersection and difference-based combinations appear to offer insights into extremely specific aspects of target diseases. For example, breast cancer is predicted by zebrafish methylmercury response minus metal ion response, with predictions MT-COI, JUN, SOD2, GADD45B, and BAX all involved in the pro-apoptotic response to reactive oxygen species, thought to be a key player in cancer. We also demonstrate predictions from Arabidopsis Boolean phenotypes for increased brown adipose tissue in mouse (salt stress responses intersection with sucrose stimulus response); and for human myopathy (red light response minus water deprivation response). We demonstrate the ranking of predictions for human holoprosencephaly from the set intersections between each pair of a variety of closely-related zebrafish phenotypes. Our results suggest that Boolean phenolog combinations may provide a more informed insight into the conserved pathways underlying diseases than either regular phenologs or the naive Bayes approach.",

    "abstract": "We recently described rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging, a novel method for estimating sensitivity of a biological system to a drug. We tested its accuracy in simulated biological signals with varying receptor sensitivity and varying levels of random noise, and presented initial proof-of-concept data from functional MRI (fMRI) studies in primate brain. However, the initial simulation testing used a simple iterative approach to estimate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) parameters, an approach that was computationally efficient but returned parameters only from a small, discrete set of values chosen a priori.\\n\\nHere we revisit the simulation testing using a Bayesian method to estimate the PKPD parameters. This improved accuracy compared to our previous method, and noise without intentional signal was never interpreted as signal. We also reanalyze the fMRI proof-of-concept data. The success with the simulated data, and with the limited fMRI data, is a necessary first step toward further testing of rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging.",

Rapid categorization paradigms have been extensively used to study our core perceptual abilities when the visual system is forced to operate under strong time constraints. However, the neural underpinning of rapid categorization remains to be understood, and the incredible speed of sight has yet to be reconciled with modern ventral stream cortical theories of shape processing.\\n\\nHere we recorded multichannel subdural electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals from intermediate areas (V4/PIT) of the ventral stream of the visual cortex while monkeys were actively engaged in detecting the presence or absence of animal targets in natural scenes. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, we quantified at millisecond precision task-relevant signals conveyed by ECoG data. Reliable neural decoding was possible shortly after stimulus onset from single trials with a degree of generalization to experimental manipulations closely mimicking monkeys accuracy and reaction time.\\n\\nTogether, the present study suggests that rapid ventral stream neural activity induces a selective task-relevant signal subsequently used to drive visual categorization.\\n\\nClassificationBiological sciences / Neuroscience",
