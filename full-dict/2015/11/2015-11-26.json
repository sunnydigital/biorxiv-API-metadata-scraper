    "abstract": "Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can also be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, based on controlling for indirect effects with linear or generalized linear models, also performed well. Indirect effects reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce incorrect inferences, however.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization results in pervasive habitat fragmentation and reduces standing genetic variation through bottlenecks and drift. Loss of genome-wide variation may ultimately reduce the evolutionary potential of animal populations experiencing rapidly changing conditions. In this study, we examined genome-wide variation among 23 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations sampled along an urbanization gradient in the New York City metropolitan area. Genome-wide variation was estimated as a proxy for evolutionary potential using more than 10,000 SNP markers generated by ddRAD-Seq. We found that genome-wide variation is inversely related to urbanization as measured by percent impervious surface cover, and to a lesser extent, human population density. We also report that urbanization results in enhanced genome-wide differentiation between populations in cities. There was no pattern of isolation by distance among these populations, but an isolation by resistance model based on impervious surface significantly explained patterns of genetic differentiation. Isolation by environment modeling also indicated that urban populations deviate much more strongly from global allele frequencies than suburban or rural populations. This study is the first to examine loss of genome-wide SNP variation along an urban-to-rural gradient and quantify urbanization as a driver of population genomic patterns.",

    "abstract": "Both species and their interactions are affected by changes that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and these changes shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic structure. That said, extant ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host-parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.",

    "abstract": "Opsins are photosensitive proteins catalyzing light-dependent processes across the tree of life. For both microbial (type 1) and metazoan (type 2) opsins, photosensing depends upon covalent interaction between a retinal chromophore and a conserved lysine residue. Despite recent discoveries of potential opsin homologs lacking this residue, phylogenetic dispersal and functional significance of these abnormal sequences have not yet been investigated. We report discovery of a large group of putatively non-retinal binding opsins, present in a number of fungal and microbial genomes and comprising nearly 30% of opsins in the Halobacteriacea, a model clade for opsin photobiology. Based on phylogenetic analyses, structural modeling, genomic context and biochemistry, we propose that these abnormal opsin homologs represent a novel family of sensory opsins which may be involved in taxis response to one or more non-light stimuli. This finding challenges current understanding of microbial opsins as a light-specific sensory family, and provides a potential analogy with the highly diverse signaling capabilities of the eukaryotic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), of which metazoan type 2 opsins are a light-specific sub-clade.",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a general mechanism of transcript diversification in mammals, which has been recently linked to proliferative states and cancer. Different 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) isoforms interact with different RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which modify the stability, translation, and subcellular localization of the corresponding transcripts. Although the heterogeneity of pre-mRNA 3 end processing has been established with high-throughput approaches, the mechanisms that underlie systematic changes in 3 UTR lengths remain to be characterized. Through a uniform analysis of a large number of 3 end sequencing data sets we have uncovered 18 signals, 6 of which novel, whose positioning with respect to pre-mRNA cleavage sites indicates a role in pre-mRNA 3 end processing in both mouse and human. With 3 end sequencing we have demonstrated that the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), which binds the poly(U) motif whose frequency also peaks in the vicinity of polyadenylation (poly(A)) sites, has a genome-wide effect on poly(A) site usage. HNRNPC-regulated 3 UTRs are enriched in ELAV-like RNA binding protein 1 (ELAVL1) binding sites and include those of the CD47 molecule (CD47) gene, which participate in the recently discovered mechanism of 3 UTR-dependent protein localization (UDPL). Our study thus establishes an up-to-date, high-confidence catalog of 3 end processing sites and poly(A) signals and it uncovers an important role of HNRNPC in regulating 3 end processing. It further suggests that U-rich elements mediate interactions with multiple RBPs that regulate different stages in a transcripts life cycle.",

    "abstract": "During normal organ development, the progenitor cell state is transient: it depends on specific combinations of transcription factors and extracellular signals, that cooperate to sustain the proliferative potential and undifferentiated status of organ progenitor cells. Not surprisingly, abnormal maintenance of progenitor transcription factors may lead to tissue overgrowth, and the concurrence of specific signals from the local environment is often critical to trigger this overgrowth. Therefore, the identification of the specific combinations of transcription factors and signals that promote or oppose proliferation in progenitor cells is essential to understand normal development and disease. We have investigated this issue by asking what signals may promote the proliferation of eye progenitors in Drosophila. Two transcription factors, the MEIS1 homologue homothorax (hth) and the Zn-finger teashirt (tsh) are transiently expressed in eye progenitors causing the expansion of the progenitor pool. However, if their co-expression is maintained experimentally, cell proliferation continues and differentiation is halted. Here we show that Hth+Tsh-induced tissue overgrowth requires the BMP2 ligand Dpp and the activation of its pathway. In Hth+Tsh cells, the Dpp pathway is abnormally hyperactivated. Rather than using autocrine Dpp expression, Hth+Tsh cells increase their avidity for Dpp, produced locally, by upregulating extracellular matrix components. During normal development, Dpp represses hth and tsh ensuring that the progenitor state is transient. However, cells in which Hth+Tsh expression is maintained use Dpp to enhance their proliferation.\\n\\nSummary StatementIn Drosophila, homothorax, the Meis1 homologue, and teashirt jointly sustain the proliferation of eye progenitor cells by increasing their avidity for BMP produced by the local microenvironment.",

In order to understand how biofilms form and contribute to infection, in vitro biofilm systems such as microtitre plate assays and flow cells, have been heavily used by many research groups around the world. Whilst these methods have greatly increased our understanding of the biology of biofilms, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many of our in vitro methods do not accurately represent in vivo conditions. Here we present a systematic review of the most widely used in vitro biofilm systems, and we discuss why they are not always representative of the in vivo biofilms found in chronic infections. We present examples of methods that will help us to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo biofilm work, so that our bench-side data can ultimately be used to improve bedside treatment.",

We assigned individuals to evolutionary clusters and then inferred recent divergence times, population size changes, and migration using genome-wide SNPs genotyped in 23 populations sampled along an urban-to-rural gradient. Both prehistoric climatic events and recent urbanization impacted these populations. Our modeling indicates that post-glacial sea level rise led to isolation of mainland and Long Island populations. These models also indicate that several urban parks represent recently-isolated P. leucopus populations, and the estimated divergence times for these populations are consistent with the history of urbanization in New York City.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies involving the 3-dimensional conformation of chromatin have revealed the important role it has to play in different processes within the cell. These studies have also led to the discovery of densely interacting segments of the chromosome, called topologically associating domains. The accurate identification of these domains from Hi-C interaction data is an interesting and important computational problem for which numerous methods have been proposed. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms designed to identify these domains assume that they are non-overlapping whereas there is substantial evidence to believe a nested structure exists. We present an efficient methodology to predict hierarchical chromatin domains using chromatin conformation capture data. Our method predicts domains at different resolutions and uses these to construct a hierarchy that is based on intrinsic properties of the chromatin data. The hierarchy consists of a set of non-overlapping domains, that maximize intra-domain interaction frequencies, at each level. We show that our predicted structure is highly enriched for CTCF and various other chromatin markers. We also show that large-scale domains, at multiple resolutions within our hierarchy, are conserved across cell types and species.

This may result in repositioning the drug in a new indication or improving our current understanding of its efficacy and side effects. While there is a substantial body of research on TF methods, there is still a need to improve their validation, which is often limited to a small part of the available targets and not easily interpretable by the user. Here we discuss how target-centric TF methods are inherently limited by the number of targets that can possibly predict (this number is by construction much larger in ligand-centric techniques). We also propose a new benchmark to validate TF methods, which is particularly suited to analyse how predictive performance varies with the query molecule. On average over approved drugs, we estimate that only five predicted targets will have to be tested to find two true targets with submicromolar potency (a strong variability in performance is however observed). In addition, we find that an approved drug has currently an average of eight known targets, which reinforces the notion that polypharmacology is a common and strong event. Furthermore, with the assistance of a control group of randomly-selected molecules, we show that the targets of approved drugs are generally harder to predict.",

In principle, knowing all information about species traits would make phylogenetic information redundant, at least that component of phylogenetic signal in the distribution of species among communities that is caused by phylogenetically related species sharing similar traits. In reality, phylogenies may contain more information than a set of singular, discretely measured traits because we cannot measure all species traits and may misjudge which are most important. The extent to which functional trait information makes phylogenetic information redundant, however, has not been explicitly studied with empirical data in community ecology. Here, we use phylogenetic linear mixed models to analyze community assembly of 55 understory plant species in 30 forest sites in central Wisconsin. These communities show strong phylogenetic attraction, yet variation among sites in 20 environmental variables could not account for this pattern. Most of the 15 functional traits we measured had strong phylogenetic signal, but only three varied strongly among sites in ways that affected species abundances. These three traits explained only 19% of variation in phylogenetic patterns of species co-occurrence. Thus, phylogenies appear to provide considerably more information about community assembly than the functional traits measured in this study, demonstrating the value of phylogeny in studying of community assembly processes even with abundant functional traits.",

We operationalize attention with a continuous performance task and variables from signal detection theory, and reward/aversion with a keypress task using variables from relative preference theory. We find that while the relationship between reward/aversion and attention is functionally invariant, a power law formulation akin to the Cobb-Douglas production function in economics provides the best model fit and theoretical explanation for the interaction. These results indicate that a decreasing signal-to-noise with signal detection results in higher loss aversion. Furthermore, the estimated exponents for the multiplicative power law suggest capacity constraints to processing for attention and reward/aversion. These results demonstrate a systemic interaction of attention and reward/aversion across subjects, with a quantitative schema raising the hypothesis that mechanistic inference may be possible at the level of behavior alone.",

More recently, it has become clear that deviations from normal gene dosage are associated with multiple disorders in a range of species including humans. While we are beginning to understand some of the transcriptional effects brought about by gene dosage changes and the chromosome rearrangement breakpoints associated with them, much of this work relies on isolated examples. We have systematically examined deficiencies on the left arm of chromosome 2 and characterize gene-by-gene dosage responses that vary from collapsed expression through modest partial dosage compensation to full or even over compensation. We found negligible long-range effects of creating novel chromosome domains at deletion breakpoints, suggesting that cases of changes in gene regulation due to altered nuclear architecture are rare. These rare cases include trans de-repression when deficiencies delete chromatin characterized as repressive in other studies. Generally, effects of breakpoints on expression are promoter proximal (~100 bp) or within the gene body. Genome-wide effects of deficiencies are observed at genes with regulatory relationships to genes within the deleted segments, highlighting the subtle expression network defects in these sensitized genetic backgrounds.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDeletions alter gene dose in heterozygotes and bring distant regions of the genome into juxtaposition. We find that the transcriptional dose response is generally varied, gene-specific, and coherently propagates into gene expression regulatory networks. Analysis of deletion heterozygote expression profiles indicates that distinct genetic pathways are weakened in adult flies bearing different deletions even though they show minimal or no overt phenotypes. While there are exceptions, breakpoints have a minimal effect on the expression of flanking genes, despite the fact that different regions of the genome are brought into contact and that important elements such as insulators are deleted. These data suggest that there is little effect of nuclear architecture and long-range enhancer and/or silencer promoter contact on gene expression in the compact Drosophila genome.",

To address this question in a dynamic system, we mapped the proteomics and transcriptomics changes in mammalian cells responding to stress induced by dithiothreitol over 30 hours. Specifically, we estimated the kinetic parameters for synthesis and degradation of RNA and proteins, and deconvoluted response patterns common and unique to each regulatory level using a new statistical tool. Overall, both regulatory levels were equally important, but differed in their impact on molecule concentrations. Both mRNA and protein changes peaked between two and eight hours, but mRNA expression fold changes were much smaller than those of the proteins. Further, mRNA concentrations were regulated in a transient, spike-like pattern and returned to values close to pre-treatment levels by the end of the experiment. In contrast, protein concentrations switched only once and established a new steady state, consistent with the dominant role of protein regulation during misfolding stress. Finally, we generated hypotheses on specific regulatory modes for example groups of genes.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms are a significant medical challenge as they are recalcitrant to current therapeutic regimes. A key component of biofilm formation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the structural biofilm scaffold and protection against antimicrobials and host defenses. Given that the glycoside hydrolases - PelAh and PslGh - encoded in the pel and psl biosynthetic operons, respectively, are utilized for in vivo exopolysaccharide processing, we reasoned that these would provide specificity to target P. aeruginosa biofilms. Evaluating these enzymes as potential therapeutics, we demonstrate that these glycoside hydrolases selectively target and degrade the exopolysaccharide component of the biofilm matrix and that nanomolar concentrations of these enzymes can both prevent biofilm formation as well as rapidly disrupt preexisting biofilms in vitro. This treatment was effective against clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa isolates and reduced biofilm biomass by 58-94%. These non-cytotoxic enzymes potentiated antibiotics as the addition of either enzyme to a sub-lethal concentration of colistin reduced viable bacterial counts by 2.5 orders of magnitude. Additionally, PelAh was able to increase neutrophil killing by ~50%. This work illustrates the feasibility and benefits of using bacterial exopolysaccharide biosynthetic glycoside hydrolases and synthetic biology to develop novel anti-biofilm therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "As the pace of implementing personalized medicine concepts increases, high-throughput variant calling on hundreds of individual genomes per day is a reality that will likely be faced by sequencing facilities across the country in the near future. While the scientific best practices for human variant calling workflows have been well defined, they also pose serious computational challenges at this high scale. Therefore, efforts in both academia and the private sector have focused on developing alternative workflows that may substantially reduce the computational cost per individual genome. Isaac is an \\\"ultra-fast\\\" variant calling workflow, designed by Illumina, Inc, and is claimed to be six times faster than BWA-GATK, with comparable sensitivity and specificity. This report is an independent review of Isaac, mainly focused on the accuracy of variant calls. We note that Isaac is indeed quite fast, and provide some benchmarks on a few hardware architectures. The overall conclusion from our analysis is that the Isaac workflow has undergone substantial improvement from version 01.14.11.27 to Isaac_2.0. The call accuracy is especially high on NA12878, however exomes tend to have a high fraction of false positive calls. We did not manage to reproduce the 99% sensitivity and specificity reported in the Illumina whitepaper, however that might be improved with further tweaking of the options. This report includes the information about some of the command-line parameters and documentation.",
