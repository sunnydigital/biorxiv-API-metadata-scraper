    "abstract": "Sequencing pathogen samples during a communicable disease outbreak is becoming an increasingly common procedure in epidemiological investigations. Identifying who infected whom sheds considerable light on transmission patterns, high-risk settings and subpopulations, and infection control effectiveness. Genomic data shed new light on transmission dynamics, and can be used to identify clusters of individuals likely to be linked by direct transmission. However, identification of individual routes of infection via single genome samples typically remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the potential of deep sequence data to provide greater resolution on transmission routes, via the identification of shared genomic variants. We assess several easily implemented methods to identify transmission routes using both shared variants and genetic distance, demonstrating that shared variants can provide considerable additional information in most scenarios. While shared variant approaches identify relatively few links in the presence of a small transmission bottleneck, these links are highly confident. Furthermore, we proposed hybrid approach additionally incorporating phylogenetic distance to provide greater resolution. We apply our methods to data collected during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, identifying several likely routes of transmission. Our study highlights the power of pathogen deep sequence data as a component of outbreak investigation and epidemiological analyses.",

    "abstract": "We have previously established two lines of rat for studying the functional basis of aerobic exercise capacity (AEC) and its impact on metabolic health. The two lines, high capacity runners (HCR) and low capacity runners (LCR), have been selectively bred for high and low intrinsic AEC, respectively. They were started from the same genetically heterogeneous population and have now diverged in both AEC and many other physiological measures, including weight, body composition, blood pressure, body mass index, lung capacity, lipid and glucose metabolism, and natural life span. In order to exploit this rat model to understand the genomic regions under differential selection within the two lines, we used SNP genotype and whole genome pooled sequencing data to identify signatures of selection using three different statistics: runs of homozygosity, fixation index, and aberrant allele frequency spectrum, and developed a composite score that combined the three signals. We found that several pathways (ATP transport and fatty acid metabolism) are enriched in regions under differential selection. The candidate genes and pathways under selection will be integrated with the previous mRNA expression data and future F2 QTL results for a multi-omics approach to understanding the biological basis of AEC and metabolic traits.",

    "abstract": "Neuroticism is a personality trait of fundamental importance for psychological wellbeing and public health. It is strongly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and several other psychiatric conditions. Although neuroticism is heritable, attempts to identify the alleles involved in previous studies have been limited by relatively small sample sizes and heterogeneity in the measurement of neuroticism. Here we report a genome-wide association study of neuroticism in 91,370 participants of the UK Biobank cohort and a combined meta-analysis which includes a further 7,197 participants from the Generation Scotland Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and 8,687 participants from a Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) cohort. All participants were assessed using the same neuroticism instrument, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R-S) Short Forms Neuroticism scale. We found a SNP-based heritability estimate for neuroticism of approximately 15% (SE = 0.7%). Meta-analysis identified 9 novel loci associated with neuroticism. The strongest evidence for association was at a locus on chromosome 8 (p = 1.28x10-15) spanning 4 Mb and containing at least 36 genes. Other associated loci included genes of interest on chromosome 1 (GRIK3, glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 3), chromosome 4 (KLHL2, Kelch-like protein 2), chromosome 17 (CRHR1, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 and MAPT, microtubule-associated protein Tau), and on chromosome 18 (CELF4, CUGBP elav-like family member 4). We found no evidence for genetic differences in the common allelic architecture of neuroticism by sex. By comparing our findings with those of the Psychiatric Genetics Consortia, we identified a large genetic correlation between neuroticism and MDD (0.64) and a smaller genetic correlation with schizophrenia (0.22) but not with bipolar disorder. Polygenic scores derived from the primary UK Biobank sample captured about 1% of the variance in trait liability to neuroticism. Overall, our findings confirm a polygenic basis for neuroticism and substantial shared genetic architecture between neuroticism and MDD. The identification of 9 new neuroticism-associated loci will drive forward future work on the neurobiology of neuroticism and related phenotypes.",

We study the asymptotic correctness, the speed of convergence, and the data size requirements of such an approach. We find that the shotgun approach can be expected to allow the inference of the complete connectivity matrix in large neuronal populations under some rather general conditions. However, we find that the posterior error of the shotgun connectivity estimator may grow quickly with the size of the unobserved neuronal populations, the connectivity strength, and the square of the observations sparseness. This implies that the shotgun connectivity estimation will require significant amounts of neuronal activity data whenever the number of neurons in the observed populations is small. We present a numerical approach for solving the shotgun estimation problem in general settings and use it to demonstrate the shotgun connectivity inference in simulated synfire and weakly coupled cortical neuronal networks.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern similarity is becoming increasingly popular because it allows one to relate distributed patterns of voxel activity to continuous perceptual and cognitive states of the human brain. Here we show that fMRI pattern similarity estimates are severely affected by temporal pattern drifts in fMRI data - even after voxel-wise detrending. For this particular dataset, the drift effect obscures orientation information as measured by fMRI pattern dissimilarities. We demonstrate that orientation information can be recovered using three different methods: 1. Regressing out the drift component through linear modeling; 2. Computing representational distances between conditions measured in independent imaging runs; 3. Crossvalidation of pattern distance estimates. One possible source of temporal pattern drift could be random walk like fluctuations -- physiological or scanner related -- occurring within single voxel timecourses. This explanation is consistent with voxel-wise detrending not alleviating pattern drift effects. In addition, this would explain why crossvalidated pattern distances are robust to temporal drift because a random walk process is expected to give rise to non-replicable drift directions. Given these findings, we recommend that future fMRI studies take pattern drift into account when analyzing pattern similarity as this can greatly enhance the sensitivity to experimental effects of interest.",

    "abstract": "Background: Inferring gene networks from high-throughput data constitutes an important step in the discovery of relevant regulatory relationships in organism cells. Despite the large number of available Gene Regulatory Network inference methods, the problem remains challenging: the underdetermination in the space of possible solutions requires additional constraints that incorporate a priori information on gene interactions. Methods: Weighting all possible pairwise gene relationships by a probability of edge presence, we formulate the regulatory network inference as a discrete variational problem on graphs. We enforce biologically plausible coupling between groups and types of genes by minimizing an edge labeling functional coding for a priori structures. The optimization is carried out with Graph cuts, an approach popular in image processing and computer vision. We compare the inferred regulatory networks to results achieved by the mutual-information-based Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) method and by the state-of-the-art GENIE3, winner of the DREAM4 multifactorial challenge. Results: Our BRANE Cut approach infers more accurately the five DREAM4 in silico networks (with improvements from 6% to 11%). On a real Escherichia coli compendium, an improvement of 11.8% compared to CLR and 3% compared to GENIE3 is obtained in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve. Up to 48 additional verified interactions are obtained over GENIE3 for a given precision. On this dataset involving 4345 genes, our method achieves a performance similar to that of GENIE3, while being more than seven times faster. The BRANE Cut code is available at: http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~pirayre/Codes-GRN-BRANE-cut.html Conclusions: BRANE Cut is a weighted graph thresholding method. Using biologically sound penalties and data-driven parameters, it improves three state-of-the-art GRN inference methods. It is applicable as a generic network inference post-processing, due its computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe findings of EGFR mutations and the development of targeted therapies have significantly improved the overall survival of lung cancer patients. Still, the prognosis remains poor, so we need to know more about the genetic alterations in lung cancer. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in lung cancer, and microRNAs can regulate EGFR. So it is very important to predict the candidate microRNAs that target mutated EGFR and to investigate the role of these candidate microRNAs in lung cancer.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsIn this study, we investigated the difference of microRNAs expression between lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with EGFR exon 19 deletion (H1650 and PC9) and its wild-type (H1299 and A549) using the Phalanx Human Whole Genome Microarray. Then the expression of individual microRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR assays. Moreover, we have detected the microRNAs expression in serum of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion and wild-type.\\n\\nResultsThe expression of 1,732 microRNAs was evaluated, and we found that microRNAs expression was different between these two groups. Hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-203, hsa-miR-3182, hsa-miR-934 were up-regulated and hsa-miR-3196 was down-regulated in the EGFR exon 19 deletion group compared with wild-type group. The detection of circulating microRNAs showed that miR-3196 was down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion compared with wild-type.\\n\\nConclusionsIt is suggested that microRNAs associate with EGFR exon 19 deletion and miR-3196 can be further explored for potential predictor and targeted biomarker when it is difficult to get the tumors.",

We show that the relative stoichiometry of the synthesis rates of {sigma}B, its anti-sigma factor RsbW and the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV plays a critical role in shaping the network behavior by forcing the {sigma}B network to function as an ultrasensitive negative feedback loop. We further demonstrate how this negative feedback regulation insulates alternative sigma factor activity from competition with the housekeeping sigma factor for RNA polymerase and allows multiple stress sigma factors to function simultaneously with little competitive interference.\\n\\nMajor Subject Areas: Computational and systems biology, Microbiology & Infectious disease\\n\\nResearch Organism: Bacillus subtilis",

Additionally, these new methods have shown that self-reactive T-cells are found in the periphery (and are not completely negatively selected in the thymus as previously believed). Combining these new data with well-established studies in auto-immunity leads to the conjecture that certain auto-immune diseases are likely to be caused by defects in tissue, not by dysregulation of the adaptive immune system. In particular, one hypothesis is that specific tissues up-regulate HLA class 2 genes, presenting epitopes that are bound by CD4+ helper T cells, which facilitates an immune response against the tissue specific cells.",
