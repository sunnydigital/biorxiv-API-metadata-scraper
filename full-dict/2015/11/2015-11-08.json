    "abstract": "IVF related intrauterus growth restriction or low birth weight (LBW) is very common in ART clinic. This study is focus on the aberrant lipid metabolism induced by in vitro fertilization and its mechanism. Firstly, we investigated the effect of IVF on fetal weight and placenta efficiency at E18.5 (at birth) and E14.5 (middle gestation). Data shows that IVF caused LBW and low placenta efficiency. Then we studied the lipidomics of E18.5 placenta and E14.5 placenta. The IVF group has an eccentric lipid content compared to in vivo group. All the 15 lipid classes are largely accumulated in E18.5 IVF placenta and are deficient in E14.5 IVF placenta. In detail, most of the 287 lipid species is accumulated at E18.5 and went short at E14.5. Using qRT-PCR we detected the expression level of genes related to lipid uptake, transport and metabolism. Most of these genes are down-regulated which indicated the metabolism function of placenta is disrupted seriously. To the imprinted genes for lipid metabolism regulation as GNAS and Grb10, IVF not only disrupt their imprinting status (methylation level) but also disrupt their gene expression. The expression of DNMTs and Tets are also disrupted in the placenta. These data demonstrate that IVF impaired the regulation network of lipid metabolism. These results prove the hypothesis: imperfect IVF condition of fertilization jeopardize the expression DNMTs, Tets and imprinting status of imprinted genes for lipid metabolism regulation. Then it causes to abnormal expression of genes for lipid metabolism and regulation. This leads to the significant differences in lipid species quantification and lipid metabolism. So it contributed to low lipid transport efficiency, restricted fetal growth and LBW. This study provides a renewed knowledge of lipid metabolism in placenta and its relation to imprinted genes and gave some clinical aware for optimizing the ART practice.\\n\\nFundingThis work was supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\\n\\nCompeting InterestsThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The shape of leaves are dynamic, changing over evolutionary time between species, within a single plant producing different shaped leaves at successive nodes, during the development of a single leaf as it allometrically expands, and in response to the environment. Notably, strong correlations between the dissection and size of leaves with temperature and precipitation exist in both the paleorecord and extant populations. Yet, a morphometric model integrating evolutionary, developmental, and environmental effects on leaf shape is lacking. Here, we continue a morphometric analysis of >5,500 leaves representing 270 grapevines of multiple Vitis species between two growing seasons. Leaves are paired one-to-one, vine-to-vine accounting for developmental context, between growing seasons. Linear Discriminant Analysis reveals shape features that specifically define growing season, regardless of species or developmental context. The shape feature, a more pronounced distal sinus, is associated with the colder, drier growing season, consistent with patterns observed in the paleorecord. We discuss the implications of such plasticity in a long-lived woody perennial, such as grapevine, with respect to the evolution and functionality of plant morphology and changes in climate.",

    "abstract": "The joint and accurate inference of selection and demography from genetic data is considered a particularly challenging question in population genetics, since both process may lead to very similar patterns of genetic diversity. However, additional information for disentangling these effects may be obtained by observing changes in allele frequencies over multiple time points. Such data is common in experimental evolution studies, as well as in the comparison of ancient and contemporary samples. Leveraging this information, however, has been computationally challenging, particularly when considering multi-locus data sets. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel, discrete approximation for diffusion processes, termed mean transition time approximation, which preserves the long-term behavior of the underlying continuous diffusion process. We then derive this approximation for the particular case of inferring selection and demography from time series data under the classic Wright-Fisher model and demonstrate that our approximation is well suited to describe allele trajectories through time, even when only a few states are used. We then develop a Bayesian inference approach to jointly infer the population size and locus-specific selection coefficients with high accuracy, and further extend this model to also infer the rates of sequencing errors and mutations. We finally apply our approach to recent experimental data on the evolution of drug resistance in Influenza virus, identifying likely targets of selection and finding evidence for much larger viral population sizes than previously reported.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have identified prognostic genes in individual cancers, but a thorough pancancer analysis has not been performed. In addition, previous studies have mostly used microarray data instead of RNA-SEQ, and have not published comprehensive lists of associations with survival. Using recently available RNA-SEQ and clinical data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas for 6,495 patients, I have investigated every annotated and expressed gene's association with survival across 16 cancer types. The most statistically significant harmful and protective genes were not shared across cancers, but were enriched in distinct gene sets which were shared across certain groups of cancers. These groups of cancers were independently recapitulated by both unsupervised clustering of Cox coefficients (a measure of association with survival) for individual genes, and for gene programs. This analysis has revealed unappreciated commonalities among cancers which may provide insights into cancer pathogenesis and rationales for co-opting treatments between cancers.",
