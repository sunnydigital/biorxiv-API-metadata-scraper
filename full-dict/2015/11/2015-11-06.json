    "abstract": "The Axon Initial Segment [AIS], located within the first 30 m of the axon, has two essential roles in generating action potentials and maintaining axonal identity. AIS assembly depends on a {beta}IV-spectrin / ankyrin G scaffold, but its macromolecular arrangement is not well understood. Here we quantitatively determined the AIS nanoscale architecture using STo-chastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy [STORM]. First we directly demonstrate that the 190-nm periodicity of the AIS submembrane lattice results from longitudinal, head-to-head {beta}IV-spectrin molecules connecting actin rings. Using multicolor 3D-STORM, we resolve the nanoscale organization of ankyrin G: its aminoterminus associates with the submembrane lattice, whereas the carboxyterminus radially extends (~32 nm on average) toward the cytosol. This AIS nano-architecture is highly resistant to cytoskeletal perturbations, advocating its role in structural stabilization. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the AIS molecular architecture, and will help understanding the crucial physiological functions of this compartment.",

While the collapse of incipient species is theoretically common, very few examples have been documented in nature. Here I show that soapberry bugs (Jadera haematoloma) have lost adaptations to their native host plant (Cardiospermum corindum) and are regionally specializing on an invasive host plant (Koelreuteria elegans), collapsing a classic and well-documented example of local adaptation. All populations that were adapted to the native host - including those still found on that host today - are now better adapted to the invasive in multiple phenotypes. Weak differentiation remains in two traits, suggesting that homogenization across the region is incomplete. This study highlights the potential for adaptation to invasive species to disrupt native communities by swamping adaptation to native conditions through maladaptive gene flow.",

Here we examine the potential for life history trade-offs associated with herbicide resistance by examining seed germination, root growth, and above-ground growth across 43 naturally occurring populations of Ipomoea purpurea that vary in their resistance to RoundUp(R), the most commonly used herbicide worldwide. We find evidence for life history trade-offs associated with all three traits; highly resistant populations had lower germination rates, shorter roots and smaller above-ground size. A visual exploration of the data indicated that the type of trade-off may differ among populations. Our results demonstrate that costs of adaptation may be present at stages other than simply the production of progeny in this agricultural weed. Additionally, the cumulative effect of costs at multiple life cycle stages can result in severe consequences to fitness when adapting to novel environments.",

The processing of this data frequently leads to I/O bottlenecks, e. g. when analyzing a small genomic region across a large number of samples. The largest I/O burden is, however, often not imposed by the amount of data needed for the analysis but rather by index files that help retrieving this data. We have developed chopBAI, a program that can chop a BAM index (BAI) file into small pieces. The program outputs a list of BAI files each indexing a specified genomic interval. The output files are much smaller in size but maintain compatibility with existing software tools. We show how preprocessing BAI files with chopBAI can lead to a reduction of I/O by more than 95% during the analysis of 10 Kbp genomic regions, eventually enabling the joint analysis of more than 10,000 individuals.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe software is implemented in C++, GPL licensed and available at http://github.com/DecodeGenetics/chopBAI",

However, standard FBA modeling of genetic knockouts can not predict drug combination synergies observed between serial metabolic targets, even though such synergies give rise to some of the most widely used antibiotic treatments. Here we extend FBA modeling to simulate responses to chemical inhibitors at varying concentrations, by diverting enzymatic flux to a waste reaction. This flux diversion yields very similar qualitative predictions to prior methods for single target activity. However, we find very different predictions for combinations, where flux diversion, which mimics the kinetics of competitive metabolic inhibitors, can explain serial target synergies between metabolic enzyme inhibitors that we confirmed in Escherichia coli cultures. FBA flux diversion opens the possibility for more accurate genome-scale predictions of drug synergies, which can be used to suggest treatments for infections and other diseases.",

We developed BUHMBOX, a well-powered statistical method to distinguish pleiotropy from heterogeneity using genotype data. We observed a shared genetic basis between 11 of 17 tested autoimmune diseases and type I diabetes (T1D, p<10-12) and 11 of 17 tested autoimmune diseases and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, p<10-7). This sharing could not be explained by heterogeneity (corrected pBUHMBOX>0.2 using 6,670 T1D cases and 7,279 RA cases), suggesting that shared genetic features in autoimmunity are due to pleiotropy. We observed a shared genetic basis between seronegative and seropostive RA (p<10-22), explained by heterogeneity (pBUHMBOX=0.008 in 2,406 seronegative RA cases). Consistent with previous observations, we observed genetic sharing between major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (p<10-9).

    "abstract": "In contrast to XX/XY species, Z-linked expression is overall reduced in female WZ/ZZ species compared to males or the autosomal expression. This pattern (Z<ZZ{approx}AA) has been consistently reported in all the WZ/ZZ taxa examined so far, with the singular exception of the insect order of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). However, conflicting results linger in this taxon due to discrepancies in data analyses and tissues sampled. To address this issue, we analyzed dosage compensation in the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae) using tissues that represent different levels of sexual divergence. C. pomonella is the most basal lepidopteran species yet examined for dosage compensation and has a neo-Z chromosome resulting from an ancient Z:autosome translocation. We based our analyses on RNAseq and de novo transcriptome data from C. pomonella, as well as scrutiny into investigations of other lepidopteran species. Our evidence supports that the lepidopterans share a pattern (Z {approx} ZZ < AA) of dosage compensation that mirrors the eutherian mammals (X {approx} XX < AA). In particular, reproductive tissues appear to be exempt from dosage compensation, which helps explain the incongruence in prior reports. Furthermore, C. pomonella ancestral-Z segment exhibited a greater expression reduction than genes on the neo-Z segment, which intriguingly also reflects the differential up-regulation between the ancestral and newly-acquired X-linked genes in mammals. The insect order of Lepidoptera challenges both the classic theories regarding evolution of sex chromosome dosage compensation and the emerging view on dosage compensations association with sexual heterogamety.",

    "abstract": "The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), plays an important immunomodulatory role, regulating transcription of genes in the innate and adaptive immune system. The present study examines patterns of transcriptome-wide response to 1,25D and the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary human monocytes, to elucidate pathways underlying the effects of 1,25D on the immune system. Monocytes obtained from healthy individuals of African-African and European-American ancestry were treated with 1,25D alone or in the presence of LPS, which induced significant up-regulation of genes in the antimicrobial and autophagy pathways, while pro-inflammatory response genes were significantly down-regulated. A joint Bayesian analysis enabled clustering of genes into patterns of shared transcriptional response across treatments. The biological pathways enriched within these expression patterns highlighted several mechanisms through which 1,25D could exert its immunomodulatory role. Pathways such as mTOR signaling, EIF2 signaling, IL-8 signaling and Tec Kinase signaling were enriched among genes with opposite transcriptional responses to 1,25D and LPS, respectively, highlighting the important roles of these pathways in mediating the immunomodulatory activity of 1,25D. Furthermore, a subset of genes with evidence of inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional response was also identified, suggesting that in addition to the well-established inter-ethnic variation in circulating levels of vitamin D, the intensity of transcriptional response to 1,25D and LPS also varies between ethnic groups. We propose that dysregulation of the pathways identified in this study could contribute to immune-mediated disease risk.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEscherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) has emerged globally as the most predominant lineage within this clinically important species, and its association with fluoroquinolone and extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance impacts significantly on treatment. The evolutionary histories of this lineage, and of important antimicrobial resistance elements within it, remain unclearly defined.\\n\\nResultsThis study of the largest worldwide collection (n = 215) of sequenced ST131 E. coli isolates to date demonstrates that clonal expansion of two previously recognized antimicrobial-resistant clades, C1/H30R and C2/H30Rx, started around 25 years ago, consistent with the widespread introduction of fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins in clinical medicine. These two clades appear to have emerged in the United States, with the expansion of the C2/H30Rx clade driven by the acquisition of a blaCTX-M-15-containing IncFII-like plasmid that has subsequently undergone extensive rearrangement. Several other evolutionary processes influencing the trajectory of this drug-resistant lineage are described, including sporadic acquisitions of CTX-M resistance plasmids, and chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M within sub-clusters followed by vertical evolution. These processes are also occurring for another family of CTX-M gene variants more recently observed amongst ST131, the blaCTX-M-14/14-like group.\\n\\nConclusionsThe complexity of the evolutionary history of ST131 has important implications for antimicrobial resistance surveillance, epidemiological analysis, and control of emerging clinical lineages of E. coli. These data also highlight the global imperative to reduce specific antibiotic selection pressures, and demonstrate the important and varied roles played by plasmids and other mobile genetic elements in the perpetuation of antimicrobial resistance within lineages.",
