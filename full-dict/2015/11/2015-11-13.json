    "abstract": "The human mutation rate is an essential parameter for studying the evolution of our species, interpreting present-day genetic variation, and understanding the incidence of genetic disease. Nevertheless, our current estimates of the rate are uncertain. Most notably, recent approaches based on counting de novo mutations in family pedigrees have yielded significantly smaller values than classical methods based on sequence divergence. Here, we propose a new method that uses the fine-scale human recombination map to calibrate the rate of accumulation of mutations. By comparing local heterozygosity levels in diploid genomes to the genetic distance scale over which these levels change, we are able to estimate a long-term mutation rate averaged over hundreds or thousands of generations. We infer a rate of 1.61 {+/-} 0.13 x 10-8 mutations per base per generation, which falls in between phylogenetic and pedigree-based estimates, and we suggest possible mechanisms to reconcile our estimate with previous studies. Our results support intermediate-age divergences among human populations and between humans and other great apes.",

    "abstract": "Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) locate host plants by following concentration gradients of root exudate chemicals in the soil. We present a simple method for RNAi-induced knockdown of genes in tomato seedling roots, facilitating the study of root exudate composition, and PPN responses. Knockdown of sugar transporter genes, stp1 and stp2 in tomato seedlings triggers corresponding reductions of glucose and fructose, but not xylose, in collected root exudate. This corresponds directly with reduced infectivity and stylet thrusting of the promiscuous PPN Meloidogyne incognita, however we observe no impact on the infectivity or stylet thrusting of the selective Solanaceae PPN Globodera pallida. This approach can underpin future efforts to understand the early stages of plant-pathogen interactions in tomato, and potentially other crop plants.",

    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity is shaped by the interaction of drift and selection, but the details of this interaction are not well understood. The impact of genetic drift in a population is largely determined by its demographic history, typically summarized by its long-term effective population size (Ne). Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this relationship, however. To better understand how changing demography impacts selection, we used whole-genome sequencing data to investigate patterns of linked selection in domesticated and wild maize (teosinte). We produce the first whole-genome estimate of the demography of maize domestication, showing that maize was reduced to approximately 5% the population size of teosinte before it experienced rapid expansion post-domestication to population sizes much larger than its ancestor. Evaluation of patterns of nucleotide diversity in and near genes shows little evidence of selection on beneficial amino acid substitutions, and that the domestication bottleneck led to a decline in the efficiency of purifying selection in maize. Young alleles, however, show evidence of much stronger purifying selection in maize, reflecting the much larger effective size of present day populations. Our results demonstrate that recent demographic change -- a hallmark of many species including both humans and crops -- can have immediate and wide-ranging impacts on diversity that conflict with would-be expectations based on Ne alone.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPairwise measures of neutral genetic differentiation are supposed to contain information about past and on-going dispersal events and are thus often used as dependent variables in correlative analyses to elucidate how neutral genetic variation is affected by landscape connectivity. However, spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of genetic drift, stemming from variations in population sizes, may inflate variance in measures of genetic differentiation and lead to erroneous or incomplete interpretations in terms of connectivity. Here, we tested the efficiency of two distance-based metrics designed to capture the unique influence of spatial heterogeneity in local drift on genetic differentiation. These metrics are easily computed from estimates of effective population sizes or from environmental proxies for local carrying capacities, and allow us to introduce the hypothesis of Spatial-Heterogeneity-in-Effective-Population-Sizes (SHNe). SHNe can be tested in a way similar to isolation-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance within the classical landscape genetics hypothesis-testing framework.\\nC_LIO_LIWe used simulations under various models of population structure to investigate the reliability of these metrics to quantify the unique contribution of SHNe in explaining patterns of genetic differentiation. We then applied these metrics to an empirical genetic dataset obtained for a freshwater fish (Gobio occitaniae).\\nC_LIO_LISimulations showed that SHNe explained up to 60% of variance in genetic differentiation (measured as Fst) in the absence of gene flow, and up to 20% when migration rates were as high as 0.10. Furthermore, one of the two metrics was particularly robust to uncertainty in the estimation of effective population sizes (or proxies for carrying capacity). In the empirical dataset, the effect of SHNe on spatial patterns of Fst was five times higher than that of isolation-by-distance, uniquely contributing to 41% of variance in pairwise Fst. Taking the influence of SHNe into account also allowed decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the upper estimate of effective dispersal distance.\\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that the use of SHNe metrics in landscape genetics will substantially improve the understanding of evolutionary drivers of genetic variation, providing substantial information as to the actual drivers of patterns of genetic differentiation in addition to traditional measures of Euclidean distance or landscape resistance.\\nC_LI",

Here we describe riboHMM, a new method that uses ribosome footprint data along with gene expression and sequence information to accurately infer translated sequences. We applied our method to human lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified 7,273 previously unannotated coding sequences, including 2,442 translated upstream open reading frames. We observed an enrichment of harringtonine-treated ribosome footprints at the inferred initiation sites, validating many of the novel coding sequences. The novel sequences exhibit significant signatures of selective constraint in the reading frames of the inferred proteins, suggesting that many of these are functional. Nearly 40% of bicistronic transcripts showed significant negative correlation in the levels of translation of their two coding sequences, suggesting a key regulatory role for these novel translated sequences.

    "abstract": "Bacteriorhodopsin, a light activated protein that creates a proton gradient in halobacteria, has long served as a simple model of proton pumps. Within bacteriorhodopsin, several key sites undergo protonation changes during the photocycle, moving protons from the higher pH cytoplasm to the lower pH extracellular side. The mechanism underlying the long-range proton translocation between the central (the retinal Schiff base SB216, D85 and D212) and exit clusters (E194 and E204) remains elusive. To obtain a dynamic view of the key factors controlling proton translocation, a systematic study using molecular dynamics simulation was performed for eight bacteriorhodopsin models varying in retinal isomer and protonation of the SB216, D85, D212 and E204. The side-chain orientation of R82 is determined primarily by the protonation states of the residues in the EC. The side-chain reorientation of R82 modulates the hydrogen-bond network and consequently possible pathways of proton transfer. Quantum mechanical intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations of proton-transfer in the methyl guanidinium-hydronium-hydroxide model system show that proton transfer via a guanidinium group requires an initial geometry permitting proton donation and acceptance by the same amine. In all the models, R82 can form proton wires with both the CC and the EC connected by the same amine. Alternatively, rare proton wires for proton transfer from the CC to the EC without involving R82 were found in an O state where the proton on D85 is transferred to D212.",

    "abstract": "Across western North America, Mimulus guttatus exists as many local populations adapted to site-specific challenges including salt spray, temperature, water availability, and soil chemistry. Gene flow between locally adapted populations will effect genetic diversity in both local demes and across the larger meta-population. A single population of annual M. guttatus from Iron Mountain, Oregon (IM) has been extensively studied and we here building off this research by analyzing whole genome sequences from 34 inbred lines from IM in conjunction with sequences from 22 Mimulus individuals from across the geographic range. Three striking features of these data address hypotheses about migration and selection in a locally adapted population. First, we find very high intra-population polymorphism (synonymous {pi} = 0.033). Variation outside genes may be even higher, but is difficult to estimate because excessive divergence affects read mapping. Second, IM exhibits a significantly positive genome-wide average for Tajimas D. This indicates allele frequencies are typically more intermediate than expected from neutrality, opposite the pattern observed in other species. Third, IM exhibits a distinctive haplotype structure. There is a genome-wide excess of positive associations between minor alleles; consistent with an important effect of gene flow from nearby Mimulus populations. The combination of multiple data types, including a novel, tree-based analytic method and estimates for structural polymorphism (inversions) from previous genetic mapping studies, illustrates how the balance of strong local selection, limited dispersal, and meta-population dynamics manifests across the genome.",

While the scientific best practices for human variant calling workflows have been well defined, they also pose serious computational challenges at this high scale. Therefore, efforts in both academia and the private sector have focused on developing alternative workflows that may substantially reduce the computational cost per individual genome. Isaac is an \\\"ultra-fast\\\" variant calling workflow, designed by Illumina, Inc, and is claimed to be six times faster than BWA-GATK, with comparable sensitivity and specificity. This report is an independent review of Isaac, mainly focused on the accuracy of variant calls. We note that Isaac is indeed quite fast, and provide some benchmarks on a few hardware architectures. The overall conclusion from our analysis is that the Isaac workflow has undergone substantial improvement from version 01.14.11.27 to Isaac_2.0. The call accuracy is especially high on NA12878, however exomes tend to have a high fraction of false positive calls. We did not manage to reproduce the 99% sensitivity and specificity reported in the Illumina whitepaper, however that might be improved with further tweaking of the options.

In this work we assessed how existing de novo assembly methods perform on these reads. We benchmarked three non-hybrid (in terms of both error correction and scaffolding) assembly pipelines as well as two hybrid assemblers which use third generation sequencing data to scaffold Illumina assemblies. Tests were performed on several publicly available MinION and Illumina datasets of E. coli K-12, using several sequencing coverages of nanopore data (20x, 30x, 40x and 50x). We attempted to assess the quality of assembly at each of these coverages, to estimate the requirements for closed bacterial genome assembly. Results show that hybrid methods are highly dependent on the quality of NGS data, but much less on the quality and coverage of nanopore data and perform relatively well on lower nanopore coverages. Furthermore, when coverage is above 40x, all non-hybrid methods correctly assemble the E. coli genome, even a non-hybrid method tailored for Pacific Bioscience reads. While it requires higher coverage compared to a method designed particularly for nanopore reads, its running time is significantly lower.",
