    "abstract": "Embryogenesis is an extraordinarily robust process, exhibiting the ability to control tissue size and repair patterning defects in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations. The size and shape of a developing tissue is a function of the number and size of its constituent cells as well as their geometric packing. How these cellular properties are coordinated at the tissue level to ensure developmental robustness remains a mystery; understanding this process requires studying multiple concurrent processes that make up morphogenesis, including the spatial patterning of cell fates and apoptosis, as well as cell intercalations. In this work, we develop a computational model that aims to understand aspects of the robust pattern repair mechanisms of the Drosophila embryonic epidermal tissues. Size control in this system has previously been shown to rely on the regulation of apoptosis rather than proliferation; however, to date little work has been done to understand the role of cellular mechanics in this process. We employ a vertex model of an embryonic segment to test hypotheses about the emergence of this size control. Comparing the model to previously published data across wild type and genetic perturbations, we show that passive mechanical forces suffice to explain the observed size control in the posterior (P) compartment of a segment. However, observed asymmetries in cell death frequencies across the segment are demonstrated to require patterning of cellular properties in the model. Finally, we show that distinct forms of mechanical regulation in the model may be distinguished by differences in cell shapes in the P compartment, as quantified through experimentally accessible summary statistics, as well as by the tissue recoil after laser ablation experiments.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDeveloping embryos are able to grow organs of the correct size even in the face of significant external perturbations. Such robust size control is achieved via tissue-level coordination of cell growth, proliferation, death and rearrangement, through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we employ computational modelling to test hypotheses of size control in the developing fruit fly. Segments in the surface tissues of the fruit fly embryo have been shown to achieve the same size even if the number of cells in each segment is perturbed genetically. We show that simple mechanical interactions between the cells of this tissue can recapitulate previously gathered data on tissue sizes and cell numbers. However, this simple model does not capture the experimentally observed spatial variation in cell death rates in this tissue, which may be explained through several adaptations to the model. These distinct adaptations may be distinguished through summary statistics of the tissue behaviour, such as statistics of cell shapes or tissue recoil after cutting. This work demonstrates how computational modelling can help investigate the complex mechanical interactions underlying tissue size and shape, which are important for understanding the underlying causes of birth defects and diseases driven by uncontrolled growth.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPremise of the study: Hybridization between diploids and tetraploids can lead to new allopolyploid species, often via a triploid intermediate. Viable triploids are often produced asymmetrically, with greater success observed for \\\"maternal-excess\\\" crosses where the mother has a higher ploidy than the father. Here we investigate the evolutionary origins of Mimulus peregrinus, an allohexaploid recently derived from the triploid M. x robertsii, to determine whether reproductive asymmetry has shaped the formation of this new species.\\nC_LIO_LIMethods: We used reciprocal crosses between the diploid (M. guttatus) and tetraploid (M. luteus) progenitors to determine the viability of triploid M. x robertsii hybrids resulting from paternal-versus maternal-excess crosses. To investigate whether experimental results predict patterns seen in the field, we performed parentage analyses comparing natural populations of M. peregrinus to its diploid, tetraploid, and triploid progenitors. Organellar sequences obtained from pre-existing genomic data, supplemented with additional genotyping was used to establish the maternal ancestry of multiple M. peregrinus and M. x robertsii populations.\\nC_LIO_LIKey results: We find strong evidence for asymmetric origins of M. peregrinus, but opposite to the common pattern, with paternal-excess crosses significantly more successful than maternal-excess crosses. These results successfully predicted hybrid formation in nature: 111 of 114 M. x robertsii individuals, and 27 of 27 M. peregrinus, had an M. guttatus maternal haplotype.\\nC_LIO_LIConclusion: This study, which includes the first Mimulus chloroplast genome assembly, demonstrates the utility of parentage analysis through genome skimming. We highlight the benefits of complementing genomic analyses with experimental approaches to understand asymmetry in allopolyploid speciation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The  priming effect, in which addition of labile substances changes the rem-ineralization rate of recalcitrant organic matter, has been intensively studied in soils, but is less well-documented in aquatic systems. We investigated the extent to which additions of nutrients or labile organic carbon could influence remineralization rates of 14C-labeled, microbially-degraded, phytoplankton-derived organic matter (OM) in microcosms inoculated with microbial communities drawn from Groves Creek Estuary in coastal Georgia, USA. We found that amendment with labile protein plus phosphorus increased remineralization rates of degraded, phytoplankton-derived OM by up to 100%, whereas acetate slightly decreased remineralization rates relative to an unamended control. Addition of ammonium and phosphate induced a smaller effect, whereas addition of ammonium alone had no effect. Counterintuitively, alkaline phosphatase activities increased in response to the addition of protein under P-replete conditions, indicating that production of enzymes unrelated to the labile priming compound may be a mechanism for the priming effect. The observed priming effect was transient: after 36 days of incubation roughly the same quantity of organic carbon had been mineralized in all treatments including no-addition controls. This timescale is on the order of the typical hydrologic residence times of well-flushed estuaries suggesting that priming in estuaries has the potential to influence whether OC is remineralized in situ or exported to the coastal ocean.",

    "abstract": "We present a dynamical model of drug accumulation in bacteria. The model captures key features in experimental time courses on ofloxacin accumulation: initial uptake; two-phase response; and long-term acclimation. In combination with experimental data, the model provides estimates of import and export rates in each phase, the time of entry into the second phase, and the decrease of internal drug during acclimation. Global sensitivity analysis, local sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the model provide information about the robustness of these estimates, and about the relative importance of different parameters in determining the features of the accumulation time courses in three different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results lead to experimentally testable predictions of the effects of membrane permeability, drug efflux and trapping (e.g., by DNA binding) on drug accumulation. A key prediction is that a sudden increase in ofloxacin accumulation in both E. coli and S. aureus is accompanied by a decrease in membrane permeability.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBacteria live or die depending on how much antibiotic gets inside them. Using a simple mathematical model, detailed information about drug import and export can be teased out of time courses of internal drug levels after a sudden exposure. The results suggest that membrane permeability can suddenly decrease during exposure to drug, accompanied by an increase, rather than a decrease, in the internal drug level.",

    "abstract": "The study of modularity in morphological systems has increased in the past twenty years, parallel to the popularization of geometric morphometrics, which has led to the emergence of different criteria for detecting modularity on landmark data. However, compared to usual covariance matrix estimators, Procrustes estimators have properties that hinder their use. Here, we compare different representations of form, focusing on detecting modularity patterns defined a priori; we also compare two metrics: one derived from traditional morphometrics (MHI) and another that emerged in the context of landmark data (RV). Using Anthropoid skulls, we compare these metrics over three representations of form: interlandmark distances, Procrustes residuals, and local shape variables. Over Procrustes residuals, both tests fail to detect modularity patterns, while in remaining representations they show the distinction between early and late development in skull ontogeny. To estimate type I and II error rates, we built covariance matrices of known structure; these tests indicate that, considering both effect and sample sizes, tests using MHI are more robust than those using RV. However, both metrics have low power when used on Procrustes residuals. Thus, we conclude that the influence of development and function is poorly represented on Procrustes estimators for covariance matrices.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1-3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn-soy-wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9% compared to monocultures. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity.",

    "abstract": "Across a species range, islands of stressful habitats impose similar selection pressures on isolated populations. It is as yet unclear, when populations respond to these selective pressures, the extent to which this results in convergent genetic evolution and whether convergence is due to independent mutations or shared ancestral variation. We address these questions investigating a classic example of adaptation by natural selection - the colonization of plant species to heavy metal contaminated soils. We use field-based reciprocal transplant experiments to demonstrate that mine alleles at a major copper tolerance QTL, Tol1, are strongly selected in the mine environment, but are neutral, or nearly so, in the off-mine environment. To identify scaffolds in genetic linkage with this locus, we assemble the genome of a mine adapted M. guttatus genotype and sequence near isogenic lines (NILs) homozygous for tolerant or non-tolerant alleles at Tol1. We identify genes with differential expression between NILs and differences in allele frequency between independent pairs of mine and off-mine populations to identify Tol1 candidate genes. We identify a single gene, a multicopper oxidase, with large differences in expression between NILs and allele frequency between populations. Furthermore, we find patterns of genetic variation at Tol1, and four additional candidate adaptation loci, are consistent with selection acting upon beneficial haplotypes that predates the existence of the copper mine habitat. We estimate the age of selected Tol1 haplotype to be at least 1700 years old and was at a frequency of 0.4-0.6% in the ancestral population when mining was initiated 150 years ago. These results suggest that adaptation to the mine habitat routinely occurs via selection on ancestral variation, rather than independent de-novo mutations or migration between populations.",
