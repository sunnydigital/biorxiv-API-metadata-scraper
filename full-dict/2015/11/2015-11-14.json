    "abstract": "The genetic structure of human populations is often characterized by aggregating measures of ancestry across the autosomal chromosomes. While it may be reasonable to assume that population structure patterns are similar genome-wide in relatively homogeneous populations, this assumption may not be appropriate for admixed populations, such as Hispanics and African Americans, with recent ancestry from two or more continents. Recent studies have suggested that systematic ancestry differences can arise at genomic locations in admixed populations as a result of selection and non-random mating. Here, we propose a method, which we refer to as the chromosomal ancestry differences (CAnD) test, for detecting heterogeneity in population structure across the genome. CAnD uses local ancestry inferred from SNP genotype data to identify chromosomes harboring genomic regions with ancestry contributions that are significantly different than expected. In simulation studies with real genotype data from Phase III of the HapMap Project, we demonstrate the validity and power of CAnD. We apply CAnD to the HapMap Mexican American (MXL) and African American (ASW) population samples; in this analysis the software RFMix is used to infer local ancestry at genomic regions assuming admixing from Europeans, West Africans, and Native Americans. The CAnD test provides strong evidence of heterogeneity in population structure across the genome in the MXL sample (p = 4e - 05), which is largely driven by elevated Native American ancestry and deficit of European ancestry on the X chromosomes. Among the ASW, all chromosomes are largely African derived and no heterogeneity in population structure is detected in this sample.",

    "abstract": "1 MotivationA series of methods in population genetics use multilocus genotype data to assign individuals membership in latent clusters. These methods belong to a broad class of mixed-membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation used to analyze text corpora. Inference from mixed-membership models can produce different output matrices when repeatedly applied to the same inputs, and the number of latent clusters is a parameter that is often varied in the analysis pipeline. For these reasons, quantifying, visualizing, and annotating the output from mixed-membership models are bottlenecks for investigators across multiple disciplines from ecology to text data mining.\\n\\n2 ResultsWe introduce pong, a network-graphical approach for analyzing and visualizing membership in latent clusters with a native D3.js interactive visualization. pong leverages efficient algorithms for solving the Assignment Problem to dramatically reduce runtime while increasing accuracy compared to other methods that process output from mixed-membership models. We apply pong to 225,705 unlinked genome-wide single-nucleotide variants from 2,426 unrelated individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project, and identify previously overlooked aspects of global human population structure. We show that pong outpaces current solutions by more than an order of magnitude in runtime while providing a customizable and interactive visualization of population structure that is more accurate than those produced by current tools.\\n\\n3 Availabilitypong is freely available and can be installed using the Python package management system pip. pongs source code is available at https://github.com/abehr/pong.\\n\\n4 Contactaaron_behr@alumni.brown.edu,\\n\\nsramachandran@brown.edu",

    "abstract": "Insulin is an ancient, multi-functional hormone with essential roles in glucose homeostasis and energy storage. Recently, our group has taken advantage of the ability to limit insulin secretion in vivo by reducing insulin gene dosage to demonstrate that insulin hypersecretion is a requirement for diet-induced obesity. Our previous studies employed male Ins1+/-:Ins2-/- mice that exhibit a complete inhibition of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia relative to Ins1+/+:Ins2-/- littermate controls, as well as female Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice with transient, partial reduction in circulating insulin relative to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermates. In the present study, we sought to extend these studies to male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice on the same chow and high fat diets. Surprisingly, while reduced Ins2 gene dosage appeared capable of reducing Ins2 mRNA, insulin protein levels in these mice were not significantly reduced. Moreover, there was a marked hyper-variability in circulating insulin levels within and between two independent cohorts of mice that persisted over at least the first year of life. In Cohort 1, we observed a paradoxical increase in body weight in some high fat-fed male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice relative to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermate controls. This phenomenon is consistent with the known satiety effects of insulin and our previous observations with Ins2 can be expressed in the brain. Collectively, our data reveal unexpected complexity associated with the Ins2 gene in male mice, and establish the Ins2 gene as a candidate for studying the effects of modifier genes and/or environmental influences on gene-to-phenotype variability. Further studies are required to define the molecular mechanisms of this phenotypic hyper-variability and to define the role of reduced Ins2 gene dosage in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Insulin is an essential hormone with key roles in energy homeostasis and body composition. Mice and rats, unlike other mammals, have two insulin genes: the rodent-specific Ins1 gene and the ancestral Ins2 gene. The relationships between insulin gene dosage and obesity has previously been explored in male and female Ins2-/- mice with full or reduced Ins1 dosage, as well as in female Ins1-/- mice with full or partial Ins2 dosage. We report herein unexpected hyper-variability in circulating insulin and physiological responses to high fat feeding in male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice. Two large cohorts of Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice and their Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermates were fed chow diet or high fat diet (HFD) from weaning and housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Cohort A and cohort B were studied one year apart. Contrary to female mice from the same litters, inactivating one Ins2 allele on the complete Ins1-null background did not cause a consistent reduction of circulating insulin in male mice. In cohort A, HFD-fed males showed an equivalent degree of insulin hypersecretion and weight gain, regardless of Ins2 dosage. In cohort B, Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- males showed decreased insulin levels and body mass, compared to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermates. While experimental conditions were held consistent between cohorts, we found that HFD-fed Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice with lower insulin levels had increased corticosterone. Collectively, these observations highlight the hyper-variability and range of phenotypic characteristics modulated by Ins2 gene dosage, specifically in male mice.",

    "abstract": "In a classic example of the invasion of a species by a selfish genetic element, the P-element was horizontally transferred from a distantly related species into Drosophila melanogaster. Despite causing  hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes that include sterility, the P-element spread globally in the course of a few decades in D. melanogaster. Until recently, its sister species, including D. simulans, remained P-element free. Here, we find a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years; a survey of 181 strains shows that around 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we show that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element. To characterize this invasion temporally and geographically, we survey 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element. We find that the D. simulans P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Importantly, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype, strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySome genes perform necessary organismal functions, others hijack the cellular machinery to replicate themselves, potentially harming the host in the process. These  selfish genes can spread through genomes and species; as a result, eukaryotic genomes are typically saddled with large amounts of parasitic DNA. Here, we chronicle the surprisingly rapid global spread of a selfish transposable element through a close relative of the genetic model, Drosophila melanogaster. We see that, as it spreads, the transposable element is associated with damaging effects, including sterility, but that the flies quickly adapt to the negative consequences of the transposable element.",

    "abstract": "Rapid control of adhesive forces is one of the key benchmarks where footpads of climbing animals outperform conventional adhesives, promising novel bio-inspired attachment systems. All climbing animals use shear forces to switch rapidly between firm attachment and easy detachment, but the detailed mechanisms underlying  shear-sensitive adhesion have remained unclear. Here, we show that attachment forces of stick insects follow classic peeling theory when shear forces are small, but strongly exceed predictions as soon as their pads start to slide due to high shear forces. Pad sliding dramatically increases the critical peel force via a combination of two distinct mechanisms. First, partial sliding will pre-stretch the pads, so that they are effectively stiffer upon detachment and peel increasingly like inextensible tape. We demonstrate how this effect can be directly related to peeling theories which account for frictional dissipation. Second, pad sliding reduces the thickness of the secretion layer in the contact zone, thereby decreasing the interfacial mobility, and increasing the stress levels required for peeling. The approximately linear increase of adhesion with friction results in a sharp increase of adhesion at peel angles less than ca. 30{degrees}, allowing rapid switching between attachment and detachment during locomotion. Our results may apply to diverse climbing animals independent of pad morphology and adhesive mechanism, and highlight that control of adhesion is not solely achieved by direction-dependence and morphological anisotropy, suggesting promising new routes for the development of bio-inspired adhesives.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHow does cortical state affect neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, and is it analogous between anesthetized and awake animals? We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from all layers of isoflurane-anesthetized cat primary visual cortex (V1) while repeatedly presenting wide-field natural scene movie clips. Spiking responses of single units were remarkably precise, reliable and sparse, with lognormally distributed mean firing rates. Many units had distinct barcode-like firing patterns, with features as little as 10 ms wide. LFP-derived cortical state switched spontaneously between synchronized (1/f) and desynchronized (broadband). Surprisingly, responses were more precise, reliable and sparse during the synchronized than desynchronized state. Because the desynchronized state under anesthesia is thought to correspond to attending periods in awake animals, during which responses are enhanced, our results complicate the analogy between cortical states in anesthetized and awake animals. The presenceof orientation maps in cat V1 may explain contrary reports in anesthetized rodents, and predicts a similar result in anesthetized ferret and primate V1.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGlobal brain activity changes spontaneously over time and can be characterized along a spectrum from slow synchronized activity, to fast desynchronized activity. This spectrum is similar in awake, asleep and anesthetized animals, but is its effect on neural responses the same in all cases? Here we show that neural responses to natural movies in anesthetized cat visual cortex are more precise during synchronized activity. This is contrary to reports in anesthetized rodents, which we suggest may be due to greater columnar organization in cat visual cortex. Since this is also contrary to enhanced responses and behavioural performance during attention, when activity is desynchronized, our results suggest that similar brain states in awake and anesthetized animals may not be functionally analogous.",

Our method leverages a database of >30,000 bacterial reference genomes which we clustered into species groups. These cover the majority of abundant species in the human microbiome but only a small proportion of microbes in other environments, including soil and seawater. We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used rare single nucleotide variants to reveal extensive vertical transmission of strains at birth but colonization with strains unlikely to derive from the mother at later time points. This pattern was missed with species-level analysis, because the infant gut microbiome composition converges towards that of an adult over time. We also applied MIDAS to 198 globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to show that many prevalent bacterial species have population structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain-level genetic variants present in metagenomes clearly reveal extensive structure and dynamics that are obscured when data is analyzed at a higher taxonomic resolution.",

    "abstract": "Much work has been devoted to understanding the evolutionary processes shaping genetic variation across genomes. Studies have found neutral polymorphism is reduced close to genes and in regions of low recombination, suggesting the effects of natural selection. However, the effect of selection on neutral sequence divergence between species remains ambiguous. While studies have reported correlations between divergence and recombination, theoretical arguments suggest selection may not affect divergence at linked neutral sites. Here we address these outstanding issues by examining how natural selection has affected divergence between distantly related species. We show that neutral divergence is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist even when comparing humans and mice, species that split 75 million years ago. Further, neutral divergence is positively correlated with recombination rate. The correlation increases when focusing on genic regions, and biased gene conversion cannot explain all of this correlation. These signatures suggest that natural selection has affected linked divergence between distantly related species. Coalescent models indicate that background selection can generate these patterns. Even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome. Thus, the view that selection does not affect divergence at linked neutral sites needs to be reconsidered. Our work has important implications for understanding evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.",

In most cases the best model was comprised of two distributions. The major-component distribution is similar to a binomial distribution with low error and low reference bias. The minor-component distribution is overdispersed with higher error and reference bias. We also found that sites fitting the minor component are enriched for copy number variants and low complexity region.

    "abstract": "The discovery of shared behavioral processes across phyla is an essential step in the establishment of a comparative study of behavior. We use immobility as an origin and reference for the measurement of locomotor behavior; speed, direction of walking and direction of facing as the three degrees of freedom shaping fly locomotor behavior; and cocaine as the parameter inducing a progressive transition in and out of immobility. In this way we expose and quantify the generative rules that shape part of fruit fly locomotor behavior, bringing about a gradual buildup of freedom during the transition from immobility to normal behavior and a precisely opposite narrowing down during the transition into immobility. During buildup the fly exhibits enhancement and then reduction to normal values of movement along each degree of freedom: first, body rotation in the horizontal plane, then path curvature and then speed of translation. Transition into immobility unfolds by narrowing down of the repertoire in the opposite sequential order, showing reciprocal relations during both buildup and narrowing down. The same generative rules apply to vertebrate locomotor behavior in a variety of contexts involving transition out and into immobility. Recent claims for deep homology between the arthropod central complex and the vertebrate basal ganglia provide an opportunity to examine whether the generative rules we discovered also share common descent. Neurochemical processes mediating the buildup of locomotor behavior in vertebrates could guide the search for equivalent processes in arthropods. The measurement methodology we use prompts the discovery of candidate behavioral homologies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDo flies and mice share the same behavior? By defining immobility as an intrinsic reference point for locomotor behavior we show that the rules that generate the transition from immobility to full blown normal behavior, and from full blown behavior to immobility are shared by fruit flies and mice. These rules constitute a much desired aim of evolutionary biology: the discovery of behavioral homologies across distant phyla. The methodology we use facilitates the discovery of cross-phyletic behavioral homologies, shedding light on the problem of the evolution of behavior.",

However, analysis of the allele counts indicates the existence of an unidentified third archaic ancestor of Europeans, which diverged from its common ancestor with sub-Saharan Africans around 900 thousand years ago. This analysis shows that the relative proportions of derived alleles in the 0.0826% of the European genome that is not shared with the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzee are 13.6% Neanderthal, 32.3% sub-Saharan African and 54.2% third archaic ancestor. This analysis together with anthropological and archaeological evidence suggests a new model of human dispersal based on a Eurasian lineage in the Levant, which admixed with Neanderthals and descendants of African mtDNA haplogroup L3, followed by radiation from a basal admixed population around 55-50 Kya, with no subsequent major contribution to the European genome.",

    "abstract": "The rise of big data in modern research poses serious challenges for data management: Large and intricate datasets from diverse instrumentation must be precisely aligned, annotated, and processed in a variety of ways to extract new insights. While high levels of data integrity are expected, research teams have diverse backgrounds, are geographically dispersed, and rarely possess a primary interest in data science. Here we describe DataJoint, an open-source toolbox designed for manipulating and processing scientific data under the relational data model. Designed for scientists who need a flexible and expressive database language with few basic concepts and operations, DataJoint facilitates multiuser access, efficient queries, and distributed computing. With implementations in both MATLAB and Python, DataJoint is not limited to particular file formats, acquisition systems, or data modalities and can be quickly adapted to new experimental designs. DataJoint and related resources are available at http://datajoint.github.com.",

    "abstract": "AbstractComplete gene knockouts are highly informative about gene function. We exome sequenced 3,222 British Pakistani-heritage adults with high parental relatedness, discovering 1,111 rare-variant homozygous likely loss of function (rhLOF) genotypes predicted to disrupt (knockout) 781 genes. Based on depletion of rhLOF genotypes, we estimate that 13.6% of knockouts are incompatible with adult life, finding on average 1.6 heterozygous recessive lethal LOF variants per adult. Linking to lifelong health records, we observed no association of rhLOF genotypes with prescription- or doctor-consultation rate, and no disease-related phenotypes in 33 of 42 individuals with rhLOF genotypes in recessive Mendelian disease genes. Phased genome sequencing of a healthy PRDM9 knockout mother, her child and controls, showed meiotic recombination sites localised away from PRDM9-dependent hotspots, demonstrating PRDM9 redundancy in humans.",

    "abstract": "One of the goals of relation extraction is to identify protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in biomedical literature. Current systems are capturing binary relations and also the direction and type of an interaction. Besides assisting in the curation PPIs into databases, there has been little real-world application of these algorithms. We describe UPSITE, a text mining tool for extracting evidence in support of a hypothesized interaction. Given a predicted PPI, UPSITE uses a binary relation detector to check whether a PPI is found in abstracts in PubMed. If it is not found, UPSITE retrieves documents relevant to each of the two proteins separately, and extracts contextual information about biological events surrounding each protein, and calculates semantic similarity of the two proteins to provide evidential support for the predicted PPI. In evaluations, relation extraction achieved an Fscore of 0.88 on the HPRD50 corpus, and semantic similarity measured with angular distance was found to be statistically significant. With the development of PPI prediction algorithms, the burden of interpreting the validity and relevance of novel PPIs is on biologists. We suggest that presenting annotations of the two proteins in a PPI side-by-side and a score that quantifies their similarity lessens this burden to some extent.",
