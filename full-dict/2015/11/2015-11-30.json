    "abstract": "Spatial structure greatly affects the evolution of cooperation. While in two-player games the condition for cooperation to evolve depends on a single structure coefficient, in multiplayer games the condition might depend on several structure coefficients, making it difficult to compare different population structures. We propose a solution to this issue by introducing two simple ways of ordering population structures: the containment order and the volume order. If population structure [S]1 is greater than population structure [S]2 in the containment or the volume order, then [S]1 can be considered a stronger promoter of cooperation. We provide conditions for establishing the containment order, give general results on the volume order, and illustrate our theory by comparing different models of spatial games and associated update rules. Our results hold for a large class of population structures and can be easily applied to specific cases once the structure coefficients have been calculated or estimated.",

    "abstract": "Water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of biomass (B) produced per unit of water transpired (E) by plants, is an important determinant of plant productivity. A mathematical approach was developed with the purpose explaining the WUE of two forage legumes (clover and birdsfoot trefoil). The approach applied involved an interpolation method by cubic spline which results in the smoothest curve that fits the set of data points obtained experimentally. The results obtained show the importance of recognizing the WUE as a function of two variables, one represents the supply ({theta}) and the other represents the demand (D). It is important to note that these surfaces generated by the model allowed the estimation of the WUE value for any value of {theta} and any value of D, showing it is able to dissect the effect of both environmental variables on WUE. From the surface generated by the model, a scalar field plot (SFP) was created. Analysis of these SFPs allowed decomposing the environmental effect on B and E parameters defining WUE. The SFPs allow identify, in one picture, what are the environmental conditions and what variable are explaining a high WUE in both species. Spline application for generating SFP could have a significant impact on the quantitative understanding of the WUE and our study represents a first step towards an analytical and integrated view of this parameters.\\n\\nMathematics Subject Classification 92B05 65D05 65D07 65D10",

We assembled short reads and error-corrected long reads using Platanus, an assembler designed to perform well for heterozygous genomes. The updated genome assembly (v2.0) yielded 3- and 3.5-fold increase in N50 and N75, respectively; 2.6-fold decrease in the total number of scaffolds; 1.25-fold increase in the number of valid transcriptome alignments; 13.4-fold less mis-assembly and 1.85-fold increase in the percentage repeat, over the earlier assembly (v1.0). The current assembly also maps better to the genes known to be involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Together, the data represents an improved assembly of the A. indica genome.\\n\\nThe raw data described in this manuscript are submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive under the accession numbers SRX1074131, SRX1074132, SRX1074133, and SRX1074134 (SRP013453).",

    "abstract": "River impoundments are commonly cited as key disturbances to freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Dams alter natural hydrological regimes, homogenize river system dynamics at a global scale, can act as barriers for migratory species and may facilitate species invasions. In this synthesis, we examined the short- and long-term effects of impoundment on fish population dynamics and community structure. At the population level, we tested the \\\"trophic surge hypothesis\\\", which predicts a hump-shaped response of fish abundance through time after impoundment. We tested the hypothesis on 40 recruitment time series and 125 adult abundance time series from 19 species and nine reservoirs distributed in temperate and boreal regions. At the community level, we compared diversity metrics (richness, evenness, diversity) on two datasets: 1) between reservoirs and reference ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and streams) and 2) over time (before and after impoundment and over time). At the population level, the trophic surge hypothesis was supported in more than 55% of the time series but we observed significant variation across species, reservoirs and regions. Fish recruitment increased substantially during reservoir filling and shortly after impoundment, and was usually followed by an increase in adult fish. The surge was transient and vanished after 3-4 years for recruits and after 10 years for adults. However, we are lacking long time series to conclude about population patterns in the trophic equilibrium phase. At the community level, we did not find any strong directional patterns in species diversity metrics when comparing reservoirs to reference lakes but found higher diversity and evenness in reservoirs and impounded streams/rivers relative to unimpounded streams/rivers. We did not find directional patterns when looking at a change over time. Variability in the reported diversity results across studies may be related to the ability to tease apart the unique effects of impoundment and water regulation from other stressors such as propagule pressure and eutrophication, as well as the comparability of the reference system. In conclusion, fish populations benefited quickly but transiently from impoundment, and longer time series are needed to conclude about population dynamics and equilibrium in aging reservoirs in order to develop management recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Although the importance of density-dependent dispersal has been recognized in theory, few empirical studies have examined how immigration changes over a wide range of densities. In a replicated experiment using a novel approach allowing within-site comparison, we examined changes in immigration rate following the gradual removal of territorial damselfish from a limited area within a much larger patch of continuous habitat. In all sites, immigration occurred at intermediate densities but did not occur before the start of removals and only rarely as density approached zero. In the combined data and in 5 of 7 sites, the number of immigrants was a hump-shaped function of density. This is the first experimental evidence for hump-shaped, density-dependent immigration. This pattern may be more widespread than previously recognized because studies over more limited density ranges have identified positive density dependence at low densities and negative density dependence at high densities. Positive density dependence at low density can arise from limits to the number of potential immigrants and from behavioral preferences for settling near conspecifics. Negative density dependence at high density can arise from competition for resources, especially high quality territories. The potential for non-linear effects of local density on immigration needs to be recognized for robust predictions of conservation reserve function, harvest impacts, pest control, and the dynamics of fragmented populations.",

While such recordings yield snapshots of neural dynamics during specified tasks, they are ill-suited for tracking single-unit activity over longer timescales relevant for most developmental and learning processes, or for capturing neural dynamics across different behavioral states. Here we describe an automated platform for continuous long-term recordings of neural activity and behavior in freely moving animals. An unsupervised algorithm identifies and tracks the activity of single units over weeks of recording, dramatically simplifying the analysis of large datasets. Months-long recordings from motor cortex and striatum made and analyzed with our system revealed remarkable stability in basic neuronal properties, such as firing rates and inter-spike interval distributions. Interneuronal correlations and the representation of different movements and behaviors were similarly stable.

In this study, we developed \\\"in vitro enChIP\\\" using recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to isolate target genomic regions. in vitro enChIP has the great advantage over conventional enChIP of not requiring expression of CRISPR complexes in cells. We first demonstrate that in vitro enChIP using recombinant CRISPR RNPs can be used to isolate target DNA from mixtures of purified DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, we show that this technology can be employed to efficiently isolate target genomic regions, while retaining their intracellular molecular interactions, with negligible contamination from irrelevant genomic regions. Thus, in vitro enChIP technology is of potential use for sequence-specific isolation of DNA, as well as for identification of molecules interacting with genomic regions of interest in vivo in combination with downstream analysis.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation is a primary heritable epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates many cellular processes. While the whole-genome methylation pattern has been generally conserved in different eukaryotic groups, invertebrates and vertebrates exhibit two distinct patterns. Whereas almost all CpG sites are methylated in most vertebrates, with the exception of short unmethylated regions call CpG islands, the most frequent pattern in invertebrate animals is  mosaic methylation, comprising domains of heavily methylated DNA interspersed with domains that are methylation free. The mechanism by which the genome methylation pattern transited from a mosaic to a global pattern and the role of the one or two-round whole-genome duplication in this transition remain largely elusive, partly owing to the lack of methylome data from early vertebrates. In this study, we used the whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing technology to investigate the genome-wide methylation in three tissues (heart, muscle, and sperm) from the sea lamprey, an extant Agarthan vertebrate. Analyses of methylation level and the extent of CpG dinucleotide depletion of geneencoding, intergenic and promoter regions revealed a gradual increase in the methylation level from invertebrates to vertebrates, with the sea lamprey exhibiting an intermediate position. In addition, the methylation level of the majority of CpGs was intermediate in each sea lamprey tissue, indicating a high level of heterogeneity of methylation status between individual cells. In this regard, we defined the genomic methylation pattern of sea lamprey as \\\"global genomic DNA intermediate methylation\\\". The methylation features in different genomic regions, such as the transcription start site (TSS) region of the gene body, exon-intron boundaries, transposons, as well as genes grouping with different expression levels, supported the gradual methylation transition hypothesis. We further discussed that the copy number difference in DNA methylation transferases and the loss of the PWWP domain and/or DNTase domain in DNMT3 sub-family enzymes may have contributed to the methylation pattern transition in early vertebrates. These findings demonstrate an intermediate genomic methylation pattern between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates, providing evidence that supports the hypothesis that methylation patterns underwent a gradual transition from invertebrates (mosaic) to vertebrates (global).",

    "abstract": "Genetic risk factors often localize in non-coding regions of the genome with unknown effects on disease etiology. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) help to explain the regulatory mechanisms underlying the association of genetic risk factors with disease. More mechanistic insights can be derived from knowledge of the context, such as cell type or the activity of signaling pathways, influencing the nature and strength of eQTLs. Here, we generated peripheral blood RNA-seq data from 2,116 unrelated Dutch individuals and systematically identified these context-dependent eQTLs using a hypothesis-free strategy that does not require prior knowledge on the identity of the modifiers. Out of the 23,060 significant cis-regulated genes (false discovery rate < 0.05), 2,743 genes (12%) show context-dependent eQTL effects. The majority of those were influenced by cell type composition, revealing eQTLs that are particularly strong in cell types such as CD4+ T-cells, erythrocytes, and even lowly abundant eosinophils. A set of 145 cis-eQTLs were influenced by the activity of the type I interferon signaling pathway and we identified several cis-eQTLs that are modulated by specific transcription factors that bind to the eQTL SNPs. This demonstrates that large-scale eQTL studies in unchallenged individuals can complement perturbation experiments to gain better insight in regulatory networks and their stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Most disease associated genetic risk factors are non-coding, making it challenging to design experiments to understand their functional consequences1,2. Identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has been a powerful approach to infer downstream effects of disease variants but the large majority remains unexplained.3,4. The analysis of DNA methylation, a key component of the epigenome5, offers highly complementary data on the regulatory potential of genomic regions6,7. However, a large-scale, combined analysis of methylome and transcriptome data to infer downstream effects of disease variants is lacking. Here, we show that disease variants have wide-spread effects on DNA methylation in trans that likely reflect the downstream effects on binding sites of cis-regulated transcription factors. Using data on 3,841 Dutch samples, we detected 272,037 independent cis-meQTLs (FDR < 0.05) and identified 1,907 trait-associated SNPs that affect methylation levels of 10,141 different CpG sites in trans (FDR < 0.05), an eight-fold increase in the number of downstream effects that was known from trans-eQTL studies3,8,9. Trans-meQTL CpG sites are enriched for active regulatory regions, being correlated with gene expression and overlap with Hi-C determined interchromosomal contacts10,11. We detected many trans-meQTL SNPs that affect expression levels of nearby transcription factors (including NFKB1, CTCF and NKX2-3), while the corresponding trans-meQTL CpG sites frequently coincide with its respective binding site. Trans-meQTL mapping therefore provides a strategy for identifying and better understanding downstream functional effects of many disease-associated variants.",

In principle, knowing all information about species traits would make phylogenetic information redundant, at least that component of phylogenetic signal in the distribution of species among communities that is caused by phylogenetically related species sharing similar traits. In reality, phylogenies may contain more information than a set of singular, discretely measured traits because we cannot measure all species traits and may misjudge which are most important. The extent to which functional trait information makes phylogenetic information redundant, however, has not been explicitly studied with empirical data in community ecology. Here, we use phylogenetic linear mixed models to analyze community assembly of 55 understory plant species in 30 forest sites in central Wisconsin. These communities show strong phylogenetic attraction, yet variation among sites in 20 environmental variables could not account for this pattern. Most of the 15 functional traits we measured had strong phylogenetic signal, but only three varied strongly among sites in ways that affected species abundances. These three traits explained only 19% of variation in phylogenetic patterns of species co-occurrence. Thus, phylogenies appear to provide considerably more information about community assembly than the functional traits measured in this study, demonstrating the value of phylogeny in studying of community assembly processes even with abundant functional traits.",

    "abstract": "Double-strand DNA breaks occur upon exposure of cells to agents such as ionizing radiation and ultraviolet light or indirectly through replication fork collapse at DNA damage sites. If left unrepaired double-strand breaks can cause genome instability and cell death. In response to DNA damage, proteins involved in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination re-localize into discrete nuclear foci. We identified 29 proteins that co-localize with the recombination repair protein Rad52 in response to DNA damage. Of particular interest, Ygr042w/Mte1, a protein of unknown function, showed robust colocalization with Rad52. Mte1 foci fail to form when the DNA helicase Mph1 is absent. Mte1 and Mph1 form a complex, and are recruited to double-strand breaks in vivo in a mutually dependent manner. Mte1 is important for resolution of Rad52 foci during double-strand break repair, and for suppressing break-induced replication. Together our data indicate that Mte1 functions with Mph1 in double-strand break repair.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms colonize a wide range of natural and artificial environments although there are hardly any data on the microbial ecology of one the most widespread man-made extreme structures: solar panels. Here we show that solar panels in a Mediterranean city (Valencia, Spain) harbor a highly diverse microbial community with more than 500 different species per panel, most of which belong to drought-, heat- and radiation-adapted bacterial genera, and sun-irradiation adapted epiphytic fungi. The taxonomic and functional profiles of this microbial community and the characterization of selected culturable bacteria reveal the existence of a diverse mesophilic microbial community on the panels surface. This biocenosis proved to be more similar to the ones inhabiting deserts than to any human or urban microbial ecosystem. This unique microbial community shows different day/night proteomic profiles; it is dominated by reddish pigment- and sphingolipid-producers, and is adapted to withstand circadian cycles of high temperatures, desiccation and solar radiation.",
