    "abstract": "Scientific publications enable results and ideas to be transmitted throughout the scientific community. The number and type of journal publications also have become the primary criteria used in evaluating career advancement. Our analysis suggests that publication practices have changed considerably in the life sciences over the past thirty years. Considerably more experimental data is now required for publication, and the average time required for graduate students to publish their first paper has increased and is approaching the desirable duration of Ph.D. training. Since publication is generally a requirement for career progression, schemes to reduce the time of graduate student and postdoctoral training may be difficult to implement without also considering new mechanisms for accelerating communication of their work. The increasing time to publication also delays potential catalytic effects that ensue when many scientists have access to new information. The time has come for the life scientists, funding agencies, and publishers to discuss how to communicate new findings in a way that best serves the interests of the public and scientific community.",

    "abstract": "Tuning curves are the functions that relate the responses of sensory neurons to various values within one continuous stimulus dimension (such as the orientation of a bar in the visual domain or the frequency of a tone in the auditory domain). They are commonly determined by fitting a model e.g. a Gaussian or other bell-shaped curves to the measured responses to a small subset of discrete stimuli in the relevant dimension. However, as neuronal responses are irregular and experimental measurements noisy, it is often difficult to determine reliably the appropriate model from the data. We illustrate this general problem by fitting diverse models to representative recordings from area MT in rhesus monkey visual cortex during multiple attentional tasks involving complex composite stimuli. We find that all models can be well-fitted, that the best model generally varies between neurons and that statistical comparisons between neuronal responses across different experimental conditions are affected quantitatively and qualitatively by specific model choices. As a robust alternative to an often arbitrary model selection, we introduce a model-free approach, in which features of interest are extracted directly from the measured response data without the need of fitting any model. In our attentional datasets, we demonstrate that data-driven methods provide descriptions of tuning curve features such as preferred stimulus direction or attentional gain modulations which are in agreement with fit-based approaches when a good fit exists. Furthermore, these methods naturally extend to the frequent cases of uncertain model selection. We show that model-free approaches can identify attentional modulation patterns, such as general alterations of the irregular shape of tuning curves, which cannot be captured by fitting stereotyped conventional models. Finally, by comparing datasets across different conditions, we demonstrate effects of attention that are cell-and even stimulus-specific. Based on these proofs-of-concept, we conclude that our data-driven methods can reliably extract relevant tuning information from neuronal recordings, including cells whose seemingly haphazard response curves defy conventional fitting approaches.",

    "abstract": "The role played by interlayer connections in shaping local responses and their long-range coupling has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we analyze a rate model of a canonic local circuit with realistic anatomy. We find that this circuit generates a rich repertoire of possible dynamical states, including an oscillatory regime in which gamma-and beta-oscillations dominate in superficial and deep layers, respectively, in agreement with experimental observations. This regime stems from non-linear inter-layer interactions, independently from intrinsic resonance properties of distinct layers. Moreover, by connecting two local circuits via cortico-cortical projections, the emergent phase differences define a flexible and frequency-dependent inter-areal hierarchy. Such dynamic patterns generally do not arise in randomized circuits, and the compatible connectomes are rare, although not unique. Altogether, these results suggest that inter-layer connectivity is homeostatically regulated to make local circuits fit to integrate and multiplex signals from several sources in multiple frequency bands.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe local circuit of mammalian cortex presents a characteristic multilayered structure, with feedforward (and feedback) cortico-cortical connections originating from (and targeting) distinct and well defined layers. Here, we model how such a structure fundamentally shapes the dynamical repertoire of local cortical oscillatory states and their long-range interaction. Experimental evidence, matched by our simulations, suggests that different cortical layers oscillate at different frequencies and that neuronal oscillations at different frequencies are exploited for communication in different directions. While this laminar specificity of oscillations is often explained in terms of multiple inhibitory populations with different resonance properties, we show here that it could alternatively emerge as a byproduct of the collective local circuit dynamics. Our modelling study indicates furthermore that the empirically observed multi-frequency oscillatory patterns cannot be reproduced in presence of an arbitrary interlayer connectivity. In this sense, therefore, we believe that the adopted connectome, derived from neuroanatomical reconstructions, is \\\"special\\\". Nevertheless, it is not unique, since other, very different connectomes may also lead to a matching dynamical repertoire. This suggests that a multiplicity of non-random canonical circuit templates may share largely overlapping functions, robustly achieved and maintained via functional homeostasis mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The activity of ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons can be represented as a set of points in the space of firing rates. Even though the dimension of this space is equal to the ensemble size, neural activity can be effectively localized on smaller subspaces. The dimensionality of the neural space is an important determinant of the computational tasks supported by the neural activity. Here, we investigate the dimensionality of neural ensembles from the sensory cortex of alert rats during periods of ongoing (intertrial) and stimulus-evoked activity. We find that dimensionality grows linearly with ensemble size, and grows significantly faster during ongoing activity compared to evoked activity. We explain these results using a spiking network model based on a clustered architecture. The model captures the difference in growth rate between ongoing and evoked activity and predicts a characteristic scaling with ensemble size that could be tested in high-density multi-electrode recordings. Moreover, we present a simple theory that predicts the existence of an upper bound on dimensionality. This upper bound is inversely proportional to the amount of pair-wise correlations and, compared to a homogeneous network without clusters, it is larger by a factor equal to the number of clusters. The empirical estimation of such bounds depends on the number and duration of trials and is well predicted by the theory. Together, these results provide a framework to analyze neural dimensionality in alert animals, its behavior under stimulus presentation, and its theoretical dependence on ensemble size, number of clusters, and correlations in spiking network models.",
