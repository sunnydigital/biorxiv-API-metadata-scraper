    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a wide class of [~]22 nt non-coding RNAs of metazoans capable of inhibiting target mRNAs translation by binding to partially complementary sites in their 3UTRs. Due to their regulatory potential, miRNAs are implicated in functioning of a broad range of biological pathways and processes. Here we investigate the functions of the miR-959-964 cluster expressed predominantly in testes of Drosophila melanogaster. The deletion of miR-959-964 resulted in male sterility due to the disturbance of the spermatid individualization process. Analysis of the transcriptome by microarray followed by luciferase reporter assay revealed didum, for, fdl and CG10512 as the targets of miR-959-964. Moreover, the deletion of miR-959-964 is accompanied by a decreased the expression of genes responsible for microtubule-based movement and spermatid differentiation. Thus, we suggest that miR-959-964 can control the process of spermatid individualization by direct and indirect modulating the expression of different components of the individualization process. In addition, we have shown that in comparison to other miRNAs, the rate of evolution of the testis-specific miR-959-964 cluster is unusually high, indicating its possible involvement in speciation via reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "O_LISampling ecological interactions presents similar challenges, problems, potential biases, and constraints as sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories. Interactions are just pairwise relationships among individuals of two different species, such as those among plants and their seed dispersers in frugivory interactions or those among plants and their pollinators. Sampling interactions is a fundamental step to build robustly estimated interaction networks, yet few analyses have attempted a formal approach to their sampling protocols.\\nC_LIO_LIRobust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions.\\nC_LIO_LIWhile the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizable fraction of the maximum number of interactions Imax among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e., Imax = AP) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, i.e., life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically I << Imax, resulting in extremely sparse interaction matrices with low connectance.\\nC_LIO_LIReasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches, and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Ad-equately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that for-bidden links can be \\\"discounted\\\" when addressing sampling effort.\\nC_LIO_LIHere I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. This is crucial to assess the fast-paced and devastating effects of defaunation-driven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic homogenization.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the causative agent of chronic respiratory infections and is an important pathogen of cystic fibrosis patients. Adaptive mutations play an essential role for antimicrobial resistance and persistence. The factors that contribute to bacterial mutagenesis in this environment are not clear. Recently it has been proposed that cationic antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37 could act as a mutagen in P. aeruginosa. Here we provide experimental evidence that mutagenesis is the product of a joint action of LL-37 and free iron. By estimating mutation rate, mutant frequencies and assessing mutational spectra in P. aeruginosa treated either with LL-37, iron or a combination of both we demonstrate that mutation rate and mutant frequency were increased only when free iron and LL-37 were present simultaneously. The addition of an iron chelator completely abolished this mutagenic effect, suggesting that LL-37 enables iron to enter the cells resulting in DNA damage by Fenton reactions. This was also supported by the observation that the mutational spectrum of the bacteria under LL-37-iron regime showed one of the characteristic Fenton reaction fingerprints: C to T transitions. Free iron concentration in nature and within hosts is kept at a very low level, but the situation in infected lungs of cystic fibrosis patients is different. Intermittent bleeding and damage to the epithelial cells in lungs may contribute to the release of free iron that in turn leads to generation of reactive oxygen species and deterioration of the respiratory tract, making it more susceptible to the infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCationic antimicrobial peptides (cAMPs) are small proteins naturally produced by the immune system to limit bacterial growth mainly through pore formation in the membrane. It has recently been suggested that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs promote bacterial mutagenesis, similarly to antibiotics. However, we previously reported that cAMPs do not increase mutation rate and do not activate bacterial stress responses. Here we resolve this contradiction. We report that free iron in the culture medium increases mutagenesis in the presence of cAMPs. We show that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs facilitate entry of free iron into bacterial cells, where it interacts with hydrogen peroxide, thereby resulting in production of DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species and increased mutagenesis. Moreover, these results may have clinically-relevant implications: while very little free iron is normally present in healthy individuals, this is not the case in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, where elevated bacterial mutagenesis promotes antibiotic resistance and contributes to persistence and severity of infection. Thus, an intervention aimed at reduction of free iron in the lungs could reduce the cAMPs-facilitation of iron-mediated mutagenesis; hence antibiotic resistance and pathoadaptation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental consideration for the conservation of a species is the extent of its native range, however defining a native range is often challenging as changing environments drive shifts in species distributions over time. The crucian carp, Carassius carassius (L.) is a threatened freshwater fish native to much of Europe, however the extent of this range is ambiguous. One particularly contentious region is England, in which C. carassius is currently considered native on the basis of anecdotal evidence. Here, we use 13 microsatellite loci, population structure analyses and approximate bayesian computation (ABC), to empirically test the native status of C. carassius in England. Contrary to the current consensus, ABC yields strong support for introduced origins of C. carassius in England, with posterior distribution estimates placing their introduction in the 15th century, well after the loss of the doggerland landbridge. This result brings to light an interesting and timely debate surrounding our motivations for the conservation of species. We discuss this topic, and make arguments for the continued conservation of C. carassius in England, despite its non-native origins.",

    "abstract": "As RNA-Seq and other high-throughput sequencing grow in use and remain critical for gene expression studies, technical variability in counts data impedes studies of differential expression studies, data across samples and experiments, or reproducing results. Studies like Dillies et al. (2013) compare several between-lane normalization methods involving scaling factors, while Hansen et al. (2012) and Risso et al. (2014) propose methods that correct for sample-specific bias or use sets of control genes to isolate and remove technical variability. This paper evaluates four normalization methods in terms of reducing intra-group, technical variability and facilitating differential expression analysis or other research where the biological, inter-group variability is of interest. To this end, the four methods were evaluated in differential expression analysis between data from Pickrell et al. (2010) and Montgomery et al. (2010) and between simulated data modeled on these two datasets. Though the between-lane scaling factor methods perform worse on real data sets, they are much stronger for simulated data. We cannot reject the recommendation of Dillies et al. to use TMM and DESeq normalization, but further study of power to detect effects of different size under each normalization method is merited.",

    "abstract": "After heat shock injury, a group of proteins that regulate protein-folding processes are synthesised to prevent damage. Caspase is an enzyme responsible for the execution ostress-induced apoptosis. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are capable of modulating caspase activity. In addition to changes in protein synthesis, heat shock causes the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from plasma membranes and the subsequent synthesis of eicosanoids, i.e., activation of the AA pathways. The development of cytoprotective strategies might depend on whether caspase-1 activity is affected by heat shock preconditioning and the associated pharmacological modulations after heat shock injury. Therefore, we studied the effects of heat shock preconditioning and modulations of the eicosanoid pathways on Ap-sHSP20.8 and on the final apoptotic effector enzyme caspase-1 to clarify whether these effects were modulated in the fat bodies of Antheraea pernyi injured by heat shock. We concluded that eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors might be utilised to simultaneously decrease Hsp 20.8 synthesis and to increase caspase-1 activity. Modifications of the eicosanoid pathways might also be used to mediate caspase-1 activity under hyperthermic conditions, suggesting a novel mechanism for regulation of caspase-1 in the fat bodies of A. pernyi",
