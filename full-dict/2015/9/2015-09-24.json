    "abstract": "The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for HLA and KIR genotyping is rapidly advancing knowledge of genetic variation of these highly polymorphic loci. NGS genotyping is poised to replace older methods for clinical use, but standard methods for reporting and exchanging these new, high quality genotype data are needed. The Immunogenomic NGS Consortium, a broad collaboration of histocompatibility and immunogenetics clinicians, researchers, instrument manufacturers and software developers, has developed the Minimum Information for Reporting Immunogenomic NGS Genotyping (MIRING) reporting guidelines. MIRING is a checklist that specifies the content of NGS genotyping results as well as a set of messaging guidelines for reporting the results. A MIRING message includes five categories of structured information - message annotation, reference context, full genotype, consensus sequence and novel polymorphism - and references to three categories of accessory information - NGS platform documentation, read processing documentation and primary data. These eight categories of information ensure the long-term portability and broad application of this NGS data for all current histocompatibility and immunogenetics use cases. In addition, MIRING can be extended to allow the reporting of genotype data generated using pre-NGS technologies. Because genotyping results reported using MIRING are easily updated in accordance with reference and nomenclature databases, MIRING represents a bold departure from previous methods of reporting HLA and KIR genotyping results, which have provided static and less-portable data. More information about MIRING can be found online at miring.immunogenomics.org.",

    "abstract": "Delays in gene networks result from the sequential nature of protein assembly. However, it is unclear how models of gene networks that use delays should be modified when considering time-dependent changes in temperature. This is important, as delay is often used in models of genetic oscillators that can be entrained by periodic fluctuations in temperature. Here, we analytically derive the time dependence of delay distributions in response to time-varying temperature changes. We find that the resulting time-varying delay is nonlinearly dependent on parameters of the time-varying temperature such as amplitude and frequency, therefore, applying an Arrhenius scaling may result in erroneous conclusions. We use these results to examine a model of a synthetic gene oscillator with temperature compensation. We show that temperature entrainment follows from the same mechanism that results in temperature compensation. Under a common Arrhenius scaling alone, the frequency of the oscillator is sensitive to changes in the mean temperature but robust to changes in the frequency of a periodically time-varying temperature. When a mechanism for temperature compensation is included in the model, however, we show that the oscillator is entrained by periodically varying temperature even when maintaining insensitivity to the mean temperature.",

    "abstract": "One of the unaddressed challenges in drug discovery is that drug potency determined in vitro is not a reliable indicator of drug activity in humans. Accumulated evidences suggest that in vivo activity is more strongly correlated with the binding/unbinding kinetics than the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions (PLI). However, existing experimental and computational techniques are insufficient in studying the molecular details of kinetics process of PLI. Consequently, we not only have limited mechanistic understanding of the kinetic process but also lack a practical platform for the high-throughput screening and optimization of drug leads based on their kinetic properties. Here we address this unmet need by integrating energetic and conformational dynamic features derived from molecular modeling with multi-task learning. To test our method, HIV-1 protease is used as a model system. Our integrated model provides us with new insights into the molecular determinants of kinetics of PLI. We find that the coherent coupling of conformational dynamics between protein and ligand may play a critical role in determining the kinetic rate constants of PLI. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relative movement of normal nodes of amino acids upon ligand binding is an important feature to capture conformational dynamics of the binding/unbinding kinetics. Coupled with the multi-task learning, we can predict combined kon and koff accurately with an accuracy of 74.35%. Thus, it is possible to screen and optimize compounds based on their binding/unbinding kinetics. The further development of such computational tools will bridge one of the critical missing links in drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Forward genetic screens represent powerful, unbiased approaches to uncover novel components in any biological process. Such screens suffer from a major bottleneck, however, namely the cloning of corresponding genes causing the phenotypic variation. Reverse genetic screens have been employed as a way to circumvent this issue, but can often be limited in scope. Here we demonstrate an innovative approach to gene discovery. Using C. elegans as a model system, we used a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation library, from the Million Mutation Project, together with the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT), to rapidly screen for and identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest, namely defects in dye-filling of ciliated sensory neurons. Such anomalies in dye-filling are often associated with the disruption of cilia, organelles which in humans are implicated in sensory physiology (including vision, smell and hearing), development and disease. Beyond identifying several well characterised dye-filling genes, our approach uncovered three genes not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function. From these putative novel dye-filling genes, we confirmed the involvement of BGNT-1.1 in ciliated sensory neuron function and morphogenesis. BGNT-1.1 functions at the trans-Golgi network of sheath cells (glia) to influence dye-filling and cilium length, in a cell non-autonomous manner. Notably, BGNT-1.1 is the orthologue of human B3GNT1/B4GAT1, a glycosyltransferase associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS). WWS is a multigenic disorder characterised by muscular dystrophy as well as brain and eye anomalies. Together, our work unveils an effective and innovative approach to gene discovery, and provides the first evidence that B3GNT1-associated Walker-Warburg syndrome may be considered a ciliopathy.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryModel organisms are useful tools for uncovering new genes involved in a biological process via genetic screens. Such an approach is powerful, but suffers from drawbacks that can slow down gene discovery. In forward genetics screens, difficult-to-map phenotypes present daunting challenges, and whole-genome coverage can be equally challenging for reverse genetic screens where typically only a single genes function is assayed per strain. Here, we show a different approach which includes positive aspects of forward (high-coverage, randomly-induced mutations) and reverse genetics (prior knowledge of gene disruption) to accelerate gene discovery. We paired a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation C. elegans library with a rare-variant associated test to rapidly identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest: defects in sensory neurons bearing sensory organelles called cilia, via a simple dye-filling assay to probe the form and function of these cells. We found two well characterised dye-filling genes and three genes, not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function, that were associated with dye-filling defects. We reveal that disruption of one of these (BGNT-1.1), whose human orthologue is associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome, results in abrogated uptake of dye and cilia length defects. We believe that our novel approach is useful for any organism with a small genome that can be quickly sequenced and where many mutant strains can be easily isolated and phenotyped, such as Drosophila and Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "The Atlantic Canary (Serinus canaria) is the most common caged bird with extensive carotenoid plumage coloration. Domestic strains of canaries have been bred for a range of colors and patterns, making them a valuable model for studies of the genetic bases for feather pigmentation. However, no detailed account has been published on the feather pigments of the various strains of this species, particularly in relation to dietary pigments available during molt. Moreover, in the twentieth century, aviculturists created a red canary by crossing Atlantic Canaries with Red Siskins (Carduelis cucullata). This \\\"red-factor\\\" canary is reputed to metabolically transform yellow dietary pigments into red ketocarotenoids, but such metabolic capacity has yet to be documented in controlled experiments. We fed molting yellow and red-factor canaries seed diets supplemented with either {beta}-carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, or {beta}-cryptoxanthin/{beta}-carotene and measured the coloration and carotenoid content of newly grown feathers. On all diets, yellow canaries grew yellow feathers and red canaries grew red feathers. Yellow canaries deposited dietary pigments and metabolically derived canary xanthophylls into feathers. Red-factor canaries deposited the same plumage carotenoids as yellow canaries, but also deposited red ketocarotenoids. Red-factor canaries deposited higher total amounts of carotenoids than yellow canaries, but otherwise there was little effect of diet treatment on feather hue or chroma. These observations indicate that canaries can use a variety of dietary precursors to produce plumage coloration and that red canaries can metabolically convert yellow dietary carotenoids into red ketocarotenoids.",

    "abstract": "Many complex brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, exhibit a wide range of symptoms and disability. To understand how brain communication is impaired in such conditions, functional connectivity studies seek to understand individual differences in brain network structure in terms of covariates that measure symptom severity. In practice, however, functional connectivity is not observed but estimated from complex and noisy neural activity measurements. Imperfect subject network estimates can compromise subsequent efforts to detect covariate effects on network structure. We address this problem in the case of Gaussian graphical models of functional connectivity, by proposing novel two-level models that treat both subject level networks and population level covariate effects as unknown parameters. To account for imperfectly estimated subject level networks when fitting these models, we propose two related approaches -- R2 based on resampling and random effects test statistics, and R3 that additionally employs random adaptive penalization. Simulation studies using realistic graph structures reveal that R2 and R3 have superior statistical power to detect covariate effects compared to existing approaches, particularly when the number of within subject observations is comparable to the size of subject networks. Using our novel models and methods to study parts of the ABIDE dataset, we find evidence of hypoconnectivity associated with symptom severity in autism spectrum disorders, in frontoparietal and limbic systems as well as in anterior and posterior cingulate cortices.",

    "abstract": "Antimetabolite chemotherapies increase uracil levels in DNA, and thus identification of factors that influence the uracil content in DNA may have implications for understanding uracil-mediated chromosomal instability. We previously showed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that uracil content in DNA correlates with replication timing, where the earliest and latest replicating regions are depleted in uracil. Here, we manipulated nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes in budding yeast to determine whether the pattern of uracil incorporation could be altered. In strains with high levels of uracil incorporation, deletion of dCMP deaminase (Dcd1) accelerated uracil incorporation at early-firing origins, likely due to rapid dTTP pool depletion. In contrast, increasing the activity of ribonucleotide reductase, which is required for the synthesis of all dNTPs via ribonucleotide diphosphates, lead to dUTP and dTTP pool equilibration and a concomitant increase in uracil content throughout the genome. These data suggest that uracil availability and the dUTP:dTTP ratio are temporally regulated during S phase and govern uracil incorporation into the genome. Therapeutic manipulation of nucleotide biosynthesis in human cells to either increase the dUTP pool or deplete the dTTP pool in early S phase may therefore improve the efficacy of antimetabolite chemotherapies.",

These studies have focused on additive association tests. Identifying deviations from additivity may provide new biological insights and explain some of the missing heritability for these diseases.\\n\\nTo identify non-additive associations we performed a genome-wide association study using a dominance deviation model for BMI, obesity and Type 2 diabetes (4,040 cases) in 120,286 individuals of British ancestry from the UK Biobank study.\\n\\nKnown obesity-associated variants in FTO showed strong evidence for deviation from additivity (P=3x10-5) through a recessive effect of the BMI-increasing allele.

A behavioral screen identified roles for Semaphorins (Serna) and Plexins (Plex) in walking behavior.

Importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; PlexB/Sema2a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons.
