    "abstract": "Survival in aquatic environments requires organisms to have effective means of collecting information from their surroundings through various sensing strategies. In this study, we explore how sensing mode and range depend on body size. We find a hierarchy of sensing modes determined by body size. With increasing body size, a larger battery of modes becomes available (chemosensing, mechanosensing, vision, hearing, and echolocation, in that order) while the sensing range also increases. This size-dependent hierarchy and the transitions between primary sensory modes are explained on the grounds of limiting factors set by physiology and the physical laws governing signal generation, transmission and reception. We theoretically predict the body size limits for various sensory modes, which align well with size ranges found in literature. The treatise of all ocean life, from unicellular organisms to whales, demonstrates how body size determines available sensing modes, and thereby acts as a major structuring factor of aquatic life.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell genomics has revolutionised modern biology while requiring the development of advanced computational and statistical methods. Advances have been made in uncovering gene expression heterogeneity, discovering new cell types and novel identification of genes and transcription factors involved in cellular processes. One such approach to the analysis is to construct pseudotime orderings of cells as they progress through a particular biological process, such as cell-cycle or differentiation. These methods assign a score - known as the pseudotime - to each cell as a surrogate measure of progression. However, all published methods to date are purely algorithmic and lack any way to give uncertainty to the pseudotime assigned to a cell. Here we present a method that combines Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GP-LVM) with a recently published electroGP prior to perform Bayesian inference on the pseudotimes. We go on to show that the posterior variability in these pseudotimes leads to nontrivial uncertainty in the pseudo-temporal ordering of the cells and that pseudotimes should not be thought of as point estimates.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies offers powerful opportunities to study genetic variation. Mapping the mutations responsible for different phenotypes is generally an involved and time-consuming process so researchers have developed user-friendly tools for mapping-by-sequencing, yet they are not applicable to organisms with non-sequenced genomes. We introduce SDM (SNP Distribution Method), a reference independent method for rapid discovery of mutagen-induced mutations in typical forward genetic screens. SDM aims to order a disordered collection of HTS reads or contigs such that the fragment carrying the causative mutation can be identified. SDM uses typical distributions of homozygous SNPs that are linked to a phenotype-altering SNP in a non-recombinant region as a model to order the fragments. To implement and test SDM, we created model genomes with an idealised SNP density based on Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 1 and analysed fragments with size distribution similar to reads or contigs assembled from HTS sequencing experiments. SDM groups the contigs by their normalised SNP density and arranges them to maximise the fit to the expected SNP distribution. We tested the procedure in existing datasets by examining SNP distributions in recent out-cross and back-cross experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana backgrounds. In all the examples we analysed, homozygous SNPs were normally distributed around the causal mutation. We used the real SNP densities obtained from these experiments to prove the efficiency and accuracy of SDM. The algorithm was able to successfully identify small sized (10-100 kb) genomic regions containing the causative mutation.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to the regulation of immune responses remains poorly studied despite emerging examples of their role as regulators of immune defenses. Here, we used mRNA sequencing to quantify gene expression and isoform abundances in primary macrophages from 60 individuals, before and after infection with two live bacteria. In response to both bacteria we identified thousands of genes that significantly change isoform usage in response to infection, and found global shifts towards (i) the inclusion of cassette exons and (ii) shorter 3 UTRs. Using complementary data collected in non-human primates, we show that these features are evolutionarily conserved among primates. Finally, our results suggest that the pervasive usage of shorter 3 UTRs is a mechanism for particular genes to evade repression by immune-activated miRNAs. Collectively, our results show that dynamic changes in RNA processing play a key role in the regulation of innate immune responses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA complete genome sequence and the advent of genome editing open up non-traditional model organisms to mechanistic genetic studies. The mosquito Aedes aegypti is an important vector of infectious diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, and has a large and complex genome, which has slowed annotation efforts. We used comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of adult gene expression to improve the genome annotation and to provide a detailed tissue-specific catalogue of neural gene expression at different adult behavioral states.\\n\\nResultsWe carried out deep RNA sequencing across all major peripheral male and female sensory tissues, the brain, and (female) ovary. Furthermore, we examined gene expression across three important phases of the female reproductive cycle, a remarkable example of behavioral switching in which a female mosquito alternates between obtaining blood-meals from humans and laying eggs. Using genome-guided alignments and de novo transcriptome assembly, our re-annotation includes 572 new putative protein-coding genes and updates to 13.5% and 50.3% of existing transcripts within coding sequences and untranslated regions, respectively. Using this updated annotation, we detail gene expression in each tissue, identifying large numbers of transcripts regulated by blood-feeding and sexually dimorphic transcripts that may provide clues to the biology of male- and female-specific behaviors, such as mating and blood-feeding, which are areas of intensive study for those interested in vector control.\\n\\nConclusionsThis neurotranscriptome forms a strong foundation for the study of genes in the mosquito nervous system and investigation of sensory-driven behaviors and their regulation. Furthermore, understanding the molecular genetic basis of mosquito chemosensory behavior has important implications for vector control.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated the profiling of large panels of cancer cell lines with responses measured for thousands of drugs. The computational challenge is now to realize the potential of these data in predicting patients responses to these drugs in the clinic.\\n\\nMethodsWe address this issue by examining the spectrum of prediction models of patient response: models predicting directly from cell lines, those predicting directly from patients, and those trained on cell lines and patients at the same time. We tested 21 classification models on four drugs, that are bortezomib, erlotinib, docetaxel and epirubicin, for which clinical trial data were available.\\n\\nResultsOur integrative models consistently outperform cell line-based predictors, indicating that there are limitations to the predictive potential of in vitro data alone. Furthermore, these integrative models achieve better predictive accuracy and require substantially fewer patients than would be the case if only patient data were available.\\n\\nConclusionsThe integration of in vitro and ex vivo genomic data results in more accurate predictors using only a fraction of the patient information, which can help optimize the development of personalized predictors of therapy response. Altogether our results support the relevance of preclinical data for therapy prediction in clinical trials, enabling more efficient and cost-effective trial design.",
