    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe NOD mouse is a polygenic model for type 1 diabetes that is characterized by insulitis, a leukocytic infiltration of the pancreatic islets. During ~35 years since the original inbred strain was developed in Japan, NOD substrains have been established at different laboratories around the world. Although environmental differences among NOD colonies capable of impacting diabetes incidence have been recognized, differences arising from genetic divergence have not previously been analyzed. We use both Mouse Diversity Array and Whole Exome Capture Sequencing platforms to identify genetic differences distinguishing 5 NOD substrains. We describe 64 SNPs, and 2 short indels that differ in coding regions of the 5 NOD substrains. A 100 kb deletion on Chromosome 3 distinguishes NOD/ShiLtJ and NOD/ShiLtDvs from 3 other substrains, while a 111 kb deletion in the Icam2 gene on Chromosome 11 is unique to the NOD/ShiLtDvs genome. The extent of genetic divergence for NOD substrains is compared to similar studies for C57BL6 and BALB/c substrains. As mutations are fixed to homozygosity by continued inbreeding, significant differences in substrain phenotypes are to be expected. These results emphasize the importance of using embryo freezing methods to minimize genetic drift within substrains and of applying appropriate genetic nomenclature to permit substrain recognition when one is used.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA common belief among human life history researchers is that \\\"harsher\\\" environments - i.e., those with higher mortality rates and resource stress - select for \\\"fast\\\" life histories, i.e. earlier reproduction and faster senescence. I show that these \\\"harsh environments, fast life histories\\\" - or HEFLH - hypotheses are poorly supported by evolutionary theory. First, I use a simple model to show that effects of environmental harshness on life history evolution are incredibly diverse. In particular, small changes in basic but poorly understood variables - e.g., whether and how population density affects vital rates - can cause selection to favor very different life histories. Furthermore, I show that almost all life history theory used to justify HEFLH hypotheses is misapplied in the first place. The reason is that HEFLH hypotheses usually treat plastic responses to heterogeneous environmental conditions within a population, whereas the theory used to justify such hypotheses treat genetic responses to environmental changes across an entire population. Counter-intuitively, the predictions of the former do not generally apply to the latter: the optimal response to a harsh environment within a large heterogeneous environment is not necessarily the optimal strategy of a population uniformly inhabiting the same harsh environment. I discuss these theoretical results in light of the current state of empirical research.",

    "abstract": "A nanopore-based approach to peptide sequencing without labels or immobilization is considered. It is based on a tandem cell (RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 167-171) with the structure [cis1, upstream pore (UNP), trans1/cis2, downstream pore (DNP), trans2]. An amino or carboxyl exopeptidase attached to the downstream side of UNP cleaves successive leading residues in a peptide threading from cis1 through UNP. A cleaved residue translocates to and through DNP where it is identified. A Fokker-Planck model is used to compute translocation statistics for each amino acid type. Multiple discriminators, including a variant of the current blockade level and translocation times through trans1/cis2 and DNP, identify a residue. Calculations show the 20 amino acids to be grouped by charge (+, -, neutral) and ordered within each group (which makes error correction easier). The minimum cleaving interval required of the exopeptidase, the sample size (number of copies of the peptide to sequence or runs with one copy) to identify a residue with a given confidence level, and confidence levels for a given sample size are calculated. The results suggest that if the exopeptidase cleaves each and every residue and does so in a reasonable time, peptide sequencing with acceptable (and correctable) errors may be feasible. If validated experimentally the proposed device could be an alternative to mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis. Implementation-related issues are discussed.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome-wide association studies have been conducted in inbred populations where the sample size is small. The ordinary association p-values and multiple testing correction therefore become questionable, as the detected genetic effect may or may not be due to chance, depending on the minor allele frequency distribution across the genome. Instead of permutation testing, marker-specific false positive rate can be analytically calculated in inbred populations without heterozygotes.\\n\\nResultsSolutions of exact p-values for genome-wide association studies in inbred populations were derived and implemented. An example is presented to illustrate that the marker-specific experiment-wise p-value varies as the genome-wide minor allele frequency distribution changes. A simulation using real Arabidopsis thaliana genome indicates that the use of exact p-values improves detection power and reduces inflation due to population structure. An analysis of a defense-related case-control phenotype using the exact p-values revealed the causal locus, where markers with higher MAFs had smaller p-values than the top variants with lower MAFs in ordinary genome-wide association analysis.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationProject URL: https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/statomics/.

    "abstract": "The palmaris longus muscle is widely recognized for its notable variability in living humans. These variations include not only muscle belly reversal, distinct double muscle bellies, duplication and triplication, but also total uni-or bilateral agenesis (absence). A review of the literature and data novel to this study illustrate that different populations of humans exhibit remarkable variation in the frequency of palmaris longus agenesis, from less than 5% of Chinese to nearly 65% of Indians. Comparative dissection-derived data reveal substantial variation in palmaris longus agenesis (PLA) in populations of extant humans (H. sapiens), chimpanzees (Pan spp.), and gorillas (Gorilla spp.) - but not orangutans (Pongo spp.), which apparently always develop this muscle. From this pattern, we infer that palmaris longus is undergoing non-adaptive, stochastic evolution in the extant African Homininae, while it continues to have adaptive purpose in Pongo, likely due to the orangutans greater degree of arboreality than the African apes and humans. Clinical evidence supports this conclusion, at least as it applies to humans. This study highlights the utility of comparative soft tissue data collection and interpretation in elucidating the evolution of anatomical structures that do not fossilize.",

    "abstract": "The movement of transposable elements from place to place in a genome requires both element-encoded and host-encoded factors. In DNA cut & paste transposition, the element-encoded transposase performs the DNA breakage and joining reactions that excise the element from the donor site and integrate it into the new insertion site. Host factors can influence many aspects of transposition. Notably, host DNA repair factors mediate the regeneration of intact duplex DNA necessary after transposase action by repairing the double strand break in the broken donor backbone, from which the transposon has excised, and repairing the single strand gaps that flank the newly inserted transposon. We have exploited the ability of the mammalian transposon piggyBat, a member of the piggyBac superfamily, to transpose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and used the yeast single gene deletion collection to screen for genes encoding host factors involved in piggyBat transposition. piggyBac transposition is distinguished by the fact that piggyBac elements insert into TTAA target sites and also that the donor backbone is restored to its pre-transposon sequence after transposon excision, that is, excision is precise. We have found that repair of the broken donor backbone requires the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway (NHEJ). By contrast, NHEJ is not required for DNA repair at the new insertion site. Thus multiple DNA repair pathways are required for piggyBac transposition.",

    "abstract": "Perception and transduction of temperature changes result in altered growth enabling plants to adapt to increased ambient temperature. While PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) has been identified as a major ambient temperature signaling hub, its upstream regulation seems complex and is poorly understood. Here, we exploited natural variation for thermo-responsive growth in Arabidopsis thaliana using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. We identified GIRAFFE2.1, a major QTL explaining ~18% of the phenotypic variation for temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation in the Bay-0 x Sha recombinant inbred line population. Transgenic complementation demonstrated that allelic variation in the circadian clock regulator EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) is underlying this QTL. The source of variation could be allocated to a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ELF3 coding region, resulting in differential expression of PIF4 and its target genes, likely causing the observed natural variation in thermo-responsive growth. In combination with other recent studies, this work establishes the role of ELF3 in the ambient temperature signaling network. Natural variation of ELF3-mediated gating of PIF4 expression during nightly growing periods seems to be affected by a coding sequence quantitative trait nucleotide that confers a selective advantage in certain environments. In addition, natural ELF3 alleles seem to differentially integrate temperature and photoperiod cues to induce architectural changes. Thus, ELF3 emerges as an essential coordinator of growth and development in response to diverse environmental cues and implicates ELF3 as an important target of adaptation.",
