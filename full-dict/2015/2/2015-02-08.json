    "abstract": "Prostate cancer exhibits high mathematical complexity due to the disruption of tissue architecture. An important part of the diagnostic of prostate tumor samples is the histological evaluation of cellular and glandular organization. The Gleason grade and score, a commonly used prognostic indicator of patient outcome, is based on the match of glandular architectural patterns with standard patterns. Unfortunately, the subjective nature of visual grading leads to variations in scoring by different pathologists. We proposed the fractal dimension of the lumen and the Lempel-Zip complexity of the histopathological patterns as useful descriptors aiding pathologist to standardize histological classification and thus prognosis and therapy planning.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIgeometrical complexity of prostate cancer\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We engineered a transdermal neuromodulation approach that targets peripheral (cranial and spinal) nerves and utilizes their afferent pathways as signaling conduits to influence brain function. We investigated the effects of this transdermal electrical neurosignaling (TEN) method on sympathetic physiology in human volunteers under different experimental conditions. In all cases, the TEN involved delivering high-frequency pulsed electrical currents to ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the right trigeminal nerve (V1/V2) and cervical spinal nerve afferents (C2/C3). Under resting conditions when subjects were not challenged or presented with environmental stimuli, TEN significantly suppressed basal sympathetic tone compared to sham as indicated by functional infrared thermography of facial temperatures. In a different experiment conducted under similar resting conditions, subjects treated with TEN reported significantly lower levels of tension and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States scale compared to sham. In a third experiment when subjects were experimentally stressed by a classical fear conditioning paradigm and a series of time-constrained cognitive tasks, TEN produced a significant suppression of heart rate variability, galvanic skin conductance, and salivary -amylase levels compared to sham. Collectively these observations demonstrate TEN can dampen basal sympathetic tone and attenuate sympathetic activity in response to acute stress induction. Our physiological and biochemical observations are consistent with the hypothesis that TEN modulates noradrenergic signaling to suppress sympathetic activity. We conclude that dampening sympathetic activity in such a manner represents a promising approach to managing daily stress.",
