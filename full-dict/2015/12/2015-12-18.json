    "abstract": "Background: The human genome contains variants ranging in size from small single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to large structural variants (SVs). High-quality benchmark small variant calls for the pilot National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Reference Material (NA12878) have been developed by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, but no similar high-quality benchmark SV calls exist for this genome. Since SV callers output highly discordant results, we developed methods to combine multiple forms of evidence from multiple sequencing technologies to classify candidate SVs into likely true or false positives. Our method (svclassify) calculates annotations from one or more aligned bam files from many high-throughput sequencing technologies, and then builds a one-class model using these annotations to classify candidate SVs as likely true or false positives.\\n\\nResults: We first used pedigree analysis to develop a set of high-confidence breakpoint-resolved large deletions. We then used svclassify to cluster and classify these deletions as well as a set of high-confidence deletions from the 1000 Genomes Project and a set of breakpoint-resolved complex insertions from Spiral Genetics. We find that likely SVs cluster separately from likely non-SVs based on our annotations, and that the SVs cluster into different types of deletions. We then developed a supervised one-class classification method that uses a training set of random non-SV regions to determine whether candidate SVs have abnormal annotations different from most of the genome. To test this classification method, we use our pedigree-based breakpoint-resolved SVs, SVs validated by the 1000 Genomes Project, and assembly-based breakpoint-resolved insertions, along with semi-automated visualization using svviz.\\n\\nConclusions: We find that candidate SVs with high scores from multiple technologies have high concordance with PCR validation and an orthogonal consensus method MetaSV (99.7% concordant), and candidate SVs with low scores are questionable. We distribute a set of 2676 high-confidence deletions and 68 high-confidence insertions with high svclassify scores from these call sets for benchmarking SV callers. We expect these methods to be particularly useful for establishing high-confidence SV calls for benchmark samples that have been characterized by multiple technologies.",

    "abstract": "Rodent defense behavior assays have been widely used as preclinical models of anxiety to study possibly therapeutic anxiety-reducing interventions. However, some proposed anxiety-modulating factors--genes, drugs and stressors--have had discordant effects across different studies. To reconcile the effect sizes of purported anxiety factors, we conducted systematic review and meta-analyses of the literature on ten anxiety-linked interventions, as examined in the elevated plus maze, open field and light-dark box assays. Diazepam, 5-HT1A receptor gene knockout and overexpression, SERT gene knockout and overexpression, pain, restraint, social isolation, corticotropin-releasing hormone and Crhr1 were selected for review. Eight interventions had statistically significant effects on rodent anxiety, while Htr1a overexpression and Crh knockout did not. Evidence for publication bias was found in the diazepam, Htt knockout, and social isolation literatures. The Htr1a and Crhr1 results indicate a disconnect between preclinical science and clinical research. Furthermore, the meta-analytic data confirmed that genetic SERT anxiety effects were paradoxical in the context of the clinical use of SERT inhibitors to reduce anxiety.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMeta-analysis shows eight rodent anxiety factors have at least moderate effects.\\nC_LIO_LIPublication bias affects four of the anxiety interventions.\\nC_LIO_LIPreclinical rodent anxiety results appear disconnected from clinical efforts.\\nC_LIO_LISerotonin transporter gene lesion effects are paradoxical with reuptake inhibitors clinical use.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent work has leveraged the extensive genotyping of the Icelandic population to perform long-range phasing (LRP), enabling accurate imputation and association analysis of rare variants in target samples typed on genotyping arrays. Here, we develop a fast and accurate LRP method, Eagle, that extends this paradigm to populations with much smaller proportions of genotyped samples by harnessing long (>4cM) identical-by-descent (IBD) tracts shared among distantly related individuals. We applied Eagle to N=150K samples (0.2% of the British population) from the UK Biobank, and we determined that it is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing methods while achieving similar or better phasing accuracy (switch error rate {approx}0.3%, corresponding to perfect phase in most 10Mb segments). We also observed that when used within an imputation pipeline, Eagle pre-phasing improved downstream imputation accuracy compared to pre-phasing in batches using existing methods (as necessary to achieve comparable computational cost).",

    "abstract": "The constantly decreasing cost and increasing out-put of current sequencing technologies enable large scale metagenomic studies of microbial communities from diverse habitats. Therefore, fast and accurate methods for taxonomic classification are needed, which can operate on increasingly larger datasets and reference databases. Recently, several fast metagenomic classifiers have been developed, which are based on comparison of genomic k-mers. However, nucleotide comparison using a fixed k-mer length often lacks the sensitivity to overcome the evolutionary distance between sampled species and genomes in the reference database. Here, we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju for fast assignment of reads to taxa. Kaiju finds maximum exact matches on the protein-level using the Borrows-Wheeler transform, and can optionally allow amino acid substitutions in the search using a greedy heuristic. We show in a genome exclusion study that Kaiju can classify more reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared to fast k-mer based classifiers, especially in genera that are underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that Kaiju classifies more than twice as many reads in ten real metagenomes compared to programs based on genomic k-mers. Kaiju can process up to millions of reads per minute, and its memory footprint is below 6 GB of RAM, allowing the analysis on a standard PC.

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered as a major source of innovation in bacteria, and as such is expected to drive adaptation to new ecological niches. However, among the many genes acquired through HGT along the diversification history of genomes, only a fraction may have actively contributed to sustained ecological adaptation. We used a phylogenetic approach accounting for the transfer of genes (or groups of genes) to estimate the history of genomes in Agrobacterium biovar 1, a diverse group of soil and plant-dwelling bacterial species. We identified clade-specific blocks of co-transferred genes encoding coherent biochemical pathways that may have contributed to the evolutionary success of key Agrobacterium clades. This pattern of gene co-evolution rejects a neutral model of transfer, in which neighbouring genes would be transferred independently of their function and rather suggests purifying selection on collectively coded acquired pathways. The acquisition of these synapomorphic blocks of co-functioning genes probably drove the ecological diversification of Agrobacterium and defined features of ancestral ecological niches, which consistently hint at a strong selective role of host plant rhizospheres.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) has a complex developmental course over childhood and adolescence. Patients with RTT often have a pre-symptomatic period with no or little outward signs of the disorder, followed by developmental arrest and regression. Following regression, the individuals condition is not static, as they often progress into defined stages with unique neurological symptoms. Similarly, the progression of RTT-like symptoms in female mice heterozygous for a null-mutation has a prodromal and symptomatic period. Change in functional local circuit connectivity was studied using hippocampal slices, assaying Schaffer evoked activity in area CA1 using fast voltage sensitive dye imaging. With this technique the local functional interactions between the excitatory and inhibitory components of the circuit can be characterized. The prodromal period was associated with a shift in extent of excitation into the stratum oriens of the hippocampus and reduced sensitivity to changes in divalent cation concentration. These data suggest that hyperexcitability of the hippocampus at the circuit level may contribute to the prodromal reduction in cognitive performance and the onset of developmental regression.",

    "abstract": "Octopamine is known to have an appetitive role in odor conditioning paradigms in Drosophila melanogaster. We wanted to test whether octopamine could also act as an appetitive stimulus in courtship conditioning, a paradigm in which training with an unreceptive female (such as a decapitated virgin) causes a subsequent decrease in courtship behavior in male Drosophila. To control octopamine release, we used the Tdc2-Gal4 and UAS-dTRPa1 genes in conjunction to depolarize octopaminergic neurons at 27 C in experimental flies. We hypothesized that inducing octopamine release during courtship training would decrease the aversive impact of training and cause less subsequent suppression of courtship behavior. Our findings confirmed this hypothesis: Tdc2-Gal4/UAS-dTRPa1 flies trained at 27 degrees showed significantly more courtship behavior than controls during testing, and in fact showed no significant effect of courtship training. This confirms that octopamine release counteracts the aversive stimulus of failure to copulate, indicating that octopamine may have an appetitive role in courtship.",

    "abstract": "The certainty that a species is accurately identified is the cornerstone of appearance based classification; however the methods used in classical taxonomy have yet to fully catch up with the digital age. Recognising this, the CO1 algorithm presented on the StripeSpotter platform was used to identify different species and sexes of mosquito wings (Diptera: Culicidae) and honey bee and bumblebee wings (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Images of different species of mosquito and bee wings were uploaded onto the CO1 database and test wing images were analysed to determine if this resulted in the correct species being identified. Out of a database containing 925 mosquito and bee wing images, the CO1 algorithm correctly identified species and sexes of test wing image presented, with a high degree of accuracy (80% to 100% depending on the species and database used, excluding sibling species) highlighting the usefulness of CO1 in identifying medically important as well as beneficial insect species. Using a larger database of wing images resulted in significantly higher numbers of test images being correctly identified than using a smaller database. The hind wings of Hymenoptera provided higher levels of correctly identified results than using the fore wings. The software should be used in conjunction with other identifying criteria (salient morphological features) in addition to the wings. CO1 is a powerful algorithm to use in identifying insect wings in its current form and has great potential if it is adapted and tailored for insect species identification. It is suggested that a primary aim in the digital age should be the production of a  World Wide Database of insect images, where all known insect images can be made available to everyone, with image recognition and species knowledge at its core.",

    "abstract": "The plant hormone auxin is perceived by a family of F-box proteins called the TIR1/AFBs. Phylogenetic studies reveal that these proteins fall into four clades in flowering plants called TIR1, AFB2, AFB4, and AFB6 (Parry et al. 2009). Genetic studies indicate that members of the TIR1 and AFB2 groups act as positive regulators of auxin signaling by promoting the degradation of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors (Dharmasiri et al. 2005; Parry et al. 2009). In this report, we demonstrate that both AFB4 and AFB5 also function as auxin receptors based on in vitro assays. We also provide genetic evidence that both AFB4 and AFB5 are targets of the picloram family of auxinic herbicides. In contrast to previous studies we find that null afb4 alleles do not exhibit obvious defects in seedling morphology or auxin hypersensitivity. We conclude that AFB4 and AFB5 act in a similar fashion to other members of the family but exhibit a distinct auxin specificity.",
