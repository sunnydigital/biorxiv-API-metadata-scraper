    "abstract": "Molecular simulations intended to compute equilibrium properties are often initiated from configurations that are highly atypical of equilibrium samples, a practice which can generate a distinct initial transient in mechanical observables computed from the simulation trajectory. Traditional practice in simulation data analysis recommends this initial portion be discarded to equilibration, but no simple, general, and automated procedure for this process exists. Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest, in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure, and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification related to a variety of diseases including cancers. We focus on the methylation data from Illuminas Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. One of the key issues of methylation analysis is to detect the differential methylation sites between case and control groups. Previous approaches describe data with simple summary statistics and kernel function, and then use statistical tests to determine the difference. However, a summary statistics-based approach cannot capture complicated underlying structure, and a kernel functions-based approach lacks interpretability of results.\\n\\nResults: We propose a novel method D3M, for detection of differential distribution of methylation, based on distribution-valued data. Our method can detect high-order moments, such as shapes of underlying distributions in methylation profiles, based on the Wasserstein metric. We test the significance of the difference between case and control groups and provide an interpretable summary of the results. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves promising accuracy and shows favorable results compared with previous methods. Glioblastoma multiforme and lower grade glioma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas show that our method supports recent biological advances and suggests new insights.\\n\\nAvailability: R implemented code is freely available from\\n\\nhttps://github.com/ymatts/D3M/\\n\\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/package=D3M.\\n\\nContact: ymatsui@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp",

    "abstract": "Herbivore induced defences are robust, evolve rapidly and activated in plants when specific elicitors, frequently found in the herbivores oral secretions (OS) are introduced into wounds during attack. How these complex induced defences evolve remains unclear. Here, we show that herbivore-induced transcriptomic responses in a wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, display an evolutionary hourglass: the pattern that characterises the transcriptomic evolution of embryogenesis in animals, plants, and fungi. While relatively young and rapidly evolving genes involved in signal perception and processing to regulate defence metabolite biosynthesis are recruited both early (1 h) and late (9-21 h) in the defence elicitation process, a group of highly conserved and older genes involved in transcriptomic regulation are activated in the middle stage (5 h). The appearance of the evolutionary hourglass architecture in both developmental and defence elicitation processes may reflect the importance of robustness and evolvability in the signalling of these important biological processes.",

Here we analyze the organization of interneurons in the CA1 area, using the combinatorial patterns of gene expression revealed by single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This analysis reveals a 5-level hierarchy of cell classes. Most of the predicted classes correspond closely to known interneuron types, allowing us to predict a large number of novel molecular markers of these classes. In addition we identified a major new interneuron population localized at the border of strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare that we term \\\"R2C2 cells\\\" after their characteristic combinatorial expression of Rgs12, Reln, Cxcl14, and Cpne5. Several predictions of this classification scheme were verified using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, providing further confidence in the gene expression patterns and novel classes predicted by the single cell data.",

Our contributions are threefold: first, we benchmark two approaches to generate targets for ANN training on an example dataset; second, we investigate many different ANN models to identify the ones with best predictions on chromatin states; third, we test different hyper-parameters and discuss how they affect the machine learning algorithms performance.

    "abstract": "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.",

It is not entirely clear how the scale and physical heterogeneity of surrounding catchment, its ecological composition, and larger landscape gradients work together to sustain littoral communities.\\n\\nA total of 114 alpine lakes in the central Pyrenees were surveyed to evaluate the functional connectivity between catchment physical and ecological elements and littoral zoobenthos, and ascertain their effect on community formation. At each lake, the zoobenthic composition was assessed together with geolocation (altitude, latitude and longitude), catchment hydrodynamics, geomorphology, topography, riparian vegetation composition, the presence of trout and frogs, water pH and conductivity.\\n\\nUni- and multidimensional fuzzy set ordination models integrating benthic biota and environmental variables revealed that at geographical scale longitude surpassed altitude in its effect on littoral ecosystem, reflecting a sharp transition between Atlantic and Mediterranean bioregions. Topography (through its control of catchment type, summer snow coverage, and connectivity with other lakes) was the largest catchment-scale driver, followed by hydrodynamics (waterbody size, type and inflow/outflow volumes). Locally, riparian plant composition significantly related to littoral community structure, richness and morphotype diversity. These variables, directly and indirectly create habitats for aquatic and terrestrial stages of invertebrates, and control nutrient and water cycles. Three ecologically diverse associations characterised distinct lake sets. Vertebrate predation, water conductivity and pH (broad measures of total dissolved ions/nutrients and their bioavailability) had no major influence on littoral taxa.\\n\\nThe work provides exhaustive information from relatively pristine sites, which unveil a strong connection between littoral ecosystem and catchment heterogeneity at scales beyond the local environment. This underpins their role as sensors of local and large-scale environmental changes, and can be used to evaluate further impacts.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to temporally fluctuating environments can be achieved through evolution of fixed genetic effects, by phenotypic plasticity (either developmental plasticity or trans-generational plasticity), or by randomizing offspring phenotypes (often called diversifying bet-hedging). Theory has long held that plasticity can evolve when information about the future environment is reliable while bet-hedging can evolve when mixtures of phenotypes have high average fitness (leading to low among generation variance in fitness). To date, no study has studied the evolutionary routes that lead to the evolution of randomized offspring phenotypes on the one hand or deterministic maternal effects on the other. We develop simple, yet general, models of the evolution of maternal effects and are able to directly compare selection for deterministic and randomizing maternal effects and can also incorporate the notion of differential maternal costs of producing offspring with alternative phenotypes. We find that only a small set of parameters allow bet hedging type strategies to outcompete deterministic maternal effects. Not only must there be little or no informative cues available, but also the frequency with which different environments are present must fall within a narrow range. By contrast, when we consider the joint evolution of the maternal strategy and the set of offspring phenotypes we find that deterministic maternal effects can always invade the ancestral state (lacking any form of maternal effect). The long-term ESS may, however, involve some form of offspring randomization, but only if the phenotypes evolve extreme differences in environment-specific fitness. Overall we conclude that deterministic maternal effects are much more likely to evolve than offspring randomization, and offspring randomization will only be maintained if it results in extreme differences in environment-specific fitness.",

    "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate about whether face recognition and object recognition constitute separate domains. Clarification of this issue can have important theoretical implications as face recognition is often used as a prime example of domain-specificity in mind and brain. An important source of input to this debate comes from studies of individuals with developmental prosopagnosia, suggesting that face recognition can be selectively impaired. We put the selectivity-hypothesis to test by assessing the performance of 10 subjects with developmental prosopagnosia on demanding tests of visual object processing involving both regular and degraded drawings. None of the individuals exhibited a dissociation between face and object recognition, and as a group they were significantly more affected by degradation of objects than control participants. Importantly, we also find positive correlations between the severity of the face recognition impairment and the degree of impaired performance with degraded objects. This suggests that the face and object deficits are systematically related rather than coincidental. We conclude that at present, there is no strong evidence in the literature on developmental prosopagnosia supporting domain-specific accounts of face recognition.",

Our objective in the current study was to understand the relationship between schizophrenia genetic risk variants and neurocognitive development in healthy individuals. We first used combined genomic and neurocognitive data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; 4303 participants ages 8 - 21 years) to screen 26 neurocognitive phenotypes for their association with schizophrenia polygenic risk.\\n\\nSchizophrenia polygenic risk was estimated for each participant based on summary statistics from the most recent schizophrenia genome-wide association analysis (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 2014). After correction for multiple comparisons, greater schizophrenia polygenic risk was significantly associated with reduced speed of emotion identification and verbal reasoning. These associations were significant by age 9 and there was no evidence of interaction between schizophrenia polygenic risk and age on neurocognitive performance. We then looked at the association between schizophrenia polygenic risk and emotion identification speed in the Harvard / MGH Brain Genomics Superstruct Project sample (GSP; 695 participants age 18-35 years), where we replicated the association between schizophrenia polygenic risk and emotion identification speed. These analyses provide evidence for a replicable association between polygenic risk for schizophrenia and specific aspects of neurocognitive performance. Our findings indicate that individual differences in genetic risk for schizophrenia are linked with the development of social cognition and potentially verbal reasoning, and that these associations emerge relatively early in development.",

Three subgroups comprising 42-65% of ASC adults show evidence for large impairments (Cohens d = -1.03 to -11.21), while other subgroups are effectively unimpaired.
