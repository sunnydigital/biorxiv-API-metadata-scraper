    "abstract": "One of surprising recent discoveries in biology is that the gene and protein expression profiles in cells with identical genetic and environmental makeup can exhibit large variability. The nature and the significance of this variability had been posed as one of the current fundamental questions of biology. In this letter, we argue that the observed variability in cellular gene and protein expression can be understood as an outcome of homeostatic regulation mechanisms controlling the gene and protein expression profiles.",

    "abstract": "This is a review. Non-electrolytic compounds typically cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. The rate of permeation is dependent on the chemical properties of the solute and the composition of the lipid bilayer membrane. Predicting the permeability coefficient of a solute is important in pharmaceutical chemistry and toxicology. Molecular simulation has proven to be a valuable tool for modeling permeation of solutes through a lipid bilayer. In particular, the solubility-diffusion model has allowed for the quantitative calculation of permeability coefficients. The underlying theory and computational methods used to calculate membrane permeability are reviewed. We also discuss applications of these methods to examine the permeability of solutes and the effect of membrane composition on permeability. The application of coarse grain and polarizable models is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Histone H2B monoubiquitylation (H2Bub1) is localized preferentially to transcribed regions of genes and spreads concomitantly with the progression of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In mammalian cells, H2Bub1 levels are highly correlated with transcription elongation rates, consistent with the general belief that H2Bub1 facilitates the elongation process. Yet, a causative role of H2Bub1 in regulating elongation rates within live cells remains to be proven. Using our recently developed 4sUDRB-seq method, we examined the impact of H2Bub1 downregulation, through silencing of its cognate E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20, on genomewide transcription elongation rates. Surprisingly, H2Bub1 downregulation had no measurable effect on global elongation rates. Instead, it led to upregulation of over 1,000 genes by altering their Pol II pause release times; notably, those genes are characterized by the presence of H2Bub1 in relatively close proximity to the paused Pol II. Conversely, another set of genes was downregulated upon partial H2Bub1 depletion, and in those genes H2Bub1 appeared to be required for efficient recruitment of Pol II to the promoter region. Overall, our data shed new light on the molecular mechanisms by which H2Bub1 regulates gene expression and imply that the role of H2Bub1 in transcription elongation should be reconsidered.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTranscription elongation is an important component of the gene expression process. Numerous factors and chromatin modifications, including some that are misregulated in various human diseases, have been suggested to regulate transcription elongation. New methods to measure genomewide transcription elongation rates now enable, for the first time, to determine how a specific factor affects transcription elongation and what is the outcome of its misregulation. Using such method, we examined the role of one specific chromatin modification, histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), in regulating transcription. Strikingly, although H2Bub1 is widely believed to serve as a regulator of transcription elongation, its downregulation did not affect genomewide elongation rates. Instead, we found that H2Bub1 regulates the expression of distinct subsets of genes by either promoting recruitment of the transcription machinery or, conversely, favoring the pausing of this machinery shortly after initiation of transcription. Our findings demonstrate that the use of genomewide elongation rate measurements can redefine the true roles of putative transcription elongation factors. Furthermore, they provide a new understanding of the functions of H2Bub1 and its impact on gene expression patterns, which is of particular interest because H2Bub1 is often downregulated in human cancer.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe open source environment R is one of the most widely used software for statistical computing. It provides a variety of applications including statistical genetics. Most of the powerful tools for quantitative genetic analyses are stand-alone free programs developed by researchers in academia. SOLAR is the standard software program to perform linkage and association mappings of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity. solarius allows the user to exploit the variance component methods implemented in SOLAR. It automates such routine operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype data. It also parses the model output and contains summary and plotting functions for exploration of the results. In addition, solarius enables parallel computing of the linkage and association analyses, that makes the calculation of genome-wide scans more efficient.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationsolarius is available on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=solarius and on GitHub https://github.com/ugcd/solarius.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are routinely visualized to present and interpret the evolutionary relationships of species. Virtually all empirical evolutionary data studies contain a visualization of the inferred tree with branch support values. Ambiguous semantics in tree file formats can lead to erroneous tree visualizations and therefore to incorrect interpretations of phylogenetic analyses.\\n\\nHere, we discuss problems that can and do arise when displaying branch values on trees after re-rooting. Branch values are typically stored as node labels in the widely-used Newick tree format. However, such values are attributes of branches. Storing them as node labels can therefore yield errors when re-rooting trees. This depends on the mostly implicit semantics that tools deploy to interpret node labels.\\n\\nWe reviewed 10 tree viewers and 10 bioinformatics toolkits that can display and re-root trees. We found that 14 out of 20 of these tools do not permit users to select the semantics of node labels. Thus, unaware users might obtain incorrect results when rooting trees inferred by common phylogenetic inference programs. We illustrate such incorrect mappings for several test cases and real examples taken from the literature. This review has already led to improvements and workarounds in 8 of the tested tools. We suggest tools should provide an option that explicitly forces users to define the semantics of node labels.",

    "abstract": "Molecular biology increasingly relies on large screens where enormous numbers of specimens are systematically assayed in the search for a particular, rare outcome. These screens include the systematic testing of small molecules for potential drugs and testing the association between genetic variation and a phenotype of interest. While these screens are \\\"hypothesis-free,\\\" they can be wasteful; pooling the specimens and then testing the pools is more efficient. We articulate in precise mathematical ways the type of structures useful in combinatorial pooling designs so as to eliminate waste, to provide light weight, flexible, and modular designs. We show that Reed-Solomon codes, and more generally linear codes, satisfy all of these mathematical properties. We further demonstrate the power of this technique with Reed-Solomonbased biological experiments. We provide general purpose tools for experimentalists to construct and carry out practical pooling designs with rigorous guarantees for large screens.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication was proposed by S.Ohno (1) as a key mechanism of a novel gene function evolution. A pair of gene paralogs, NTNG1 and NTNG2, sharing identical gene and protein structures and encoding similar proteins, forms a functional complement subfunctionalising (SF) within cognitive domains and forming cognitive endophenotypes, as detected by Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests (2). Both NTNG paralogs are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), with unique nonoverlapping segregation among the other 15 cognitive disorders (CD), emphasizing an evolutionary gain-dependent link between advanced cognitive functions and concomitant neurocognitive pathologies. Complementary expression and human brain transcriptome composition of the paralogs explains the observed phenomena of their functional complementarity. The lowest identity among NTNGs is found in a middle of encoded by them proteins designated as uknown (Ukd) domain. NTNG1 contains anthropoid-specific constrained regions, and both genes contain non-coding conserved sequences underwent accelerated evolution in human. NTNG paralogs SF perturbates \\\"structure drives function\\\" concept at protein and gene levels. The paralogs function diversification forms a so-called \\\"Cognitive Complement (CC)\\\", a product of gene duplication and subsequent cognitive subfunction bifurcation among the NTNG gene duplicates.",

    "abstract": "A pair of vertebrate-specific and brain-expressed pre-synaptic genes, NTNG1 and NTNG2, contributes to the Intellectual Quotient (IQ) test scores in a complementary manner. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NTNG1 are associated with attenuated verbal comprehension (VC) or processing speed (PS) while NTNG2 SNPs affect working memory (WM) and perceptual organization (PO), forming cognitive endophenotypes in healthy and schizophrenia (SCZ)-affected human subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs), defined as 21 nucleotide (nu) long NTNG gene loci symmetrically embedding the IQ-affecting mutation alleles (VC/PS and WM/PO), underwent dramatic evolutionary changes from mice through primates to hominins, at the accelerated rates. Mutation alleles associated with the higher VC and WM IQ scores are found in the genomes of extinct hominins of Neolithic times, however, lower WM scores associated allele is also detectable in Mesolithic hunters genomes. Protein sequence of NTNG1 is 100% conserved among the primates, archaic and modern extinct hominins while NTNG2 underwent a recent selection sweep encoding a primate-specific S371A/V (~50,000 yrs BC), and a modern human (5,300 yrs BC) T346A substitutions. We show that a 500 mln yrs old genomic duplication of a synapse primordial gene provided a substrate for further synapse elaborations and its ultimate capacitive expansion of what evolved into a vertebrate cognitive superior complexity - intelligence.",
