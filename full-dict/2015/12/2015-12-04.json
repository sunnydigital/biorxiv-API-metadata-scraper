    "abstract": "RNA-Seq and gene expression microarrays provide comprehensive profiles of gene activity, but lack of reproducibility has hindered their application. A key challenge in the data analysis is the normalization of gene expression levels, which is currently performed following an implicit assumption that most genes are not differentially expressed. Here, we present a mathematical approach to normalization that makes no assumption of this sort. We have found that variation in gene expression is much greater than currently believed, and that it can be measured with available technologies. Our results also explain, at least partially, the problems encountered in transcriptomics studies. We expect this improvement in detection to help efforts to realize the full potential of gene expression profiling, especially in analyses of cellular processes involving complex modulations of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing problem is how memories can be stored for very long times despite the volatility of the underlying neural substrate, most notably the high turnover of dendritic spines and synapses. To address this problem, here we are using a generic and simple probabilistic model for the creation and removal of synapses. We show that information can be stored for several months when utilizing the intrinsic dynamics of multi-synapse connections. In such systems, single synapses can still show high turnover, which enables fast learning of new information, but this will not perturb prior stored information (slow forgetting), which is represented by the compound state of the connections. The model matches the time course of recent experimental spine data during learning and memory in mice supporting the assumption of multi-synapse connections as the basis for long-term storage.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIt is widely believed that information is stored in the connectivity, i.e. the synapses of neural networks. Yet, the morphological correlates of excitatory synapses, the dendritic spines, have been found to undergo a remarkable turnover on daily basis. This poses the question, how information can be retained on such a variable substrate.\\n\\nIn this study, using connections with multiple synapses, we show that connections which follow the experimentally measured bimodal distribution in the number of synapses can store information orders of magnitude longer than the lifetime of a single synapse. This is a consequence of the underlying bistable collective dynamic of multiple synapses: Single synapses can appear and disappear without disturbing the memory as a whole.\\n\\nFurthermore, increasing or decreasing neural activity changes the distribution of the number of synapses of multi-synaptic connections such that only one of the peaks remains. This leads to a desirable property: information about these altered activities can be stored much faster than it is forgotten. Remarkably, the resulting model dynamics match recent experimental data investigating the long-term effect of learning on the dynamics of dendritic spines.",

    "abstract": "The fossil record is a rich source of information about biological diversity in the past. However, the fossil record is not only incomplete but has inherent biases due to geological, physical, chemical and biological factors. Our knowledge of past life is also biased because of differences in academic and amateur interests and sampling efforts. As a result, not all individuals or species that lived in the past are equally likely to be discovered at any point in time or space. To reconstruct temporal dynamics of diversity using the fossil record, biased sampling must be explicitly taken into account. Here, we introduce an approach that utilizes the variation in the number of times each species is observed in the fossil record to estimate both sampling bias and true richness. We term our technique TRiPS (True Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling model) and explore its robustness to violation of its assumptions via simulations. We then venture to estimate sampling bias and absolute species richness of dinosaurs in the geological stages of the Mesozoic. Using TRiPS, we estimate that 1936 (1543-2468) species of dinosaurs roamed the Earth during the Mesozoic. We also present improved estimates of species richness trajectories of the three major dinosaur clades; the sauropodomorphs, ornithischians and theropods, casting doubt on the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event and demonstrating that all dinosaur groups are subject to considerable sampling bias throughout the Mesozoic.",

De novo motif search is one of the key downstream computational analysis following the ChIP-seq experiments and several algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, most web-based systems do not perform independent filtering or enrichment analyses to ensure the quality of the discovered motifs. Here, we developed a web server Factorbook Motif Pipeline based on an algorithm used in analyzing ENCODE consortium ChIP-seq datasets. It performs comprehensive analysis on the set of peaks detected from a ChIP-seq experiments: (i) de novo motif discovery; (ii) independent composition and bias analyses and (iii) matching to the annotated motifs. The statistical tests employed in our pipeline provide a reliable measure of confidence as to how significant are the motifs reported in the discovery step.\\n\\nAvailabilityFactorbook Motif Pipeline source code is accessible through the following URL. https://github.com/joshuabhk/factorbook-motif-pipeline",

    "abstract": "How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL); however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here, we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of RL. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice, and as such has broad implications for the study of decisions.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of ecological processes into models of trait evolution is important for understanding past drivers of evolutionary change. Species interactions have long been thought to be key drivers of trait evolution. However, models for comparative data that account for interactions between species are lacking. One of the challenges is that such models are intractable and difficult to express analytically. Here we present phylogenetic models of trait evolution that includes interspecific competition amongst species. Competition is modelled as a tendency of sympatric species to evolve towards distinct niches, producing trait overdispersion and high phylogenetic signal. The model predicts elevated trait variance across species and a slowdown in evolutionary rate both across the clade and within each branch. The model also predicts a reduction in correlation between otherwise correlated traits. We used an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to estimate model parameters. We tested the power of the model to detect deviations from Brownian trait evolution using simulations, finding reasonable power to detect competition in sufficiently large (20+ species) trees. We applied the model to examine the evolution of bill morphology of Darwins finches, and found evidence that competition affects the evolution of bill length.",

    "abstract": "Eco-evolutionary dynamics are now recognized to be highly relevant for population and community dynamics. However, the impact of evolutionary dynamics on spatial patterns, such as the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics, is less well appreciated. Here, we analyse the evolutionary consequences of spatial network connectivity and topology for dispersal strategies and quantify the eco-evolutionary feedback in terms of altered classical metapopulation dynamics. We find that network properties, such as topology and connectivity, lead to predictable spatio-temporal correlations in fitness expectations. These spatio-temporally stable fitness patterns heavily impact evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies and lead to eco-evolutionary feedbacks on landscape level metrics, such as the number of occupied patches, the number of extinctions and recolonizations as well as metapopulation extinction risk and genetic structure. Our model predicts that classical metapopulation dynamics are more likely to occur in dendritic networks, and especially in riverine systems, compared to other types of landscape configurations. As it remains debated whether classical metapopulation dynamics are likely to occur in nature at all, our work provides an important conceptual advance for understanding the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics which has implications for conservation and management of spatially structured populations.",

    "abstract": "Cryptic genetic variation (CGV), hidden under most conditions, is the repressed genetic potential that can facilitate adaptation and evolution. The conditional manifestation of CGV has been claimed to explain the background dependence of causal loci as well as missing heritability. However, despite being proposed over 60 years ago, the genetic architecture and regulation of CGV and its contribution towards regulation of complex traits remains unclear. Using linkage mapping of mean and variance effects, we have identified loci that regulate phenotypic manifestation of standing genetic variation in a previously published dataset of biparental Saccharomyces cerevisiae population grown in 34 diverse environments. Based on our results we propose the existence of a gradient of buffering states for a population determined by the environment. Most environments show a tight buffering with additive, independent causal loci with little epistasis. However, as this buffering is disrupted, the underlying highly interconnected environment-specific genetic interactome is revealed such that each causal locus is a part of this network. Interspersed within these networks are generalist capacitors that regulate CGV across multiple environments, with one allele behaving as a capacitor and the other as a potentiator. Our study demonstrates the connecting link between architecture of hidden and visible genetic variation and uncovers the genetic networks which potentially underlie all complex traits. Our study establishes CGV as a significant contributor to phenotypic variation, and provides evidence for a predictable pattern underlying gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that can explain background dependence and missing heritability in complex traits and diseases.\\n\\nSUMMARYThe phenotypic effects of cryptic genetic variation (CGV) are mostly hidden and manifested only under certain rare conditions and have the potential to facilitate adaptation. However, little is understood about its genetic regulation. We performed variance QTL mapping to understand the regulation of phenotypic manifestation of standing genetic variation in a biparental yeast population. We propose a model describing the connecting link between visible variation and CGV. We identify generalist capacitors and environment-specific networks that potentially underlie all phenotypes. This fresh approach of mapping causal loci can solve the long-standing mystery of missing heritability in complex traits and diseases.",

Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance.

Hence, a significant proportion of fetal chromosomal abnormalities are not detectable by current non-invasive methods. Here we report the clinical validation of a novel NIPT designed to detect genome-wide gains and losses of chromosomal material [&ge;]7 Mb and losses associated with specific deletions <7 Mb.\\n\\nObjectiveThe objective of this study is to provide a clinical validation of the sensitivity and specificity of a novel NIPT for detection of genome-wide abnormalities.\\n\\nStudy DesignThis retrospective, blinded study included maternal plasma collected from 1222 study subjects with pregnancies at increased risk for fetal chromosomal abnormalities that were assessed for trisomy 21 (T21), trisomy 18 (T18), trisomy 13 (T13), sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs), fetal sex, genome-wide copy number variants (CNVs) 7 Mb and larger, and select deletions smaller than 7 Mb. Performance was assessed by comparing test results with findings from G-band karyotyping, microarray data, or high coverage sequencing.\\n\\nResultsClinical sensitivity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21, T18, T13, and SCAs, and 97.7% for genome-wide CNVs. Clinical specificity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21, T18, and T13, and 99.9% for SCAs and CNVs. Fetal sex classification had an accuracy of 99.6%.\\n\\nConclusionThis study has demonstrated that genome-wide non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal chromosomal abnormalities can provide high resolution, sensitive, and specific detection of a wide range of sub-chromosomal and whole chromosomal abnormalities that were previously only detectable by invasive karyotype analysis. In some instances, this NIPT also provided additional clarification about the origin of genetic material that had not been identified by invasive karyotype analysis.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern similarity is becoming increasingly popular because it allows one to relate distributed patterns of voxel activity to continuous perceptual and cognitive states of the human brain. Here we show that fMRI pattern similarity estimates are severely affected by temporal pattern drifts in fMRI data - even after voxel-wise detrending. For this particular dataset, the drift effect obscures orientation information as measured by fMRI pattern dissimilarities. We demonstrate that orientation information can be recovered using three different methods: 1. Regressing out the drift component through linear modeling; 2. Computing representational distances between conditions measured in independent imaging runs; 3. Crossvalidation of pattern distance estimates. One possible source of temporal pattern drift could be random walk like fluctuations -- physiological or scanner related -- occurring within single voxel timecourses. This explanation is consistent with voxel-wise detrending not alleviating pattern drift effects. In addition, this would explain why crossvalidated pattern distances are robust to temporal drift because a random walk process is expected to give rise to non-replicable drift directions. Given these findings, we recommend that future fMRI studies take pattern drift into account when analyzing pattern similarity as this can greatly enhance the sensitivity to experimental effects of interest.",

    "abstract": "Sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 6 months after onset of symptoms has been recently documented, and Ebola virus RNA has been detected in semen of survivors up to 9 months after onset of symptoms. As countries affected by the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, by far the largest to date, are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), it remains unclear what threat is posed by rare sexual transmission events that could arise from survivors. We devised a novel mathematical model that includes sexual transmission from convalescent survivors: a SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered) transmission model. We fitted the model to weekly incidence of EVD cases from the 2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 0.1% per sex act transmission probability and a 3-month convalescent period (the two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission) create very few additional cases, but would extend the epidemic by 83 days [95% CI: 68-98 days] (p < 0.0001) on average. Strikingly, a 6-month convalescent period extended the average epidemic by 540 days (95% CI: 508-572 days), doubling the current length, despite an insignificant rise in the number of new cases generated. Our results show that current recommendations for abstinence and condom use should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, but will not reduce the length of time the public health community must stay vigilant. While the number of infectious survivors is expected to greatly decline over the coming months, our results show that transmission events may still be expected for quite some time as each event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. Precise measurement of the convalescent period is thus important for planning ongoing surveillance efforts.",
