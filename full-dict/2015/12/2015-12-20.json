    "abstract": "Palindromic consensus nucleotide sequences are found at the genomic integration sites of retroviruses and other transposable elements. It has been suggested that the palindromic consensus arises as a consequence of structural symmetry in the integrase complex, but the precise mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Here we perform a statistical analysis of large datasets of HTLV-1 and HIV-1 integration sites. The results show that the palindromic consensus sequence is not present in individual integration sites, but appears to arise in the population average as a consequence of the existence of a non-palindromic nucleotide motif that occurs in approximately equal proportions on the plus-strand and the minus-strand of the host genome. We demonstrate that palindromic probability position matrices are characteristic of such situations. We develop a generally applicable algorithm to sort the individual integration site sequences into plus-strand and minus-strand subpopulations. We apply this algorithm to identify the respective integration site nucleotide motifs of five retroviruses of different genera: HTLV-1, HIV-1, MLV, ASLV, and PFV. The results reveal a non-palindromic motif that is shared between these retroviruses.",

    "abstract": "The recent availability of large-scale sequence data for the human Y chromosome has revolutionized analyses of and insights gained from this non-recombining, paternally inherited chromosome. However, the studies to date focus on Eurasian variation, and hence the diversity of early-diverging branches found in Africa has not been adequately documented. Here we analyze over 900 kb of Y chromosome sequence obtained from 547 individuals from southern African Khoisan and Bantuspeaking populations, identifying 232 new sequences from basal haplogroups A and B. We find new branches within haplogroups A2 and A3b1 and suggest that the prehistory of haplogroup B2a is more complex than previously suspected; this haplogroup is likely to have existed in Khoisan groups before the arrival of Bantu-speakers, who brought additional B2a lineages to southern Africa. Furthermore, we estimate older dates than obtained previously for both the A2-T node within the human Y chromosome phylogeny and for some individual haplogroups. Finally, there is pronounced variation in branch length between major haplogroups; haplogroups associated with Bantu-speakers have significantly longer branches. This likely reflects a combination of biases in the SNP calling process and demographic factors, such as an older average paternal age (hence a higher mutation rate), a higher effective population size, and/or a stronger effect of population expansion for Bantu-speakers than for Khoisan groups.",

The annotation of gene products is mainly accelerated by Gene Ontology (GO) and more recently by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Here we report a suite of MeSH packages for chicken in Bioconductor and illustrate some features of different MeSH-based analyses, including MeSH-informed enrichment analysis and MeSH-guided semantic similarity among terms and gene products, using two lists of chicken genes available in public repositories. The two published datasets that were employed represent (i) differentially expressed genes and (ii) candidate genes under selective sweep or epistatic selection. The comparison of MeSH with GO overrepresentation analyses suggested not only that MeSH supports the findings obtained from GO analysis but also that MeSH is able to further enrich the representation of biological knowledge and often provide more interpretable results. Based on the hierarchical structures of MeSH and GO, we computed semantic similarities among vocabularies as well as semantic similarities among selected genes. These yielded the similarity levels between significant functional terms, and the annotation of each gene yielded the measures of gene similarity. Our findings show the benefits of using MeSH as an alternative choice of annotation in order to draw biological inferences from a list of genes of interest. We argue that the use of MeSH in conjunction with GO will be instrumental in facilitating the understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits.",

However, most genomic prediction models developed so far are appropriate for Gaussian phenotypes. For this reason, appropriate genomic prediction models are needed for count data, since the conventional regression models used on count data with a large sample size (n) and a small number of parameters (p) cannot be used for genomic-enabled prediction where the number of parameters (p) is larger than the sample size (n). Here we propose a Bayesian mixed negative binomial (BMNB) genomic regression model for counts that takes into account genotype by environment (G x E) interaction. We also provide all the full conditional distributions to implement a Gibbs sampler. We evaluated the proposed model using a simulated data set and a real wheat data set from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and collaborators.

Yet, viruses such as HIV can cause chronic infections by evolving as quickly as the adaptive immune system, forming an evolutionary arms race. Here we introduce a mathematical framework to study the coevolutionary dynamics of antibodies with antigens within a host. We focus on changes in the binding interactions between the antibody and antigen populations, which result from the underlying stochastic evolution of genotype frequencies driven by mutation, selection, and drift. We identify the critical viral and immune parameters that determine the distribution of antibody-antigen binding affinities. We also identify definitive signatures of coevolution that measure the reciprocal response between antibodies and viruses, and we introduce experimentally measurable quantities that quantify the extent of adaptation during continual coevolution of the two opposing populations. Using this analytical framework, we infer rates of viral and immune adaptation based on time-shifted neutralization assays in two HIV-infected patients. Finally, we analyze competition between clonal lineages of antibodies and characterize the fate of a given lineage in terms of the state of the antibody and viral populations. In particular, we derive the conditions that favor the emergence of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may be useful in designing a vaccine against HIV.",

    "abstract": "Speciation often involves the splitting of a lineage and the adaptation of daughter lineages to different environments. It may also involve the merging of divergent lineages, thus creating a stable homoploid hybrid species1 that constructs a new ecological niche by transgressing2 the ecology of the parental types. Hybrid speciation may also contribute to enigmatic and cryptic biodiversity in the sea.3,4 The enigmatic walleye pollock, which is not a pollock at all but an Atlantic cod that invaded the Pacific 3.8 Mya,5 differs considerably from its presumed closest relatives, the Pacific and Atlantic cod. Among the Atlantic cod, shallow-water coastal and deep-water migratory frontal ecotypes are associated with highly divergent genomic islands;6,7 however, intermediates remain an enigma.8 Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of over 200 individuals using up to 33 million SNPs based on genotype likelihoods9 and showed that the evolutionary status of walleye pollock is a hybrid species: it is a hybrid between Arctic cod and Atlantic cod that transgresses the ecology of its parents. For the first time, we provide decisive evidence that the Atlantic cod coastal and frontal ecotypes are separate species that hybridized, leading to a true-breeding hybrid species that differs ecologically from its parents. We refute monophyly and dichotomous branching of these taxa, and stress the importance of looking beyond branching trees at admixture and hybridity. Our study demonstrates the power of whole-genome sequencing and population genomics in providing deep insights into fundamental processes of speciation. Our study was a starting point for further work aimed at examining the criteria of hybrid speciation,10 selection, sterility and structural chromosomal variation11 among cod-fish, which are among the most important fish stocks in the world. The hybrid nature of both the walleye pollock and Atlantic cod raises the question concerning the extent to which very profitable fisheries12,13 depend on hybrid vigour. Our results have implications for management of marine resources in times of rapid climate change.14,15",

    "abstract": "The thalamus is a key brain element in the processing of sensory information. During the sleep and awake states, this brain area is characterized by the presence of two distinct dynamical regimes: in the sleep state activity is dominated by spindle oscillations (7 - 15 Hz) weakly affected by external stimuli, while in the awake state the activity is primarily driven by external stimuli. Here we develop a simple and computationally efficient model of the thalamus that exhibits two dynamical regimes with different information-processing capabilities, and study the transition between them. The network model includes glutamatergic thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons and gabaergic reticular (RE) neurons described by adaptative integrate-and-fire models in which spikes are induced by either depolarization or hyperpolarization rebound. We found a range of connectivity conditions under which the thalamic network composed by these neurons displays the two aforementioned dynamical regimes. Our results show that TC-RE loops generate spindle-like oscillations and that a critical value of clustering in the RE-RE connections is necessary for the coexistence of the two regimes. We also observe that the transition between the two regimes occurs when the external excitatory input on TC neurons (mimicking sensory stimulation) is large enough to cause a significant fraction of them to switch from hyperpolarization-rebound-driven firing to depolarization-driven firing. Overall, our model gives a novel and clear description of the role that the two types of neurons and their connectivity play in the dynamical regimes observed in the thalamus, and in the transition between them. These results pave the way for the development of efficient models of the transmission of sensory information from periphery to cortex.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe thalamus is known to exhibit two clearly distinct dynamical regimes with different functionalities. During slow-wave sleep the thalamus is dominated by internal activity and is hardly sensitive to external stimuli. In contrast, in the awake state, the thalamus modulates its activity according to the stimuli coming from the periphery. Here we study the conditions regulating the transition between these two states. To that end we implement a simple yet biologically realistic neuronal network model of the thalamus, based on single-neuron models that reproduce the properties of the two prominent types of thalamic neurons, namely thalamocortical relay cells and reticular neurons. We found that when reticular neurons are clustered the network exhibits two distinct dynamical regimes; one dominated by oscillations and insensitive to external stimuli (like sleep) and one sensitive to them (like wake). Moreover we found that the transition between the two regimes is due to the increase of the external excitatory input (corresponding to stronger sensory stimuli).",

    "abstract": "Fibrillogenesis, the production or development of protein fibers, has been linked to protein folding diseases. The progress curve of fibrils or aggregates typically takes on a sigmoidal shape witha lag phase, a rapid growth phase, and a final plateau regime. The study of the lag phase and the estimation of its critical timescale provide insight into the factors regulating the fibrillation process. However, methods to estimate a quantitative expression for the lag time rely on empirical expressions, which cannot connect the lag time to kinetic parameters associated with the reaction mechanisms of protein fibrillation. Here we introduce an approach for the estimation of the lag time using the governing rate equations of the elementary reactions of a subsequent monomer addition model for protein fibrillation as a case study. We show that the lag time is given by the sum of the critical timescales for each fibril intermediate in the subsequent monomer addition mechanism and therefore reveals causal connectivity between intermediate species. Furthermore, we find that single-molecule assays of protein fibrillation can exhibit a lag phase without a nucleation process, while dyes and extrinsic fluorescent probe bulk assays of protein fibrillation do not exhibit an observable lag time phase during template-dependent elongation. Our approach could be valuable for investigating the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the protein fibrillation reaction mechanism and provides physicochemical insights into parameters regulating the lag phase.",

    "abstract": "Electrotaxis plays a critical role in developmental cell migration, axon growth cone guidance, epithelial wound healing, tissue regeneration, and the degree of invasiveness characterizing different cancer cell lines. During electrotaxis in a direct current electric field (EF), a cell migrates preferentially either towards the anode or cathode depending on the cell-type. However, the types and ranges of mechanisms coupling trans-cellular electric fields to cellular EF-sensitive signaling systems are largely unknown. To address this cell biological phenomenon, I use transcriptomic data from a developmental genetic model in which multicellular social aggregation is induced by starvation of amoeboid cells. I find that the developmental proteome expressed during the streaming aggregation stage is measurably and substantially enriched in charged and highly polar amino acids relative to the proteomes of either the unicellular amoeboid or the multicellular fruiting body. This large-scale coding augmentation of EF-sensitive amino acid residues in thousands of streaming-specific proteins is accompanied by a proportional coding decrease in the number of small, uncharged amino acid residues. I also confirm an expected coding increase of biosynthetically costly amino acids in the proteome of the satiated feeding-stage amoeboid. These findings suggest that electrotactic capability is encoded broadly in the genetically regulated deployment of a developmental proteome with augmented EF-sensitivity. These results signify that extreme, nonuniform, evolutionary constraints can be exerted on the amino acid composition of an organisms proteome.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are a major source of genome variation across the branches of life. Although TEs may occasionally play an adaptive role in their hosts genome, they are much more often deleterious, and purifying selection is thus an important factor controlling genomic TE loads. In contrast, life history and genomic characteristics such as mating system, parasitism, GC content, and RNAi pathways, have been suggested to account for the startling disparity of TE loads in different species. Previous studies of fungal, plant, and animal genomes have reported conflicting results regarding the direction in which these genomic features drive TE evolution. Many of these studies have had limited power because they studied taxonomically narrow systems, comparing only a limited number of phylogenetically independent contrasts, and did not address long term effects on TE evolution. Here we explicitly test the long term determinants of TE evolution by comparing 42 nematode genomes that span over 500 million years of diversification, and include numerous transitions between life history states and RNAi pathways. We have analysed the reconstructed TE loads of ancestors through the Nematoda phylogeny to account for correlation with GC content and transitions in TE evolutionary models. We also analysed the effect of transitions in life history characteristics and RNAi using ANOVA of phylogenetically independent contrasts. We show that purifying selection against TEs is the dominant force throughout the evolutionary history of Nematoda, as indicated by reconstructed ancestral TE loads, and that strong stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are the underlying models which best explain TE diversification among extant species. In contrast we found no evidence that life history or RNAi variations have a significant influence upon genomic TE load across extended periods of evolutionary history. We suggest that these are largely inconsequential to the large differences in TE content observed between genomes and only by these large-scale comparisons can we distinguish long term and persistent effects from transient effects or misleading random changes.",

Recognising this, the CO1 algorithm presented on the StripeSpotter platform was used to identify different species and sexes of mosquito wings (Diptera: Culicidae) and honey bee and bumblebee wings (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Images of different species of mosquito and bee wings were uploaded onto the CO1 database and test wing images were analysed to determine if this resulted in the correct species being identified. Out of a database containing 925 mosquito and bee wing images, the CO1 algorithm correctly identified species and sexes of test wing image presented, with a high degree of accuracy (80% to 100% depending on the species and database used, excluding sibling species) highlighting the usefulness of CO1 in identifying medically important as well as beneficial insect species. Using a larger database of wing images resulted in significantly higher numbers of test images being correctly identified than using a smaller database. The hind wings of Hymenoptera provided higher levels of correctly identified results than using the fore wings. The software should be used in conjunction with other identifying criteria (salient morphological features) in addition to the wings. CO1 is a powerful algorithm to use in identifying insect wings in its current form and has great potential if it is adapted and tailored for insect species identification. It is suggested that a primary aim in the digital age should be the production of a  World Wide Database of insect images, where all known insect images can be made available to everyone, with image recognition and species knowledge at its core.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the sources and sinks of methane (CH4) is critical for predicting and managing global biogeochemical cycles. Recent studies have reported that CH4 concentrations in cave ecosystems are depleted and that these subterranean environments may act as a daily sinks for atmospheric CH4. It has been hypothesized that this CH4 depletion may be caused by radiolysis, an abiotic process whereby CH4 is oxidized via interactions with ionizing radiation derived from radon decay. Alternatively, the depletion of CH4 concentrations could be due to biological processes, specifically oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. We theoretically explored the radiolysis hypothesis and conclude that it is a kinetically constrained process that is unlikely to lead to the rapid loss of CH4 in subterranean environments. We present experimental results to support this claim. We tested the microbial oxidation hypothesis in a set of mesocosm experiments that were conducted in Vietnamese caves. Our results reveal that methanotrophic bacteria associated with cave rocks consume CH4 at a rate of 1.33 - 2.70 mg CH4 {middle dot} m-2 {middle dot} d-1. These CH4 oxidation rates equal or exceed what has been reported in other habitats, including agricultural systems, grasslands, deciduous forests, and Arctic tundra. As such, microbial methanotrophy has the potential to significantly oxidize CH4 in caves, but also smaller-size open subterranean spaces, such as cracks, fissures, and other pores that are connected to and rapidly exchange with the atmosphere. Future studies are needed to understand how subterranean CH4 oxidation scales up to affect regional and global CH4 cycling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeterozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 have been identified in patients with a range of complex phenotypes including intellectual disability, autism and schizophrenia. However heterozygous CNTNAP2 mutations are also common in the normal population. Conversely, homozygous mutations are rare and have not been found in unaffected individuals.\\n\\nCase presentationWe describe a consanguineous family carrying a deletion in CNTNAP2 predicted to abolish function of its protein product, CASPR2. Affected family members show epilepsy, facial dysmorphisms, severe intellectual disability and impaired language. We compared these patients with previously reported individuals carrying homozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 and identified a highly recognisable phenotype.\\n\\nConclusionsWe propose that CASPR2 loss produces a syndrome involving early-onset refractory epilepsy, intellectual disability, language impairment and autistic features that can be recognized as CASPR2 deficiency disorder. Further screening for homozygous patients meeting these criteria, together with detailed phenotypic investigations will be crucial for understanding the contribution of CNTNAP2 to normal and disrupted development.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the properties and functions of DNA sequences is an important, but challenging task in the broad field of genomics. This task is particularly difficult for noncoding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of noncoding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98% of the human genome is noncoding and 93% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting noncoding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory \\\"grammar\\\" to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models.\\n\\nAvailability and implementation\\n\\nAll source code is available at the github repository http://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ.",
