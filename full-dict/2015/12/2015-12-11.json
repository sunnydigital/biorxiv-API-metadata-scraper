    "abstract": "Understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is important for both biological research and public health applications. It has been widely demonstrated that statistical modeling provides a firm basis for inferring relevant epidemiological quantities from incidence and molecular data. However, the complexity of transmission dynamic models causes two challenges: Firstly, the likelihood function of the models is generally not computable and computationally intensive simulation-based inference methods need to be employed. Secondly, the model may not be fully identifiable from the available data. While the first difficulty can be tackled by computational and algorithmic advances, the second obstacle is more fundamental. Identifiability issues may lead to inferences which are more driven by the prior assumptions than the data themselves. We here consider a popular and relatively simple, yet analytically intractable model for the spread of tuberculosis based on classical IS6110 fingerprinting data. We report on the identifiability of the model, presenting also some methodological advances regarding the inference. Using likelihood approximations, it is shown that the reproductive value cannot be identified from the data available and that the posterior distributions obtained in previous work have likely been substantially dominated by the assumed prior distribution. Further, we show that the inferences are influenced by the assumed infectious population size which has generally been kept fixed in previous work. We demonstrate that the infectious population size can be inferred if the remaining epidemiological parameters are already known with sufficient precision.",

    "abstract": "Genetic assimilation results from selection on phenotypic plasticity, but quantitative genetics models of linear reaction norms considering intercept and slope as traits do not fully incorporate the process of genetic assimilation. We argue that intercept-slope reaction norm models are insufficient representations of genetic effects on linear reaction norms, and that considering reaction norm intercept as a trait is unfortunate because the definition of this trait relates to a specific environmental value (zero) and confounds genetic effects on reaction norm elevation with genetic effects on environmental perception. Instead we suggest a model with three traits representing genetic effects that respectively (i) are independent of the environment, (ii) alter the sensitivity of the phenotype to the environment, and (iii) determine how the organism perceives the environment. The model predicts that, given sufficient additive genetic variation in environmental perception, the environmental value at which reaction norms tend to cross will respond rapidly to selection after an abrupt environmental change, and eventually become equal to the new mean environment. This readjustment of the zone of canalization becomes completed without changes in genetic correlations, genetic drift or imposing any fitness costs on maintaining plasticity. The asymptotic evolutionary outcome of this three-trait linear reaction norm generally entails a lower degree of phenotypic plasticity than the two-trait model, and maximum expected fitness does not occur at the mean trait values in the population.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells use microtubule-based intracellular transport for the delivery of many subcellular cargos, including organelles. The canonical view of organelle transport is that organelles directly recruit molecular motors via cargo-specific adaptors. In contrast to this view, we show here that peroxisomes move by hitchhiking on early endosomes, an organelle that directly recruits the transport machinery. Using the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans we find that hitchhiking is mediated by a novel endosome-associated linker protein, PxdA. PxdA is required for normal distribution and long-range movement of peroxisomes, but not early endosomes or nuclei. Using simultaneous time-lapse imaging we find that early endosome-associated PxdA localizes to the leading edge of moving peroxisomes. We identify a coiled-coil region within PxdA that is necessary and sufficient for early endosome localization and peroxisome distribution and motility. These results present a new mechanism of microtubule-based organelle transport where peroxisomes hitchhike on early endosomes and identify PxdA as the novel linker protein required for this coupling.",

Unique in the animal kingdom are safety lines that safeguard hatching and first molting. Further curiosities are dwarf males in parasitic and sessile taxa and bacteria-induced gigantism and infectious feminization in crustacean hosts. Record-breaking features in animals are relative penis length, clutch size, sperm size, chromosome number, viability of resting eggs, and fossil ages of penis, sperm and brooded embryos. These reproductive peculiarities are reviewed and their implication for basic and applied biology is discussed, including the early evolution and diversification of brood care in arthropods, sperm competition and assurance of paternity, posthumous paternity and sustainable male-based fishery, and ecotype changes by man-made pollution.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of birth weight have focused on fetal genetics, while relatively little is known about how maternal genetic variation influences fetal growth. We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight that could highlight potentially relevant maternal determinants of fetal growth.\\n\\nWe meta-analysed GWAS data on up to 8.7 million SNPs in up to 86,577 women of European descent from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium and the UK Biobank. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) and analyses of mother-child pairs to quantify the separate maternal and fetal genetic effects.\\n\\nMaternal SNPs at 10 loci (MTNR1B, HMGA2, SH2B3, KCNAB1, L3MBTL3, GCK, EBF1, TCF7L2, ACTL9 and CYP3A7) showed evidence of association with offspring birth weight at P<5x10-8. The SEM analyses showed at least 7 of the 10 associations were consistent with effects of the maternal genotype acting via the intrauterine environment, rather than via effects of shared alleles with the fetus. Variants, or correlated proxies, at many of the loci had been previously associated with adult traits, including fasting glucose (MTNR1B, GCK and TCF7L2) and sex hormone levels (CYP3A7), and one (EBF1) with gestational duration.\\n\\nThe identified associations indicate effects of maternal glucose, cytochrome P450 activity and gestational duration, and potential effects of maternal blood pressure and immune function on fetal growth. Further characterization of these associations, for example in mechanistic and causal analyses, will enhance understanding of the potentially modifiable maternal determinants of fetal growth, with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with low and high birth weights.",

    "abstract": "Although >20 common frequency age-related macular degeneration (AMD) alleles have been discovered with genome-wide association studies, substantial disease heritability remains unexplained. In this study we sought to identify additional variants, both common and rare, that have an association with advanced AMD. We genotyped 4,332 cases and 25,268 controls of European ancestry from three different populations using the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. We performed meta-analyses to identify associations with common variants and performed single variant and gene-based burden tests to identify associations with rare variants. Two protective, low frequency, non-synonymous variants A307V in PELI3 (odds ratio [OR]=0.14, P=4.3x10-10) and N1050Y in CFH (OR=0.76, Pconditional=1.6x10-11) were significantly associated with a decrease in risk of AMD. Additionally, we identified an enrichment of protective alleles in PELI3 using a burden test (OR=0.14). The new variants have a large effect size, similar to rare mutations we reported previously in a targeted sequencing study, which remain significant in this analysis: CFH R1210C (OR=18.82, P=3.5x10-07), C3 K155Q (OR=3.27, P=1.5x10-10), and C9 P167S (OR=2.04, P=2.8x10-07). We also identified a strong protective signal for a common variant (rs8056814) near CTRB1 associated with a decrease in AMD risk (logistic regression: OR = 0.71, P = 1.8x10-07; Firth corrected OR = 0.64, P = 9.6x10-11). This study supports the involvement of both common and low frequency protective variants in AMD. It also may expand the role of the high-density lipoprotein pathway and branches of the innate immune pathway, outside that of the complement system, in the etiology of AMD.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are known to affect a large portion of the human genome and have been implicated in many diseases. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability. To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5 times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes. In addition to known enrichments in segmental duplication and near centromeres and telomeres, we also report that CNVs are enriched in specific types of satellite and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Finally, using this comprehensive approach, we identify 3,455 regions with recurrent CNVs that were missing from existing catalogs. In particular, we identify 347 genes with a novel exonic CNV in low-mappability regions, including 29 genes previously associated with disease.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of next generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, omics experiments have become the mainstay for studying diverse biological effects on a genome wide scale. ChIP-seq is the omics technique that enables genome wide localization of transcription factor binding or epigenetic modification events. Since the inception of ChIP-seq in 2007, many methods have been developed to infer ChIP target binding loci from the resultant reads after mapping them to a reference genome. However, interpreting these data has proven challenging, and as such these algorithms have several shortcomings, including susceptibility to false positives due to artifactual peaks, poor localization of binding sites, and the requirement for a total DNA input control which increases the cost of performing these experiments. We present Ritornello, a new approach with roots in digital signal processing (DSP) that addresses all of these problems. We show that Ritornello generally performs equally or better than the peak callers tested and recommended by the ENCODE consortium, but in contrast, Ritornello does not require a matched total DNA input control to avoid false positives, effectively decreasing the sequencing cost to perform ChIP-seq.",

    "abstract": "Hashimotos thyroiditis is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in humans and, similar to other autoimmune diseases, is multifactorial in nature. Moreover, the expression of TLRs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as diabetes and insulinitis. The TLRs are a family of at least 10 receptors associated with innate immunity that are present in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which recognize highly conserved patterns of the surface of microorganisms, such as LPS, peptidoglycan, and dsRNA and CpG sequences.\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate mRNA of the TLR3, TLR9 and cytokines (IFN-beta, TNF and IL-1) in thyroid follicular cells obtained of mice with autoimmune experimental thyroiditis (EAT). For that C57BL/6 mice were immunized with Tg plus complete Freunds adyuvant and treated or not with Poli I:C. Anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies level was determined by indirect ELISA. Also isolated thyroid follicles were treated in vitro with Poli IC. The results show that TLR3 receptors and some cytokines (IFN-beta, TNF and IL-10) are more highly expressed in thyroid follicular cells treated with Poli I:C. and in the animals with TAE, which present humoral autoimmune response. Taken together, these results suggest that TLR3 expression in thyroid follicular cells induces signaling mechanisms to enhanced IL-1, TNF and IFN-{beta} levels during pathogen infections and that could trigger of autoimmune thyroiditis.",
