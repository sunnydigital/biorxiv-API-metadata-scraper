    "abstract": "Identification of candidate causal variants in regions associated with risk of common diseases is complicated by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and multiple association signals. Nonetheless, accurate maps of these variants are needed, both to fully exploit detailed cell specific chromatin annotation data to highlight disease causal mechanisms and cells, and for design of the functional studies that will ultimately be required to confirm causal mechanisms. We adapted a Bayesian evolutionary stochastic search algorithm to the fine mapping problem, and demonstrated its improved performance over conventional stepwise and regularised regression through simulation studies. We then applied it to fine map the established multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) associations in the IL-2RA (CD25) gene region. For T1D, both stepwise and stochastic search approaches identified four T1D association signals, with the major effect tagged by the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12722496. In contrast, for MS, the stochastic search found two distinct competing models: a single candidate causal variant, tagged by rs2104286 and reported previously using stepwise analysis; and a more complex model with two association signals, one of which was tagged by the major T1D associated rs12722496 and the other by rs56382813. There is low to moderate LD between rs2104286 and both rs12722496 and rs56382813 (r2 [~=] 0.3) and our two SNP model could not be recovered through a forward stepwise search after conditioning on rs2104286. Both signals in the two variant model for MS affect CD25 expression on distinct subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, which are key cells in the autoimmune process. The results support a shared causal variant for T1D and MS. Our study illustrates the benefit of using a purposely designed model search strategy for fine mapping and the advantage of combining disease and protein expression data.",

    "abstract": "Sex determination evolves rapidly, often because of turnover of the genes at the top of the pathway. The house fly, Musca domestica, has a multifactorial sex determination system, allowing us to identify the selective forces responsible for the evolutionary turnover of sex determination in action. There is a male determining factor, M, on the Y chromosome (YM), which is probably the ancestral state. An M factor on the third chromosome (IIIM) has reached high frequencies in multiple populations across the world, but the evolutionary forces responsible for the invasion of IIIM are not resolved. To test if the IIIM chromosome invaded because of sex-specific selection pressures, we used mRNA sequencing to determine if isogenic males that differ only in the presence of the YM or IIIM chromosome have different gene expression profiles. We find that more genes are differentially expressed between YM and IIIM males in testis than head, and that genes with male-biased expression are most likely to be differentially expressed between YM and IIIM males. We additionally find that IIIM males have a \\\"masculinized\\\" gene expression profile, suggesting that the IIIM chromosome has accumulated an excess of male-beneficial alleles because of its male-limited transmission. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sex-specific selection acts on alleles linked to the male-determining locus driving evolutionary turnover in the sex determination pathway.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveUrothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder is the fourth most common cancer in males in the United States. In addition to mutations in FGFR3, TP53, AKT1, TSC1, and PTEN genes, mutations in PIK3CA have been also described in urothelial carcinomas, preferentially in low-grade tumors. Mutations in PIK3CA also has been shown to have implications for prognosis, surveillance and therapeutic response. Thus, determining the PIK3CA status in urothelial carcinomas could potentially improved the clinical management of patients with bladder cancer. Herein, we evaluated the presence of PIK3CA mutations in exons 1, 9, and 20 in 21 urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder.\\n\\nMethodsPatients were treated by radical cystectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Representative tissue blocks (1 for each case) were selected. We used a pinpoint DNA extraction technique from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and mutational analysis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay coupled with sequencing of targeted exons. Patients included 15 men and 6 women, with a median age of 68 years (range, 42 to 76 years), with 3 noninvasive and 18 invasive urothelial carcinomas. Noninvasive carcinomas included 1 case each of low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS). Invasive tumors included 3 pT1, 5 pT2, 6 pT3, and 4 pT4 urothelial carcinomas.\\n\\nResultsWe did not find mutations in the analyzed exons of the PIK3CA gene, in any of the 21 urothelial carcinomas. The preponderance of invasive high-grade and high-stage tumors could explain the absence of identifiable mutations in our cohort.\\n\\nConclusionsPIK3CA mutations as prognosti-cators of outcome or predictors of therapeutic response await further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of large, repeat-rich eukaryotic genomes continues to represent a significant challenge in genomics. While long-read technologies have made the high-quality assembly of small, microbial genomes increasingly feasible, data generation can be prohibitively expensive for larger genomes. Advances in assembly algorithms are thus essential to exploit the characteristics of short and long-read sequencing technologies to consistently and reliably provide high-quality assemblies in a cost-efficient manner. OPERA-LG is a scalable, exact algorithm for the scaffold assembly of large, repeat-rich genomes, with consistent improvement over state-of-the-art programs for scaffold correctness and contiguity. It provides a rigorous framework for scaffolding of repetitive sequences and a systematic approach for combining data from different second-generation (Illumina, Ion Torrent) and third-generation (PacBio, ONT) sequencing technologies. OPERA-LG efficiently scaffolds large genomes with provable scaffold properties, providing an avenue for systematic augmentation and improvement of 1000s of existing draft eukaryotic genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "The lack of effective biomarkers for predicting cancer risk in premalignant disease is a major clinical problem. There is a near-limitless list of candidate biomarkers and it remains unclear how best to sample the tissue in space and time. Practical constraints mean that only a few of these candidate biomarker strategies can be evaluated empirically and there is no framework to determine which of the plethora of possibilities is the most promising. Here we have sought to solve this problem by developing a theoretical platform for in silico biomarker development. We construct a simple computational model of carcinogenesis in premalignant disease and use the model to evaluate an extensive list of tissue sampling strategies and different molecular measures of these samples. Our model predicts that: (i) taking more biopsies improves prognostication, but with diminishing returns for each additional biopsy; (ii) longitudinally-collected biopsies provide slightly more prognostic information than a single biopsy collected at the latest possible time-point; (iii) measurements of clonal diversity are more prognostic than measurements of the presence or absence of a particular abnormality and are particularly robust to confounding by tissue sampling; and (iv) the spatial pattern of clonal expansions is a particularly prognostic measure. This study demonstrates how the use of a mechanistic framework provided by computational modelling can diminish empirical constraints on biomarker development.",

This flexibility makes Pyvolve a convenient framework not only for simulating sequences under a wide variety of conditions, but also for developing and testing new evolutionary models. Moreover, Pyvolve includes several novel sequence simulation features, including a new rate matrix scaling algorithm and branch-length perturbations.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \\\"mutation signatures\\\" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis.\\n\\nHere we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites.\\n\\nWe illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5 to the mutated site.\\n\\nThe overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \\\"mixed-membership models\\\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.\\n\\nOur methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature_shiny/.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySomatic (non-inherited) mutations are acquired throughout our lives in cells throughout our body. These mutations can be caused, for example, by DNA replication errors or exposure to environmental mutagens such as tobacco smoke. Some of these mutations can lead to cancer.\\n\\nDifferent cancers, and even different instances of the same cancer, can show different distinctive patterns of somatic mutations. These distinctive patterns have become known as \\\"mutation signatures\\\". For example, C > A mutations are frequent in lung caners whereas C > T and CC > TT mutations are frequent in skin cancers. Each mutation signature may be associated with a specific kind of carcinogen, such as tobacco smoke or ultraviolet light. Identifying mutation signatures therefore has the potential to identify new carcinogens, and yield new insights into the mechanisms and causes of cancer,\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce new statistical tools for tackling this important problem. These tools provide more robust and interpretable mutation signatures compared to previous approaches, as we demonstrate by applying them to large-scale cancer genomic data.",
