    "abstract": "The Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis (SOWH) test is a method to evaluate incongruent phylogenetic topologies. It is used, for example, when an investigator wishes to know if the maximum likelihood tree recovered in their analysis is significantly different than an alternative phylogenetic hypothesis. The SOWH test compares the observed difference in likelihood between the topologies to a null distribution of differences in likelihood generated by parametric resampling. The SOWH test is a well-established and important phylogenetic method, but it can be difficult to implement and its sensitivity to various factors is not well understood. We wrote SOWHAT, a program that automates the SOWH test. In test analyses, we find that variation in parameter estimation as well as the use of a more complex model of parameter estimation have little impact on results, but that results can be inconsistent when an insufficient number of replicates are used to estimate the null distribution. We provide methods of analyzing the sampling as well as a simple stopping criteria for sufficient bootstrap replicates, which increase the overall reliability of the approach. Applications of the SOWH test should include explicit evaluations of sampling adequacy. SOWHAT is available for download from https://github.com/josephryan/SOWHAT.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the StudyAutomatic self-fertilization may influence the geography of speciation, promote reproductive isolation between incipient species, and lead to ecological differentiation. As such, selfing taxa are predicted to co-occur more often with their closest relatives than are outcrossing taxa. Despite suggestions that this pattern may be general, the extent to which mating system influences range overlap in close relatives has not been tested formally across a diverse group of plant species pairs.\\n\\nMethodsWe test for a difference in range overlap between species pairs where zero, one, or both species are selfers, using data from 98 sister species pairs in 20 genera across 15 flowering plant families. We also use divergence time estimates from time-calibrated phylogenies to ask how range overlap changes with divergence time and whether this effect depends on mating system.\\n\\nKey ResultsWe find no evidence that automatic self-fertilization influences range overlap of closely related plant species. Sister pairs with more recent divergence times had modestly greater range overlap, but this effect did not depend on mating system.\\n\\nConclusionsThe absence of a strong influence of mating system on range overlap suggests that mating system plays a minor or inconsistent role compared to many other mechanisms potentially influencing the co-occurrence of close relatives.",

    "abstract": "We surveyed gene expression in six tissues in an F2 intercross between mouse strains C57BL/6J (abbreviated B6) and BTBR T+ tf /J (abbreviated BTBR) made genetically obese with the Leptin(ob) mutation. We identified a number of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) affecting the expression of numerous genes distal to the locus, called trans-eQTL hotspots. Some of these trans-eQTL hotspots showed effects in multiple tissues, whereas some were specific to a single tissue. An unusually large number of transcripts (7% of genes) mapped in trans to a hotspot on chromosome 6, specifically in pancreatic islets. By considering the first two principal components of the expression of genes mapping to this region, we were able to convert the multivariate phenotype into a simple Mendelian trait. Fine-mapping the locus by traditional methods reduced the QTL interval to a 298 kb region containing only three genes, including Slco1a6, one member of a large family of organic anion transporters. Direct genomic sequencing of all Slco1a6 exons identified a non-synonymous coding SNP that converts a highly conserved proline residue at amino acid position 564 to serine. Molecular modeling suggests that Pro564 faces an aqueous pore within this 12-transmembrane domain-spanning protein. When transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells, BTBR OATP1A6-mediated cellular uptake of the bile acid taurocholic acid (TCA) was enhanced compared to B6 OATP1A6. Our results suggest that genetic variation in Slco1a6 leads to altered transport of TCA (and potentially other bile acids) by pancreatic islets, resulting in broad gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Our method for \\\"Time to most recent common ancestor\\\" TMRCA of genetic trees for the first time deals with natural selection by apriori mathematics and not as a random factor. Bioprocesses such as \\\"kin selection\\\" generate a few overrepresented \\\"singular lineages\\\" while almost all other lineages terminate. This non-uniform branching gives greatly exaggerated TMRCA with current methods. Thus we introduce an inhomogenous stochastic process which will detect singular lineages by asymmetries, whose \\\"reduction\\\" then gives true TMRCA. Reduction implies younger TMRCA, with smaller errors. This gives a new phylogenetic method for computing mutation rates, with results similar to \\\"pedigree\\\" (meiosis) data. Despite these low rates, reduction implies younger TMRCA, with smaller errors. We establish accuracy by a comparison across a wide range of time, indeed this is only y-clock giving consistent results for 500-15,000 ybp. In particular we show that the dominant European y-haplotypes R1a1a & R1b1a2, expand from c3700BC, not reaching Anatolia before c3300BC. This contradicts current clocks dating R1b1a2 to either the Neolithic Near East or Paleo-Europe. However our dates match R1a1a & R1b1a2 found in Yamnaya cemetaries of c3300BC by Svante Paabo et al, together proving R1a1a & R1b1a2 originates in the Russian Steppes.",

    "abstract": "Some diseases are caused by genetic loci with a high rate of change, and heritability in complex traits is likely to be partially caused by variation at these loci. These hypermutable elements, such as tandem repeats, change at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than the rates at which most single nucleotides mutate. However, single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, are currently the primary focus of genetic studies of human disease. Here we quantify the degree to which SNPs are correlated with hypermutable loci by examining a range of mutation rates. We use established population genetics theory to relate mutation rates to recombination rates and compare the theoretical predictions to simulations. Both simulations and theory agree that, at the highest mutation rates, almost all correlation is lost between a hypermutable locus and surrounding SNPs. The theoretical predictions break down as the mutation rate increases, and consequently differ widely from the simulated results. The simulation results suggest that some correlation remains between SNPs and hypermutable loci when mutation rates are on the lower end of the mutation spectrum. Consequently, in some cases SNPs can tag variation caused by some hypermutable loci. We also examine the linkage between SNPs and other SNPs and uncover ways in which the linkage disequilibrium of rare SNPs differs from that of hypermutable loci.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria are central to human health and disease, but the tools available for modulating and editing bacterial communities are limited. New technologies for tuning microbial populations would facilitate the targeted manipulation of the human microbiome and treatment of bacterial infections. For example, antibiotics are often broad spectrum in nature and cannot be used to accurately manipulate bacterial communities. Bacteriophages can provide highly specific targeting of bacteria, but relying solely on natural phage isolation strategies to assemble well-defined and uniform phage cocktails that are amenable to engineering can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Here, we present a synthetic-biology strategy to modulate phage host ranges by manipulating phage genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used this technology to swap multiple modular phage tail components and demonstrated that Escherichia coli phage scaffolds can be redirected to target pathogenic Yersinia and Klebsiella bacteria, and conversely, Klebsiella phage scaffolds can be redirected to target E. coli. The synthetic phages achieved multiple orders-of-magnitude killing of their new target bacteria and were used to selectively remove specific bacteria from multi-species bacterial communities. We envision that this approach will accelerate the study of phage biology, facilitate the tuning of phage host ranges, and enable new tools for microbiome engineering and the treatment of infectious diseases.",

To determine whether striatal ensembles drive subjects' judgments of duration, we manipulated and recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing a duration categorization psychophysical task. We found that the dynamics of striatal neurons predicted duration judgments, and that simultaneously recorded ensembles could judge duration as well as the animal. Furthermore, striatal neurons were necessary for duration judgments, as muscimol infusions produced a specific impairment in animals' duration sensitivity. Lastly, we show that time as encoded by striatal populations ran faster or slower when rats judged a duration as longer or shorter, respectively. These results demonstrate that the speed with which striatal population state changes supports the fundamental ability of animals to judge the passage of time.",

However, the positional distributions of coding mutations, and the 79% of somatic variants in exome data that do not alter protein sequence or RNA splicing, remain largely unstudied. We employed density-based clustering methods on ~4,700 exomes from 21 tumor types to detect variably-sized significantly mutated regions (SMRs). SMRs reveal recurrent alterations across a diverse spectrum of coding and non-coding elements, including microRNAs, transcription factor binding sites, and untranslated regions that are individually mutated in up to ~15% of samples in specific cancer types. SMRs often associated with changes in gene expression and signaling. Mapping SMRs to protein structures revealed spatial clustering of somatic mutations at known and novel cancer-driver domains and molecular interfaces. Mutation frequencies in SMRs demonstrate that distinct protein regions are differentially mutated among tumor types. The functional diversity of SMRs underscores both the varied mechanisms of oncogenic misregulation and the advantage of unbiased driver identification.",

    "abstract": "Proteomics is poised to play critical roles in clinical research. However, due to limited coverage and high noise, integration with powerful analysis algorithms is necessary. In particular, network-based algorithms can improve selection of reproducible features in spite of incomplete proteome coverage, technical inconsistency or high inter-sample variability. We define analytical reliability on three benchmarks --- precision/recall rates, feature-selection stability and cross-validation accuracy. Using these, we demonstrate the insufficiencies of commonly used Students t-test and Hypergeometric enrichment. Given advances in sample sizes, quantitation accuracy and coverage, we are now able to introduce and evaluate Ranked-Based Network Approaches (RBNAs) for the first time in proteomics. These include SNET (SubNETwork), FSNET (FuzzySNET), PFSNET (PairedFSNET). We also introduce for the first time, PPFSNET(samplePairedPFSNET), which is a paired-sample variant of PFSNET. RBNAs (particularly PFSNET and PPFSNET) excelled on all three benchmarks and can make consistent and reproducible predictions even in the small-sample size scenario (n=4). Given these qualities, RBNAs represent an important advancement in network biology, and is expected to see practical usage, particularly in clinical biomarker and drug target prediction.",

First, a vectorial representation of the genomic data is obtained using oligonucleotide signatures. Using non-linear subspace projections, data is transformed to be suitable for automatic clustering. This allows for the detection of one vs. more genomes (clusters) in a sample. As clustering is an ill-posed problem, the pipeline relies on a thorough choice of all involved methods and parameters.

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic profiling enables the unprecedented interrogation of gene expression heterogeneity in rare cell populations that would otherwise be obscured in bulk RNA sequencing experiments. The stochastic nature of transcription is revealed in the bimodality of single-cell transcriptomic data, a feature shared across single-cell expression platforms. There is, however, a paucity of computational tools that take advantage of this unique characteristic. We present a new methodology to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data that models this bimodality within a coherent generalized linear modeling framework. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model that allows one to characterize biological changes in the proportions of cells that are expressing each gene, and in the positive mean expression level of that gene. We introduce the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes turned on in a cell, and show how it can be used to simultaneously adjust for technical variation and so-called \\\"extrinsic noise\\\" at the single-cell level without the use of control genes. Our model permits direct inference on statistics formed by collections of genes, facilitating gene set enrichment analysis. The residuals defined by such models can be manipulated to interrogate cellular heterogeneity and gene-gene correlation across cells and conditions, providing insights into the temporal evolution of networks of co-expressed genes at the single-cell level. Using two single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including newly generated data from Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells, we show how model residuals can be used to identify significant changes across biologically relevant gene sets that are missed by other methods and characterize cellular heterogeneity in response to stimulation.",
