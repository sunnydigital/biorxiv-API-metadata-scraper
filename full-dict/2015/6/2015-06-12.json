    "abstract": "As next-generation sequencing becomes a clinical tool, a full understanding of the variables affecting sequencing analysis output is required. Through the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), we compared sequencing pipelines at five independent centers (CNAG, DKFZ, OICR, RIKEN and WTSI) using a single tumor-blood DNA pair. Analyses by each center and with one standardized algorithm revealed significant discrepancies. Although most pipelines performed well for coding mutations, library preparation methods and sequencing coverage metrics clearly influenced downstream results. PCR-free methods showed reduced GC-bias and more even coverage. Increasing sequencing depth to [~]100x (two- to three-fold higher than current standards) showed a benefit, as long as the tumor:control coverage ratio remained balanced. To become part of routine clinical care, high-throughput sequencing must be globally compatible and comparable. This benchmarking exercise has highlighted several fundamental parameters to consider in this regard, which will allow for better optimization and planning of both basic and translational studies.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is a process that unlinks neighbouring loci allowing for independent evolutionary trajectories within genomes of many organisms. If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Polyglutamine (pQ) tracts are abundant in many proteins co-interacting on DNA. The lengths of these pQ tracts can modulate their interaction strengths. However, pQ tracts > 40 residues are pathologically prone to amyloidogenic self-assembly. Here, we assess the extent and consequences of variation in the pQ-encoding opa repeats of Notch (N) in Drosophila melanogaster. We use Sanger sequencing to genotype opa sequences (50-CAX repeats), which have resisted assembly using short sequence reads. While the majority of N sequences pertain to reference opa31 (Q13HQ17) and opa32 (Q13HQ18) allelic classes, several rare alleles encode tracts > 32 residues: opa33a (Q14HQ18), opa33b (Q15HQ17), opa34 (Q16HQ17), opa35a1/opa35a2 (Q13HQ21), opa36 (Q13HQ22), and opa37 (Q13HQ23). Only one rare allele encodes a tract < 31 residues: opa23 (Q13-Q10). This opa23 allele shortens the pQ tract while simultaneously eliminating the interrupting histidine. Homozygotes for the short and long opa alleles have defects in sensory bristle organ specification, abdominal patterning, and embryonic survival. Inbred stocks with wild-type opa31 alleles become more viable when outbred, while an inbred stock with the longer opa35 becomes less viable after outcrossing to different backgrounds. In contrast, an inbred stock with the short opa23 allele is semi-viable in both inbred and outbred genetic backgrounds. This opa23 Notch allele also produces notched wings when recombined out of the X chromosome. Importantly, wa-linked X balancers carry the N allele opa33b and suppress AS-C insufficiency caused by the sc8 inversion. Our results demonstrate potent pQ variation and epistatic sensitivity for the N locus, and the need for long read genotyping of key repeat variables underlying gene regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "The relatively recent development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques has revealed a wealth of novel sequences found in very low abundance: the rare biosphere. Today, most studies of diversity of microorganisms are carried out almost exclusively with HTS techniques. However, culturing seems indispensable for diversity studies especially if the aim is exploring the rare biosphere. We have carried out a deep (1 million sequences per sample) pyrosequencing analysis of two marine bacterial samples and isolated a culture collection from one of them. We have shown that the collectors curves of the pyrosequencing data were close to reaching an asymptote. We have estimated the total richness of the samples and the sequencing effort necessary to obtain the total estimated richness experimentally. Comparing the pyrosequencing data and the isolates sequences we have found that isolation retrieves some of the rarest taxa and that the composition of rare taxa follows an annual succession. We have shown that increasing the number of tags sequenced would slowly uncover the isolated bacteria. However, even if the whole bacterial diversity was found by increasing the sampling depth, culturing would still be essential for the study of marine bacterial communities, especially if the target is the rare biosphere.",
