    "abstract": "A number of methods have been developed for modeling the evolution of a quantitative trait on a phylogeny. These methods have received renewed interest in the context of genome-wide studies of gene expression, in which the expression levels of many genes can be modeled as quantitative traits. We here develop a new method for joint analyses of quantitative traits within and between-species, the Expression Variance and Evolution (EVE) model. The model parameterizes the ratio of population to evolutionary expression variance, facilitating a wide variety of analyses, including a test for lineage-specific shifts in expression level, and a phylogenetic ANOVA that can detect genes with increased or decreased ratios of expression divergence to diversity, analogous to the famous HKA test used to detect selection at the DNA level. We use simulations to explore the properties of these tests under a variety of circumstances and show that the phylogenetic ANOVA is more accurate than the standard ANOVA (no accounting for phylogeny) sometimes used in transcriptomics. We then apply the EVE model to a mammalian phylogeny of 15 species typed for expression levels in liver tissue. We identify genes with high expression divergence between-species as candidates for expression level adaptation, and genes with high expression diversity within-species as candidates for expression level conservation and/or plasticity. Using the test for lineage-specific expression shifts, we identify several candidate genes for expression level adaptation on the catarrhine and human lineages, including genes putatively related to dietary changes in humans. We compare these results to those reported previously using a model which ignores expression variance within-species, uncovering important differences in performance. We demonstrate the necessity for a phylogenetic model in comparative expression studies and show the utility of the EVE model to detect expression divergence, diversity, and branch-specific shifts.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell intercalation is used in several developmental processes to shape the normal body plan1. There is no clear evidence that intercalation is involved in pathologies. Here, we use the proto-oncogene Myc to study a process analogous to early phase of tumour expansion: Myc-induced cell competition2-7. Cell competition is a conserved mechanism5,6,8,9 driving the elimination of slow proliferating cells (so called losers) by faster proliferating neighbours (so called winners) through apoptosis10 and is important to prevent developmental malformations and maintain tissue fitness11. Using long term live imaging of Myc-driven competition in the Drosophila pupal notum and in the wing imaginal disc, we show that the probability of elimination of loser cells correlates with the surface of contact shared with winners. As such, modifying loser/winner interface morphology can modulate the strength of competition. We further show that elimination of loser clones requires winner/loser cell mixing through cell-cell intercalation. Cell mixing is driven by differential growth and the high tension at winner-winner interfaces relative to winner-loser and loser-loser interfaces, which leads to a preferential stabilisation of winner-loser contacts and reduction of clone compactness over time. Differences in tension are generated by a relative difference of junctional F-actin levels between loser and winner junctions, induced by differential levels of the phosphatidylinositol PIP3. Our results establish the first link between cell-cell intercalation induced by a proto-oncogene and how it promotes invasiveness and destruction of healthy tissues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrug treatments and vaccine designs against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have multiple issues, all associated with the diverse genetic traits present in this pathogen, ranging from multi-drug resistant genes to the molecular machinery for the biosynthesis of biofilms. Several candidate vaccines against P. aeruginosa have been developed, which target the outer membrane proteins; however, major issues arise when attempting to establish complete protection against this pathogen due to its presumably genotypic variation at the strain level. To shed light on this concern, we proposed this study to assess the P. aeruginosa pangenome and its molecular evolution across multiple strains.\\n\\nResultsThe P. aeruginosa pangenome was estimated to contain more than 16,000 non-redundant genes, and approximately 15% of these constituted the core genome. Functional analyses of the accessory genome indicated a wide presence of genetic elements directly associated with pathogenicity. An in-depth molecular evolution analysis revealed the full landscape of selection forces acting on the P. aeruginosa pangenome, in which purifying selection drives evolution in the genome of this human pathogen. We also detected distinctive positive selection in a wide variety of outer membrane proteins, with the data supporting the concept of substantial genetic variation in proteins probably recognized as antigens. Approaching the evolutionary information of genes under extremely positive selection, we designed a new Multi-Locus Sequencing Typing assay for an informative, rapid, and cost-effective genotyping of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.\\n\\nConclusionsWe report the unprecedented pangenome characterization of P. aeruginosa on a large scale, which included almost 200 bacterial genomes from one single species and a molecular evolutionary analysis at the pangenome scale. Evolutionary information presented here provides a clear explanation of the issues associated with the use of protein conjugates from pili, flagella, or secretion systems as antigens for vaccine design, which exhibit high genetic variation in terms of non-synonymous substitutions in P. aeruginosa strains.",

    "abstract": "Long (>200vbps) non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) can act as a scaffold promoting the interaction of several proteins, RNA and DNA. Some lncRNAs interact with the DNA via a triple helix formation. Triple helices are formed by a single stranded RNA/DNA molecule, which binds to the major groove of a double helix following a canonical code. Recently, sequence analysis methods have been proposed to detect triple helices for a given RNA and DNA sequences. We propose the Triplex Domain Finder (TDF) to detect DNA binding domains in RNA molecules. For a candidate lncRNA and potential target DNA regions, i.e. promoter of genes differentially regulated after the knockdown of the lncRNA, TDF evaluates whether particular RNA regions are likely to form DNA binding domains (DBD). Moreover, the DNA binding sites from the predicted DBDs are used to indicate potential target DNA regions, i.e. genes with high binding site coverage in their promoter. The command line tool provides results on a user friendly and graphical html interface. A case study on FENDRR, an lncRNA known to form triple helices, demonstrates that TDF is able to recover both previously discovered DBDs and DNA binding sites.

    "abstract": "The last 20 years have been a remarkable era for biology and medicine. One of the most significant achievements has been the sequencing of the first human genomes, which has laid the foundation for profound insights into human genetics, the intricacies of regulation and development, and the forces of evolution. Incredibly, as we look into the future over the next 20 years, we see the very real potential for sequencing more than one billion genomes, bringing with it even deeper insights into human genetics as well as the genetics of millions of other species on the planet. Realizing this great potential, though, will only be achieved through the integration and development of highly scalable computational and quantitative approaches can keep pace with the rapid improvements to biotechnology. In this perspective, we aim to chart out these future technologies, anticipate the major themes of research, and call out the challenges ahead. One of the largest shifts will be in the training used to prepare the class of 2035 for their highly interdisciplinary world.",

    "abstract": "New DNA sequencing technologies are allowing researchers to explore the genomes of the millions of natural history specimens collected prior to the molecular era. Yet, we know little about how well specific next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques work with the degraded DNA typically extracted from museum specimens. Here, we use one type of NGS approach, sequence capture of ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to collect data from bird museum specimens as old as 120 years. We targeted approximately 5,000 UCE loci in 27 Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) representing three evolutionary lineages, and we collected an average of 3,749 UCE loci containing 4,460 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite older specimens producing fewer and shorter loci in general, we collected thousands of markers from even the oldest specimens. More sequencing reads per individual helped to boost the number of UCE loci we recovered from older specimens, but more sequencing was not as successful at increasing the length of loci. We detected contamination in some samples and determined contamination was more prevalent in older samples that were subject to less sequencing. For the phylogeny generated from concatenated UCE loci, contamination led to incorrect placement of some individuals. In contrast, a species tree constructed from SNPs called within UCE loci correctly placed individuals into three monophyletic groups, perhaps because of the stricter analytical procedures we used for SNP calling. This study and other recent studies on the genomics of museums specimens have profound implications for natural history collections, where millions of older specimens should now be considered genomic resources.",

    "abstract": "Rare variant association studies are at a critical inflexion point with the increasing availability of exome-sequencing data. A popular test of association is the sequence kernel association test (SKAT). Weights are embedded within SKAT to reflect the hypothesized contribution of the variants to the trait variance. Correct weighting is expected to boost power, and yet the correct weights are generally unknown. It is therefore important to assess the effect of weight misspecification in SKAT.\\n\\nWe evaluated the behavior of the score and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) under weight misspecification. Simulation and empirical results revealed that LRT is generally more robust and more powerful than score test in such a circumstance. For instance, when the simulated betas were larger for rarer than for more common variants, (incorrectly) assigning equal weights reduced the power of the LRT by [~] 5%, while the score tests power dropped by [~] 30%.\\n\\nTo optimize weighting we proposed a data-driven weighting scheme. With this scheme and LRT we detected significant enrichment of rare case mutations (MAF<5%; P-value=7e-04) of a set of constrained genes in the Swedish schizophre-nia case-control cohort with exome-sequencing data.\\n\\nThe score test is currently preferred for its computational efficiency and power. Indeed, assuming correct specification, in some circumstances the score test is the most powerful test. However, LRT has the compelling qualities of being generally more powerful and more robust to misspecification. This is an important result given that, arguably, misspecified models are likely to be the rule rather than the exception in weighting-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "The paleontological record chronicles numerous episodes of mass extinction that severely culled the Tree of Life. Biologists have long sought to assess the extent to which these events may have impacted particular groups. We present a novel method for detecting mass-extinction events from phylogenies estimated from molecular sequence data. We develop our approach in a Bayesian statistical framework, which enables us to harness prior information on the frequency and magnitude of mass-extinction events. The approach is based on an episodic stochastic-branching process model in which rates of speciation and extinction are constant between rate-shift events. We model three types of events: (1) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in speciation rate; (2) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in extinction rate, and; (3) instantaneous tree-wide mass-extinction events. Each of the events is described by a separate compound Poisson process (CPP) model, where the waiting times between each event are exponentially distributed with event-specific rate parameters. The magnitude of each event is drawn from an event-type specific prior distribution. Parameters of the model are then estimated using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC) algorithm. We demonstrate via simulation that this method has substantial power to detect the number of mass-extinction events, provides unbiased estimates of the timing of mass-extinction events, while exhibiting an appropriate (i.e., below 5%) false discovery rate even in the case of background diversification rate variation. Finally, we provide an empirical application of this approach to conifers, which reveals that this group has experienced two major episodes of mass extinction. This new approach--the CPP on Mass Extinction Times (CoMET) model--provides an effective tool for identifying mass-extinction events from molecular phylogenies, even when the history of those groups includes more prosaic temporal variation in diversification rate.",
