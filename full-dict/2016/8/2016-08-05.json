    "abstract": "Global climate is changing rapidly and is accompanied by large-scale fragmentation and destruction of habitats. Since dispersal is the first line of defense for mobile organisms to cope with such adversities in their environment, it is important to understand the causes and consequences of evolution of dispersal. Although dispersal is a complex phenomenon involving multiple dispersal-traits like propensity (tendency to leave the natal patch) and ability (to travel long distances), the relationship between these traits is not always straight-forward, it is not clear whether these traits can evolve simultaneously or not, and how their interactions affect the overall dispersal profile. To investigate these issues, we subjected four large (N[~]2500) outbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster to artificial selection for increased dispersal, in a setup that mimicked increasing habitat fragmentation over 33 generations. The propensity and ability of the selected populations were significantly greater than the non-selected controls and the difference persisted even in the absence of proximate drivers for dispersal. The dispersal kernel evolved to have significantly greater standard deviation and reduced values of skew and kurtosis, which ultimately translated into the evolution of a greater frequency of long-distance dispersers (LDDs). We also found that although sex-biased dispersal exists in Drosophila melanogaster, its expression can vary depending on which dispersal component is being measured and the environmental condition under which dispersal takes place. Interestingly though, there was no difference between the two sexes in terms of dispersal evolution. We discuss possible reasons for why some of our results do not agree with previous laboratory and field studies. The rapid evolution of multiple components of dispersal and the kernel, expressed even in the absence of stress, indicates that dispersal evolution cannot be ignored while investigating eco-evolutionary phenomena like speed of range expansion, disease spread, evolution of invasive species and destabilization of metapopulation dynamics.\\n\\nData AccessibilityData will be deposited to dryad if accepted.",

    "abstract": "Given the intricacies of the retinal neural circuit, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the brain, it is proposed that retinal function goes beyond mere spatiotemporal prefiltering. We hypothesise that aspects related to motion detection and discrimination, anticipation and adaptation to environmental and contextual conditions, which have traditionally been ascribed to the brain, may be supported by neurons in the retina. Such early computations may be dependent on compensative and adaptive mechanisms that stem from qualities intrinsic to the retinal neural circuit and its interaction with the environment (neural transduction time, connectivity patterns, regularities in the input signal, temporal dynamics and light variations).\\n\\nWith a view to investigating the contribution of the photoreceptor population to the processing performed by the retina in natural scotopic conditions, we present a continuous model of the rod photoreceptor. Our model permits the reproduction and exploration of a set of qualitative features displayed in vitro, such as excitation-dependent activation level and time-to-membrane current integration. We captured qualitative aspects of key features selected for their presumed importance in early visual function. Further, we subjected our model to extensive parameter sensitivity analyses, aiming to provide a visual representation of their contribution to the observed qualitative behavior.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPrimate rod photoreceptor cells constitute the very first processing step in retinal function. This layer influences most of the visual field and presents itself as a tightly packed photosensitive array. Yet, no computational formulation of this neuron is suited for large-scale, time continuous modeling. With a view to studying retinal function in natural contexts, we describe a qualitative, continuous model of the rod. We subject this model to parameter analyses against selected behavioral features. We aim to provide a model that can integrate in further experiments, as well as in large scale network simulation.",

Recent analyses of human pedigrees have called this understanding into question, by revealing unexpectedly low germline mutation rates, which imply that substitutions accrue more slowly than previously believed. Translating mutation rates estimated from pedigrees into substitution rates is not as straightforward as it may seem, however.

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are fundamental for the proper functioning of the cell. As a result, protein interaction surfaces are subject to strong evolutionary constraints. Recent developments have shown that residue co-evolution provides accurate predictions of heterodimeric protein interfaces from sequence information. So far these approaches have been limited to the analysis of families of prokaryotic complexes for which large multiple sequence alignments of homologous sequences can be compiled. We explore the hypothesis that co-evolution points to structurally conserved contacts at protein-protein interfaces, which can be reliably projected to homologous complexes with distantly related sequences. We introduce a novel domain-centred protocol to study the interplay between residue co-evolution and structural conservation of protein-protein interfaces. We show that sequence-based co-evolutionary analysis systematically identifies residue contacts at prokaryotic interfaces that are structurally conserved at the interface of their eukaryotic counterparts. In turn, this allows the prediction of conserved contacts at eukaryotic protein-protein interfaces with high confidence using solely mutational patterns extracted from prokaryotic genomes. Even in the context of high divergence in sequence, where standard homology modelling of protein complexes is unreliable, our approach provides sequence-based accurate information about specific details of protein interactions at the residue level. Selected examples of the application of prokaryotic co-evolutionary analysis to the prediction of eukaryotic interfaces further illustrates the potential of this novel approach.\\n\\nSignificance statementInteracting proteins tend to co-evolve through interdependent changes at the interaction interface. This phenomenon leads to patterns of coordinated mutations that can be exploited to systematically predict contacts between interacting proteins in prokaryotes. We explore the hypothesis that co-evolving contacts at protein interfaces are preferentially conserved through long evolutionary periods. We demonstrate that co-evolving residues in prokaryotes identify inter-protein contacts that are particularly well conserved in the corresponding structure of their eukaryotic homologues. Therefore, these contacts have likely been important to maintain protein-protein interactions during evolution. We show that this property can be used to reliably predict interacting residues between eukaryotic proteins with homologues in prokaryotes even if they are very distantly related in sequence.",

We sequenced the whole genomes of an Early and End Neolithic dog from Germany, including a sample associated with one of Europes earliest farming communities. Both dogs demonstrate continuity with each other and predominantly share ancestry with modern European dogs, contradicting a previously suggested Late Neolithic population replacement. Furthermore, we find no genetic evidence to support the recent hypothesis proposing dual origins of dog domestication. By calibrating the mutation rate using our oldest dog, we narrow the timing of dog domestication to 20,000-40,000 years ago. Interestingly, we do not observe the extreme copy number expansion of the AMY2B gene that is characteristic of modern dogs and has previously been proposed as an adaptation to a starch-rich diet driven by the widespread adoption of agriculture in the Neolithic.",

We focused on different metrics of niche change such as centroid shift, niche overlap and trophic niche breadth using stable isotope analysis ({delta}15N and {delta}13C). Our results showed plasticity in niche overlap between MTs and RTs and niche shift of marble trout when occurring in sympatry with RTs, but not due to a niche replacement of MTs by RTs.

Our method, called phase-corrected LNA (pcLNA) overcomes the main limitations of the standard Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) to remain uniformly accurate for long times, still maintaining the speed and analytically tractability of the LNA. As part of this, we develop analytical expressions for key probability distributions and associated quantities, such as the Fisher Information Matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence and we introduce a new approach to system-global sensitivity analysis. We also present algorithms for statistical inference and for long-term simulation of oscillating systems that are shown to be as accurate but much faster than leaping algorithms and algorithms for integration of diffusion equations. Stochastic versions of published models of the circadian clock and NF-{kappa}B system are used to illustrate our results.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial consortia composed of autotrophic and heterotrophic species abound in nature, yet examples of synthetic communities with mixed metabolism are limited in the laboratory. We previously engineered a model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, to secrete the bulk of the carbon it fixes as sucrose, a carbohydrate that can be utilized by many other microbes. Here, we tested the capability of sucrose-secreting cyanobacteria to act as a flexible platform for the construction of synthetic, light-driven consortia by pairing them with three disparate heterotrophs: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The comparison of these different co-culture dyads reveals general design principles for the construction of robust autotroph/heterotroph consortia.\\n\\nMain findingsWe observed heterotrophic growth dependent upon cyanobacterial photosynthate in each co-culture pair. Furthermore, these synthetic consortia could be stabilized over the long-term (weeks to months) and both species could persist when challenged with specific perturbations. Stability and productivity of autotroph/heterotroph co-cultures was dependent on heterotroph sucrose utilization, as well as other species-independent interactions that we observed across all dyads. One interaction we observed to destabilize consortia was that non-sucrose byproducts of photosynthesis negatively impacted heterotroph growth. Conversely, inoculation of each heterotrophic species enhanced cyanobacterial growth in comparison to axenic cultures Finally, these consortia can be flexibly programmed for photoproduction of target compounds and proteins; by changing the heterotroph in co-culture to specialized strains of B. subtilis or E. coli we demonstrate production of alpha-amylase and polyhydroxybutyrate, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsEnabled by the unprecedented flexibility of this consortia design, we uncover species-independent design principles that influence cyanobacteria/heterotroph consortia robustness. The modular nature of these communities and their unusual robustness exhibits promise as a platform for highly-versatile photoproduction strategies that capitalize on multi-species interactions and could be utilized as a tool for the study of nascent symbioses. Further consortia improvements via engineered interventions beyond those we show here (i.e. increased efficiency growing on sucrose) could improve these communities as production platforms.",

Next-generation sequencing approaches open up the possibility of sampling many more markers from fewer individuals to address the same questions. Here, we applied a target gene capture method to deep sequence [~]1000 independent autosomal regions of a non-model organism, the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus). We devised a sampling scheme based on the predictions of theoretical studies of metapopulations to show that sampling few individuals, but many loci, can be extremely informative to reconstruct the evolutionary history of species. We collected data from a single deme (SID) from Northern Australia and from a scattered sampling representing various locations throughout the Indian Ocean (SCD). We explored the genealogical signature of population dynamics detected from both sampling schemes using an ABC algorithm. We then contrasted these results with those obtained by fitting the data to a non-equilibrium finite island model. Both approaches supported an Nm value [~]40, consistent with philopatry in this species. Finally, we demonstrate through simulation that metapopulations exhibit greater resilience to recent changes in effective size compared to unstructured populations. We propose an empirical approach to detect recent bottlenecks based on our sampling scheme.",

They are found to occur very frequently in protein structures with their number exceeding that of {pi}-helices, though it is considerably less than that of -helices and {beta}-strands.

Taking advantage of this significantly expanded database of PPII-helices, we have analyzed the functional and structural roles of PPII helices as well as determined the amino acid propensity within and around them. Though Pro residues are highly preferred, it is not a mandatory condition for the formation of PPII-helices, since ~40% PPII-helices were found to contain no Proline residues. Aromatic amino acids are avoided within this helix, while Gly, Asn and Asp residues are preferred in the proximal flanking regions. These helices range from 3 to 13 residues in length with the average twist and rise being -121.2{degrees}{+/-}9.2{degrees} and 3.0[A]{+/-}0.1[A] respectively. A majority (~72%) of PPII-helices were found to occur in conjunction with -helices and {beta}-strands, and serve as linkers as well.

Prior to the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes pair, synapse, and recombine to ensure their proper disjunction at anaphase I. Additionally, telomeres tethered at the nuclear envelope cluster in the bouquet configuration where they are subjected to dramatic pulling forces acting from outside of the nucleus. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomere-associated protein Ndj1 is required for bouquet formation. When Ndj1 is absent, these dramatic motions cease and multiple steps of meiosis I prophase progression are delayed. Here we identified Nup2 in a pool of enriched proteins that co-purify with tagged Ndj1 from meiotic cell extracts. Nup2 is a nonessential nucleoporin that functions in nuclear transport, boundary activity, and telomere silencing in mitotically dividing cells. We found that deletion of NUP2 delayed pairing and synapsis during meiosis, and led to decreased spore viability, similar to the ndj1{Delta} mutant phenotype. Surprisingly, the nup2{Delta} ndj1{Delta} double mutant failed to segregate chromosomes, even though the meiotic program continued. These results suggest that a physical impediment to nuclear division is created in the absence of Nup2 and Ndj1. Our deletion analysis of NUP2 identified a previously uncharacterized 125-amino acid region that is both necessary and sufficient to complement all of nup2{Delta}s meiotic phenotypes, which we call the meiotic autonomous region (MAR). We propose that Ndj1 and Nup2 function in parallel pathways to promote the dynamic chromosome events of meiotic chromosome dynamics, perhaps through the establishment or maintenance of higher-order chromosome organization.",

Most existing genome browsers were designed for data exploration by individual users, while a few allow some limited forms of collaboration among multiple users, such as file sharing and wiki-style collaborative editing of gene annotations. Our works premise is that allowing sharing of genome browser views instantaneously in real-time enables the exchange of ideas and insight in a collaborative project, thus harnessing the wisdom of the crowd. PBrowse is a parallel-access real-time collaborative web-based genome browser that provides both an integrated, real-time collaborative platform and a comprehensive file sharing system. PBrowse also allows real-time track comment and has integrated group chat to facilitate interactive discussion among multiple users. Through the Distributed Annotation Server protocol, PBrowse can easily access a wide range of publicly available genomic data, such as the ENCODE data sets. We argue that PBrowse, with the re-designed user management, data management and novel collaborative layer based on Biodalliance, represents a paradigm shift from seeing genome browser merely as a tool of data visualisation to a tool that enables real-time human-human interaction and knowledge exchange in a collaborative setting.\\n\\nAvailabilityPBrowse is available at http://pbrowse.victorchang.edu.au, and its source code is available via the open source BSD 3 license at http://github.com/VCCRI/PBrowse.\\n\\nContactj.ho@victorchang.edu.au\\n\\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary video demonstrating collaborative feature of pbrowse is available in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROvKXZoXiIc.",

This approach revealed that: 1) TADs and LADs correspond to isochores, i.e., isochores are the genomic units that underlie chromatin domains; 2) the conservation of TADs and LADs in mammalian genomes is explained by the evolutionary conservation of isochores; 3) chromatin domains corresponding to GC-poor isochores (e.g., LADs) interact with other domains also corresponding to GC-poor isochores even if located far away on the chromosomes; in contrast, chromatin domains corresponding to GC-rich isochores (e.g., TADs) show more localized chromosomal interactions, many of which are inter-chromosomal. In conclusion, this investigation establishes a link between DNA sequences and chromatin architecture, explains the evolutionary conservation of TADs and LADs and provides new information on the spatial distribution of GC-poor/gene-poor and GC-rich/gene-rich chromosomal regions in the interphase nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and the affective disorders, here comprising bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, are psychiatric illnesses that lead to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Whilst understanding of their pathobiology remains limited, large case-control studies have recently identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these disorders. However, discerning the functional effects of these SNPs has been difficult as the associated causal genes are unknown. Here we evaluated whether schizophrenia and affective disorder associated-SNPs are correlated with gene expression within human brain tissue. Specifically, to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), we leveraged disorder-associated SNPs identified from six Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and CONVERGE Consortium studies with gene expression levels in post-mortem, neurologically-normal tissue from two independent human brain tissue expression datasets (UK Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)). We identified 6 188 and 16 720 cis-acting SNPs exceeding genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8) in the UKBEC and GTEx datasets, respectively. 1 288 cis-eQTLs were significant in a metaanalysis leveraging overlapping brain regions and were associated with expression of 15 genes, including three non-coding RNAs. One cis-eQTL, rs 16969968, results in a functionally disruptive missense mutation in CHRNA5, a schizophrenia-implicated gene. Meta-analysis identified 297 trans-eQTLs associated with 24 genes that were significant in a region-specific manner. Importantly, comparing across tissues, we find that blood eQTLs largely do not capture brain cis-eQTLs. This study identifies putatively causal genes whose expression in region-specific brain tissue may contribute to the risk of schizophrenia and affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "Pattern formation during development is a highly dynamic process. In spite of this, few experimental and modelling approaches take into account the explicit time-dependence of the rules governing regulatory systems. We address this problem by studying dynamic morphogen interpretation by the gap gene network in Drosophila melanogaster. Gap genes are involved in segment determination during early embryogenesis. They are activated by maternal morphogen gradients encoded by bicoid (bcd) and caudal (cad). These gradients decay at the same time-scale as the establishment of the antero-posterior gap gene pattern. We use a reverse-engineering approach, based on data-driven regulatory models called gene circuits, to isolate and characterise the explicitly time-dependent effects of changing morphogen concentrations on gap gene regulation. To achieve this, we simulate the system in the presence and absence of dynamic gradient decay. Comparison between these simulations reveals that maternal morphogen decay controls the timing and limits the rate of gap gene expression. In the anterior of the embyro, it affects peak expression and leads to the establishment of smooth spatial boundaries between gap domains. In the posterior of the embryo, it causes a progressive slow-down in the rate of gap domain shifts, which is necessary to correctly position domain boundaries and to stabilise the spatial gap gene expression pattern. We use a newly developed method for the analysis of transient dynamics in non-autonomous (time-variable) systems to understand the regulatory causes of these effects. By providing a rigorous mechanistic explanation for the role of maternal gradient decay in gap gene regulation, our study demonstrates that such analyses are feasible and reveal important aspects of dynamic gene regulation which would have been missed by a traditional steady-state approach. More generally, it highlights the importance of transient dynamics for understanding complex regulatory processes in development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimal development is a highly dynamic process. Biochemical or environmental signals can cause the rules that shape it to change over time. We know little about the effects of such changes. For the sake of simplicity, we usually leave them out of our models and experimental assays. Here, we do exactly the opposite. We characterise precisely those aspects of pattern formation caused by changing signalling inputs to a gene regulatory network, the gap gene system of Drosophila melanogaster. Gap genes are involved in determining the body segments of flies and other insects during early development. Gradients of maternal morphogens activate the expression of the gap genes. These gradients are highly dynamic themselves, as they decay while being read out. We show that this decay controls the peak concentration of gap gene products, produces smooth boundaries of gene expression, and slows down the observed positional shifts of gap domains in the posterior of the embryo, thereby stabilising the spatial pattern. Our analysis demonstrates that the dynamics of gene regulation not only affect the timing, but also the positioning of gene expression. This suggests that we must pay closer attention to transient dynamic aspects of development than is currently the case.",

    "abstract": "Insects determine their body segments in two different ways. Short-germband insects, such as the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, use a molecular clock to establish segments sequentially. In contrast, long-germband insects, such as the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, determine all segments simultaneously through a hierarchical cascade of gene regulation. Gap genes constitute the first layer of the Drosophila segmentation gene hierarchy, downstream of maternal gradients such as that of Caudal (Cad). We use data-driven mathematical modelling and phase space analysis to show that shifting gap domains in the posterior half of the Drosophila embryo are an emergent property of a robust damped oscillator mechanism, suggesting that the regulatory dynamics underlying long- and short-germband segmentation are much more similar than previously thought. In Tribolium, Cad has been proposed to modulate the frequency of the segmentation oscillator. Surprisingly, our simulations and experiments show that the shift rate of posterior gap domains is independent of maternal Cad levels in Drosophila. Our results suggest a novel evolutionary scenario for the short- to long-germband transition, and help explain why this transition occurred convergently multiple times during the radiation of the holometabolan insects.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDifferent insect species exhibit one of two distinct modes of determining their body segments during development: they either use a molecular oscillator to position segments sequentially, or they generate segments simultaneously through a hierarchical gene-regulatory cascade. The sequential mode is ancestral, while the simultaneous mode has been derived from it independently several times during evolution. In this paper, we present evidence which suggests that simultaneous segmentation also involves an oscillator in the posterior of the embryo of the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This surprising result indicates that both modes of segment determination are much more similar than previously thought. Such similarity provides an important step towards explaining the frequent evolutionary transitions between sequential and simultaneous segmentation.",

Here, we highlight the need for approaches that complement RNA-seq, discover that northern blotting of small RNAs is biased against short sequences, and develop a protocol that removes this bias. We found that multiple small RNA-seq datasets from the worm C. elegans had shorter forms of miRNAs that appear to be degradation products that arose during the preparatory steps required for RNA-seq. When using northern blotting during these studies, we discovered that miRNA-length probes can have a ~360-fold bias against detecting even synthetic sequences that are 8 nt shorter. By using shorter probes and by performing hybridization and washes at low temperatures, we greatly reduced this bias to enable equivalent detection of 24 nt to 14 nt RNAs. Our protocol can better discriminate RNAs that differ by a single nucleotide and can detect specific miRNAs present in total RNA from C. elegans. This improved northern blotting is particularly useful to obtain a measure of small RNA integrity, analyze products of RNA processing or turnover, and analyze functional RNAs that are shorter than typical miRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Process point of view models of mortality, such as the Strehler-Mildvan and stochastic vitality models, represent death in terms of the loss of survival capacity through challenges and dissipation. Drawing on hallmarks of aging, we link these concepts to candidate biological mechanisms through a framework that defines death as challenges to vitality where distal factors defined the age-evolution of vitality and proximal factors define the probability distribution of challenges. To illustrate the process point of view, we hypothesize that the immune system is a mortality nexus, characterized by two vitality streams: increasing vitality representing immune system development and immunosenescence representing vitality dissipation. Proximal challenges define three mortality partitions: juvenile and adult extrinsic mortalities and intrinsic adult mortality. Model parameters, generated from Swedish mortality data (1751-2010), exhibit biologically meaningful correspondences to economic, health and cause-of-death patterns. The model characterizes the 20th century epidemiological transition mainly as a reduction in extrinsic mortality resulting from a shift from high magnitude disease challenges on individuals at all vitality levels to low magnitude stress challenges on low vitality individuals. Of secondary importance, intrinsic mortality was described by a gradual reduction in the rate of loss of vitality presumably resulting from reduction in the rate of immunosenescence. Extensions and limitations of a distal/proximal framework for characterizing more explicit causes of death, e.g. the young adult mortality hump or cancer in old age are discussed.",

    "abstract": "While bacteria divide clonally, horizontal gene transfer followed by homologous recombination is now recognized as an important and sometimes even dominant contributor to their evolution. However, the details of how the competition between clonal inheritance and recombination shapes genome diversity, population structure, and species stability remains poorly understood. Using a computational model, we find two principal regimes in bacterial evolution and identify two composite parameters that dictate the evolutionary fate of bacterial species. In the divergent regime, characterized by either a low recombination frequency or strict barriers to recombination, cohesion due to recombination is not sufficient to overcome the mutational drift. As a consequence, the divergence between any pair of genomes in the population steadily increases in the course of their evolution. The species as a whole lacks genetic coherence with sexually isolated clonal sub-populations continuously formed and dissolved. In contrast, in the metastable regime, characterized by a high recombination frequency combined with low barriers to recombination, genomes continuously recombine with the rest of the population. The population remains genetically cohesive and stable over time. The transition between these two regimes can be affected by relatively small changes in evolutionary parameters. Using the Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) data we classify a number of well-studied bacterial species to be either the divergent or the metastable type. Generalizations of our framework to include fitness and selection, ecologically structured populations, and horizontal gene transfer of non-homologous regions are discussed.",

In this paper we explore the ecological mechanisms of multicellular diversification during experimental evolution of the brewers yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The evolution from single cells into multicellular clusters modifies the structure of the environment, changing the fluid dynamics and creating novel ecological opportunities.

To identify factors that affect hematopoiesis, we performed association studies for blood cell traits in the population-based Estonian Biobank using high coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 2,284 samples and SNP genotyping in an additional ~17,000 samples. Our analyses identified 17 associations across 14 blood cell traits. Integration of WGS-based fine-mapping and complementary epigenomic data sets provided evidence for causal mechanisms at several loci, including at a novel basophil count-associated locus near the master hematopoietic transcription factor CEBPA. The fine-mapped variant at this basophil count association near CEBPA overlapped an enhancer active in common myeloid progenitors and influenced its activity. In situ perturbation of this enhancer by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells demonstrated that it is necessary for and specifically regulates CEBPA expression during basophil differentiation. We additionally identified basophil count-associated variation at another more pleiotropic myeloid enhancer near GATA2, highlighting regulatory mechanisms for ordered expression of master hematopoietic regulators during lineage specification. Our study illustrates how population-based genetic studies can provide key insights into poorly understood cell differentiation processes of considerable physiologic relevance.",

We performed extracellular recordings of large populations of hippocampal region CA1 neurons in freely moving rats across sleep and waking states. Throughout non-REM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, we observed periods of diminished oscillatory and population spiking activity lasting on the order of seconds, which we refer to as \\\"LOW\\\" activity sleep states. LOW states featured enhanced firing in a subset of \\\"LOW-active\\\" cells, and greater firing in putative interneurons compared to DOWN/OFF states. LOW activity sleep was preceded and followed by increased sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity. We also observed decreased slow-wave activity (SWA) and sleep spindles in the hippocampus local-field potential (LFP) and neocortical electroencephalogram (EEG) upon LOW onset, but only a partial rebound immediately after LOW. LOW states demonstrated LFP, EEG, and EMG patterns consistent with sleep, but frequently transitioned into microarousals (MAs) and showed EMG and LFP spectral differences from previously described small-amplitude irregular activity (SIA) during quiet waking. Their likelihood increased over the course of sleep, particularly following REM sleep. To confirm that LOW is a brain-wide phenomenon, we analyzed data from the entorhinal cortex of rats, medial prefrontal cortex, and anterior thalamus of mice, obtained from crcns.org and found that LOW states corresponded to markedly diminished activity simultaneously in all of these regions. We propose that LOW states are an important microstate within non-REM sleep that provide respite from high-activity sleep, and may serve a restorative function.",

Although widespread, the use of these alternative categories could obscure further heterogeneity due to inter-population differences in effective size, growth rate, and timing or amount of gene flow. We compared intra and interpopulation variation measures combining novel and literature data relative to 87,818 autosomal SNPs in 14 open populations and 10 geographic and/or linguistic European isolates. Patterns of intra-population diversity were found to vary significantly more among isolates, probably due to differential levels of drift and inbreeding. The relatively large effective size estimated for some population isolates challenges the generalized view that they originate from small founding groups. Principal component scores based on measures of intra-population variation of isolated and open populations turned out to be distributed along a sort of continuum, with an area of intersection between the two groups. Patterns of inter-population diversity were even closer, as we were able to detect some differences between population groups only for a few multidimensional scaling dimensions. Therefore, different lines of evidence suggest that dichotomizing human populations into open and isolated fails to capture the actual relations among their genomic features.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization presents unique environmental challenges to human commensal species. The Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex contains a number of synanthropic mosquito species that are major vectors of malaria. To examine ongoing cryptic diversification within the complex, we performed reduced representation sequencing on 941 mosquitoes collected across four ecogeographic zones in Cameroon. We find evidence for clear subdivision within An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. - the two most significant malaria vectors in the region. Importantly, in both species rural and urban populations of mosquitoes were genetically differentiated. Genome scans of cryptic subgroups reveal pervasive signatures of selection centered on genes involved in xenobiotic resistance. Notably, a selective sweep containing eight detoxification enzymes is unique to urban mosquitoes that exploit polluted breeding sites. Overall, our study reveals that anthropogenic environmental modification is driving population differentiation and local adaptation in African malaria mosquitoes with potentially significant consequences for malaria epidemiology.",
