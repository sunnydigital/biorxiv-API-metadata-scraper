    "abstract": "Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation and is, therefore, central to evolutionary change. Previous work on Paramecium tetraurelia found an unusually low germline base-substitution mutation rate in this ciliate. Here, we tested the generality of this result among ciliates using Tetrahymena thermophila. We sequenced the genomes of 10 lines of T. thermophila that had each undergone approximately 1,000 generations of mutation accumulation (MA). We applied an existing mutation-calling pipeline and developed a new probabilistic mutation detection approach that directly models the design of an MA experiment and accommodates the noise introduced by mismapped reads. Our probabilistic mutation-calling method provides a straightforward way of estimating the number of sites at which a mutation could have been called if one was present, providing the denominator for our mutation rate calculations. From these methods, we find that T. thermophila has a germline base-substitution mutation rate of 7.61 x 10-12 per site, per cell division, which is consistent with the low base-substitution mutation rate in P. tetraurelia. Over the course of the evolution experiment, genomic exclusion lines derived from the MA lines experienced a fitness decline that cannot be accounted for by germline base-substitution mutations alone, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors must be involved. Because selection can only operate to reduce mutation rates based upon the \\\"visible\\\" mutational load, asexual reproduction with a transcriptionally silent germline may allow ciliates to evolve extremely low germline mutation rates.",

    "abstract": "Scientists have been unable to reach a consensus on why organisms age and why they live as long as they do. Here, a multidisciplinary approach was taken in an attempt to understand the root causes of aging. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics may play a previously unappreciated role in determining longevity by governing the dynamics of degradation and renewal within biomolecular ensembles and dictating the inevitability of fidelity loss. The proposed model offers explanations for species longevity trends that have been previously unexplained and for aging-related observations that are considered paradoxical within current paradigms--for example, the elevated damage levels found even in youth within many long-lived species, such as the naked mole-rat. This framework questions whether declining selective pressure is the primary driver of aging, and challenges major tenets of the disposable soma theory. Unifying pertinent principles from diverse disciplines leads to a theoretical framework of biological aging with fewer anomalies, and may be useful in predicting outcomes of experimental attempts to modulate the aging phenotype.",

A set of modular bioinformatic tools and workflows was implemented as the Metavisitor package in the Galaxy framework. Using the graphical Galaxy workflow editor, users with minimal computational skills can use existing Metavisitor workflows or adapt them to suit specific needs by adding or modifying analysis modules. Metavisitor can be used on our Mississippi server, or can be installed on any Galaxy server instance and a pre-configured Metavisitor server image is provided. Metavisitor works with DNA, RNA or small RNA sequencing data over a range of read lengths and can use a combination of de novo and guided approaches to assemble genomes from sequencing reads. We show that the software has the potential for quick diagnosis as well as discovery of viruses from a vast array of organisms. Importantly, we provide here executable Metavisitor use cases, which increase the accessibility and transparency of the software, ultimately enabling biologists or clinicians to focus on biological or medical questions.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 grows in the presence of membrane-permeant organic acids that can depress cytoplasmic pH and accumulate in the cytoplasm. We conducted experimental evolution by daily diluting cultures in increasing concentrations of benzoic acid (up to 20 mM) buffered at external pH 6.5, a pH at which permeant acids concentrate in the cytoplasm. By 2,000 generations, clones isolated from evolving populations showed increasing tolerance to benzoate but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Sixteen clones grew to stationary phase in 20 mM benzoate, whereas the ancestral strain W3110 peaked and declined. Similar growth occurred in 10 mM salicylate. Benzoate-evolved strains grew like W3110 in the absence of benzoate; in media buffered at pH 4.8, pH 7.0, or pH 9.0; or in 20 mM acetate or sorbate at pH 6.5. Genomes of 16 strains revealed over 100 mutations including SNPs, large deletions, and insertion knockouts. Most strains acquired deletions in the benzoate-induced multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) regulon or in associated regulators such as rob and cpxA, as well as MDR efflux pumps emrA, emrY, and mdtA. Strains also lost or down-regulated the Gad acid fitness regulon. In 5 mM benzoate, or in 2 mM salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate), most strains showed increased sensitivity to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracycline; some strains were more sensitive than a marA knockout. Thus, our benzoate-evolved strains may reveal additional unknown drug resistance components. Benzoate or salicylate selection pressure may cause general loss of MDR genes and regulators.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBenzoate is a common food preservative, and salicylate is the primary active metabolite of aspirin. In the gut microbiome, genetic adaptation to salicylate may involve loss or downregulation of inducible multidrug resistance systems. This discovery implies that aspirin therapy may modulate the human gut microbiome to favor salicylate tolerance at the expense of drug resistance. Similar aspirin-associated loss of drug resistance might occur in bacterial pathogens found in arterial plaques.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the contents of many (membrane-free) nuclear \\\"bodies\\\" exchange rapidly with the soluble pool whilst the underlying structure persists; such observations await a satisfactory biophysical explanation. To shed light on this, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of a chromatin fiber interacting with an ensemble of (multivalent) DNA-binding proteins; these proteins switch between two states - active (binding) and inactive (non-binding). This system provides a model for any DNA-binding protein that can be modified post-translationally to change its affinity for DNA (e.g., like the phosphorylation of a transcription factor). Due to this out-of-equilibrium process, proteins spontaneously assemble into clusters of self-limiting size, as individual proteins in a cluster exchange with the soluble pool with kinetics like those seen in photo-bleaching experiments. This behavior contrasts sharply with that exhibited by \\\"equilibrium\\\", or non-switching, proteins that exist only in the binding state; when these bind to DNA non-specifically, they form clusters that grow indefinitely in size. Our results point to post-translational modification of chromatin-bridging proteins as a generic mechanism driving the self-assembly of highly dynamic, non-equilibrium, protein clusters with the properties of nuclear bodies. Such active modification also reshapes intra-chromatin contacts to give networks resembling those seen in topologically-associating domains, as switching markedly favors local (short-range) contacts over distant ones.",

    "abstract": "Since the Zika outbreaks are unprecedented human threat in relation to congenital malformations and neurological/autoimmune complications as well as its high potential to spread in regions presenting the vectors, improvements in mosquito control is a top priority. Thus, Aedes aegypti laboratory strains will be fundamental to support studies in different research fields implicated on Zika-mosquito interactions which are the basis for the development of innovative control methods. In this sense, we determined the main infection aspects of the Brazilian Zika strain in reference Aedes aegypti laboratory mosquitoes.\\n\\nWe orally exposed Rockefeller, Higgs and Rexville mosquitoes to a Brazilian ZIKV (ZIKVBR) and qRT-PCR was applied to determine the infection and dissemination rates, and viral levels in mosquito tissues as well as in the saliva. The ZIKVBR kinetics was monitored during the infection in Rockefeller mosquitoes. Rockefeller strain was the most susceptible at 7 days post-infection but all strains presented similar infection levels at 14 days post-infection. Although variations in the saliva detection rates were observed, we confirmed that ZIKVBR was present in saliva from Rockefeller, Higgs and Rexville females at detectable levels at 14 days post-infection. The ZIKVBR kinetics in Rockefeller mosquitoes showed that the virus could be detected in the heads at 4 days post-infection but was more consistently detected late in infection. The viral levels peaked at 11 days post-infection in the mosquito bodies, remaining stable until 14 days post-infection, in contrast to the heads, where the mean viral levels only peaked at 14 days post-infection.\\n\\nOur study presents the first evaluation on how Brazilian Zika virus behaves in reference Aedes aegypti strains and shed light on how the infection evolves over time. Vector competence and basic hallmarks of the ZIKVBR development were revealed in laboratory mosquitoes. This study provides additional information to accelerate studies focusing on ZIKV-mosquito interactions.",

    "abstract": "The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, where the emergence of antibiotic resistance is a global public-health concern. Host factors such as age and the presence of co-morbidities have been implicated in a worse outcome for patient. However, this is complicated by the highly complex and multi-faceted nature of bacterial virulence, which has so far prevented a robust mapping between genotype, phenotype and infection outcome. To investigate the role of bacterial and host factors in contributing to S. aureus bacteraemia-associated mortality we sequenced a collection of clinical isolates (of the MLST clonal complex CC22) from patients with bloodstream infections and quantified specific virulence phenotypes. A genome-wide association scan identified several novel virulence-affecting loci, which we validated using a functional genomics approach. Analysing the data comprising bacterial genotype and phenotype as well as clinical meta-data within a machine-learning framework revealed that mortality associated with CC22 bacteraemia is not only influenced by the interactions between host and bacterial factors but can also be predicted at the individual patient-level to a high degree of accuracy. This study clearly demonstrates the potential of using a combined genomics and data analytic approach to enhance our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis. Considering both host and microbial factors, including whole genome sequence and phenotype data, within a predictive framework could thus pave the way towards personalised medicine and infectious disease management.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are important metabolic organelles involved in the catabolism of several lipid classes, e.g. very-long-chain fatty acids. Malfunction or absence of peroxisomes leads to accumulation of educts for peroxisomal {beta}-oxidation and mitochondrial damage, resulting in fatal perturbation of metabolism. The impact of peroxisome deficiency on mitochondria is not elucidated yet. Here we present a model of Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4)-induced lipotoxicity and accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) as the cause for mitochondrial damage in consequence of peroxisome loss in a Peroxin19 (pex19) mutant. Hyperactive Hnf4 signaling leads to upregulation of lipase 3 and enzymes for mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation. This results in enhanced lipolysis, elevated concentrations of NEFA, maximal {beta}-oxidation and mitochondrial swelling. NEFA are ligands for Hnf4 and further enhance its activity. By genetic removal of Hnf4 in pex19 mutants, lipotoxicity and mitochondrial swelling are reduced and their survival is rescued.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPeroxisomes are cell organelles which play a major role in lipid metabolism. They interact with mitochondria, the organelles which are responsible for cellular energy production. Loss of peroxisomes, as it occurs in the rare, inheritable human disease class of Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders, is lethal. Over the past couple of years, a number of studies showed that peroxisome loss leads to mitochondrial damage as a secondary consequence, but the underlying mechanism has not been understood yet. In our study, we use a mutant of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster as a model for Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders and find that a protein called Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 is hyperactive upon peroxisome loss, which provokes the mobilization of storage fat and, as a consequence, the accumulation of toxic free fatty acids. These enter the mitochondria, but cannot be used for energy gain. Free fatty acids are then trapped in the mitochondria and lead to their swelling and damage, which provides an explanation for mitochondrial defects in Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorders. Genetic reduction of Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 activity rescues the viability of the peroxisome mutant by reducing the accumulation of free fatty acids and the subsequent mitochondrial damage, which might provide a novel target for therapy development.",

    "abstract": "Addressing the transmission enigma of the neglected disease Buruli ulcer (BU) is a World Health Organization priority. In Australia, we have observed an association between mosquitoes harboring the causative agent, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and BU. Here we tested a contaminated skin model of BU transmission by dipping the tails from healthy mice in cultures of the causative agent, Mycobacterium ulcerans. Tails were exposed to mosquito (Aedes notoscriptus and Aedes aegypti) blood feeding or punctured with sterile needles. Two of 11 of mice with M. ulcerans contaminated tails exposed to feeding A. notoscriptus mosquitoes developed BU. Eighteen of 20 mice subjected to contaminated tail needle puncture developed BU. Mouse tails coated only in bacteria did not develop disease. We observed a low infectious dose-50 of four colony-forming units and a median incubation time of 12 weeks, consistent with data from human infections. We have uncovered a highly efficient and biologically plausible atypical transmission mode of BU via natural or anthropogenic skin punctures.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBuruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. Unfortunately, how people contract this disease is not well understood. Here we show for the first time using experimental infections in mice that a very low dose of M. ulcerans delivered beneath the skin by a minor injury caused by a blood-feeding insect (mosquito) or a needle puncture is sufficient to cause Buruli ulcer.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacteria modulate subcellular processes to handle stressful environments. Genome-wide profiling of gene expression (RNA-Seq) and fitness (Tn-Seq) allows two views of the same genetic network underlying these responses. However, it remains unclear how they combine, enabling a bacterium to overcome a perturbation.\\n\\nResultsHere we generate RNA-Seq and Tn-Seq profiles in three strains of S. pneumoniae in response to stress defined by different levels of nutrient depletion. These profiles show that genes that change their expression and/or become phenotypically important come from a diverse set of functional categories, and genes that are phenotypically important tend to be highly expressed. Surprisingly, we find that expression and fitness changes rarely occur on the same gene, which we confirmed by over 140 validation experiments. To rationalize these unexpected results we built the first genome-scale metabolic model of S. pneumoniae showing that differential expression and phenotypic importance actually correlate between nearest neighbors, although they are distinctly partitioned into small subnetworks. Moreover, a meta-analysis of 234 S. pneumoniae gene expression studies reveals that essential genes and phenotypically important subnetworks rarely change expression, indicating that they are shielded from transcriptional fluctuations and that a clear distinction exists between transcriptional and phenotypic response networks.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a genome-wide computational/experimental approach that contextualizes changes that occur on transcriptomic and phenomic levels in response to stress. Importantly, this highlights the need to connect disparate response networks, for instance in antibiotic target identification, where preferred targets are phenotypically important genes that would be overlooked by transcriptomic analyses alone.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a global threat to human health. The problem is aggravated by unnecessary and incorrect use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. One way to provide correct treatment and to slow down the development of antibiotic resistance is to assay the susceptibility profile of the infecting bacteria before treatment is initiated and let this information guide the choice of antibiotic. However, current methods for Antibiotics Susceptibility Testing (AST) are too slow for point of care application. Here we present a fast AST, fASTest, that rapidly captures individual bacterial cells in nanofluidics channels and monitors their response to different antibiotics based on direct imaging. By averaging the growth rate over many cells, we determined the susceptibility to several antibiotics in less than 25 min even at cell densities as low as 104 CFU/mL. The short time scale, high sensitivity and high specificity make the method practically useful for guiding antibiotic treatment in, for example, urinary tract infections.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryIndividual bacterial cells can be captured and imaged in a microfluidic device to determine how their growth rate responds to antibiotic treatment in a few minutes.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are RNA N-glycosidases that depurinate a specific adenine residue in the conserved sarcin/ricin loop of 28S rRNA. These enzymes are widely distributed among plants and their presence has also been confirmed in several bacterial species. Recently, we reported for the first time in silico evidence of RIP encoding genes in metazoans, in two closely related species of insects: Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Here, we have experimentally confirmed the presence of these genes in mosquitoes and attempted to unveil their evolutionary history. A detailed study was conducted, including evaluation of taxonomic distribution, phylogenetic inferences and microsynteny analyses, indicating that the culicine RIP genes derived from a single Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) event, probably from a Cyanobacterial donor species. Moreover, evolutionary analyses show that, after transference, these genes evolved under purifying selection, strongly suggesting that they play functional roles in these organisms. In this work we confirm the presence of RIP genes in Culicinae species, and show solid evidence supporting the hypothesis that these genes are derived from a single prokaryotic transferred gene through HGT. In addition, clear evidence of purifying selection pressure has been recorded, supporting the hypothesis that these genes are functional within this subfamily.",

    "abstract": "Mating is a ubiquitous social interaction with the potential to influence the microbiome by facilitating transmission, modifying host physiology, and in species where males donate nuptial gifts to females, altering diet. We manipulated mating and nuptial gift consumption in two insects that differ in nuptial gift size, the Mormon cricket Anabrus simplex and the decorated cricket Gryllodes sigillatus, with the expectation that larger gifts are more likely to affect the gut microbiome. Surprisingly, mating, but not nuptial gift consumption, affected bacterial community structure, and only in Mormon crickets. The change in structure was due to a precipitous drop in the abundance of lactic-acid bacteria in unmated females, a taxon known for their beneficial effects on nutrition and immunity. Mating did not affect phenoloxidase or lysozyme-like antibacterial activity in either species, suggesting that any physiological response to mating on host-microbe interactions is decoupled from the systemic immunity. Protein supplementation also did not affect the gut microbiome in decorated crickets, suggesting that insensitivity of gut microbes to dietary protein could contribute to the lack of an effect of nuptial gift consumption. Our study provides experimental evidence that sexual interactions can affect the microbiome and suggests mating can promote beneficial gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "While women are generally underrepresented in STEM fields, there are noticeable differences between fields. For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation. Both in biology and in computational biology, a female last author increases the probability of other authors on the paper being female, pointing to a potential role of female PIs in influencing the gender balance.",
