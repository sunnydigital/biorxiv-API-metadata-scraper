    "abstract": "Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), a promising technology for exploring ribosome decoding rates, is characterized by the presence of infrequent high peaks in ribosome footprint density and by long alignment gaps. Here, to reduce the impact of the data heterogeneity we introduce a simple normalization method, Ribo-seq Unit Step Transformation (RUST). RUST is robust and outperforms other normalization techniques in the presence of heterogeneous noise. We illustrate how RUST can be used for identifying mRNA sequence features that affect ribosome footprint densities globally. We show that a few parameters extracted with RUST are sufficient for predicting experimental densities with high accuracy. Importantly the application of RUST to 30 publicly available Ribo-seq datasets revealed a substantial variation in sequence determinants of ribosome footprint frequencies, questioning the reliability of Ribo-seq as an accurate representation of local ribosome densities without prior quality control. This emphasizes our incomplete understanding of how protocol parameters affect ribosome footprint densities.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heritable cardiovascular disorder that affects 1 in 500 people. In infants it can be particularly severe and it is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in pediatric populations. A high percentage of HCM is attributed to mutations in {beta}-cardiac myosin, the motor protein that powers ventricular contraction. This study reports how two mutations that cause early-onset HCM, D239N and H251N, affect the mechanical output of human {beta}-cardiac myosin at the molecular level. We observe extremely large increases (25% - 95%) in the actin gliding velocity, single molecule intrinsic force, and ATPase activity of the two mutant myosin motors compared to wild type myosin. In contrast to previous studies of HCM-causing mutations in human {beta}-cardiac myosin, these mutations were striking in that they caused changes in biomechanical parameters that were both greater in magnitude and more uniformly consistent with a hyper-contractile phenotype. In addition, S1-S2 binding studies revealed a significant decrease in affinity of the H251N motor for S2, suggesting that this mutation may further increase hyper-contractility by releasing active motors from a sequestered state. This report shows, for the first time, a clear and significant gain in function for all tested molecular biomechanical parameters due to HCM mutations in human {beta}-cardiac myosin.",

Such a device could be used as a memory unit for biological computing systems designed to operate in noisy environments. We discuss a recent implementation of an exclusive switch in living cells, the recombinase addressable data (RAD) module. In order to understand the behavior of a RAD module we compute the exact time dependent distributions of the two expressed genes starting in one state and evolving to another asymptotic state. We consider two operating regimes of the RAD module: fast and slow stochastic switching. The fast regime is \\\"aggregative\\\" and produces unimodal distributions, whereas the slow regime is \\\"separative\\\" and produces bimodal distributions. Both regimes can serve to prepare pure memory states when all cells are expressing the same gene. The slow regime can also separate mixed states by producing two sub-populations each one expressing a different gene. Our model provides a simplified, general phenomenological framework for studying biological memory devices and our analytic solution can be further used to clarify theoretical concepts in bio-computation and for optimal design in synthetic biology.",

This instability has been explained by the ability of R-loops to induce DNA damage. Here, we show that persistent R-loops also compromise DNA repair. Depleting endogenous RNase H activity impairs R-loop removal in budding yeast, causing DNA damage that occurs preferentially in the repetitive ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA). We analyzed the repair kinetics of this damage and identified mutants that modulate repair. Our results indicate that persistent R-loops in the rDNA induce damage that is slowly repaired by break-induced replication (BIR). Furthermore, R-loop induced BIR at the rDNA leads to lethal repair intermediates when RNA polymerase I elongation is compromised. We present a model to explain how removal of R-loops by RNase H is critical in ensuring the efficient repair of R-loop induced DNA damage by pathways other than BIR.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that many immune diseases occur at different rates among people with schizophrenia compared to the general population. Here, we evaluated whether this phenotypic correlation between immune diseases and schizophrenia might be explained by shared genetic risk factors (genetic correlation). We used data from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia (N=35,476 cases and 46,839 controls) to compare the genetic architecture of schizophrenia to 19 immune diseases. First, we evaluated the association with schizophrenia of 581 variants previously reported to be associated with immune diseases at genome-wide significance. We identified three variants with pleiotropic effects, located in regions associated with both schizophrenia and immune disease. Our analyses provided the strongest evidence of pleiotropy at rs1734907 ([~]85kb upstream of EPHB4), a variant which was associated with increased risk of both Crohns disease (OR = 1.16, P = 1.67x10-13) and schizophrenia (OR = 1.07, P = 7.55x10-6). Next, we investigated genome-wide sharing of common variants between schizophrenia and immune diseases using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and cross-trait LD Score regression (LDSC). PRS revealed significant genetic overlap with schizophrenia for narcolepsy (p=4.1x10-4), primary biliary cirrhosis (p=1.4x10-8), psoriasis (p=3.6x10-5), systemic lupus erythematosus (p=2.2x10-8), and ulcerative colitis (p=4.3x10-4). Genetic correlations between these immune diseases and schizophrenia, estimated using LDSC, ranged from 0.10 to 0.18 and were consistent with the expected phenotypic correlation based on epidemiological data. We also observed suggestive evidence of sex-dependent genetic correlation between schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis (interaction p=0.02), with genetic risk scores for multiple sclerosis associated with greater risk of schizophrenia among males but not females. Our findings suggest that shared genetic risk factors contribute to the epidemiological co-occurrence of schizophrenia and certain immune diseases, and suggest that in some cases this genetic correlation is sex-dependent.\n\nAuthor SummaryImmune diseases occur at different rates among patients with schizophrenia compared to the general population. While the reasons for this phenotypic correlation are unclear, shared genetic risk (genetic correlation) has been proposed as a contributing factor. Prior studies have estimated the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and a handful of immune diseases, with conflicting results. Here, we performed a comprehensive cross-disorder investigation of schizophrenia and 19 immune diseases. We identified three individual genetic variants associated with both schizophrenia and immune diseases, including a variant near EPHB4 - a gene whose protein product guides the migration of lymphocytes towards infected cells in the immune system and the migration of neuronal axons in the brain. We demonstrated significant genome-wide genetic correlation between schizophrenia and narcolepsy, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. Finally, we identified a potential sex-dependent pleiotropic effect between schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Our findings point to shared genetic risk for schizophrenia and at least a subset of immune diseases, which likely contributes to their epidemiological co-occurrence. These results raise the possibility that the same genetic variants may exert their effects on neurons or immune cells to influence the development of psychiatric and immune disorders, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling systems precisely transmit information in the presence of molecular noise while retaining flexibility to accommodate the needs of individual cells. To understand design principles underlying such versatile signaling, we analyzed the response of the tumor suppressor p53 to varying levels of DNA damage in hundreds of individual cells and observed a switch between distinct signaling modes characterized by isolated pulses and sustained oscillations of p53 accumulation. Guided by dynamic systems theory we show that this requires an excitable network structure comprising positive feedback and provide experimental evidence for its molecular identity. The resulting data-driven model reproduced all features of measured signaling responses and is sufficient to explain their heterogeneity in individual cells. We present evidence that heterogeneity in the levels of the feedback regulator Wip1 sets cell-specific thresholds for p53 activation, providing means to modulate its response through interacting signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate how excitable signaling networks can provide high specificity, sensitivity and robustness while retaining unique possibilities to adjust their function to the physiology of individual cells.",

    "abstract": "One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across all animal groups and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome usage and composition, taking into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, essentially all animals have comparable amounts of introns and intergenic sequence, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more dependent on genome size than previously thought.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryWithin our anthropocentric genomic framework, many analyses tends to try to define humans, mammals, or vertebrates relative to the so-called \\\"lower\\\" animals. This implicitly posits that vertebrates are complex organisms with large genomes and invertebrates are simple organisms with small genomes. This has the problem that genome size is therefore presumed to correlate with complexity and ignores any unknown complexity of vast numbers of invertebrate groups, many with large genomes. Animals vary widely in genome size, by almost three orders of magnitude, but when sequencing new animal genomes preference is given to those with smaller genomes for reasons of cost. In trying to understand how genomes are used in general, there is an added layer of complication from quality of the assembly and annotation. We have examined genome usage across a wide range of animals and have described ways to account for errors of low-quality annotations. We also show that the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates are not so different, and that when large-genome invertebrates are added, genome size alone appears to be defining the fraction of the genome that is genes.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition refers to the ability to reflect on and monitor ones cognitive processes, such as perception, memory and decision-making. Metacognition is often assessed in the lab by whether an observers confidence ratings are predictive of objective success, but simple correlations between performance and confidence are susceptible to undesirable influences such as response biases. Recently an alternative approach to measuring metacognition has been developed (Maniscalco & Lau, 2012) that characterises metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d') by assuming a generative model of confidence within the framework of signal detection theory. However, current estimation routines require an abundance of confidence rating data to recover robust parameters, and only provide point estimates of meta-d. In contrast, hierarchical Bayesian estimation methods provide opportunities to enhance statistical power, incorporate uncertainty in group-level parameter estimates and avoid edge-correction confounds. Here I introduce such a method for estimating metacognitive efficiency (meta-d/d) from confidence ratings and demonstrate its application for assessing group differences. A tutorial is provided on both the meta-d model and the preparation of behavioural data for model fitting. Through numerical simulations I show that a hierarchical approach outperforms alternative fitting methods in situations where limited data are available, such as when quantifying metacognition in patient populations. In addition, the model may be flexibly expanded to estimate parameters encoding other influences on metacognitive efficiency. MATLAB software and documentation for implementing hierarchical meta-d estimation (HMeta-d) can be downloaded at https://github.com/smfleming/HMeta-d.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric condition often associated with poor quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Lack of progress in improving treatment outcomes has been attributed to limited knowledge of the underlying biology, although large-scale genomic studies have begun to provide such insight. We report the largest single cohort genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (11,260 cases and 24,542 controls) and through meta-analysis with existing data we identify 50 novel GWAS loci. Using gene-wide association statistics we implicate an additional set of 22 novel associations that map onto a single gene. We show for the first time that the common variant association signal is highly enriched among genes that are intolerant to loss of function mutations and that variants in these genes persist in the population despite the low fecundity associated with the disorder through the process of background selection. Associations point to novel areas of biology (e.g. metabotropic GABA-B signalling and acetyl cholinesterase), reinforce those implicated in earlier GWAS studies (e.g. calcium channel function), converge with earlier rare variants studies (e.g. NRXN1, GABAergic signalling), identify novel overlaps with autism (e.g. RBFOX1, FOXP1, FOXG1), and support early controversial candidate gene hypotheses (e.g. ERBB4 implicating neuregulin signalling). We also demonstrate the involvement of six independent central nervous system functional gene sets in schizophrenia pathophysiology. These findings provide novel insights into the biology and genetic architecture of schizophrenia, highlight the importance of mutation intolerant genes and suggest a mechanism by which common risk variants are maintained in the population.",

Previous oxytocin studies are male-biased and often constrained by task-based inferences. Here we investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting state connectivity between subcortical and cortical networks women.\\n\\nMethodsWe collected resting state fMRI data on 26 typically-developing women following intranasal oxytocin administration using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on OXTR.\\n\\nResultsIn women, OXTR was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in reward, emotion, social-communication, language, and pain processing. This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals with higher autistic traits.\\n\\nDiscussionOxytocin strengthens corticostriatal connectivity in women, particularly with cortical networks that are involved in social-communicative, motivational, and affective processes. This effect may be important for future work on neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g., autism, chronic pain), particularly through highlighting how oxytocin may operate differently for subsets of individuals.\\n\\nSignificance statementThis is the first study to examine how oxytocin affects corticostriatal connectivity in humans, and specifically in women. This is important given oxytocin could impact neural circuitry differently in males and females. Here, we show that oxytocin increases connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry involved in a number of social-communicative, motivational, and affective processes that are implicated in certain neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., autism). This effect is bolstered by independent evidence that oxytocin receptor gene expression is high in striatal regions and modest in cortical areas. These results may have potential implications for personalized treatment, as oxytocin-related effects on connectivity may vary substantially between individuals.",

    "abstract": "The association and dissociation of protein oligomers is frequently coupled to the binding of ligands, facilitating the regulation of many biological processes. Equilibrium thermodynamic models are needed to describe the linkage between ligand binding and homo-oligomerization. These models must be parameterized in a way that makes physical interpretation straightforward, and allows elaborations or simplifications to be readily incorporated. We propose a systematic framework for the equilibrium analysis of ligand-linked oligomerization, treating in detail the case of a homo-oligomer with cyclic point group symmetry, where each subunit binds a ligand at a single site. Exploiting the symmetry of the oligomer, in combination with a nearest-neighbors approximation, we derive a class of site-specific ligand binding models involving only four parameters, irrespective of the size of the oligomer. The model parameters allow direct quantitative assessment of ligand binding cooperativity, and the influence of ligand binding on protein oligomerization, which are the key questions of biological interest. These models, which incorporate multiple types of linkage, are practically applicable, and we show how Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be used to characterize the agreement of the model with experimental data. Simplifications to the model emerge naturally, as its parameters take on extremal values. The nearest-neighbors approximation underpinning the model is transparent, and the model could be augmented in obvious fashion if the approximation were inadequate. The approach is generalizable, and could be used to treat more complex situations, involving more than a single kind of ligand, or a different protein symmetry.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe assembly and disassembly of protein complexes in response to the binding of ligands is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon. This is often linked, in turn, to the activation or deactivation of protein function. Methods are therefore needed to quantitate the linkage or coupling between protein assembly and effector binding, requiring the development of mathematical models describing the coupled binding processes. As proteins usually assemble in a symmetric fashion, the nature of any symmetry present has to be considered during model construction. We have developed a class of models than can effectively describe the coupling between effector binding and protein assembly into symmetric ring-like structures of any size. Despite the relatively complex mathematical form of the models, they are practically applicable. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a form of Bayesian statistical analysis, can be used to analyze the fit of the models to experimental data, and recover the model parameters. This allows the direct assessment of the nature and magnitude of the coupling between effector binding and protein assembly, as well as other relevant characteristics of the system.",

Understanding how the complexity of these networks influences their response to changing top-down control is a central challenge in ecology. Here, we provide a model-based investigation of trophic cascades - an oft-studied ecological phenomenon that occurs when changes in the biomass of top predators indirectly effect changes in the biomass of primary producers - in complex food webs that are representative of the structure of real ecosystems. Our results reveal that strong cascades occur primarily in low richness and weakly connected food webs, a result in agreement with some prior predictions. The primary mechanism underlying weak or absent cascades was a strong compensatory response; in most webs predators induced large population level cascades that were masked by changes in the opposite direction by other species in the same trophic guild. Thus, the search for a general theory of trophic cascades in food webs should focus on uncovering features of real ecosystems that promote biomass compensation within functional guilds or trophic levels.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial animals must have frequent contact with water to maintain their lives, implying that environmental DNA (eDNA) originating from terrestrial animals should be detectable from places containing water in terrestrial ecosystems. Aiming to detect the presence of terrestrial mammals using forest water samples, we applied a set of universal PCR primers (MiMammal, a modified version of fish universal primers) for metabarcoding mammalian eDNA. After verifying the primers usefulness in silico and using water samples from zoo cages of animals with known species compositions, we collected five 500-ml water samples from ponds in two cool-temperate forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Using eDNA extracted from the water samples, we constructed amplicon libraries using MiMammal primers for Illumina MiSeq sequencing. MiMammal metabarcoding yielded a total of 75,214 reads, which we then subjected to data pre-processing and taxonomic assignment. We thereby detected species of mammals common to the sampling areas, including deer (Cervus nippon), mouse (Mus musculus), vole (Myodes rufocanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and shrew (Sorex unguiculatus). Previous applications of the eDNA metabarcoding approach have mostly been limited to aquatic/semiaquatic systems, but the results presented here show that the approach is also promising even in forest mammal biodiversity surveys.",

    "abstract": "The American chestnut (Castanea dentata [Marsh.] Borkh.; Fagaceae) was an historically important hardwood species in eastern deciduous forests of the United States and Canada prior to being nearly eradicated by chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr). Several remnant populations have been identified persisting across fragmented parts of the historical range. The identification and characterization of remnant C. dentata populations is important for breeding and conservation efforts, as they may represent potential genetic sources of local adaptation or blight resistance, but much of the historical range remains unsurveyed. Here, I report the locations, blight infection status, and reproductive status of remnant American chestnut in upland forested areas of western New York, finding several reproductive/potentially reproductive trees.",

    "abstract": "One of the key characteristics of any genetic variant is its geographic distribution. The geographic distribution can shed light on where an allele first arose, what populations it has spread to, and in turn on how migration, genetic drift, and natural selection have acted. The distribution of a genetic variant can also be of great utility for medical/clinical geneticists. Collectively the geographic distribution of many genetic variants can reveal population structure. As a result, visual inspection of geographic maps for genetic variants is common practice in genetic studies. Here we develop an interactive visualization tool for rapidly displaying the geographic distribution of genetic variants. Through a REST API and dynamic front-end the Geography of Genetic Variants (GGV) browser provides maps of allele frequencies in populations distributed across the globe.",

    "abstract": "Scaffolding genomes into complete chromosome assemblies remains challenging even with the rapidly increasing sequence coverage generated by current next-generation sequence technologies. Even with scaffolding information, many genome assemblies remain incomplete. The genome of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a fish model system in evolutionary genetics and genomics, is not completely assembled despite scaffolding with high-density linkage maps. Here, we first test the ability of a Hi-C based proximity guided assembly to perform a de novo genome assembly from relatively short contigs. Using Hi-C based proximity guided assembly, we generated complete chromosome assemblies from 50 kb contigs. We found that 98.99% of contigs were correctly assigned to linkage groups, with ordering nearly identical to the previous genome assembly. Using available BAC end sequences, we provide evidence that some of the few discrepancies between the Hi-C assembly and the existing assembly are due to structural variation between the populations used for the two assemblies or errors in the existing assembly. This Hi-C assembly also allowed us to improve the existing assembly, assigning over 60% (13.35 Mb) of the previously unassigned ([~]21.7 Mb) contigs to linkage groups. Together, our results highlight the potential of the Hi-C based proximity guided assembly method to be used in combination with short read data to perform relatively inexpensive de novo genome assemblies. This approach will be particularly useful in organisms in which it is difficult to perform linkage mapping or to obtain high molecular weight DNA required for other scaffolding methods.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is inherently noisy, but little is known about whether noise affects cell function or, if so, how and by how much. Here I present a theoretical framework to quantify the fitness costs of gene expression noise and identify the evolutionary and synthetic targets of noise control. I find that gene expression noise reduces fitness by slowing the average rate of nutrient uptake and protein synthesis. This is a direct consequence of the hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) kinetics of most biological reactions, which I show cause \\\"hyperbolic filtering\\\", a process that diminishes both the average rate and noise propagation of stochastic reactions. Interestingly, I find that transcriptional noise directly slows growth by slowing the average translation rate. Perhaps surprisingly, this is the largest fitness cost of transcriptional noise since translation strongly filters mRNA noise, making protein noise largely independent of transcriptional noise, consistent with empirical data. Translation, not transcription, then, is the primary target of protein noise control. Paradoxically, selection for protein-noise control favors increased ribosome-mRNA binding affinity, even though this increases translational bursting. However, I find that the efficacy of selection to suppress noise decays faster than linearly with increasing cell size. This predicts a stark, cell-size-mediated taxonomic divide in selection pressures for noise control: small unicellular species, including most prokaryotes, face fairly strong selection to suppress gene expression noise, whereas larger unicells, including most eukaryotes, experience extremely weak selection. I suggest that this taxonomic discrepancy in selection efficacy contributed to the evolution of greater gene-regulatory complexity in eukaryotes.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYGene expression is a probabilistic process, resulting in random variation in mRNA and protein abundance among cells called \\\"noise\\\". Understanding how noise affects cell function is a major problem in biology. Here I present theory demonstrating that gene expression noise slows the average rate of cell division. Furthermore, by modeling stochastic gene expression with non-linearity, I identify novel mechanisms of cellular robustness. However, I find that the cost of noise, and therefore the strength of selection favoring robustness, decays faster than linearly with increasing cell size. This may help explain the vast differences in gene-regulatory complexity between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of bacterial translocation (BT) in the promotion of carcinogenesis has gained a considerable attention in the last years. At this point however BT has not been studied in the context of pancreatic cystic lesions and their development into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The aim of the study was to analyze if bacteria are present in pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) collected from patients with suspected pancreatic cysts. Total DNA was isolated from sixty nine PCF. The occurrence of bacteria in PCF was analyzed using bacterial 16S rRNA gene-specific PCR-based method followed by sequence identification and quantitative PCR assay tuned up to different pathogenic and commensal human bacteria. Forty-seven out of sixty-nine samples (68%) were found positive for harboring bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Follow up sequencing analyses of the PCR products revealed that bacterial species related to Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., and Bacillus spp. were predominating the PCF samples. The results suggest that specific bacteria can translocate to the pancreas and become detectable in the PCF.",

    "abstract": "Rho guanine exchange factors (RhoGEFs) control many aspects of the cellular cytoskeleton, and thereby regulate and control processes such as cell migration, cell adhesion and proliferation. TGAT is a splice variant of the RhoGEF Trio, with oncogenic potential. Whether the subcellular location of TGAT is critical for its activity is unknown. Confocal microscopy of fluorescent protein tagged TGAT revealed co-localization with a Golgi marker. Because plasma membrane localized RhoGEFs are particularly effective at activating RhoA, plasma membrane localization of TGAT was studied. In order to quantitatively measure plasma membrane association we developed a novel, highly sensitive image analysis method. The method requires a cytoplasmic marker and a plasma membrane marker, which are co-imaged with the tagged protein of interest. Linear unmixing is performed to determine the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic component in the fluorescence signal of protein of interest. The analysis revealed that wild-type TGAT is partially co-localized with the plasma membrane. Strikingly, cysteine TGAT-mutants lacking one or more palmitoylation sites in the C-tail, still showed membrane association. In contrast, a truncated variant, lacking the last 15 amino acids, TGAT{Delta}15, lost membrane association. The functional role of membrane localization was determined by measuring TGAT activity in single cells with a RhoA FRET-sensor and F-actin levels. Mutants of TGAT that still maintained membrane association showed similar activity as wild-type TGAT. In contrast, the activity was abrogated for the cytoplasmic TGAT{Delta}15 variant. Synthetic recruitment of TGAT{Delta}15 to membranes confirmed that TGAT effectively activates RhoA at the plasma membrane. Together, these results show that membrane association of TGAT is critical for its activity, but that palmitoylation is dispensable.",
