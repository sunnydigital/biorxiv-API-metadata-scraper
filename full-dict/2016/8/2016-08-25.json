    "abstract": "Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding, microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing numbers of genomes. In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic datasets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this paper, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies, and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.",

    "abstract": "We assess the prospects for ending AIDS in South Africa using a dynamical model to fit data on time trends in HIV prevalence and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) coverage for adults. We estimate current and project future trends in HIV incidence, prevalence and AIDS related deaths, in ART coverage and incidence, and in TB notification rates. We consider two scenarios: constant effort under which people continue to be started on treatment at the current rate and expanded treatment and prevention under which testing rates are increased, everyone is started on treatment as soon as they are found to be infected with HIV, and voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis and condom distribution programmes are expanded.\\n\\nAs a result of the roll-out of ART the incidence of HIV has fallen from a peak of 2.3% per annum in 1996 to 0.65% in 2016, the AIDS related mortality from a peak of 1.4% per annum in 2006 to 0.37% p.a. in 2016 and both continue to fall at a relative rate of 17% p.a. Maintaining a policy of constant effort will lead to further declines in HIV incidence, AIDS related mortality and TB notification rates but will not end AIDS. Implementing a policy of expanded treatment and prevention in September 2016 should ensure that by 2020 new infections and deaths will be less than one per thousand adults and the UNAIDS Goal of Ending AIDS by 2030 will be reached. Scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis and condom availability will avert some new infections but will save relatively few lives. Nevertheless, equity demands that people at very high risk of infection including commercial sex-workers, men-who-have-sex-with-men and young women should have access to the best available methods of prevention.\\n\\nThe current cost to the health services of managing HIV and TB among adults in South Africa is about US$2.1 Bn p.a. (0.6% of GDP p.a.) and this will rise to a peak of US$2.7 Bn p.a. in 2018 (0.8% GDP p.a.). As treatment is scaled up and prevention made available to those at high risk, the cost will fall to US$ 1.8 Bn p.a. in 2030 and US$ 1.0 Bn p.a. in 2050 as those that are living with HIV on ART, die of natural causes. The cost of testing people for HIV is never more than about 8% of the total cost and since testing is the sine qua non of treatment it will be essential to invest sufficient resources in testing. The cost of treating tuberculosis is never more than about 10% of the total and since this is the major cause of AIDS related illness and deaths, efforts should be made to optimise TB treatment.\\n\\nEnding AIDS in the world will depend critically on what happens in South Africa which accounts for 20% of all people living with HIV. The increasing availability of ART has had a major impact on both HIV incidence and AIDS related mortality and universal access to ART is affordable. With the commitment to make treatment available to all those infected with HIV in September 2016, the South African government is well placed to eliminate HIV as a major threat to public health by 2020 and to end AIDS by 2030. Individuals at high risk of infection deserve access to the best available methods of protecting themselves and they will become increasingly important in the final stages of ending the epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Our initial understanding of the flow of protein-encoding genetic information, DNA to RNA to protein, a process defined as the \\\"central dogma of molecular biology\\\", was eventually amended to account for the information back-flow from RNA to DNA (reverse transcription), and for its \\\"side-flow\\\" from RNA to RNA (RNA-dependent RNA synthesis, RdRs). These processes, both potentially leading to protein production, were described only in viral systems, and although putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was shown to be present, and RdRs to occur, in most, if not all, mammalian cells, its function was presumed to be restricted to regulatory. Here we report the occurrence of protein-encoding RNA to RNA information transfer in mammalian cells. We describe below the detection, by next generation sequencing (NGS), of a chimeric doublestranded/pinhead intermediate containing both sense and antisense globin RNA strands covalently joined in a predicted and uniquely defined manner, whose cleavage at the pinhead would result in the generation of an endproduct containing the intact coding region of the original mRNA. We also describe the identification of the putative end product of RNA-dependent globin mRNA amplification. It is heavily modified, uniformly truncated at both untranslated regions (UTRs), terminates with the OH group at the 5 end, consistent with a cleavagegenerated 5 terminus, and its massive cellular amount is unprecedented for a conventional mRNA transcription product. It also translates in a cell-free system into polypeptides indistinguishable from the translation product of conventional globin mRNA. The physiological significance of the mammalian mRNA amplification, which might operate during terminal differentiation and in the production of highly abundant rapidly generated proteins such as some collagens or other components of extracellular matrix, with every genome-originated mRNA molecule acting as a potential template, as well as possible implications, including physiologically occurring intracellular PCR process, iPCR, are discussed in the paper.",

    "abstract": "In order to efficiently edit eukaryotic genomes, it is critical to test the impact of chromatin dynamics on CRISPR/Cas9 function and develop strategies to adapt the system to eukaryotic contexts. So far, research has extensively characterized the relationship between the CRISPR endonuclease Cas9 and the composition of the RNADNA duplex that mediates the systems precision. Evidence suggests that chromatin modifications and DNA packaging can block eukaryotic genome editing by custom-built DNA endonucleases like Cas9; however, the underlying mechanism of Cas9 inhibition is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that closed, gene-silencing-associated chromatin is a mechanism for the interference of Cas9-mediated DNA editing. Our assays use a transgenic cell line with a drug-inducible switch to control chromatin states (open and closed) at a single genomic locus. We show that closed chromatin inhibits editing at specific target sites, and that artificial reversal of the silenced state restores editing efficiency. These results provide new insights to improve Cas9-mediated editing in human and other mammalian cells.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/071464_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f2c52org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@96df75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1288f24org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cdaa02_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) has considerable importance in population genetics. To date, estimates of the DFE come from studies using a small number of individuals. Thus, estimates of the proportion of moderately to strongly deleterious new mutations may be unreliable because such variants are unlikely to be segregating in the data. Additionally, the true functional form of the DFE is unknown, and estimates of the DFE differ significantly between studies. Here we present a flexible and computationally tractable method, called Fit{partial}a{partial}i, to estimate the DFE using the site frequency spectrum from a large number of individuals. We apply our approach to the frequency spectrum of 1300 Europeans from the Exome Sequencing Project ESP6400 dataset, 1298 Danes from the LuCamp dataset, and 432 Europeans from the 1000 Genomes Project to estimate the DFE of deleterious nonsynonymous mutations. We infer significantly fewer (0.38-0.84x) strongly deleterious mutations with selection coefficient |s| > 0.01 and more (1.24-1.43x) weakly deleterious mutations with selection coefficient |s| < 0.001 compared to previous estimates. Furthermore, a DFE that is a mixture distribution of a point mass at neutrality plus a gamma distribution fits best to two of the three datasets. Our results suggest that nearly neutral forces play a larger role in human evolution than previously thought.",

More importantly, the position of the J'(r) valley (rJ'm) depends exclusively on the density of clustering molecules ({rho}c).

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity may evolve as a generalist strategy to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Empirical studies, however, rarely find results confirming this prediction. This may be related to constraints imposed by the genetic architecture underlying plasticity variation. Three components of plasticity are central to characterize its variation: the intensity of response, the direction of response and the total amount of change. Reaction norm functions are a key analytical tool in plasticity studies. The more complex they are, the more plasticity components will vary independently, requiring more parameters to be described. Experimental studies are continuously collecting results showing that actual reaction norms are often nonlinear. This demands an analytical framework - yet to be developed - capable of straightforwardly untangling plasticity components. In Drosophila mediopunctata, the number of dark spots on the abdomen decreases as a response to increasing developmental temperatures. We have previously described a strong association between reaction norm curvature and across-environment mean values in homozygous strains. Here, we describe seven new reaction norms of heterozygous genotypes and further the investigation on the genetic architecture of this traits plasticity, testing three competing models from the literature - Overdominance, Epistasis and Pleiotropy. We use the curves of localized slopes of each reaction norm - Local Plasticity functions - to characterize the plastic response intensity and direction, and introduce a Global Plasticity parameter to quantify their total amount of change. Uncoupling plasticity components allowed us to discard the Overdominance model, weaken the Epistasis model and strengthen the support for the Pleiotropy model. Furthermore, this approach allows the elaboration of a coherent developmental model for the pigmentation of D. mediopunctata where genetic variation at one single feature explains the patterns of plasticity and overall expression of the trait. We claim that Global Plasticity and Local Plasticity may prove instrumental to the understanding of adaptive reaction norm evolution",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the scale and diversity of population genomic datasets for bacteria now provide the potential for genome-wide patterns of co-evolution to be studied at the resolution of individual bases. The major human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae represents the first bacterial organism for which densely enough sampled population data became available for such an analysis. Here we describe a new statistical method, genomeDCA, which uses recent advances in computational structural biology to identify the polymorphic loci under the strongest co-evolutionary pressures. Genome data from over three thousand pneumococcal isolates identified 5,199 putative epistatic interactions between 1,936 sites. Over three-quarters of the links were between sites within the pbp2x, pbp1a and pbp2b genes, the sequences of which are critical in determining non-susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. A network-based analysis found these genes were also coupled to that encoding dihydrofolate reductase, changes to which underlie trimethoprim resistance. Distinct from these resistance genes, a large network component of 384 protein coding sequences encompassed many genes critical in basic cellular functions, while another distinct component included genes associated with virulence. These results have the potential both to identify previously unsuspected protein-protein interactions, as well as genes making independent contributions to the same phenotype. This approach greatly enhances the future potential of epistasis analysis for systems biology, and can complement genome-wide association studies as a means of formulating hypotheses for experimental work.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEpistatic interactions between polymorphisms in DNA are recognized as important drivers of evolution in numerous organisms. Study of epistasis in bacteria has been hampered by the lack of both densely sampled population genomic data, suitable statistical models and powerful inference algorithms for extremely high-dimensional parameter spaces. We introduce the first model-based method for genome-wide epistasis analysis and use the largest available bacterial population genome data set on Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) to demonstrate its potential for biological discovery. Our approach reveals interacting networks of resistance, virulence and core machinery genes in the pneumococcus, which highlights putative candidates for novel drug targets. Our method significantly enhances the future potential of epistasis analysis for systems biology, and can complement genome-wide association studies as a means of formulating hypotheses for experimental work.",

Using genetic data from four populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, we show that most populations harbor genetic variants in Cas9 target sites, some of which would render them immune to drive (ITD). We show that even a rare ITD allele can reduce or eliminate the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-based synthetic gene. This effect is equivalent to and accentuated by mild inbreeding, which is a characteristic of many diseasevectoring arthropods. We conclude that designing such a drive will require characterization of genetic variability and the mating system within and among targeted populations.",

In this sense, we determined the main infection aspects of the Brazilian Zika strain in reference Aedes aegypti laboratory mosquitoes.\\n\\nWe orally exposed Rockefeller, Higgs and Rexville mosquitoes to a Brazilian ZIKV (ZIKVBR) and qRT-PCR was applied to determine the infection and dissemination rates, and viral levels in mosquito tissues as well as in the saliva. The ZIKVBR kinetics was monitored during the infection in Rockefeller mosquitoes. Rockefeller strain was the most susceptible at 7 days post-infection but all strains presented similar infection levels at 14 days post-infection. Although variations in the saliva detection rates were observed, we confirmed that ZIKVBR was present in saliva from Rockefeller, Higgs and Rexville females at detectable levels at 14 days post-infection. The ZIKVBR kinetics in Rockefeller mosquitoes showed that the virus could be detected in the heads at 4 days post-infection but was more consistently detected late in infection. The viral levels peaked at 11 days post-infection in the mosquito bodies, remaining stable until 14 days post-infection, in contrast to the heads, where the mean viral levels only peaked at 14 days post-infection.\\n\\nOur study presents the first evaluation on how Brazilian Zika virus behaves in reference Aedes aegypti strains and shed light on how the infection evolves over time. Vector competence and basic hallmarks of the ZIKVBR development were revealed in laboratory mosquitoes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMore than 30 genes can harbor rare exonic variants sufficient to cause nephrotic syndrome (NS), and the number of genes implicated in monogenic NS continues to grow. However, outside the first year of life, the majority of affected patients, particularly in ancestrally mixed populations, do not have a known monogenic form of NS. Even in those children classified with a monogenic form of NS, there is phenotypic heterogeneity. Thus, we have only discovered a fraction of the heritability of NS - the underlying genetic factors contributing to phenotypic variation. Part of the \\\"missing heritability\\\" for NS has been posited to be explained by patients harboring coding variants across one or more previously implicated NS genes, insufficient to cause NS in a classical Mendelian manner, but that nonetheless impact protein function enough to cause disease. However, systematic evaluation in patients with NS for rare or low-frequency risk alleles within single genes, or in combination across genes (\\\"oligogenicity\\\"), has not been reported.\\n\\nObjectiveTo determine whether, as compared to a reference population, patients with NS have either a significantly increased burden of protein-altering variants (\\\"risk-alleles\\\"), or unique combination of them (\\\"oligogenicity\\\"), in a set of 21 genes implicated in Mendelian forms of NS.\\n\\nMethodsIn 303 patients with NS enrolled in the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), we performed targeted amplification paired with next-generation sequencing of 21 genes implicated in monogenic NS. We created a high-quality variant call set and compared it to a variant call set of the same genes in a reference population composed of 2535 individuals from Phase 3 of 1000 Genomes Project. We created both a \\\"stringent\\\" and \\\"relaxed\\\" pathogenicity filtering pipeline, applied them to both cohorts, and computed the (1) burden of variants in the entire gene set per cohort, (2) burden of variants in the entire gene set per individual, (3) burden of variants within a single gene per cohort, and (4) unique combinations of variants across two or more genes per cohort.\\n\\nResultsWith few exceptions when using the relaxed filter, and which are likely the result of confounding by population stratification, NS patients did not have significantly increased burden of variants in Mendelian NS genes in comparison to a reference cohort, nor was there any evidence of oligogenicity. This was true when using both the relaxed and stringent variant pathogenicity filter.\\n\\nConclusionIn our study, the burden or particular combinations of low-frequency or rare protein altering variants in previously implicated Mendelian NS genes cohort does not significantly differ between North American patients with NS and a reference population. Studies in larger independent cohorts or meta-analyses are needed to assess generalizability of our discoveries and also address whether there is in fact small but significant enrichment of risk alleles or oligogenicity in NS cases undetectable with this current sample size. It is still possible that rare protein altering variants in these genes, insufficient to cause Mendelian disease, still contribute to NS as risk alleles and/or via oligogenicity. However, we suggest that more accurate bioinformatic analyses and the incorporation of functional assays would be necessary to identify bona fide instances of this form of genetic architecture as a contributor to the heritability of NS.",

    "abstract": "Stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment is essential for cell division. It requires recruitment of outer kinetochore microtubule binders by centromere proteins C and T (CENP-C and CENP-T). To study the molecular requirements of kinetochore formation, we reconstituted the binding of the MIS12 and NDC80 outer kinetochore subcomplexes to CENP-C and CENP-T. Whereas CENP-C recruits a single MIS12:NDC80 complex, we show here that CENP-T binds one MIS12:NDC80 and two NDC80 complexes upon phosphorylation by the mitotic CDK1:Cyclin B complex at three distinct CENP-T sites. Visualization of reconstituted complexes by electron microscopy supports this model. Binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12 is competitive, and therefore CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit two MIS12 and up to four NDC80 complexes. Our observations provide a molecular explanation for the stoichiometry of kinetochore components and its cell cycle regulation, and highlight how outer kinetochore modules bridge distances of well over 100 nm.",

    "abstract": "A most important property of biochemical systems is robustness. Static robustness, e.g., homeostasis, is the insensitivity of a state against perturbations, whereas dynamics robustness, e.g., homeorhesis, is the insensitivity of a dynamic process. In contrast to the extensively studied static robustness, dynamics robustness, i.e., how a system creates an invariant temporal profile against perturbations, is little explored despite transient dynamics being crucial for cellular fates and are reported to be robust experimentally. For example, the duration of a stimulus elicits different phenotypic responses, and signaling networks process and encode temporal information. Hence, robustness in time courses will be necessary for functional biochemical networks. Based on dynamical systems theory, we uncovered a general mechanism to achieve dynamics robustness. Using a three-stage linear signaling cascade as an example, we found that the temporal profiles and response duration post-stimulus is robust to perturbations against certain parameters. Then analyzing the linearized model, we elucidated the criteria of how such dynamics robustness emerges in signaling networks. We found that changes in the upstream modules are masked in the cascade, and that the response duration is mainly controlled by the rate-limiting module and organization of the cascade's kinetics. Specifically, we found two necessary conditions for dynamics robustness in signaling cascades: 1) Constraint on the rate-limiting process: The phosphatase activity in the perturbed module is not the slowest. 2) Constraints on the initial conditions: The kinase activity needs to be fast enough such that each module is saturated even with fast phosphatase activity and upstream information is attenuated. We discussed the relevance of such robustness to several biological examples and the validity of the above conditions therein. Given the applicability of dynamics robustness to a variety of systems, it will provide a general basis for how biological systems function dynamically.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCells use signaling pathways to transmit information received on its membrane to DNA,and many important cellular processes are tied to signaling networks. Past experiments have shown that cells internal signaling networks are sophisticated enough to process and encode temporal information such as the length of time a ligand is bound to a receptor. However, little research has been done to verify whether information encoded onto temporal profiles can be made robust. We examined mathematical models of linear signaling networks and found that the relaxation of the response to a transient stimuli can be made robust to certain parameter fluctuations. Robustness is a key concept in 1/15 biological systems it would be disastrous if a cell could not operate if there was as light change in its environment or physiology. Our research shows that such dynamics robustness does emerge in linear signaling cascades, and we outline the design principles needed to generate such robustness. We discovered that two conditions regarding the speed of the internal chemical reactions and concentration levels are needed to generate dynamics robustness.",

Given the huge burden that Chikungunya and Zika fevers impose to public health in the affected countries and the lack of effective interventions against them, the aim of this work was to evaluate the antiviral potential of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) - an iron-binding glycoprotein with broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties - in both CHIKV and ZIKV infections. The general antiviral activity of bLf was assessed by plaque assays, and the inhibitory effects of the protein on specific stages of virus infecion was evaluated by immunofluorescence and nucleic acid quantification assays. Our data show that bLf exerts a dose-dependent strong inhibitory effect on the infection of Vero cells by the aforementioned arboviruses, reducing their infection efficiency in up to nearly 80%, with no significant cytotoxicity, and such antiviral activity occurs at the levels of binding and replication of the virus particles. Taken together, these findings reveal that bLf antimicrobial properties are extendable to CHIKV and ZIKV, underlining a generic inhibition mechanism that can be explored to develop a potential strategy against their infections.",

This study was conducted to determine whether experimental stroke preferentially affects HRV during specific times of the day or parts of the sleep-wake cycle. A continuous telemetry system was used to analyze electroencephalograms (EEG), electromyograms (EMG), and electrocardiograms (ECG) after experimental ischemic stroke in rats (n = 13). Animals were implanted with telemetry probes and, after a two week stabilization period, 72h of baseline continuous EEG, EMG, ECG data were collected. Animals were then assigned to two procedure groups: 1) experimental stroke via 90 minute intraluminal filament occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, or 2) sham surgery. Continuous waveform recording and HRV analysis was then continued for 48h following each procedure. HRV analysis was conducted by both time-domain and frequency-domain methods. Heart rate exhibited circadian rhythms among all animals prior to and following both procedures. Neither procedure contributed to significant heart rate changes. We did not find sleep state or circadian-dependent alterations in HRV in baseline recording. However, after stroke, animals exhibited elevated high frequency (HF) HRV (>10% increase, p<0.05) specifically during daytime waking periods. This contrasts with studies in humans that demonstrate reduced HRV after stroke, suggesting that age, medical comorbidities, or species differences modify the overall response to cortical infarction of autonomic control centers.",

    "abstract": "The ancient African crop, finger millet, has broad resistance to pathogens including the toxigenic fungus Fusarium graminearum. Here we report the discovery of a novel plant defence mechanism, resulting from an unusual symbiosis between finger millet and a root-inhabiting bacterial endophyte, M6 (Enterobacter sp.). Seed-coated M6 swarms towards Fusarium attempting to penetrate root epidermis, induces growth of root hairs which then bend parallel to the root axis, then forms biofilm-mediated microcolonies, resulting in a remarkable, multi-layer root hair-endophyte stack (RHESt). RHESt results in a physical barrier that prevents entry and/or traps F. graminearum which is then killed. Thus M6 creates its own specialized killing microhabitat. M6 killing requires c-di-GMP-dependent signalling, diverse fungicides and xenobiotic resistance. Further molecular evidence suggests long-term host-endophyte-pathogen co-evolution. The end-result of this remarkable symbiosis is reduced DON mycotoxin, potentially benefiting millions of subsistence farmers and livestock. RHESt demonstrates the value of exploring ancient, orphan crop microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe 2014-5 West African Ebola epidemic highlights the need for rigorous, rapid clinical trials under difficult circumstances. Challenges include temporally and spatially patchy transmission, and the responsibility to deliver public health interventions during a randomized trial. An innovative design such as ring vaccination with an immediate arm and a delayed arm can address these issues, but complex trials raise complex analysis issues.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe present a stochastic, compartmental model for a ring vaccination trial of a vaccine for an Ebola-like disease. After identification of an index case, a ring of primary contacts is recruited and either vaccinated immediately or after a delay of 21 days. The primary outcome of the trial is effectiveness calculated from cumulative incidence in the two arms, counting cases only from a pre-specified window in which the immediate arm is assumed to be fully protected and the delayed arm is not protected. The results of simulating the trial are used to calculate the sample size necessary for 80% power and the estimates of effectiveness are reported under a variety of assumptions regarding the trial design and implementation.\\n\\nThe three key components of sample size calculations - attack rate in controls, estimate of incidence difference between the arms, and intracluster correlation coefficient - are dependent on trial design and implementation in a way that can be quantitatively predicted by the model. Under baseline parameter assumptions, we found that a total of 8,900 study participants were needed to achieve 80% power to detect a difference in attack rate between the two arms, whereas a standard approach with the same parameters returns a necessary sample size of 7,100 individuals. Such a study would on average return a vaccine effectiveness estimate of 69.81%, with average 95% confidence interval (41.2%, 84.2%).\\n\\nWe found that for this design the necessary sample size and estimated effectiveness are sensitive to properties of the vaccine - in particular, pre-exposure and post-exposure efficacy; to two setting-specific parameters over which investigators have little control - rate of infections from outside the ring and overall attack rate in the controls; and to three parameters that are determined by the study design - the time window in which cases are counted, intensity of case-detection and administrative delay in vaccinating individuals.\\n\\nThis approach replaces assumptions about parameters in the trial with assumptions about disease dynamics and vaccine characteristics at the individual level.\\n\\nConclusionsIncorporating simulation into the trial design process can improve robustness of sample size calculations. Simulation can identify optimal values for study design parameters that can be controlled. For this specific trial design, vaccine effectiveness depends on properties of the ring vaccination design and on the measurement window, as well as the epidemiologic setting. Rejecting the null likely indicates one or more types of vaccine efficacy at the individual level, but the magnitude of the effect will vary across settings.",

We studied seven measures of biological aging in 964 middle-aged humans in the Dunedin Study: telomere-length, three epigenetic-clocks, and three biomarker-composites. Agreement between these different measures of biological aging was low. We also compared associations between biological aging measures and outcomes that geroprotective therapies will seek to modify: physical functioning, cognitive decline, and subjective signs of aging. The 71-CpG epigenetic clock and the biomarker composites were consistently related to these outcomes. Effect-sizes were modest. Quantification of biological aging is a young field.

To analyse TAF10-dependent gene regulation during development, we conditionally deleted Taf10 in the mesoderm. Our results provide evidence for a time window during which Taf10 loss in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) does not prevent cyclic gene transcription or PSM patterning while lateral plate differentiation is profoundly altered. During this period, global steady state mRNA levels are not significantly affected in the PSM although the expression of a subset of specific genes is dysregulated. Together, our data demonstrate a differential sensibility of mesodermal tissues to the lack of TAF10. This supports a differential requirement for TAF10 by the general transcriptional machinery during different developmental processes.",

    "abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by dominant, toxic, gain-of-function mutations in the widely expressed, housekeeping gene, GARS. The mechanisms underlying selective nerve pathology in CMT2D remain unresolved, as does the cause of the mild-to-moderate sensory involvement that distinguishes CMT2D from the allelic disorder distal spinal muscular atrophy type V. To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the underlying afferent nerve pathology, we examined the sensory nervous system in CMT2D mice. We show that the equilibrium between functional subtypes of sensory neuron in dorsal root ganglia is distorted by Gars mutations, leading to sensory defects in peripheral tissues and correlating with overall disease severity. CMT2D mice display changes in sensory behaviour concordant with the afferent imbalance, which is present at birth and non-progressive, indicating that sensory neuron identity is prenatally perturbed and that a critical developmental insult is key to the afferent pathology. This suggests that both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative mechanisms contribute to CMT2D pathogenesis, and thus has profound implications for the timing of future therapeutic treatments.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of genetically diverse inherited nerve disorders with the unifying feature of peripheral neuron degeneration. The mechanisms triggering this motor and sensory nerve dysfunction remain unresolved, as does the reason for the lack of sensory pathology observed in distal hereditary motor neuropathies, which can be associated with CMT genes. To unravel the mechanisms leading to afferent deterioration, we have studied the sensory nervous system of CMT Type 2D mice. Our work indicates that the specific cellular identity of sensory nerves is perturbed in mutant mice pre-natally. CMT therefore manifests through the complex interplay between malfunctioning developmental, maturation, and survival programs, which has important ramifications for therapeutic timing.",

However, functional frameshifts have been found widely existing. It was puzzling how a frameshift protein kept its structure and functionality while its amino-acid sequence was changed substantially. Here we show that frame similarities between frameshifts and wild types are higher than random similarities and are defined at the genetic code, gene, and genome levels. In the standard genetic code, frameshift codon substitutions are more conservative than random substitutions. The frameshift tolerability of the standard genetic code ranks in the top 2.0-3.5% of alternative genetic codes, showing that the genetic code is nearly optimal for frameshift tolerance. Furthermore, frameshift-resistant codons (codon pairs) appear more frequently than expected in many genes and certain genomes, showing that the frameshift optimality is reflected not only in the genetic code but more importantly, in its allowance of further optimizing the frameshift tolerance of a particular gene or genome, which shed light on the role of frameshift mutations in molecular and genomic evolution.",
