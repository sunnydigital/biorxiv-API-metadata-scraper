    "abstract": "The lack of multivariate methods for decoding the representational content of interregional neural communication has left it difficult to know what information is represented in distributed brain circuit interactions. Here we present Multi-Connection Pattern Analysis (MCPA), which works by learning mappings between the activity patterns of the populations as a factor of the information being processed. These maps are used to predict the activity from one neural population based on the activity from the other population. Successful MCPA-based decoding indicates the involvement of distributed computational processing and provides a framework for probing the representational structure of the interaction. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of MCPA in realistic circumstances. Applying MCPA to fMRI data shows that interactions between visual cortex regions are sensitive to information that distinguishes individual natural images, suggesting that image individuation occurs through interactive computation across the visual processing network. MCPA-based representational similarity analyses (RSA) results support models of error coding in interactions among regions of the network. Further RSA analyses relate the non-linear information transformation operations between layers of a computational model (HMAX) of visual processing to the information transformation between regions of the visual processing network. Additionally, applying MCPA to human intracranial electrophysiological data demonstrates that the interaction between occipital face area and fusiform face area contains information about individual faces. Thus, MCPA can be used to assess the information represented in the coupled activity of interacting neural circuits and probe the underlying principles of information transformation between regions.",

    "abstract": "The availability of large-scale population genomic sequence data has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the demographic histories of natural populations across a broad range of organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic inference by characterizing the performance of three popular methods through extensive simulation of datasets with varying numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three different demographic models relevant to a number of species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates of each of these models--often severely. Moreover, we find that selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size changes when none have occurred. We argue that the amount of recent positive selection required to skew inferences may often be acting in natural populations. These results suggest that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may have exaggerated the extent and frequency of population size changes.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional collective cell migration assays are used to study cancer and tissue repair. These assays involve combined cell migration and cell proliferation processes, both of which are modulated by cell-to-cell crowding. Previous discrete models of collective cell migration assays involve a nearest-neighbour proliferation mechanism where crowding effects are incorporated by aborting potential proliferation events if the randomly chosen target site is occupied. There are two limitations of this traditional approach: (i) it seems unreasonable to abort a potential proliferation event based on the occupancy of a single, randomly chosen target site; and, (ii) the continuum limit description of this mechanism leads to the standard logistic growth function, but some experimental evidence suggests that cells do not always proliferate logistically. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a generalised proliferation mechanism which allows non-nearest neighbour proliferation events to take place over a template of r [&ge;] 1 concentric rings of lattice sites. Further, the decision to abort potential proliferation events is made using a crowding function, f (C), which accounts for the density of agents within a group of sites rather than dealing with the occupancy of a single randomly chosen site. Analysing the continuum limit description of the stochastic model shows that the standard logistic source term, {lambda}C(1 - C), where {lambda} is the proliferation rate, is generalised to a universal growth function, {lambda}Cf (C). Comparing the solution of the continuum description with averaged simulation data indicates that the continuum model performs well for many choices of f (C) and r. For nonlinear f (C), the quality of the continuum-discrete match increases with r.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brains specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation contributes to gene and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, and therefore has been hypothesized to facilitate the evolution of flexible traits such as sociality in insects. However, DNA methylation is sparsely studied in insects. Therefore, we documented patterns of DNA methylation across a wide diversity of insects. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the DNA methylation system will be associated with presence/absence of sociality among insects. We also predicted that underlying enzymatic machinery is concordant with patterns of DNA methylation. We found DNA methylation to be widespread, detected in all orders examined except Diptera (flies). Whole genome bisulfite sequencing showed that orders differed in levels of DNA methylation. Hymenopteran (ants, bees, wasps and sawflies) had some of the lowest levels, including several potential losses. Blattodea (cockroaches) show all possible patterns, including a potential loss of DNA methylation in a eusocial species whereas solitary species had the highest levels. Phylogenetically corrected comparisons revealed no evidence that supports evolutionary dependency between sociality and DNA methylation. Species with DNA methylation do not always possess the typical enzymatic machinery. We identified a gene duplication event in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that is shared by some hymenopteran, and paralogs have experienced divergent, non-neutral evolution. This diversity and non-neutral evolution of underlying machinery suggests alternative DNA methylation pathways may exist. Altogether, DNA methylation is highly variable in insects and is not a universal driver of social behavior. Future, functional studies are required to advance our understanding of DNA methylation in insects.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of sensory and decisional processes to perceptual decision making is still unclear, even in simple perceptual tasks. When a decision maker needs to select an action from a set of balanced alternatives, any tendency to choose one alternative more often- choice bias-is consistent with a bias in the sensory evidence, but also with a preference to select that alternative independently of the sensory evidence. To decouple sensory from decisional biases, here we asked humans to perform a simple perceptual discrimination task with two symmetric alternatives under two different task instructions. The instructions varied the response mapping between perception and the category of the alternatives. In two experiments, we found that 30 out of 32 participants exhibited sensory biases and 15 decisional biases. The decisional biases were consistent with a criterion change in a simple signal detection theory model. Perceptual decision making, thus, even in simple scenarios, is affected by sensory and decisional choice biases.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding increases parent-offspring relatedness and commonly reduces offspring viability, shaping selection on reproductive interactions involving relatives and associated parental investment (PI). Nevertheless, theories predicting selection for inbreeding versus inbreeding avoidance and selection for optimal PI have only been considered separately, precluding prediction of optimal PI and associated reproductive strategy given inbreeding. We unify inbreeding and PI theory, demonstrating that optimal PI increases when a female's inbreeding decreases the viability of her offspring. Inbreeding females should therefore produce fewer offspring due to the fundamental trade-off between offspring number and PI. Accordingly, selection for inbreeding versus inbreeding avoidance changes when females can adjust PI with the degree that they inbreed. In contrast, optimal PI does not depend on whether a focal female is herself inbred. However, inbreeding causes optimal PI to increase given strict monogamy and associated biparental investment compared to female-only investment. Our model implies that understanding evolutionary dynamics of inbreeding strategy, inbreeding depression, and PI requires joint consideration of the expression of each in relation to the other. Overall, we demonstrate that existing PI and inbreeding theories represent special cases of a more general theory, implying that intrinsic links between inbreeding and PI affect evolution of behaviour and intra-familial conflict.",

We here report a more complicated scenario concerning the fingertips of smartphone users. We sorted 21-days histories of touchscreen use of 57 volunteers into social and non-social categories. Sensorimotor variability was measured in a laboratory setting by simple button depressions and scalp electrodes (electroencephalogram, EEG). The ms range trial-to-trial variability in button depression was directly proportional to the number of social touches and inversely proportional to non-social touches. Variability of the early tactile somatosensory potentials was also proportional to the number of social touches, but not to non-social touches. The number of Apps and the speed of touchscreen use also reflected this variability. We suggest that smartphone use affects elementary computations even in tasks not involving a phone and that social activities uniquely reconfigure the thumb to touchscreen use.\\n\\nImpact StatementUnconstrained behavior on a smartphone is a powerful predictor of neuronal functions measured in the laboratory and the details of the smartphone-neuronal association challenges the established ideas of brain plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Mapping directions of influence in the human brain connectome represents the next phase in understanding its functional architecture. However, a host of methodological uncertainties have impeded the application of directed connectivity methods, which have primarily been validated via 'ground truth' connectivity patterns embedded in simulated functional MRI (fMRI) and magneto-/electro-encephalography (MEG/EEG) datasets. Such simulations rely on many generative assumptions, and we hence utilized a different strategy involving empirical data in which a ground truth directed connectivity pattern could be anticipated with confidence. Specifically, we exploited the established 'sensory reactivation' effect in episodic memory, in which retrieval of sensory information reactivates regions involved in perceiving that sensory modality. Subjects performed a paired associate task in separate fMRI and MEG sessions, in which a ground truth reversal in directed connectivity between auditory and visual sensory regions was instantiated across task conditions. This directed connectivity reversal was successfully recovered across different algorithms, including Granger causality and Bayes network (IMAGES) approaches, and across fMRI ('raw' and deconvolved) and source-modeled MEG. These results extend simulation studies of directed connectivity, and offer practical guidelines for the use of such methods in clarifying causal mechanisms of neural processing.",

On the basis of three objective tests and a questionnaire, we show that (a) the prevalence of congenital amusia is only 1.5% with slightly more females than males, unlike other developmental disorders where males often predominate; (b) self-disclosure is a reliable index of congenital amusia, that suggests that congenital amusia is hereditary with 46% first-degree relatives similarly affected; c) that the deficit is not attenuated by musical training and d) it emerges in relative isolation from other cognitive disorder except for spatial orientation problems.

    "abstract": "Folded states of single domain globular proteins, the workhorses in cells, are compact with high packing density. It is known that the radius of gyration, Rg, of both the folded and unfolded (created by adding denaturants) states increase as N{nu} where N is the number of amino acids in the protein. The values of the celebrated Flory exponent{nu} are, respectively, [Formula], and {approx} 0.6 in the folded and unfolded states, which coincide with those found in homopolymers in poor and good solvents, respectively. However, the extent of compaction of the unfolded state of a protein under low denaturant concentration, conditions favoring the formation of the folded state, is unknown. This problem which goes to the heart of how proteins fold, with implications for the evolution of foldable sequences, is unsolved. We develop a theory based on polymer physics concepts that uses the contact map of proteins as input to quantitatively assess collapsibility of proteins. The model, which includes only two-body excluded volume interactions and attractive interactions reflecting the contact map, has only expanded and compact states. Surprisingly, we find that although protein collapsibility is universal, the propensity to be compact depends on the protein architecture. Application of the theory to over two thousand proteins shows that the extent of collapsibility depends not only on N but also on the contact map reflecting the native fold structure. A major prediction of the theory is that {beta}-sheet proteins are far more collapsible than structures dominated by -helices. The theory and the accompanying simulations, validating the theoretical predictions, fully resolve the apparent controversy between conclusions reached using different experimental probes assessing the extent of compaction of a couple proteins. As a by product, we show that the theory correctly predicts the scaling of the collapse temperature of homopolymers as a function of the number of monomers. By calculating the criterion for collapsibility as a function of protein length we provide quantitative insights into the reasons why single domain proteins are small and the physical reasons for the origin of multi-domain proteins. We also show that non-coding RNA molecules, whose collapsibility is similar to proteins with {beta}-sheet structures, must undergo collapse prior to folding, adding support to \\\"Compactness Selection Hypothesis\\\" proposed in the context of RNA compaction.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomic expertise for the identification of species is rare and costly. On-going advances in computer vision and machine learning have led to the development of numerous semi- and fully automated species identification systems. However, these systems are rarely agnostic to specific morphology, rarely can perform taxonomic \\\"approximation\\\" (by which we mean partial identification at least to higher taxonomic level if not to species), and frequently rely on costly scientific imaging technologies. We present a generic, hierarchical identification system for automated taxonomic approximation of organisms from images. We assessed the effectiveness of this system using photographs of slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae), for which we implemented image pre-processing, segmentation, and colour and shape feature extraction algorithms to obtain digital phenotypes for 116 species. The identification system trained on these digital phenotypes uses a nested hierarchy of artificial neural networks for pattern recognition and automated classification that mirrors the Linnean taxonomy, such that user-submitted photos can be assigned a genus, section, and species classification by traversing this hierarchy. Performance of the identification system varied depending on photo quality, number of species included for training, and desired taxonomic level for identification. High quality photos were scarce for some taxa and were under-represented in the training set, resulting in imbalanced network training. The image features used for training were sufficient to reliably identify photos to the correct genus but less so to the correct section and species. The outcomes of this project include a library of feature extraction algorithms called ImgPheno, a collection of scripts for neural network training called NBClassify, a library for evolutionary optimization of artificial neural network construction called AI::FANN::Evolving and a planned web application called OrchID for identification of user-submitted images.

    "abstract": "BackgroundChimeric transcripts are commonly defined as transcripts linking two or more different genes in the genome, and can be explained by various biological mechanisms such as genomic rearrangement, read-through or trans-splicing, but also by technical or biological artefacts.

Many programs have recently been developed to identify chimeras from Illumina RNA-seq data (mostly fusion genes in cancer). However outputs of different programs on the same dataset can be widely inconsistent, and tend to include many false positives. Other issues relate to simulated datasets restricted to fusion genes, real datasets with limited numbers of validated cases, result inconsistencies between simulated and real datasets, and gene rather than junction level assessment.\\n\\nResultsHere we present ChimPipe, a modular and easy-to-use method to reliably identify chimeras from paired-end Illumina RNA-seq data. We have also produced realistic simulated datasets for three different read lengths, and enhanced two gold-standard cancer datasets by associating exact junction points to validated gene fusions. Benchmarking ChimPipe together with four other state-of-the-art tools on this data showed ChimPipe to be the top program at identifying exact junction coordinates for both kinds of datasets, and the one showing the best trade-off between sensitivity and precision. Applied to 106 ENCODE human RNA-seq datasets, ChimPipe identified 137 high confidence chimeras connecting the protein coding sequence of their parent genes. In subsequent experiments, three out of four predicted chimeras, two of which recurrently expressed in a large majority of the samples, could be validated. Cloning and sequencing of the three cases revealed several new chimeric transcript structures, 3 of which with the potential to encode a chimeric protein for which we hypothesized a new role.\\n\\nConclusionsChimPipe combines spanning and paired end RNA-seq reads to detect any kind of chimeras, including read-throughs, and shows an excellent trade-off between sensitivity and precision. The chimeras found by ChimPipe can be validated in-vitro with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The so-called steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) are rhythmic brain responses to rhythmic sensory stimulation, and are often used to study perceptual and attentional processes. We present a data analysis method for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow-band steady-state response in the frequency and time-frequency domains. The method, termed rhythmic entrainment source separation (RESS), is based on denoising source separation approaches that take advantage of the simultaneous but differential projection of neural activity to many non-invasively placed electrodes or sensors. Our approach is a combination and extension of existing multivariate source separation methods. We demonstrate that RESS performs well on both simulated and empirical data, and outperforms conventional SSEP analysis methods based on selecting electrodes with the strongest SSEP response. We also discuss the potential confound of overfitting--whereby the filter captures noise in absence of a signal. Matlab scripts are available to replicate and extend our simulations and methods. We conclude with some practical advice for optimizing SSEP data analyses and interpreting the results.",

The first focuses on organismal phenotypes, and on the information that organisms acquire about their environment. The second connects information-theoretic concepts to genotypic change. The genotypic and phenotypic level can be linked by experimental high-throughput genotyping and computational models of genotype-phenotype relationships. I here use a simple information-theoretic framework to compute a phenotypes information content (its phenotypic complexity), and the information gain or change that comes with a new phenotype. I apply this framework to experimental data on DNA-binding phenotypes of multiple transcription factors. Low phenotypic complexity is associated with a biological systems ability to discover novel phenotypes in evolution. I show that DNA duplications lower phenotypic complexity, which illustrates how information theory can help explain why gene duplications accelerate evolutionary adaptation. I also demonstrate that with the right experimental design, sequencing data can be used to infer the information gain associated with novel evolutionary adaptations, for example in laboratory evolution experiments. Information theory can help quantify the evolutionary progress embodied in the discovery of novel adaptive phenotypes.",

In-spite of their positive role in cell survival, modifications like cytosine methylation incur a mutational cost. Cytosine methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine, is prone to hydrolytic deamination which leads to C [-&gt;] T and G [-&gt;] A transitions. Here, we first study the abundance of mutagenic cytosine methylation target motifs and show that bacteria like Vibrio cholerae might use motif avoidance as a strategy to minimize the mutational effect of deamination of methylated cytosine. Second by performing SNP analysis on whole genome sequence data from Vibrio cholerae patient isolates we show a) high abundance of cytosine methylation-dependent mutations in the cytosine methylation target motif RCCGGY, b) 95% of these C [-&gt;] T and G [-&gt;] A transitions in the coding region lead to non-synonymous substitutions and c) many of these transitions are associated with membrane proteins and are implicated in virulence.

    "abstract": "AsbtractContext is known to affect how a stimulus is perceived. A variety of illusions have been attributed to contextual processing -- from orientation tilt effects to chromatic induction phenomena, but their neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we present a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. A key feature of the model is the postulated existence of two spatially disjoint near-vs. far-extra-classical regions with complementary facilitatory and suppressive contributions to the classical receptive field. The model accounts for a variety of contextual illusions, reveals commonalities between seemingly disparate phenomena, and helps organize them into a novel taxonomy. It explains how center-surround interactions may shift from attraction to repulsion in tilt effects, and from contrast to assimilation in induction phenomena. The model further explains enhanced perceptual shifts generated by a class of patterned background stimuli that activate the two opponent extra-classical regions cooperatively. Overall, the ability of the model to account for the variety and complexity of contextual illusions provides computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular signatures identified from high-throughput transcriptomic studies often have poor reliability and fail to reproduce across studies. One solution is to combine independent studies into a single integrative analysis, additionally increasing sample size. However, the different protocols and technological platforms across transcriptomic studies produce unwanted systematic variation that strongly confounds the integrative analysis results. When studies aim to discriminate an outcome of interest, the common approach is a sequential two-step procedure; unwanted systematic variation removal techniques are applied prior to classification methods.\\n\\nResultsTo limit the risk of overfitting and over-optimistic results of a two-step procedure, we developed a novel multivariate integration method, MINT, that simultaneously accounts for unwanted systematic variation and identifies predictive gene signatures with greater reproducibility and accuracy. In two biological examples on the classification of three human cell types and four subtypes of breast cancer, we combined high-dimensional microarray and RNA-seq data sets and MINT identified highly reproducible and relevant gene signatures predictive of a given phenotype. MINT led to superior classification and prediction accuracy compared to the existing sequential two-step procedures.\\n\\nConclusionsMINT is a powerful approach and the first of its kind to solve the integrative classification framework in a single step by combining multiple independent studies.

    "abstract": "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are the consensus marker for determination of microbial diversity on the planet, invaluable in studies of evolution and, for the past decade, high-throughput sequencing of variable regions of ribosomal RNA genes has become the backbone of most microbial ecology studies. However, the underlying reference databases of full-length rRNA gene sequences are underpopulated, ecosystem skewed1, and subject to primer bias2, which hamper our ability to study the true diversity of ecosystems. Here we present an approach that combines reverse transcription of full-length small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes and synthetic long read sequencing by molecular tagging, to generate primer-free, full-length SSU rRNA gene sequences from all domains of life, with a median raw error rate of 0.17%. We generated thousands of full-length SSU rRNA sequences from five well-studied ecosystems (soil, human gut, fresh water, anaerobic digestion, and activated sludge) and obtained sequences covering all domains of life and the majority of all described phyla. Interestingly, 30% of all bacterial operational taxonomic units were novel, compared to the SILVA database (less than 97% similarity). For the Eukaryotes, the novelty was even larger with 63% of all OTUs representing novel taxa. In addition, 15% of the 18S rRNA OTUs were highly novel sequences with less than 80% similarity to the databases. The generation of primer-free full-length SSU rRNA sequences enabled eco-system specific estimation of primer-bias and, especially for eukaryotes, showed a dramatic discrepancy between the in-silico evaluation and primer-free data generated in this study. The large amount of novel sequences obtained here reaffirms that there is still vast, untapped microbial diversity lacking representatives in the SSU rRNA databases and that there might be more than millions after all1, 3. With our new approach, it is possible to readily expand the rRNA databases by orders of magnitude within a short timeframe. This will, for the first time, enable a broad census of the tree of life.",

A common view is that a stable and shared frequency over time is required for robust and functional synchronization. To the contrary, we found that non-stationary instantaneous frequency modulations were essential for synchronization. First, we recorded gamma rhythms in monkey visual area V1, and found that they synchronized by continuously modulating their frequency difference in a phase-dependent manner. The frequency modulation properties regulated both the phase-locking and the preferred phase-relation between gamma rhythms. Second, our experimental observations were in agreement with a biophysical model of gamma rhythms and were accurately predicted by the theory of weakly coupled oscillators revealing the underlying theoretical principles that govern gamma synchronization. Thus, synchronization through instantaneous frequency modulations represents a fundamental principle of gamma-band neural coordination that is likely generalizable to other brain rhythms.",

Haplotype data provide an alternative method for detecting associations between variants in weak linkage disequilibrium with genotyped variants and a given trait of interest. A genome-wide haplotype association study for MDD was undertaken utilising a family-based population cohort, Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (n = 18 773), as a discovery cohort with UK Biobank used as a population-based cohort replication cohort (n = 25 035). Fine mapping of haplotype boundaries was used to account for overlapping haplotypes potentially tagging the same causal variant. Within the discovery cohort, two haplotypes exceeded genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) for an association with MDD. One of these haplotypes was nominally significant in the replication cohort (P < 0.05) and was located in 6q21, a region which has been previously associated with bipolar disorder, a psychiatric disorder that is phenotypically and genetically correlated with MDD. Several haplotypes with P < 10-7 in the discovery cohort were located within gene coding regions associated with diseases that are comorbid with MDD. Using such haplotypes to highlight regions for sequencing may lead to the identification of the underlying causal variants.",
