    "abstract": "We introduce Salmon, a new method for quantifying transcript abundance from RNA-seq reads that is highly-accurate and very fast. Salmon is the first transcriptome-wide quantifier to model and correct for fragment GC content bias, which we demonstrate substantially improves the accuracy of abundance estimates and the reliability of subsequent differential expression analysis compared to existing methods that do not account for these biases. Salmon achieves its speed and accuracy by combining a new dual-phase parallel inference algorithm and feature-rich bias models with an ultra-fast read mapping procedure. These innovations yield both exceptional accuracy and order-of-magnitude speed benefits over alignment-based methods.",

    "abstract": "One way to analyze the relationship between species attributes and sample attributes via the matrix of species composition is to calculate the community-weighted mean of species attributes (CWM) and relate it to sample attributes by correlation, regression or ANOVA. This weighted-mean approach is frequently used by vegetation ecologists to relate species attributes like plant functional traits or Ellenberg-like species indicator values to sample attributes like measured environmental variables, biotic properties, species richness or sample scores in ordination analysis.\\n\\nThe problem with the weighted-mean approach is that, in certain cases, it yields biased results in terms of both effect size and P-values, and this bias is contingent upon the beta diversity of the species composition data. The reason is that CWM values calculated from samples of communities sharing some species are not independent of each other. This influences the number of effective degrees of freedom, which is usually lower than the actual number of samples, and the difference further increases with decreasing beta diversity of the data set. The discrepancy between the number of effective degrees of freedom and the number of samples in analysis turns into biased effect sizes and an inflated Type I error rate in those cases where the significance of the relationship is tested by standard tests, a problem which is analogous to analysis of two spatially autocorrelated variables. Consequently, results of studies using rather homogeneous (although not necessarily small) compositional data sets may be overly optimistic, and effect sizes of studies based on data sets differing by their beta diversity are not directly comparable.\\n\\nHere, I introduce guidelines on how to decide in which situation the bias is actually a problem when interpreting results, recognizing that there are several types of species and sample attributes with different properties and that ecological hypotheses commonly tested by the weighted-mean approach fall into one of three broad categories. I also compare available analytical solutions accounting for the bias (modified permutation test and sequential permutation test using the fourth-corner statistic) and suggest rules for their use.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Gene gains and losses shape the gene complement of animal lineages and are a fundamental aspect of genomic evolution. Acquiring a comprehensive view of the evolution of gene repertoires is however limited by the intrinsic limitations of common sequence similarity searches and available databases. Thus, a subset of the complement of an organism consists of hidden orthologs, those with no apparent homology with common sequenced animal lineages --mistakenly considered new genes-- but actually representing fast evolving orthologs of presumably lost proteins. Here, we describe 'Leapfrog', an automated pipeline that uses increased taxon sampling to overcome long evolutionary distances and identify hidden orthologs in large transcriptomic databases. As a case study, we used 35 transcriptomes of 29 flatworm lineages to recover 3,597 hidden orthologs. Unexpectedly, we do not observe a correlation between the number of hidden orthologs in a lineage and its 'average' evolutionary rate. Hidden orthologs do not show unusual sequence composition biases (e.g. GC content, average length, domain composition), but do appear to be more common in genes with binding or catalytic activity. By using 'Leapfrog', we identify key centrosome-related genes and homeodomain classes previously reported as absent in free-living flatworms, e.g. planarians. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that hidden orthologs comprise a significant proportion of the gene repertoire, qualifying the impact of gene losses and gains in gene complement evolution.",

This article reports improved B-factor prediction achieved by sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond molecular dynamics simulations that use uniformly increased atomic masses by 100-fold to increase time resolution. Using the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, ubiquitin, and lysozyme as model systems, the B-factor root mean square deviations (mean {+/-} standard error) of these proteins were 3.1 {+/-} 0.2-9 {+/-} 1 [A]2 for C and 7.3 {+/-} 0.9-9.6 {+/-} 0.2 [A]2 for C{gamma}, when the sampling was done, for each of these proteins, over 20 distinct, independent, and 50-picosecond high-mass molecular dynamics simulations using AMBER forcefield FF12MC or FF14SB.

    "abstract": "Translating the ever-increasing wealth of information on microbiomes (environment, host, or built environment) to advance the understanding of system-level processes is proving to be an exceptional research challenge. One reason for this challenge is that relationships between characteristics of microbiomes and the system-level processes they influence are often evaluated in the absence of a robust conceptual framework and reported without elucidating the underlying causal mechanisms. The reliance on correlative approaches limits the potential to expand the inference of a single relationship to additional systems and advance the field. We propose that research focused on how microbiomes influence the systems they inhabit should work within a common framework and target known microbial processes that contribute to the system-level processes of interest. Here we identify three distinct categories of microbiome characteristics (microbial processes, microbial community properties, and microbial membership) and propose a framework to empirically link each of these categories to each other and the broader system level processes they affect. We posit that it is particularly important to distinguish microbial community properties that can be predicted from constituent taxa (community aggregated traits) from and those properties that are currently unable to be predicted from constituent taxa (emergent properties). Existing methods in microbial ecology can be applied to more explicitly elucidate properties within each of these categories and connect these three categories of microbial characteristics with each other. We view this proposed framework, gleaned from a breadth of research on environmental microbiomes and ecosystem processes, as a promising pathway with the potential to advance discovery and understanding across a broad range of microbiome science.",

    "abstract": "Snakes numerous fascinating features distinctive from other tetrapods necessitate a rich history of genome evolution that is still obscure. To address this, we report the first high-quality genome of a viper, Deinagkistrodon acutus and comparative analyses using other species from major snake and lizard lineages. We map the evolution trajectories of transposable elements (TEs), developmental genes and sex chromosomes onto the snake phylogeny. TEs exhibit dynamic lineage-specific expansion. And in the viper many TEs may have been rewired into the regulatory network of brain genes, as shown by their associated expression with nearby genes in the brain but not in other tissues. We detect signatures of adaptive evolution in olfactory, venom and thermal-sensing genes, and also functional degeneration of genes associated with vision and hearing. Many Hox and Tbx limb-patterning genes show evidence of relaxed selective constraints, and such genes phylogenetic distribution supports fossil evidence for a successive loss of forelimbs then hindlimbs during the snake evolution. Finally, we infer that the Z and W sex chromosomes had undergone at least three recombination suppression events at the ancestor of advanced snakes, with the W chromosomes showing a gradient of degeneration from basal to advanced snakes. These results, together with all the genes identified as undergoing adaptive or degenerative evolution episodes at respective snake lineages forge a framework for our deep understanding into snakes molecular evolution history.",

    "abstract": "1To extract patterns from neuroimaging data, various techniques, including statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, have been explored to ultimately aid in Alzheimers disease diagnosis of older adults in both clinical and research applications. However, identifying the distinctions between Alzheimers brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. Recently, cutting-edge deep learning technologies have been rapidly expanding into numerous fields, including medical image analysis. This work outlines state-of-the-art deep learning-based pipelines employed to distinguish Alzheimers magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI data from normal healthy control data for the same age group. Using these pipelines, which were executed on a GPU-based high performance computing platform, the data were strictly and carefully preprocessed. Next, scale and shift invariant low- to high-level features were obtained from a high volume of training images using convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In this study, functional MRI data were used for the first time in deep learning applications for the purposes of medical image analysis and Alzheimers disease prediction. These proposed and implemented pipelines, which demonstrate a significant improvement in classification output when compared to other studies, resulted in high and reproducible accuracy rates of 99.9% and 98.84% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively. Additionally, the subject-level classification was performed that resulted in the averaged accuracy rate of 94.32% and 97.88% for the fMRI and MRI pipeline respectively. Finally, a decision making algorithm was designed for the subject-level classification and improved the averaged accuracy rate to 97.77% for fMRI and 100% MRI subjects.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhylogenetic codon models are often used to characterize the selective regimes acting on protein coding sequences. Recent methodological developments have led to models explicitly accounting for the interplay between mutation and selection, by explicitly modelling the amino acid fitness landscape along the sequence. However, thus far, most of these models have assumed that the fitness landscape is constant over time. Fluctuations of the fitness landscape may often be random or depend on complex and unknown factors. However, some organisms may be subject to systematic changes in selective pressure, resulting in reproducible molecular adaptations across independent lineages subject to similar conditions.\\n\\nResultsHere, we developed a codon-based differential selection model, which aims to detect and quantify the fine-grained consistent patterns of adaptation at the protein-coding level, as a function of external conditions experienced by the organism under investigation. The model parameterizes the global mutational pressure, as well as the site- and condition-specific amino acid selective preferences. This phylogenetic model is implemented in a Bayesian MCMC framework. After validation with simulations, we applied our method to a dataset of HIV sequences from patients with known HLA genetic background. Our differential selection model detects and characterizes differentially selected coding positions specifically associated with two different HLA alleles.\\n\\nConclusionour differential selection model is able to identify consistent molecular adaptations as a function of repeated changes in the environment of the organism. These models can be applied to many other problems, ranging from viral adaptation to evolution of life-history strategies in plants or animals.",

In order to evaluate the potential applications of MNC, we looked for the presence of a fourth dimensions distinctive hallmarks in a temporal sequence of 2D images taken during spontaneous brain activity. Indeed, recent findings suggest that several brain activities, such as mind-wandering and memory retrieval, might take place in the functional space of a four dimensional hypersphere, which is a double donut-like structure undetectable in the usual three dimensions. We found that the Renyi entropy is higher in MNC areas than in the surrounding ones, and that these temporal patterns closely resemble the trajectories predicted by the possible presence of a hypersphere in the brain.",

Mollusks are among the organisms that successfully invaded the non-marine realm, resulting in the radiation of terrestrial panpulmonate gastropods. We compared transcriptomes from panpulmonates to study the selective pressures that modeled the transitions from marine into freshwater and terrestrial realms in this molluscan lineage.\\n\\nResultsDe novo assembly of six panpulmonate transcriptomes resulted in 55,000 - 97,000 predicted open reading frames, of which 9 - 14% were functionally annotated. Adding published transcriptomes, we predicted 791 ortholog clusters shared among fifteen panpulmonate species, resulting in 702 amino acid and 736 codon-wise alignments. The branch-site test of positive selection applied to the codon-wise alignments showed twenty-eight genes under positive selection in the freshwater lineages and seven in the terrestrial lineages. Gene ontology categories of these candidate genes include actin assembly, transport of glucose, and the tyrosine metabolism in the terrestrial lineages; and, DNA repair, metabolism of xenobiotics, mitochondrial electron transport, and ribosome biogenesis in the freshwater lineages.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified candidate genes representing processes that may have played a key role during the water-to-land transition in Panpulmonata. These genes were involved in energy metabolism and gas-exchange surface development in the terrestrial lineages and in the response to the abiotic stress factors (UV radiation, osmotic pressure, xenobiotics) in the freshwater lineages.

    "abstract": "Expecting events in time leads to more efficient behavior. A remarkable early finding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on reaction times; i.e., the fact that the time period between a warning signal and an impendent stimuli, to which subjects are instructed to respond as quickly as possible, influences reaction times. Recently it has been shown that the phase of oscillatory activity preceding stimulus presentation is related to behavior. Here we connect both of these findings by reporting a novel foreperiod effect on the inter-trial phase coherence triggered by a stimulus to which subjects do not respond. Until now, inter-trial phase coherence has been used to describe a regularity in the phases of groups of trials. We propose a single-trial measure of inter-trial phase coherence and prove its soundness. Equipped with this measure, and using a multivariate decoding method, we demonstrate that the foreperiod duration modulates single-trial phase coherence. In principle, this modulation could be an artifact due to the decoding method used to detect it. We show that this is not the case, since the modulation can also be observed with a very simple averaging method. Although real, the single-trial modulation of inter-trial phase coherence by the foreperiod duration could just reflect a nuisance in our data. We argue against this possibility by showing that the strength of the modulation correlates with subjects behavioral measures, both error rates and mean-reaction times. We anticipate that the new foreperiod effect on inter-trial phase coherence, and the decoding method used here to detect it, will be important tools to understand cognition at the single-trial level. In Part II of this manuscript, we support this claim, by showing that attention modulates the strength of the new foreperiod effect in a trial-by-trial basis.",

The evolution of populations of mixed mtDNA types is complicated and poorly understood, and variability of these controlled admixtures plays a central role in the inheritance and onset of genetic disease. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the evolution and variability in these stochastic populations for any type of cellular control, showing that cell-to-cell variability in mtDNA, and mutant load, inevitably increases with time, according to rates which we derive and which are notably independent of the mechanistic details of feedback signalling. We show with a set of experimental case studies that this theory explains disparate quantitative results from classical and modern experimental and computational studies on heteroplasmy variance in different species. We demonstrate that our general model provides a host of specific insights, including a modification of the often-used but hard-to-interpret Wright formula to correspond directly to biological observables, the ability to quantify selective and mutational pressure in mtDNA populations, and the pronounced variability inevitably arising from the action of possible mtDNA quality-control mechanisms. Our general theoretical framework, supported by existing experimental results, thus helps understand and predict the evolution of stochastic mtDNA populations in cell biology.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide and, very soon, sequencing association studies, might yield multiple regions harbouring interesting association signals. Given that each region encompasses numerous variants in high linkage disequilibrium, it is not clear which are i) truly causal or ii) just reasonably close to the causal ones. Researchers proposed many methods to predict, albeit not test, the causal SNPs in a region, a process commonly denoted as fine-mapping. Unfortunately, all existing fine-mapping methods output posterior causality probabilities assuming that causal SNPs are among those already measured in the study, or have been catalogued elsewhere. However, due to technological and computational obstacles in calling many types of genetic variants, such assumption is not realistic. We propose a novel method/software, denoted as Quasi-CAausality Test (QCAT), for testing (not just predicting) the causality of any catalogued genetic variant. QCAT i) makes no assumption that causal variants are among catalogued variants, and ii) makes use of easily available summary statistics from genetic studies, e.g. variant association Z-scores, to make statistical inferences. The proposed statistical test controls the type I error at or below the desired level. Its practical application to well-known smoking association signals provide some insightful results. The QCAT software is publically available at: http://dleelab.github.io/qcat/",

    "abstract": "Modern gene therapies aim to prevent the inheritance of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from mother to offspring by using a third-party mtDNA background. Technological limitations mean that these therapies may result in a small amount of maternal mtDNA admixed with a majority of third-party mtDNA. This situation is unstable if the mothers mtDNA experiences a proliferative advantage over the third-party mtDNA, in which case the efficacy of the therapy may be undermined. Animal models suggest that the likelihood of such a proliferative advantage increases with increasing genetic distance between mother and third-party mtDNA, but in real therapeutic contexts the genetic distance, and so the importance of this effect, remains unclear. Here we harness a large volume of available human mtDNA data to model random sampling of mother and third-party mtDNAs from real human populations. We show that even within the same haplogroup, genetic differences around 20-80 SNPs are common between mtDNAs. These values are sufficient to lead to substantial segregation in murine models, over an organismal lifetime, even given low starting heteroplasmy, inducing increases from 5% to 35% over one year. Randomly pairing mothers and third-party women in clinical contexts thus runs the risk that substantial mtDNA segregation will compromise the beneficial effects of the therapy. We suggest that choices of  mtDNA donors be based on recent shared maternal ancestry, or, preferentially, explicit haplotype matching, in order to reduce the potential for problems in the implementation of these therapies.",

    "abstract": "The ability to use words to refer to the world is vital to the communicative power of human language. In particular, the anaphoric use of words to refer to previously mentioned concepts (antecedents) allows dialogue to be coherent and meaningful. Psycholinguistic theory posits that anaphor comprehension involves reactivating a memory representation of the antecedent. Whereas this implies the involvement of recognition memory, the neural processes for reference resolution are largely unknown. Here, we report time-frequency analysis of four EEG experiments to reveal the increased coupling of functional neural systems associated with referentially coherent expressions compared to referentially ambiguous expressions. Despite varying in modality, language, and type of referential expression, all experiments showed larger gamma-band power for coherence compared to ambiguity. Beamformer analysis in high-density Experiment 4 localised this increase to posterior parietal cortex around 400-600 ms after anaphor-onset and to frontal-temporal cortex around 500-1000 ms. We argue that the observed gamma-band power increases reflect successful referential binding and resolution, which links incoming information to antecedents through an interaction between the brains recognition memory networks and frontal-temporal language network. We integrate these findings with previous results from patient and neuroimaging studies, and outline a nascent cortico-hippocampal theory of reference.",

    "abstract": "A simple statistical mechanical model proposed by Wako and Saito has explained the aspects of protein folding surprisingly well. This model was systematically applied to multiple proteins by Munoz and Eaton and has since been referred to as the Wako-Saito-Munoz-Eaton (WSME) model. The success of the WSME model in explaining the folding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is dominated by native interactions, which makes the energy landscape globally biased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models, Saito emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in protein folding; folding starts with the creation of contiguous segments having a native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these segments. The{phi} -values calculated for barnase with the WSME model suggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the structural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME model was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having a complex topology, which opened the way to comprehensively understanding the folding process of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe allosteric transitions, indicating that the allosteric structural movement does not occur as a deterministic sequential change between two conformations but as a stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape. Statistical mechanical viewpoint on folding, as highlighted by the WSME model, has been renovated in the context of modern methods and ideas, and will continue to provide insights on equilibrium and dynamical features of proteins.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of large data sets describing reproductive isolation between species that vary in their degrees of relatedness has been extremely influential in the study of speciation. However, several limitations make it difficult to test specific hypotheses about which factors predict the evolution of reproductive isolation. In particular, the statistical methods typically used are limited in their ability to test complex hypotheses involving multiple predictor variables or interactions between variables; at least one method, the Mantel Test, has also been found to be unreliable. In this paper, I describe a framework to determine which factors contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation using phylogenetic linear mixed models. Phylogenetic linear mixed models do not suffer from the same statistical limitations as other methods and I demonstrate the flexibility of this framework to analyze data collected at different evolutionary scales, to test both categorical and continuous predictor variables, and to test the effect of multiple predictors simultaneously, all of which cannot be achieved using any other single statistical method. I do so by re-analyzing several classic data sets and explicitly testing hypotheses that had previously been untested directly, including differences in accumulation of reproductive isolation between sympatric and allopatric species pairs.",

    "abstract": "High-order epistasis has been observed in many genotype-phenotype maps. These multi-way interactions between mutations may be useful for dissecting complex traits and could have profound implications for evolution. Alternatively, they could be a statistical artifact. High-order epistasis models assume the effects of mutations should add, when they could in fact multiply or combine in some other nonlinear way. A mismatch in the \\\"scale\\\" of the epistasis model and the scale of the underlying map would lead to spurious epistasis. In this paper, we develop an approach to estimate the nonlinear scales of arbitrary genotype-phenotype maps. We can then linearize these maps and extract high-order epistasis. We investigated seven experimental genotype-phenotype maps for which high-order epistasis had been reported previously. We find that five of the seven maps exhibited nonlinear scales. Interestingly, even after accounting for nonlinearity, we found statistically significant high-order epistasis in all seven maps. The contributions of high-order epistasis to the total variation ranged from 2.2% to 31.0%, with an average across maps of 12.7%. Our results provide strong evidence for extensive high-order epistasis, even after nonlinear scale is taken into account. Further, we describe a simple method to estimate and account for nonlinearity in genotype-phenotype maps.",

SJB and JSW wrote the paper.\\n\\nScientific significance statementZooplankton grazing is an important driver of plankton mortality and is a core component of the microbial loop. The dilution method is the prevailing tool used to measure the impact of zooplankton in marine microbial communities. However, the theoretical model underlying the interpretation of experimental measurements using this method does not account for niche competition between plankton. As a consequence, we show that the dilution method may conflate the effects of grazing with those of niche competition, implying that previously reported grazing rates could be overestimated. We propose modifying the classical dilution method by diluting only the zooplankton and then measuring the response of plankton. This \\\"Z-dilution\\\" method explicitly accounts for the effects of niche competition in limiting net plankton growth. We find the Z-dilution method provides robust grazing rate estimates in theory and suggest ways in which the relative strength of niche competition to zooplankton grazing could be measured by combining the Z-dilution and classical dilution methods.\\n\\nData availability statementCode is available from http://github.com/WeitzGroup/DilutionMethod-NicheCompetition and is archived on Zenodo at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.61196 (Beckett and Weitz, 2016).\\n\\nAbstractThe dilution method is the principal tool used to infer in situ microzooplankton grazing rates. However, grazing is the only mortality process considered by the theoretical model underlying the interpretation of dilution method experiments. We show an alternative interpretation arises when there is concurrent niche competition within the plankton community. We find that grazing rates may be overestimated - the degree of overestimation is related to the importance of niche competition relative to zooplankton grazing. Thus, we propose a modification to the dilution method to disentangle the effects of niche competition and zooplankton grazing. Our theoretical results suggest the revised \\\"Z-dilution\\\" method can robustly infer grazing mortality, regardless of the dominant plankton mortality driver. Further, we show it is possible to independently estimate both grazing mortality and niche competition when the classical and Z-dilution methods are used in tandem. We discuss the significance of these results for quantifying plankton mortality rates.",

Slowly evolving proteins or sites within proteins were assumed to be more functionally important and thus subject to stronger selection pressure. More recently, biophysical models of protein evolution, which combine evolutionary theory with protein biophysics, have completely revolutionized our view of the forces that shape sequence divergence. Slowly evolving proteins have been found to evolve slowly because of selection against toxic mis-folding and misinteractions, linking their rate of evolution primarily to their abundance. Similarly, most slowly evolving sites in proteins are not directly involved in function, but mutating them has large impacts on protein structure and stability. Here, we review the studies of the emergent field of biophysical protein evolution that have shaped our current understanding of sequence divergence patterns. We also propose future research directions to develop this nascent field.",

Modern mass spectrometry enables detailed functional characterization of the pathogenic biochemical processes, as achieved by accurate and comprehensive quantification of proteins and their regulatory chemical modifications. Here, we describe how high-accuracy mass spectrometry in combination with high-resolution chromatographic separations can be leveraged to meet these analytical requirements in a mechanism-focused manner. We review the quantification methods capable of producing accurate measurements of protein abundance and post-translational modification stoichiometries. We then discuss how experimental design and chromatographic resolution can be leveraged to achieve comprehensive functional characterization of biochemical processes in complex biological proteomes. Finally, we describe current approaches for quantitative analysis of a common functional protein modification: reversible phosphorylation. In all, current instrumentation and methods of high-resolution chromatography and mass spectrometry proteomics are poised for immediate translation into improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for pediatric and adult diseases.",

To push the operating limits of this unconventional centrifuge, we present an experimentally-validated theoretical model that describes the paperfuge as a non-linear, non-conservative oscillator system. We use this model to inform our design process, achieving speeds of 125,000 rpm and equivalent centrifugal forces of 30,000 g, with theoretical limits predicting one million rpm. We harness these speeds to separate pure plasma in less than 1.5 minutes and isolate malaria parasites in 15 minutes from whole human blood. By expanding the materials used, we implement centrifugal microfluidics using PDMS, plastic and 3D-printed devices, ultimately opening up new opportunities for electricity-free POC diagnostics, especially in resource-poor settings.",

    "abstract": "Geographic variation of color pattern in the South American poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) is an intriguing evolutionary phenomenon. These chemically defended anurans use bright aposematic colors to warn potential predators of their unpalatibility. However, aposematic signals are frequency-dependent and individuals deviating from a local model are at a higher risk of predation. The well-known examples of Batesian and Mullerian mimics, hymenopterans (wasps and bees) and Heliconius butterflies, both support the benefits of unique models with relatively high frequencies. However, extreme diversity in the aposematic signal has been documented in the poison frogs of the genus Dendrobates, especially in the Oophaga subgenus. Here we investigate the phylogenetic and genomic differentiations among populations of Oophaga sylvatica, which exhibit one of the highest phenotypic diversification among poison frogs. Using a combination of PCR amplicons (mitochondrial and nuclear markers) and genome wide markers from a double-digested RAD data set, we characterize 13 populations (12 monotypic and 1 polytypic) across the O. sylvatica distribution. These populations are mostly separated in two lineages distributed in the Northern and the Southern part of their range in Ecuador. We found relatively low genetic differentiation within each lineage, despite considerable phenotypic variation, and evidence suggesting ongoing gene flow and genetic admixture among some populations of the Northern lineage. Overall these data suggest that phenotypic diversification and novelty in aposematic coloration can arise in secondary contact zones even in systems where phenotypes are subject to strong stabilizing selection.",

    "abstract": "The human reference genome assembly plays a central role in nearly all aspects of todays basic and clinical research. GRCh38 is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since 2009 and reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and encompasses modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures and localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and used data from new genome mapping technologies and single haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also expanded the number of alternate loci to create a reference that provides a more robust representation of human population variation. We demonstrate that the updates render the reference an improved annotation substrate, alter read alignments in unchanged regions and impact variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection of new de novo long-read haploid assemblies and conclude that while the new assemblies compare favorably to the reference with respect to continuity, error rate, and gene completeness, the reference still provides the best representation for complex genomic regions and coding sequences. We assert that the collected updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our understanding of human biology and advance our efforts to improve health.",

    "abstract": "Abbreviations\\n\\nAbstractAn alternative model for protein translation is presented wherein ribosomes utilize a complementary RNA copy of protein coding sequences to monitor the progress of messenger RNAs during their translation to reduce the frequency of frameshifting errors. The synthesis of this  framing RNA is postulated to be catalyzed by the small subunit of the ribosome, in the decoding center, by excising and concatemerizing tRNA anticodons bound to each codon of the mRNA template. Various components of the model are supported by previous observations of tRNA mutants that impact ribosomal frameshifting, unique globin-coding RNAs in developing erythroblasts, and the epigenetic, intergenerational transfer of phenotypic traits via mammalian sperm RNA. Confirmation of the proposed translation mechanism is experimentally tractable and might significantly enhance our understanding of several fundamental biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Herbivore selection of plant hosts and plant responses to insect colonization have been subjects of intense investigations. A growing body of evidence suggests that for successful colonization to occur, (effector/virulence) proteins in insect saliva must modulate plant defense responses to the benefit of the insect. A range of insect saliva proteins that modulate plant defense responses have been identified, but there is no direct evidence that these proteins are delivered into specific plant tissues and enter plant cells. Aphids and other sap-sucking insects of the order Hemiptera use their specialized mouthparts (stylets) to probe plant mesophyll cells, until they reach the phloem cells for long-term feeding. Here we show by immunogold-labeling of ultrathin sections of aphid feeding sites that an immuno-suppressive aphid effector localizes in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells near aphid stylets, but not in cells further away from aphid feeding sites. In contrast, another aphid effector protein localizes in the sheaths composed of gelling saliva that surround the aphid stylets. Thus, insects deliver effectors directly into plant tissue. Moreover, different aphid effectors locate extracellularly in the sheath saliva or are introduced into the cytoplasm of plant cells.",

MutationalPatterns is an R/Bioconductor package that characterizes this broad range of mutational patterns and potential relations with (epi-)genomic features. Furthermore, it offers an efficient method to quantify the contribution of known mutational signatures.

    "abstract": "De novo creation of protein coding genes involves formation of short ORFs from noncoding regions; some of these ORFs might then become fixed in the population. De novo created proteins need to, at the bare minimum, not cause serious harm to the organism, meaning that they should for instance not cause aggregation. Therefore, although the creation of the short ORFs could be truly random, but the fixation should be of subject to some selective pressure. The selective forces acting on de novo created proteins have been elusive and contradictory results have been reported. In Drosophila they are more disordered, i.e. are enriched in polar residues, than ancient proteins, while the opposite trend is present in yeast. To the best of our knowledge no valid explanation for this difference has been proposed.\\n\\nTo solve this riddle we studied structural properties and age of all proteins in 187 eukaryotic species. We find that, on average, there are small differences between proteins of different ages, with the exception that younger proteins are shorter. However, when we take the GC content into account we find that this can explain the opposite trends observed in yeast (low GC) and drosophila (high GC). GC content is correlated with codons coding for disorder-promoting amino acids, and inversely correlated with transmembrane, helix and sheet promoting residues. We find that for the youngest proteins, i.e. the ones that are most likely to be de novo created, there exists a strong correlation with GC and structural properties. In contrast, this strong relationship is not seen for ancient proteins. This leads us to propose that structural features are not a strong determining factor for fixation of de novo created genes. Instead these proteins resemble random proteins given a particular GC level. The dependency on GC content is then gradually weakened during evolution.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe show that the GC content of a genomic area is of great importance for the properties of a protein-coding de novo created gene. The GC content affects the frequency of the codons and this affects the probability for each amino acid to be included in a de novo created protein. The codons encoding for Ala, Pro and Glu contain 80% GC, while codons for Lys, Phe, Asn, Tyr and Ile contain 20% or less. Pro and Gly are disorder-promoting, while Phe, Tyr and Ile are order-promoting. Therefore random protein sequences at a high GC will be more disordered than the ones created at a low GC. The structural properties of the youngest (orphan) proteins match to a large degree the properties of random proteins when the GC content is taken into account. In contrast structural properties of ancient proteins only show a weak correlation with GC content. This suggests that even after fixation of de novo created proteins largely resemble random proteins given a certain GC content. Thereafter, during evolution the correlation between structural properties and GC weakens.",
