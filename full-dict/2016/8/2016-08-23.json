    "abstract": "Comparisons of DNA from archaic and modern humans show that these groups interbred, and in some cases received an evolutionary advantage from doing so. This process - adaptive introgression - may lead to a faster rate of adaptation than is predicted from models with mutation and selection alone. Within the last couple of years, a series of studies have identified regions of the genome that are likely examples of adaptive introgression. In many cases, once a region was ascertained as being introgressed, commonly used statistics based on both haplotype as well as allele frequency information were employed to test for positive selection. Introgression by itself, however, changes both the haplotype structure and the distribution of allele frequencies, thus confounding traditional tests for detecting positive selection. Therefore, patterns generated by introgression alone may lead to false inferences of positive selection. Here we explore models involving both introgression and positive selection to investigate the behavior of various statistics under adaptive introgression. In particular, we find that the number and allelic frequencies of sites that are uniquely shared between archaic humans and specific present-day populations are particularly useful for detecting adaptive introgression. We then examine the 1000 Genomes dataset to characterize the landscape of uniquely shared archaic alleles in human populations. Finally, we identify regions that were likely subject to adaptive introgression and discuss some of the most promising candidate genes located in these regions.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of neural population coding has been limited by a lack of analysis methods to characterize spiking data from large populations. The biggest challenge comes from the fact that the number of possible network activity patterns scales exponentially with the number of neurons recorded ([~] 2Neurons). Here we introduce a new statistical method for characterizing neural population activity that requires semi-independent fitting of only as many parameters as the square of the number of neurons, so requiring drastically smaller data sets and minimal computation time. The model works by matching the population rate (the number of neurons synchronously active) and the probability that each individual neuron fires given the population rate. We found that this model can accurately fit synthetic data from up to 1000 neurons. We also found that the model could rapidly decode visual stimuli from neural population data from macaque primary visual cortex, [~] 65 ms after stimulus onset. Finally, we used the model to estimate the entropy of neural population activity in developing mouse somatosensory cortex and surprisingly found that it first increases, then decreases during development. This statistical model opens new options for interrogating neural population data, and can bolster the use of modern large-scale in vivo Ca2+ and voltage imaging tools.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive mutations in somatic cells generate a heterogeneous genomic population within an organism and may result in serious medical conditions. While cancer is the most studied disease associated with somatic variations, recent advances in single cell and ultra deep sequencing indicate that a number of phenotypes and pathologies are impacted by cell specific variants. Currently, the accurate identification of low allelic frequency somatic variants relies on a combination of deep sequencing coverage and multiple evidences of the presence of variants. However, in this study we show that false positive variants can account for more than 70% of identified somatic variations, rendering conventional detection methods inadequate for accurate determination of low allelic variants. Interestingly, these false positive variants primarily originate from mutagenic DNA damage which directly confounds determination of genuine somatic mutations. Furthermore, we developed and validated a simple metric to measure mutagenic DNA damage, and demonstrated that mutagenic DNA damage is the leading cause of sequencing errors in widely used resources including the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.",

Using coalescence simulations modeling populations evolving in a tree-like fashion, we explore the adequacy of the Structure model and the Gaussian assumption for identifying ancestry components correctly and for inferring the correct tree. In most cases, ancestry components are inferred correctly, although sample sizes and times since admixture can influence the inferences. Similarly, the popular Gaussian approximation tends to perform poorly when branch lengths are long, although the tree topology is correctly inferred in all scenarios explored.

    "abstract": "Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by the UDP-GalNAc polypeptide:N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) family of enzymes. Their activity results in the GalNAc 1-O-Thr/Ser structure, termed the Tn antigen, which is further decorated with additional sugars. In neoplastic cells, the Tn antigen is often overexpressed. Because O-glycosylation is controlled by the activity of GalNAc-Ts, their regulation is of great interest. Previous reports suggest that growth factors, EGF or PDGF, induce Golgi complex-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) relocation of both GalNAc-Ts and Tn antigen in HeLa cells, offering a mechanism for Tn antigen overexpression termed \\\"GALA\\\". However, we were unable to reproduce these findings. Upon treatment of HeLa cells with either EGF or PDGF we observed no change in the co-localization of endogenous GalNAc-T1, GalNAc-T2 or Tn antigen with the Golgi complex marker TGN46. There was also no enhancement of localization with the ER marker calnexin. We conclude that growth factors do not cause redistribution of GalNAc-Ts from the Golgi complex to the ER in HeLa cells.",

While theoretical models have emphasized the importance of distinct biological factors, such as protein folding4, back mutations5, species complexity6,7, and mutational robustness8 at determining the DFE, it remains unclear which of these models can describe the DFE in natural populations. Here, we show that the theoretical models make distinct predictions about how the DFE will differ between species. We further show that humans have a higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations than Drosophila melanogaster. Comparing four categories of theoretical models, only Fishers Geometrical Model (FGM) is consistent with our data. FGM assumes that multiple phenotypes are under stabilizing selection, with the number of phenotypes defining a complexity of the organism. It suggests that long-term population size and cost of complexity drive the evolution of the DFE, with many implications for evolutionary and medical genomics.",

However, the stochastic blinking of single fluorophores can introduce large uncertainties into the final count. Here we provide a theoretical foundation for applying SLM to the problem of molecular counting based on the distribution of blinking events from a single fluorophore. We also show that by redundantly tagging single-molecules with multiple, blinking fluorophores, the accuracy of the technique can be enhanced by harnessing the central limit theorem. The coefficient of variation (CV) then, for the number of molecules M estimated from a given number of blinks B, scales like [Formula], where Nl is the mean number of labels on a target. As an example, we apply our theory to the challenging problem of quantifying the cell-to-cell variability of plasmid copy number in bacteria.",

Here we systematically profiled transcriptomes of human neural progenitor cells exposed to Asian ZIKVC, African ZIKVM, and dengue virus (DENV). In contrast to the robust global transcriptome changes induced by DENV, ZIKV has a more selective and larger impact on expression of genes involved in DNA replication and repair. While overall expression profiles are similar, ZIKVC, but not ZIKVM, induces upregulation of viral response genes and TP53. P53 inhibitors can block the apoptosis induced by both ZIKVC and ZIKVM in hNPCs, with higher potency against ZIKVC-induced apoptosis. Our analyses reveal virus- and strain-specific molecular signatures associated with ZIKV infection.

    "abstract": "In a recent paper1, we have derived three main conclusions: i) that all Asian and Pacific populations share a single origin and expansion out of Africa, contradicting an earlier proposal of two independent waves; ii) that populations from South and Southeast Asia harbor a small proportion of ancestry from an unknown extinct hominin - different from the Neanderthal and the Denisovan - which is absent in Europeans; and, iii) that the characteristic distinctive phenotypes (including very short stature) of Andamanese do not reflect an ancient African origin, but have resulted from strong natural selection on genes related to human body size. Although the single wave out of Africa2 and single origin for Asian and Pacific populations have been confirmed3, the existence of admixture with an extinct hominin has been challenged by Skoglund et al.4, as they were unable to replicate our results in their data sets. While we had used a wide variety of statistical methods and data sets from diverse populations to draw our inference, Skoglund et al.4 have used only one method (D-stats5, for the whole genome, not specifically for the relevant genomic regions) and compared only with the Asians, not even with the Europeans. Skoglund et al.4 have alleged that our statistical treatment of the data was faulty and have pointed out some possible sources of error. We have reexamined our data focusing on possible sources of error flagged by Skoglund et al4. We have also performed new analyses. The reexamination and new analyses have bolstered our confidence that our earlier inferences were correct and have resulted in an improved model of introgression of modern humans with a hitherto unknown archaic ancestry. We also propose a possible reason for the inability of Skoglund et al.4 to validate our inference.",

    "abstract": "Plant strategies for nutrient acquisition and recycling are key components of ecosystem functioning. How the evolution of such strategies modifies ecosystem functioning and services is still not well understood. In the present work, we aim at understanding how the evolution of different phenotypic traits link aboveground and belowground processes, thereby affecting the functioning of the ecosystem at different scales and in different realms. Using a simple model, we follow the dynamics of a limiting nutrient inside an ecosystem. Considering trade-offs between aboveground and belowground functional traits, we study the effects of the evolution of such strategies on ecosystem properties (amount of mineral nutrient, total plant biomass, dead organic matter and primary productivity) and whether such properties are maximized. Our results show that when evolution leads to a stable outcome, it minimizes the quantity of nutrient available (following Tilman's R* rule). We also show that considering the evolution of aboveground and belowground functional traits simultaneously, total plant biomass and primary productivity are not necessarily maximized through evolution. The coupling of aboveground and belowground processes through evolution may largely diminish predicted standing biomass and productivity (extinction may even occur), and impact the evolutionary resilience (ie, the return time to previous phenotypic states) of the ecosystem in face of external disturbances. We show that changes in plant biomass and their effects on evolutionary change can be understood by accounting for the links between nutrient uptake and mineralization, and for indirect effects of nutrient uptake on the amount of detritus in the system.",

    "abstract": "Concepts organize the relationship among individual stimuli or events by highlighting shared features. Often, new goals require updating conceptual knowledge to reflect relationships based on different goal-relevant features. Here, our aim is to determine how hippocampal (HPC) object representations are organized and updated to reflect changing conceptual knowledge. Participants learned two classification tasks in which successful learning required attention to different stimulus features, thus providing a means to index how representations of individual stimuli are reorganized according to changing task goals. We used a computational learning model to capture how people attended to goal-relevant features and organized object representations based on those features during learning. Using representational similarity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we demonstrate that neural representations in left anterior HPC correspond with model predictions of concept organization. Moreover, we show that during early learning, when concept updating is most consequential, HPC is functionally coupled with prefrontal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that when task goals change, object representations in HPC can be organized in new ways, resulting in updated concepts that highlight the features most critical to the new goal.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA cosmopolitan couple looking for a home may focus on trendy features. But, with news of a baby on the way, they must quickly learn which features make for a child-friendly home to conceptually reorganize their set of potential homes. Here, we investigate how conceptual knowledge is updated in the brain when goals change and attention shifts to new information. By combining fMRI with computational modeling, we find that object representations in the human hippocampus are dynamically updated with concept-relevant information during learning. We also demonstrate that when concept updating is most consequential, the hippocampus is functionally coupled with neocortex. Our findings suggest that the brain reorganizes when concepts change and provide support for a neurocomputational theory of concept formation.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of Big Data technologies can potentially boost the scalability of data-driven biology and health workflows by orders of magnitude. Consider, for instance, that technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem have been successfully used in data-driven industry to scale their processes to levels much larger than any biological- or health-driven work attempted thus far. In this work we demonstrate the scalability of a sequence alignment pipeline based on technologies from the Hadoop ecosystem - namely, Apache Flink and Hadoop MapReduce, both running on the distributed Apache YARN platform. Unlike previous work, our pipeline starts processing directly from the raw BCL data produced by Illumina sequencers. A Flink-based distributed algorithm reconstructs reads from the Illumina BCL data, and then demultiplexes them - analogously to the bcl2fastq2 program provided by Illumina. Subsequently, the BWA-MEM-based distributed aligner from the Seal project is used to perform read mapping on the YARN platform. While the standard programs by Illumina and BWA-MEM are limited to shared-memory parallelism (multi-threading), our solution is completely distributed and can scale across a large number of computing nodes. Results show excellent pipeline scalability, linear in the number of nodes. In addition, this approach automatically benefits from the robustness to hardware failure and transient cluster problems provided by the YARN pipeline, as well as the scalability of the Hadoop Distributed File System. Moreover, this YARN-based approach complements the up-and-coming version 4 of the GATK toolkit, which is based on Spark and therefore can run on YARN. Together, they can be used to form a scalable complete YARN-based variant calling pipeline for Illumina data, which will be further improved with the arrival of distributed in-memory filesystem technology such as Apache Arrow, thus removing the need to write intermediate data to disk.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate segmentation is characterized by the periodic formation of epithelial somites from the mesenchymal presomitic mesoderm (PSM). How the rhythmic signaling pulse delivered by the Segmentation Clock is translated into the periodic morphogenesis of somites remains poorly understood. Here, we focused on the role of Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC/Pcdh8) in this process. We show that in chicken and mouse embryos, PAPC expression is tightly regulated by the Clock and Wavefront system in the posterior PSM. We observed that PAPC exhibits a striking complementary pattern to N-Cadherin (CDH2), marking the interface of the future somite boundary in the anterior PSM. Gain and loss of function of PAPC in chicken embryos disrupt somite segmentation by altering the CDH2-dependent epithelialization of PSM cells. Our data suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is increased in PAPC expressing cells, subsequently affecting CDH2 internalization in the anterior compartment of the future somite. This in turn generates a differential adhesion interface, allowing formation of the acellular fissure that defines the somite boundary. Thus periodic expression of PAPC downstream of the Segmentation Clock triggers rhythmic endocytosis of CDH2, allowing for segmental de-adhesion and individualization of somites.",

    "abstract": "The success of fMRI places constraints on the nature of the neural code. The fact that researchers can infer similarities between neural representations, despite limitations in what fMRI measures, implies that certain neural coding schemes are more likely than others. For fMRI to be successful given its low temporal and spatial resolution, the neural code must be smooth at the sub-voxel and functional level such that similar stimuli engender similar internal representations. Through proof and simulation, we evaluate a number of reasonable coding schemes and demonstrate that only a subset are plausible given both fMRIs successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity. Deep neural network approaches, which have been forwarded as computational accounts of the ventral stream, are consistent with the success of fMRI, though functional smoothness breaks down in the later network layers. These results have implications for the nature of neural code and ventral stream, as well as what can be successfully investigated with fMRI.",

    "abstract": "The application of insect and arthropod information to medicolegal death investigations is one of the more exacting applications of entomology. Historically limited to homicide investigations, the integration of full time forensic entomology services to the medical examiners office in Harris County has opened up the opportunity to apply entomology to a wide variety of manner of death classifications and types of scenes to make observations on a number of different geographical and species-level trends in Harris County, Texas, USA. In this study, a retrospective analysis was made of 203 forensic entomology cases analyzed during the course of medicolegal death investigations performed by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston, TX, USA from January 2013 through April 2016. These cases included all manner of death classifications, stages of decomposition and a variety of different scene types that were classified into decedents transported from the hospital (typically associated with myiasis or sting allergy; 3.0%), outdoor scenes (32.0%) or indoor scenes (65.0%). Ambient scene air temperature at the time scene investigation was the only significantly different factor observed between indoor and outdoor scenes with average indoor scene temperature being slightly cooler (25.2{degrees}C) than that observed outdoors (28.0{degrees}C). Relative humidity was not found to be significantly different between scene types. Most of the indoor scenes were classified as natural (43.3%) whereas most of the outdoor scenes were classified as homicides (12.3%). All other manner of death classifications came from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Several species were found to be significantly associated with indoor scenes as indicated by a binomial test, including Blaesoxipha plinthopyga (Sarcophagidae), all Sarcophagidae including B. plinthopyga, Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae), Synthesiomyia nudiseta (Muscidae) and Lucilia cuprina (Calliphoridae). The only species that was a significant indicator of an outdoor scene was Lucilia eximia (Calliphoridae). All other insect species that were collected in five or more cases were collected from both indoor and outdoor scenes. A species list with month of collection and basic scene characteristics with the length of the estimated time of colonization is also presented. The data presented here provide valuable casework related species data for Harris County, TX and nearby areas on the Gulf Coast that can be used to compare to other climate regions with other species assemblages and to assist in identifying new species introductions to the area. This study also highlights the importance of potential sources of uncertainty in preparation and interpretation of forensic entomology reports from different scene types.",

    "abstract": "Loggerhead turtle is an endangered sea turtle species with a migratory lifestyle and worldwide distribution, experiencing markedly different habitats throughout its lifetime. Environmental conditions, especially food availability and temperature, constrain the acquisition and the use of available energy, thus affecting physiological processes such as growth, maturation, and reproduction. These physiological processes at the population level determine survival, fecundity, and ultimately the population growth rate--a key indicator of the success of conservation efforts. As a first step towards the comprehensive understanding of how environment shapes the physiology and the life cycle of a loggerhead turtle, we constructed a full life cycle model based on the principles of energy acquisition and utilization embedded in the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. We adapted the standard DEB model using data from published and unpublished sources to obtain parameter estimates and model predictions that could be compared with data. The outcome was a successful mathematical description of ontogeny and life history traits of the loggerhead turtle. Some deviations between the model and the data existed (such as an earlier age at sexual maturity and faster growth of the post-hatchlings), yet probable causes for these deviations were found informative and discussed in great detail. Physiological traits such as the capacity to withstand starvation, trade-offs between reproduction and growth, and changes in the energy budget throughout the ontogeny were inferred from the model. The results offer new insights into physiology and ecology of loggerhead turtle with the potential to lead to novel approaches in conservation of this endangered species.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of genome-wide association studies are performed in Europeans, and their transferability to other populations is dependent on many factors (e.g. linkage disequilibrium, allele frequencies, genetic architecture). As medical genomics studies become increasingly large and diverse, gaining insights into population history and consequently the transferability of disease risk measurement is critical. Here, we disentangle recent population history in the widely-used 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, with an emphasis on populations underrepresented in medical studies. To examine the transferability of single-ancestry GWAS, we used published summary statistics to calculate polygenic risk scores for six well-studied traits and diseases. We identified directional inconsistencies in all scores; for example, height is predicted to decrease with genetic distance from Europeans, despite robust anthropological evidence that West Africans are as tall as Europeans on average. To gain deeper quantitative insights into GWAS transferability, we developed a complex trait coalescent-based simulation framework considering effects of polygenicity, causal allele frequency divergence, and heritability. As expected, correlations between true and inferred risk were typically highest in the population from which summary statistics were derived. We demonstrated that scores inferred from European GWAS were biased by genetic drift in other populations even when choosing the same causal variants, and that biases in any direction were possible and unpredictable. This work cautions that summarizing findings from large-scale GWAS may have limited portability to other populations using standard approaches, and highlights the need for generalized risk prediction methods and the inclusion of more diverse individuals in medical genomics.",

    "abstract": "Although microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature, relatively little is known about the structural and functional roles of their constituent organisms underlying interactions. A common approach to study such questions begins with extracting a network of statistically significant pairwise co-occurrences from a matrix of observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances across sites. The structure of this network is assumed to encode information about ecological interactions and processes, resistance to perturbation, and the identity of keystone species. However, common methods for identifying these pairwise interactions can contaminate the network with spurious patterns that obscure true ecological signals. Here, we describe this problem in detail and develop a solution that incorporates null models to distinguish ecological signals from statistical noise. We apply these methods to the initial OTU abundance matrix and to the extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to a large soil microbiome data set and show that many previously reported patterns for these data are statistical artifacts. In contrast, we find the frequency of three-way interactions among microbial OTUs to be highly statistically significant. These results demonstrate the importance of using appropriate null models when studying observational microbiome data, and suggest that extracting and characterizing three-way interactions among OTUs is a promising direction for unraveling the structure and function of microbial ecosystems.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMicrobes are ubiquitous in the environment. We know that microbial communities - the groups of microbes that live together, interact, and depend on one another - vary across environments. Multiple processes, ranging from competition between microbes to environmental stress, are believed to alter microbial community composition. Here, we describe a set of statistical techniques that can more accurately identify the underlying taxa relationships that structure the observed abundances of microbes across habitats. Using a large data set of soil samples collected across North and South America, we both illustrate the statistical artifacts that incorrect methods can introduce and describe proper techniques based on appropriate null models for studying how the abundances of taxa vary across soil samples. These tools improve our ability to distinguish ecologically meaningful interactions from simple statistical noise in such observational data. Our application of these tools suggests some previous claims about the network structure of microbial communities may be statistical artifacts. Furthermore, we find that three-way interactions among microbial taxa are significantly more common than we would expect at random, and thus may provide a novel means for identifying ecologically meaningful interactions.",

    "abstract": "Genetic risk for common autoimmune diseases is influenced by hundreds of small effect, mostly non-coding variants, enriched in regulatory regions active in adaptive-immune cell types. DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) are a genomic mark for regulatory DNA. Here, we generated a single DHSs annotation from fifteen deeply sequenced DNase-seq experiments in adaptive-immune as well as non-immune cell types. Using this annotation we quantified accessibility across cell types in a matrix format amenable to statistical analysis, deduced the subset of DHSs unique to adaptive-immune cell types, and grouped DHSs by cell-type accessibility profiles. Measuring enrichment with cell-type-specific TF binding sites as well as proximal gene expression and function, we show that accessibility profiles grouped DHSs into coherent regulatory functions. Using the adaptive-immune-specific DHSs as input (0.37% of genome), we associated DHSs to six autoimmune diseases with GWAS data. Associated loci showed higher replication rates when compared to loci identified by GWAS or by considering all DHSs, allowing the additional discovery of 327 loci (FDR<0.005) below typical GWAS significance threshold, 52 of which are novel and replicating discoveries. Finally, we integrated DHS associations from six autoimmune diseases, using a network model (bird-eye view) and a regulatory Manhattan plot schema (per locus). Taken together, we described and validated a strategy to leverage finely resolved regulatory priors, enhancing the discovery, interpretability, and resolution of genetic associations, and providing actionable insights for follow up work.",
