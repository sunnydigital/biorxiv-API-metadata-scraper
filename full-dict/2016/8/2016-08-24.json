    "abstract": "We have asked how the common S34F mutation in the splicing factor U2AF1 regulates alternative splicing in lung cancer, and why wild-type U2AF1 is retained in cancers with this mutation. A human lung epithelial cell line was genetically modified so that U2AF1S34F is expressed from one of the two endogenous U2AF1 loci. By altering levels of mutant or wild-type U2AF1 in this cell line and by analyzing published data on human lung adenocarcinomas, we show that S34F-associated changes in alternative splicing are proportional to the ratio of S34F:wild-type gene products and not to absolute levels of either the mutant or wild-type factor. Preferential recognition of specific 3' splice sites in S34F-expressing cells is largely explained by differential in vitro RNA-binding affinities of mutant versus wild-type U2AF1 for those same 3' splice sites. Finally, we show that lung adenocarcinoma cell lines bearing U2AF1 mutations do not require the mutant protein for growth in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, wild-type U2AF1 is required for survival, regardless of whether cells carry the U2AF1S34F allele. Our results provide mechanistic explanations of the magnitude of splicing changes observed in U2AF1-mutant cells and why tumors harboring U2AF1 mutations always retain an expressed copy of the wild-type allele.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLarge-scale genomics studies have identified recurrent mutations in many genes that fall outside the conventional domain of proto-oncogenes. They include genes encoding factors that mediate RNA splicing; mutations affecting four of these genes are present in up to half of proliferative myeloid disorders and in a significant number of solid tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma. Here we have characterized several properties of a common mutant version of the U2AF1 splicing factor, a component of the U2 auxiliary factor complex, in lung cells. We have found that mutant-associated changes in splice site selection are primarily influenced by the ratio of mutant and wild-type U2AF1 gene products; thus increasing wild-type U2AF1 levels represses the mutant-induced splicing program. We show that the altered splice site preferences of mutant U2AF1 can be attributed to changes in its binding to relevant 3' splice sites. We also show that mutant U2AF1 is different from some oncogenes: the growth properties of lung cancer cell lines carrying the mutant allele are unaffected by loss of the mutant gene, while the wild-type allele is absolutely required for survival. These results advance our understanding of the molecular determinants of the mutant-associated splicing program, and they highlight previously unappreciated roles of wild-type U2AF1 in the presence of the recurrent U2AF1S34F mutation.",

    "abstract": "Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition. Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental, behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex, per se, from other factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first summarize the evolution, development and maintenance of ARTS. We then review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS, dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS. Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but it is perhaps time that they take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as \"immunocompetence\" and \"androgens\" might useful to develop a rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated. Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving deeper into physiology, seemingly at the cost of ignoring their organisms evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being increasingly recognized, including in species with ARTS, but we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.",

To test if low frequency subthreshold oscillations could reduce neuronal gain during wakefulness, we measured the membrane potential of primary visual cortex (V1) layer 2/3 excitatory, parvalbumin-positive (PV+), and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and sensory discrimination tasks. We found prominent 3-5 Hz membrane potential oscillations that reduced the gain of excitatory neurons but not the gain of PV+ and SOM+ interneurons, which oscillated synchronously with excitatory neurons and fired strongly at the peak of de polarizations. 3-5 Hz oscillation prevalence and timing were strongly modulated by visual input and the animals behavior al response, suggesting that these oscillations are triggered to adjust sensory responses for specific behavioral contexts. Therefore, these findings reveal a novel gain reduction mechanism that adapts sensory processing to behavior.",

    "abstract": "In this work we implement approximate Bayesian computational methods to improve the design of a wound-healing assay used to quantify cell-cell interactions. This is important as cell-cell interactions, such as adhesion and repulsion, have been shown to play an important role in cell migration. Initially, we demonstrate with a model of an ideal experiment that we are able to identify model parameters for agent motility and adhesion, given we choose appropriate summary statistics. Following this, we replace our model of an ideal experiment with a model representative of a practically realisable experiment. We demonstrate that, given the current (and commonly used) experimental set-up, model parameters cannot be accurately identified using approximate Bayesian computation methods. We compare new experimental designs through simulation, and show more accurate identification of model parameters is possible by expanding the size of the domain upon which the experiment is performed, as opposed to increasing the number of experimental repeats. The results presented in this work therefore describe time and cost-saving alterations for a commonly performed experiment for identifying cell motility parameters. Moreover, the results presented in this work will be of interest to those concerned with performing experiments that allow for the accurate identification of parameters governing cell migratory processes, especially cell migratory processes in which cell-cell adhesion or repulsion are known to play a significant role.",

    "abstract": "Persistence is a transient and non-inheritable tolerance to antibiotics by a small fraction of a bacterial population. One of the proposed determinants of bacterial persistence is Toxin-Antitoxin systems (TAS) which are also implicated in a wide range of stress-related phenomena. In a report (Maisonneuve E, Castro-Camargo M, Gerdes K. 2013. Cell 154:1140-1150) an interesting link between ppGpp mediated stringent response, TAS and persistence was proposed. It is proposed that accumulation of ppGpp enhances the accumulation of inorganic polyphosphate which modulates Lon protease to degrade antitoxins. The decrease in the concentration of antitoxins supposedly activated the toxin to increase in the number of persisters during antibiotic treatment. In this study, we show that inorganic polyphosphate is not required for Lon-dependent degradation of YefM, the antitoxin of YefM/YoeB TAS. The {Delta}10 strain, an Escherichia coli MG1655 derivative in which the ten TAS are deleted, is more sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Ampicillin compared to wild-type MG1655. Furthermore, we show that the {Delta}10 strain has relatively lower fitness compared to the wild type and hence, we argue that the implications based on this strain are void. We conclude that there is no direct and specific link between stringent response and the regulation of TAS. The link between TAS and persistence is inconclusive due to altered fitness of {Delta}10 strain and hence requires thorough inspection and debate.\\n\\nImportanceA model connecting stringent response, endoribonuclease encoding Type II Toxin-Antitoxin systems (TAS) and persistence is widely propagated. It states that \\\"accumulation of ppGpp results in accumulation of inorganic polyphosphate which modulates Lon protease to degrade antitoxin rendering toxins free to induce persistence\\\". This work presents a contradiction to and challenges the model. Experimental evidence, literature survey as well as rationale are provided to show that inorganic polyphosphate is not required for the degradation of YefM, the antitoxin in YefM/YoeB TAS. The {Delta}10 strain is relatively more sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Ampicillin as well as has lowered fitness. This is likely because of the polar effects on the adjacent genes caused by the genetic manipulation of multiple TAS loci.",

    "abstract": "Structural analysis of chromosome folding in vivo has been revolutionized by Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and related methods, which use proximity ligation to identify chromosomal loci in physical contact. We recently described a variant 3C technique, Micro-C, in which chromatin is fragmented to mononucleosomes using micrococcal nuclease, enabling nucleosome-resolution folding maps of the genome. Here, we describe an improved Micro-C protocol using long crosslinkers, termed Micro-C XL, which exhibits greatly increased signal to noise, and provides further insight into the folding of the yeast genome. We also find that signal to noise is much improved in Micro-C XL libraries generated from relatively insoluble chromatin as opposed to soluble material, providing a simple method to physically enrich for bona-fide long-range interactions. Micro-C XL maps of the budding and fission yeast genomes reveal both short-range chromosome fiber features such as chromosomally-interacting domains (CIDs), as well as higher-order features such as clustering of centromeres and telomeres, thereby addressing the primary discrepancy between prior Micro-C data and reported 3C and Hi-C analyses. Interestingly, comparison of chromosome folding maps of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe revealed widespread qualitative similarities, yet quantitative differences, between these distantly-related species. Micro-C XL thus provides a single assay suitable for interrogation of chromosome folding at length scales from the nucleosome to the full genome.",

    "abstract": "Significance statementSome 25 years ago it was discovered that the activity of the ER chaperone BiP is regulated by covalent modification, the nature of which, AMPylation (not ADPribosylation, as had long been thought) and the enzyme responsible, FICD, have only recently been identified. Genetic inactivation of FICD and in vitro studies of the purified enzyme and substrate have done much to clarify the biochemical consequences of the modification and its underlying logic: As ER stress wanes, FICD uses ATP to AMPylate Thr518 of BiP locking BiP in a relatively inactive conformation. As ER stress levels re-mount the cells draw on this pool of inactive chaperone, which is de-AMPylated and restored to its fully active state.\\n\\nHere we report on the identity of the de-AMPylating enzyme - and with it on the surprising finding that both AMPylation and de-AMPylation of BiP are carried out by the same polypeptide (FICD) using the same active site, both in vivo and in vitro. Analysis of the reaction products reveals that de-AMPylation does not involve trivial concentration-dependent micro-reversibility of an enzymatic reaction, but rather a switch in the active site of FICD that facilitates two antagonistic thermodynamically favored reactions.\\n\\nSurprisingly BiP de-AMPylation (not AMPylation) is the default activity of FICD. The side-chain of a single regulatory residue, E234, toggles the enzyme between de-AMPylation and AMPylation in vitro. Our studies thereby uncover an active mechanism that must exist in the ER for coupling waning levels of unfolded protein stress to the conversion of FICD from its default de-AMPylation mode to BiP AMPylation. Whilst the details of this active switch remain to be discovered, we are able to suggest a plausible mechanism by which it may come about.\\n\\nIdentification of the enzyme that de-modifies BiP to reactivate it will be of interest to cell biologists, whereas the novel features of FICD as a dualfunctioning enzyme with a single bi-functional active site will be of broad interest to enzymologists and molecular biologists.\\n\\nAbstractProtein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is defended by an unfolded protein response (UPR) that matches ER chaperone capacity to the burden of unfolded proteins. As levels of unfolded proteins decline, a metazoanspecific FIC-domain containing ER-localized enzyme, FICD/HYPE, rapidly inactivates the major ER chaperone BiP by AMPylating T518. Here it is shown that the single catalytic domain of FICD can also release the attached AMP, restoring functionality to BiP. Consistent with a role for endogenous FICD in de-AMPylating BiP, FICD-/- cells are hypersensitive to introduction of a constitutively AMPylating, de-AMPylation defective mutant FICD. These opposing activities hinge on a regulatory residue, E234, whose default state renders FICD a constitutive de-AMPylase in vitro. The location of E234 on a conserved regulatory helix and the mutually antagonistic activities of FICD in vivo, suggest a mechanism whereby fluctuating unfolded protein load actively switches FICD from a de-AMPylase to an AMPylase.",

    "abstract": "Free heme is an endogenous danger signal to provoke innate immunity. Active innate immunity is a precondition of an effective adaptive immune response. However, heme catabolites, CO, biliverdin and bilirubin trigger immunosuppression. Furthermore, free heme induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 to reinforce the production of CO, biliverdin and bilirubin. As such, free heme can drive two antagonistic mechanisms to affect adaptive immunity. What is the outcome of animal immune response to an antigen in the presence of free heme? The question remains to be explored. Here we report the immunization results by intraperitoneal injection of the formulations containing BSA and heme. When the used heme concentrations were about less than 1 {micro}M, the production of anti-BSA IgG and IgM was unaffected; when the used heme concentrations were about more than 1 {micro}M but less than 5 {micro}M, the production of anti-BSA IgG and IgM was enhanced; when the used heme concentrations were about more than 5 {micro}M, the production of anti-BSA IgG and IgM was suppressed. The results demonstrate that heme can modulate adaptive immunity (at least humoral immunity) by the mode of double concentration-thresholds. If heme concentrations are below the first threshold, there is no effect on adaptive immunity; if between the first and second thresholds, there is promotive effect; if over the second threshold, there is inhibitive effect. A hypothesis is also presented here to explain the mode.",

Tracking behavioral patterns of individuals in groups is an active research field, however, reliable software tools for long-term or real-time tracking are still scarce.

Featuring a convenient MO_SCPLOWATLABC_SCPLOW-based interface and a fast multi-threading C++ core, we achieved an > 30x speed-up over a popular existing tracking method without loss in accuracy. Moreover, since memory usage is low, many hours of high-resolution video files can be tracked in reasonable time, making long-term observation of behavior possible. In a number of exemplary experiments on zebra fish, we show the feasibility of long-term observations and how to use the software to perform closed-loop experiments, where the tracked position of individuals is fed-back in real-time to a stimulus presentation screen installed below the fish-tank. Visual stimulation capabilities is incorporated into xyTracker and can be based on any behavioral features of all members of the group, such as, collective location, speed, or direction of movement, making interesting closed-loop experiments for investigating group behavior in a virtual reality setting possible.",

However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either PacBio or Oxford Nanopore technologies, and achieves a contig NG50 of greater than 21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio datasets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.",

Previously, as facilitated with our discovery in 2005 that \\\"completely insoluble\\\" proteins could be all solubilized in unsalted water [Song (2009) FEBS Lett. 583: 953], we found that the TDP-43 prion-like domain in fact contains an intrinsic membrane-interacting subdomain [Lim et al. [2016] PLoS Biol. 14, e1002338]. We decrypted that ALS-causing mutations/cofactor-depletion act to render the wellstructured folds of cytosolic VAPB-MSP domain and SOD1 into highly disordered states, thus becoming buffer-insoluble. Most surprisingly, this also unlocks the amphiphilic/hydrophobic regions universally exiting in proteins, which thus acquire a novel capacity in abnormally interacting with membranes [Qin et al. (2013) F1000Res 2-221.v2; Lim (2016) BBA-Biomembranes. 1858: 2223]. Here we aimed extend our discovery to address two fundamental questions: 1) why many E. coli proteins become aggregated in aging; and 2) whether aggregation-prone proteins can also acquire a novel capacity in interacting with membranes; by dissecting the 557-residue S1 ribosomal protein into 7 fragments to disrupt its 6 S1 folds, followed by extensive CD and NMR characterizations. The results reveal that we have successfully eliminated all 6 S1 folds and fragment 4 becomes highly disordered and thus buffer-insoluble. Most strikingly, F4 does acquire a capacity in transforming into a helical conformation in membrane environments. Here, for the first time, our study deciphers that like ALScausing mutants, the disruption of a well-folded E. coli cytosolic protein also unlocks its amphiphilic/hydrophobic regions which are capable of abnormally interacting with membranes. Therefore, proteins, the most important functional players for all forms of life, can transform into membrane-toxic forms triggering diseases and aging, if their hydrophobic/amphiphilic regions are unlocked by genetic, pathological or/and environmental factors, which is characteristic of severe aggregation.",

Here we report the occurrence of protein-encoding RNA to RNA information transfer in mammalian cells. We describe below the detection, by next generation sequencing (NGS), of a chimeric doublestranded/pinhead intermediate containing both sense and antisense globin RNA strands covalently joined in a predicted and uniquely defined manner, whose cleavage at the pinhead would result in the generation of an endproduct containing the intact coding region of the original mRNA. We also describe the identification of the putative end product of RNA-dependent globin mRNA amplification. It is heavily modified, uniformly truncated at both untranslated regions (UTRs), terminates with the OH group at the 5 end, consistent with a cleavagegenerated 5 terminus, and its massive cellular amount is unprecedented for a conventional mRNA transcription product. It also translates in a cell-free system into polypeptides indistinguishable from the translation product of conventional globin mRNA. The physiological significance of the mammalian mRNA amplification, which might operate during terminal differentiation and in the production of highly abundant rapidly generated proteins such as some collagens or other components of extracellular matrix, with every genome-originated mRNA molecule acting as a potential template, as well as possible implications, including physiologically occurring intracellular PCR process, iPCR, are discussed in the paper.",

    "abstract": "The haplotypes of a beneficial allele carry information about its history that can shed light on its age and putative cause for its increase in frequency. Specifically, the signature of an alleles age is contained in the pattern of local ancestry that mutation and recombination impose on its haplotypic background. We provide a method to exploit this pattern and infer the time to the common ancestor of a positively selected allele following a rapid increase in frequency. We do so using a hidden Markov model which leverages the length distribution of the shared ancestral haplotype, the accumulation of derived mutations on the ancestral background, and the surrounding background haplotype diversity. Using simulations, we demonstrate how the inclusion of information from both mutation and recombination events increases accuracy relative to approaches that only consider a single type of event. We also show the behavior of the estimator in cases where data do not conform to model assumptions, and provide some diagnostics for assessing and improving inference. Using the method, we analyze population-specific patterns in the 1000 Genomes Project data to provide a global perspective on the timing of adaptation for several variants which show evidence of recent selection and functional relevance to diet, skin pigmentation, and morphology in humans.",

In up to 40% of sexual infections there is clear evidence for multiple founding variants, which can influence the efficacy of putative prevention methods and the reconstruction of epidemiologic histories. To measure the diversity of the founding population and to compute the probability of alternative transmission scenarios, while explicitly taking phylogenetic uncertainty into account, we created an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method based on a set of statistics measuring phylogenetic topology, branch lengths, and genetic diversity. We applied our method to a heterosexual transmission pair showing a complex paraphyletic-polyphyletic donor-recipient phylogenetic topology. We found evidence identifying the donor that was consistent with the known facts of the case (Bayes factor >20). We also found that while the evidence for ongoing transmission between the pair was as good or better than the singular transmission event model, it was only viable when the rate of ongoing transmission was implausibly high (~1/day). We concluded that the singular transmission model, which was able to estimate the diversity of the founding population (mean 7% substitutions/site), was more biologically plausible. Our study provides a formal inference framework to investigate HIV-1 direction, diversity, and frequency of transmission. The ability to measure the diversity of founding populations in both simple and complex transmission situations is essential to understanding the relationship between the phylogeny and epidemiology of HIV-1 as well as in efforts developing new prevention technologies.",

    "abstract": "Proteins that are components of the secretory machinery form a cellular pathway of paramount importance for physiological regulation, development and function of human tissues. Consistently, most secretory pathway components are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. At the same time, recent studies identified that the largest fraction of tissue-specific proteins consists of secreted and membrane proteins and not intracellular proteins. This suggests that the secretory pathway is distinctively regulated in a tissue-specific fashion. However, a systematic analysis on how the protein secretory pathway is tuned in different tissues is lacking, and it is even largely unexplored if the secretome and membrane proteome differs in, for example, posttranslation modifications across tissues. Here, analyzing publically available transcriptome data across 30 human tissues, we discovered the expression level of key components previously categorized as housekeeping proteins were specifically over-expressed in a certain tissue compared with the average expression of their corresponding secretory pathway subsystem (e.g. protein folding). These extreme genes define an exceptional fine-tuning in specific subnetworks, which neatly differentiated for example the pancreas and liver from 30 other tissues. Moreover, the subnetwork expression tuning correlated with the nature and number of post translational modification sites in the pancreas or liver-specific secretome and membrane proteome. These patterns were recurrently observed also in other tissues, like the blood, the brain and the skeletal muscle. These findings conciliate both the housekeeping and tissue-specific nature of the protein secretory pathway, which we attribute to a fine-tuned regulation of defined subnetworks in order to support the diversity of secreted proteins and their modifications.",

    "abstract": "Representational models specify how activity patterns in populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity with any readout mechanism capable of a linear transform. Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches - when conducted appropriately - can perform similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly construed as complementary components of a single data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.\\n\\nAuthor Summary\\n\\nModern neuroscience can measure activity of many neurons or the local blood oxygenation of many brain locations simultaneously. As the number of simultaneous measurements grows, we can better investigate how the brain represents and transforms information, to enable perception, cognition, and behavior. Recent studies go beyond showing that a brain region is involved in some function. They use representational models that specify how different perceptions, cognitions, and actions are encoded in brain-activity patterns. In this paper, we provide a general mathematical framework for such representational models, which clarifies the relationships between three different methods that are currently used in the neuroscience community. All three methods evaluate the same core feature of the data, but each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Pattern component modelling (PCM) implements the most powerful test between models, and is analytically tractable and expandable. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) provides a highly useful summary statistic (the dissimilarity) and enables model comparison with weaker distributional assumptions. Finally, encoding models characterize individual responses and enable the study of their layout across cortex. We argue that these methods should be considered components of a larger toolkit for testing hypotheses about the way the brain represents information.",

Their disturbance (e.g. in human neonates at risk for autism), may compromise the proper development of a social brain. The genetic bases of such predispositions are unknown. Here we take advantage of well-known visual preferences exhibited by newly-hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus) for the head/neck region of their mother hen, to investigate the presence of segregating variation in the predispositions to approach a stuffed hen vs. a scrambled version of it. We compared the spontaneous preferences of three different breeds that have been maintained genetically isolated for at least eighteen years and identically raised in the same farm. Visually-naive chicks of all the three tested breeds (Padovana, Polverara and Robusta maculata) showed the same initial preference for the predisposed stimulus, suggesting that the direction of the initial preference might be genetically fixed. A few minutes later though, striking differences emerged between breeds, which could indicate early different strategies of dealing with affiliative objects: while the Polverara breed maintained a constant preference across the entire test, the Padovana and Robusta breeds progressively explored the alternative stimulus more. We argue that exploration of novelty might help chicks to look for responsive parental objects and to form a more structured representation of the mother hen. We hence documented the presence of inherited genetic variability for early social predisposition in interaction with environmental stimuli.",

To date, most work has focused on cataloging taxa present in samples and determining whether the distribution of taxa shifts with exogenous covariates. However, important questions regarding how taxa interact with each other and their environment remain open, thus preventing in-depth ecological understanding of microbiomes. Time-series data from 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing are becoming more common within microbial ecology, but given the  big data nature of these studies, there are currently no methods capable of utilizing the breadth of the data to infer ecological interactions from these longitudinal data. We address this gap by presenting a method of analysis using Poisson regression fit with an elastic-net penalty that 1) takes advantage of the fact that the data are time series; 2) constrains estimates to allow for the possibility of many more interactions than data; and 3) is scalable enough to handle data consisting of thousands of taxa. We test the method on gut microbiome data from white-throated woodrats (Neotoma albigula) that were fed varying amounts of the plant secondary compound oxalate over a period of 22 days to estimate interactions between OTUs and their environment.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical modelling provides a useful framework within which to investigate the organization of biological tissues. With advances in experimental biology leading to increasingly detailed descriptions of cellular behaviour, models that consider cells as individual objects are becoming a common tool to study how processes at the single-cell level affect collective dynamics and determine tissue size, shape and function. However, there often remains no comprehensive account of these models, their method of solution, computational implementation or analysis of parameter scaling, hindering our ability to utilise and accurately compare different models. Here we present an effcient, open-source implementation of the immersed boundary method (IBM), tailored to simulate the dynamics of cell populations. This approach considers the dynamics of elastic membranes, representing cell boundaries, immersed in a viscous Newtonian fluid. The IBM enables complex and emergent cell shape dynamics, spatially heterogeneous cell properties and precise control of growth mechanisms. We solve the model numerically using an established algorithm, based on the fast Fourier transform, providing full details of all technical aspects of our implementation. The implementation is undertaken within Chaste, an open-source C++ library that allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions. Our implementation scales linearly with time step, and subquadratically with mesh spacing and immersed boundary node spacing. We identify the relationship between the immersed boundary node spacing and fluid mesh spacing required to ensure fluid volume conservation within immersed boundaries, and the scaling of cell membrane stiffness and cell-cell interaction strength required when refining the immersed boundary discretization. This study provides a recipe allowing consistent parametrisation of IBM models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae and close relatives are a growing cause of healthcare-associated infections for which increasing rates of multi-drug resistance are a major concern. The Klebsiella polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence determinant and epidemiological marker. However, little is known about capsule epidemiology since serological typing is not widely accessible, and many isolates are serologically non-typeable. Molecular methods for capsular typing are needed, but existing methods lack sensitivity and specificity and fail to take advantage of the information available in whole-genome sequence data, which is increasingly being generated for surveillance and investigation of Klebsiella.\\n\\nMethodsWe investigated the diversity of capsule synthesis loci (K loci) among a large, diverse collection of 2503 genome sequences of K. pneumoniae and closely related species. We incorporated analyses of both full-length K locus DNA sequences and clustered protein coding sequences to identify, annotate and compare K locus structures, and we propose a novel method for identifying K loci based on full locus information extracted from whole genome sequences.\\n\\nResultsA total of 134 distinct K loci were identified, including 31 novel types. Comparative analysis of K locus gene content detected 508 unique protein coding gene clusters that appear to reassort via homologous recombination, generating novel K locus types. Extensive nucleotide diversity was detected among the wzi and wzc genes, both within and between K loci, indicating that current typing schemes based on these genes are inadequate. As a solution, we introduce Kaptive, a novel software tool that automates the process of identifying K loci from large sets of Klebsiella genomes based on full locus information.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work highlights the extensive diversity of Klebsiella K loci and the proteins that they encode. We propose a standardised K locus nomenclature for Klebsiella, present a curated reference database of all known K loci, and introduce a tool for identifying K loci from genome data (https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive). These developments constitute important new resources for the Klebsiella community for use in genomic surveillance and epidemiology.",
