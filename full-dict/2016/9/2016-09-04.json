    "abstract": "Genetic modification of cell lines and primary cells is an expensive and cumbersome approach, often involving the use of viral vectors. Electroporation using square wave generating devices, like Lonza{acute}s Nucleofector, is a widely used option, but the costs associated with the acquisition of electroporation kits and the transient transgene expression might hamper the utility of this methodology. In the present work we show that our in house developed buffers, termed Chicabuffers, can be efficiently used to electroporate cell lines and primary cells from murine and human origin. Using the Nucleofector II device, we electroporated 14 different cell lines and also primary cells, like mesenchymal stem cells and cord blood CD34+, providing optimized protocols for each of them. Moreover, when combined with Sleeping Beauty based transposon system, long-term transgene expression could be achieved in all types of cells tested. Transgene expression was stable and did not interfere with CD34+ differentiation to committed progenitors. We also show that these buffers can be used in CRISPR-mediated editing of PDCD1 gene locus in 293T and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The optimized protocols reported in this study provide a suitable and cost-effective platform for the genetic modification of cells, facilitating the widespread adoption of this technology.",

    "abstract": "We consider the computational problem of phasing an individual genotype sample given a collection of known haplotypes in the population. We give a fast and accurate algorithm GPhase for reconstructing haplotype pair consistent with input genotype. It uses the coalescent based mutation model of Stephens and Donnelly (2000). Computing optimal solution under this model is expensive and our algorithm uses a greedy approximation for fast and accurate estimation. Our algorithm is simple, efficient and has linear time and space complexity. Experiments on real datasets revealed improved gene level phasing accuracy for GPhase tool compared to other widely used tools such as SHAPEIT, Beagle, MaCH and Impute2. On simulated data, GPhase tool was able to phase samples each containing more than 1700 markers with high accuracy. GPhase can be used for gene level phasing of individual samples using publicly available haplotype datasets such as HapMap data or 1000 genome data. This finds applications in studies on recessive Mendelian disorders where parent data is lacking. GPhase is freely available for download and use from https://github.com/kshitijtayal/GPhase/.",

    "abstract": "Two major models, namely direct and indirect models, have been proposed for the protein chemical denaturation but it remains challenging to experimentally demonstrate and distinguish between them. Here, by use of CD and NMR spectroscopy, we succeeded in differentiating the effects on a small but well-folded protein WW4, of GdmCl and NaSCN at diluted concentrations ([&ge;]200 mM). Both denaturants up to 200 mM have no alternation of its average structure but do reduce its thermodynamic stability to different degrees. Despite acting as the stronger denaturant, GdmCl only weakly interacts with amide protons, while NaSCN shows extensive interactions with both hydrophobic side chains and amide protons. Although both denaturants show no significant perturbation on overall ps-ns backbone dynamics of WW4, GdmCl suppresses while NaSCN enhances its s-ms backbone dynamics in a denaturant concentration dependent manner. Quantitative analysis reveals that although they dramatically raise exchange rates, GdmCl slightly increases while NaSCN reduces the population of the major conformational state. Our study represents the first report deciphering that GdmCl and NaSCN appear to destabilize a protein following two models respectively, which are characteristic of opposite s-ms dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The processes responsible for patterns of cytonuclear discordance remain unclear. Here, we employ an exon capture dataset, demographic methods, and species distribution modeling to elucidate the impact of historical demography on patterns of genealogical concordance and discordance in ground squirrel lineages from the Otospermophilus beecheyi species complex. Previous studies in O. beecheyi revealed three morphologically cryptic and highly divergent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages (named the Northern, Central, and Southern lineages based on geography) with only the Northern lineage exhibiting concordant divergence in nuclear markers. We show that these mtDNA lineages likely formed in allopatry during the Pleistocene, but responded differentially to climatic changes that occurred since the last interglacial ([~]120,000 years ago). We find that the Northern lineage maintained a stable range throughout this period, correlating with genetic distinctiveness among all genetic markers and low migration rates between the other lineages. In contrast, our results support a scenario where the Southern lineage expanded from Baja California Sur during the Late Pleistocene and hybridized with the Central lineage, eventually driving the Central lineage to extinction. While high intraspecific gene flow among newly colonized populations eroded significant signals of Central ancestry from autosomal markers, male sex-biased dispersal in this system preserved signals of this past hybridization and introgression event in matrilineal-biased X-chromosome and mtDNA markers. Our results highlight the importance of range stability in maintaining the persistence of phylogeographic lineages, whereas unstable range dynamics can increase the tendency for lineages to interact and collapse upon secondary contact.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe taxonomy of the genus Pinus is widely accepted and a well-resolved phylogeny based on entire plastome sequences exists. However, there is a large discrepancy in estimated divergence times of major pine clades among existing studies mainly due to differences in fossil placement and dating methods used. We currently lack a dated molecular pine phylogeny that makes full usage of the rich fossil record in pines. This study is the first to estimate the divergence dates of pines based on a large number of fossils (21) evenly distributed across all major clades in combination with applying the most novel dating method.\\n\\nResultsWe present a range of molecular phylogenetic trees of Pinus generated within a Bayesian framework using both the novel fossilized birth-death and the traditional node dating method with different fossil sets. We find the origin of pines likely to be up to 30 Myr older (Early Cretaceous) than inferred in most previous studies (Late Cretaceous) and propose generally older divergence times for major clades within Pinus than previously thought. Our age estimates vary significantly between the different dating approaches but the results generally agree on older divergence times. We present a revised list of 21 fossils that are suitable to use in dating or comparative analyses of pines.\\n\\nConclusionsAn accurate timescale for the divergence times in pines is essential if we are to link diversification processes and functional adaptation of this genus to geological events or to changing climates. Next to older divergence times in Pinus, our results indicate that node age estimates in pines depend on dating approaches and fossil sets used due to different inherent characteristics of dating approaches. Our set of dated phylogenetic trees of pines presented herein provide the basis to account for uncertainties in age estimations when applying comparative phylogenetic methods, which will improve our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological history in pines.",

    "abstract": "Until now, the potential of NGS has been seldom realised for the construction of barcode reference libraries. Using a two-step PCR approach and MiSeq sequencing, we tested a cost-effective method and developed a custom workflow to simultaneously sequence multiple markers (COI, Cytb and EF, altogether 2kb) from hundreds of specimens. Interestingly, primers and PCR conditions used for Sanger sequencing did not require optimisation to construct MiSeq library. After completion of quality controls, 87% of the species and 76% of the specimens had valid sequences for the three markers. Nine specimens (3%) exhibited two divergent (up to 10%) sequence clusters. In 95% of the species, MiSeq and Sanger sequences obtained from the same samplings were similar. For the remaining 5%, species were paraphyletic or the sequences clustered into two divergent groups (>7%) on the final trees (Sanger + MiSeq). These problematic cases are difficult to explain but may represent coding NUMTS or heteroplasms. These results highlight the importance of performing quality control steps, working with expert taxonomists and using more than one marker for DNA-taxonomy or species diversity assessment. The power and simplicity of this method appears promising to build on existing experience, tools and resources while taking advantage of NGS.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGene regulatory interactions are of fundamental importance to various biological functions and processes. However, only a few previous computational studies have claimed success in revealing genome-wide regulatory landscapes from temporal gene expression data, especially for complex eukaryotes like human. Moreover, recent work suggests that these methods still suffer from the curse of dimensionality if network size increases to 100 or higher.\\n\\nResultWe present a novel scalable algorithm for identifying genome-wide regulatory network structures. The highlight of our method is that its superior performance does not degenerate even for a network size on the order of 104, and is thus readily applicable to large-scale complex networks. Such a breakthrough is achieved by considering both prior biological knowledge and multiple topological properties (i.e., sparsity and hub gene structure) of complex networks in the regularized formulation. We also illustrate the application of our algorithm in practice using the time-course expression data from an influenza infection study in respiratory epithelial cells.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe algorithm described in this article is implemented in MATLAB(R).

    "abstract": "Decellularised human livers are considered the perfect ECM (extracellular matrix) surrogate because both 3-dimensional architecture and biological features of the hepatic microenvironment are thought to be preserved. However, donor human livers are in chronically short supply, both for transplantation or as decellularised scaffolds, and will become even scarcer as life expectancy increases. It is hence of interest to determine the structural and biochemical properties of human hepatic ECM to derive design criteria for engineering bio-mimetic scaffolds. The intention of this work was to obtain quantitative design specifications for fabricating scaffolds for hepatic tissue engineering using human livers as a template. To this end, hepatic samples from 5 human donors were decellularised using a protocol shown to reproducibly conserve matrix composition and micro-structure in porcine livers. The decellularisation outcome was evaluated through histological and quantitative image analyses to evaluate cell removal, protein and glycosaminoglycan content per unit area. Applying the same decellularisation protocol to human liver samples obtained from 5 different donors yielded 5 different outcomes. Only 1 liver out of 5 was completely decellularised, while the other 4 showed different levels of remaining cells. Moreover, protein and glycosaminoglycan content per unit area after decellularisation were also found to be donor-dependent. The donor-to-donor variability of human livers thus precludes their use as templates for engineering a generic 'one-size fits all' ECM-mimic hepatic scaffold.",

Inferring microbial community structure and dynamics directly from time-resolved metagenomics data is key to understanding the community ecology and predicting its temporal behavior. Many methods have been proposed to perform the inference. Yet, we point out that there are several pitfalls along the way, from uninformative temporal measurements to the compositional nature of the relative abundance data, focusing on highly abundant species by ignoring or grouping low-abundance species, and implicit assumptions in various regularization methods. These issues have to be seriously considered in ecological modeling of human gut microbiota.",

This is especially relevant and interesting for humans, where fine-scale population structure can both confound disease-mapping studies and reveal the history of migration and divergence that shaped our species diversity. Here we review notable recent advances in the detection, use, and understanding of population structure. Our work addresses multiple areas where substantial progress is being made: improved statistics and models for better capturing differentiation, admixture, and the spatial distribution of variation; computational speed-ups that allow methods to scale to modern data; and advances in haplotypic modeling that have wide ranging consequences for the analysis of population structure. We conclude by outlining four important open challenges: The limitations of discrete population models, uncertainty in individual origins, the incorporation of both fine-scale structure and ancient DNA in parametric models, and the development of efficient computational tools, particularly for haplotype-based methods.",

Their potential to invade populations and persist will depend on interactions with environmental conditions, particularly as larvae are often exposed to fluctuating and extreme temperatures in the field. We reared Ae. aegypti larvae infected with different types of Wolbachia (wMel, wAlbB and wMelPop) under diurnal cyclical temperatures. Rearing wMel and wMelPop-infected larvae at 26-37{degrees}C reduced the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation induced by Wolbachia. We also observed a sharp reduction in the density of Wolbachia in adults. Furthermore, exposure to 26-37{degrees}C over two generations eliminated both the wMel and wMelPop infections. In contrast, the wAlbB infection was maintained at a high density, exhibited complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with a high fidelity under this temperature cycle. These findings have implications for the success of Wolbachia interventions across different environments and highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing.",
