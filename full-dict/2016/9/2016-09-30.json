    "abstract": "The numerical model of one-loop circulation exploits viscous deformation as mechanism of ventricular filling. Mathematical advantage of viscous deforming is a possibility to present the ventricular filling as the function of two independent variables (stress and time); two-dimensional argument frames a table which permits to calculate end-diastolic ventricular volume due to information about measured venous pressure and duration of ventricular diastole. The equation was deduced which balances the system while varying of such parameters as arterial resistance, the value of normal rhythm and the volume flow rate. The model pays attention on the phenomenon of asymmetrical position of normal rhythm (the steady rhythm in conditions of rest) and explains why the operating range of brady-rhythms is much narrower than the operating range of tachy-rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, transient gene expression (TGE) is a rapid, minimal-investment alternative to single-copy integrations for testing of transgenic constructs. However, transient gene expression, as measured by flow cytometry with a fluorescent reporter, typically displays a broad, asymmetric distribution with a left-tail that is convolved with background signal. Common approaches for deriving a summary statistic for transiently expressed gene products impose a normal distribution on gated or ungated data. Summary statistics derived from these models are heavily biased by experimental conditions and instrument settings that are difficult to replicate and insufficient to accurately describe the underlying data. Here, we present a convolved gamma distribution as a superior model for TGE datasets. The 4-6 parameters of this model are sufficient to accurately describe the entire, ungated distribution of transiently transfected HEK cells expressing monomeric fluorescent proteins, that operates consistently across a range of transfection conditions and instrument settings. Based on these observations, a convolved gamma model of TGE distributions has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of genetic device characterization in mammalian cells.",

The catch allocation model allocates the catches in different hunting areas and seasons to the different summer aggregations, and the population models analyse the impact of these catches on the population dynamics of the eight narwhal aggregations.\\n\\nThe population models run from 1970, and the catch allocation model needs population trajectories from 1970 to the present in order to estimate the catches taken from the different summer aggregations during this period. In an initial run it uses linear transitions between the available abundance estimates; but more elaborate population trajectories are estimated by the fit of the population models to the abundance data. The two models are therefore run in an iterative manner until the catch histories that are estimated by the allocation model, and the abundance trajectories that are estimated by the population models, converge between runs.\\n\\nGiven a converged model and potential future catch options for the different hunts, the model estimates the probabilities of fulfilling management options for eight summer aggregations of narwhals.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria have a distinct secretion system, termed type VII (T7SS), which is encoded by paralogous chromosomal loci (ESX) and associated with pathogenesis, conjugation, and metal homeostasis. Evolution of paralogous gene families is of interest because duplication is an important mechanism by which novel genes evolve, but there are potential conflicts between adaptive forces that stabilize duplications and those that enable evolution of new functions. Our objective was to delineate the adaptive forces underlying diversification of T7SS. Plasmid-borne ESX were described recently, and we found evidence that the initial duplication and divergence of ESX systems occurred on plasmids and was driven by selection for advantageous mutations. Plasmid conjugation has been linked to T7SS and type IV secretion systems (T4SS) in mycobacteria, and we discovered that T7SS and T4SS genes evolved in concert on the plasmids. We hypothesize that differentiation of plasmid ESX helps to prevent conjugation among cells harboring incompatible plasmids. Plasmid ESX appear to have been repurposed following migration to the chromosome, and there is evidence of positive selection driving further differentiation of chromosomal ESX. We hypothesize that ESX loci were initially stabilized on the chromosome by mediating their own transfer. These results emphasize the diverse adaptive paths underlying evolution of novelty, which in this case involved plasmid duplications, selection for advantageous mutations in the mobile and core genomes, migration of the loci between plasmids and chromosomes, and lateral transfer among chromosomes. We discuss further implications for the choice of model organism to study ESX functions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Reliable exon recognition is key to the splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein whose nuclear loss and cytoplasmic aggregation are a hallmark pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). TDP-43 depletion causes the aberrant inclusion of cryptic exons into a range of transcripts, but their extent, relevance to disease pathogenesis and whether they are caused by other RNA-binding proteins implicated in ALS/FTD are unknown. We developed an analysis pipeline to discover and quantify cryptic exon inclusion and applied it to publicly available human and murine RNA-sequencing data. We detected widespread cryptic splicing in TDP-43 depletion datasets but almost none in another ALS/FTD-linked protein FUS. Sequence motif and iCLIP analysis of cryptic exons demonstrated that they are bound by TDP-43. Unlike the cryptic exons seen in hnRNP C depletion, those linked to TDP-43 do not originate from a particular family of transposable element. Cryptic exons are poorly conserved and inclusion overwhelmingly leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the host transcript, with reduced transcript levels observed in differential expression analysis. RNA-protein interaction data on 73 different RNA-binding proteins showed that, in addition to TDP-43, 7 specifically bind TDP-43 linked cryptic exons.This suggests that TDP-43 competes with other splicing factors for binding to cryptic exons and can repress cryptic exon inclusion. Our quantitative analysis pipeline confirms the presence of cryptic exons during TDP-43 depletion and will aid investigation of their relevance to disease.",

    "abstract": "Mapping cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) has become a popular approach for characterizing proximal genetic regulatory variants. However, measures used for quantifying the effect size of cis-eQTLs have been inconsistent and poorly defined. In this paper, we describe log allelic fold change (aFC) as a biologically interpretable and mathematically convenient unit that represents the magnitude of expression change associated with a given genetic variant. This measure is mathematically independent from expression level and allele frequency, applicable to multi-allelic variants, and generalizable to multiple independent variants. We provide tools and guidelines for estimating aFC from eQTL and allelic expression data sets, and apply it to GTEx data. We show that aFC estimates independently derived from eQTL and allelic expression data are highly consistent, and identify technical and biological correlates of eQTL effect size. We generalize aFC to analyze genes with two eQTLs in GTEx, and show that in nearly all cases these eQTLs are independent in their regulatory activity. In summary, aFC is a solid measure of cis-regulatory effect size that allows quantitative interpretation of cellular regulatory events from population data, and it is a valuable approach for investigating novel aspects of eQTL data sets.",

    "abstract": "The impact of inherited genetic variation on gene expression in humans is well-established. The majority of known expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impact expression of local genes (cis-eQTLs). More research is needed to identify effects of genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand their biological mechanisms. One common trans-eQTLs mechanism is \\\"mediation\\\" by a local (cis) transcript. Thus, mediation analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in order to identify transcripts that are \\\"cis-mediators\\\" of trans-eQTLs, including those \\\"cis-hubs\\\" involved in regulation of many trans-genes. Identifying such mediators helps us understand regulatory networks and suggests biological mechanisms underlying trans-eQTLs, both of which are relevant for understanding susceptibility to complex diseases. The multi-tissue expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program provides a unique opportunity to study cis-mediation across human tissue types. However, the presence of complex hidden confounding effects in biological systems can make mediation analyses challenging and prone to confounding bias, particularly when conducted among diverse samples. To address this problem, we propose a new method: Genomic Mediation analysis with Adaptive Confounding adjustment (GMAC). It enables the search of a very large pool of variables, and adaptively selects potential confounding variables for each mediation test. Analyses of simulated data and GTEx data demonstrate that the adaptive selection of confounders by GMAC improves the power and precision of mediation analysis. Application of GMAC to GTEx data provides new insights into the observed patterns of cis-hubs and trans-eQTL regulation across tissue types.",

Antagonistic species interactions dominate the local adaptation literature relative to mutualistic ones, preventing an overall assessment of adaptation within interspecific interactions. Here, we tested whether the legume Medicago lupulina is adapted to the locally abundant species of mutualistic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (\\\"rhizobia\\\"), which vary in frequency across its eastern North American range. We reciprocally inoculated northern and southern M. lupulina genotypes with the northern (Ensifer medicae) or southern bacterium (E. meliloti) in a greenhouse experiment. Neither northern nor southern plants produced more seed flowered earlier, or were more likely to flower when inoculated with their local rhizobium species, although plants produced more root nodules (the structures that house the bacteria) wit their local rhizobia. We used a pre-existing dataset to perform a genome scan for loci that showed elevated differentiation between field-collected plants that hosted different bacteria. None of the loci we identified belonged to the well-characterized suite of legume-rhizobia symbiosis genes, suggesting that the rhizobia do not drive genetic divergence between M. lupulina populations. Our results demonstrate that symbiont local adaptation is weak in this mutualism despite large-scale geographic variation in the identity of the interacting species.",

To better distinguish true from false positive calls, we present a method that uses genotype array data from the sequenced samples, rather than public data such as HapMap or dbSNP, to train an accurate classifier using Random Forests. We demonstrate our method on a set of variant calls obtained from 642 African-ancestry genomes from the The Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA), sequenced to high depth (30X).\\n\\nResultsWe have applied our classifier to compare call sets generated with different calling methods, including both single-sample and multi-sample callers.

Since most NGS sequencing data is accompanied by genotype data for the same samples, our method can be trained on each dataset to provide a more accurate computational validation of site calls compared to generic methods. Moreover, our method allows for adjustment based on allele frequency (e.g., a different set of criteria to determine quality for rare vs. common variants) and thereby provides insight into sequencing characteristics that indicate data quality for variants of different frequencies.\\n\\nAvailabilityCode will be made available prior to publication on Github.",

However, existing expert based identification algorithms often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false positive rate.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe propose a data informed framework for identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR via feature engineering and machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including k-Nearest-Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed EHR repository ranging from 2012 to 2014.\\n\\nResultsWe apply top-performing machine learning algorithms on the engineered features.

    "abstract": "Myosin VI (MVI) is the only known member of the myosin superfamily that, upon dimerization, walks processively towards the pointed end of the actin filament. The leading head of the dimer directs the trailing head forward with a power stroke, a conformational change of the motor domain exaggerated by the lever arm. Using a new coarse-grained model for the power stroke of a single MVI, we provide the molecular basis for its motility. We show that the power stroke occurs in two major steps: first, the motor domain attains the post-stroke conformation without directing the lever arm forward; second, the lever arm reaches the post-stroke orientation by undergoing a rotational diffusion. From the analysis of the trajectories, we discover that the potential that directs the rotating lever arm towards the post-stroke conformation is almost flat, implying that the lever arm rotation is mostly un-coupled from the motor domain. Because a backward load comparable with the largest inter-head tension in a MVI dimer prevents the rotation of the lever arm, our model suggests that the leading-head lever arm of a MVI dimer is uncoupled, in accord with the inference drawn from polarized Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (polTIRF) experiments. Our simulations are in quantitative agreement with polTIRF experiments, which validates our structural insights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our model in explaining the broad step-size distribution of MVI stepping pattern, and we make testable predictions.",

    "abstract": "Some methods for demographic inference based on the observed genetic diversity of current populations rely on the use of summary statistics such as the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS). Demographic models can be either model-constrained with numerous parameters such as growth rates, timing of demographic events and migration rates, or model-flexible, with an unbounded collection of piecewise constant sizes. It is still debated whether demographic histories can be accurately inferred based on the SFS. Here we illustrate this theoretical issue on an example of demographic inference for an African population. The SFS of the Yoruba population (data from the 1000 Genomes Project) is fit to a simple model of population growth described with a single parameter (e.g., founding time). We infer a time to the most recent common ancestor of 1.7 million years for this population. However, we show that the Yoruba SFS is not informative enough to discriminate between several different models of growth. We also show that for such simple demographies, the fit of one-parameter models outperforms the model-flexible method recently developed by Liu and Fu. The use of this method on simulated data suggests that it is biased by the noise intrinsically present in the data.",

Here we report our findings after comprehensive examination of the data for quality control.\\n\\nThe basic quality of the genotypes was assessed using standard procedures. KING version 1.4 was used to confirm the relationships in the provided pedigrees, and also to detect undeclared relationships. PCA was used to examine the similarities and differences between individuals among and between population groups.\\n\\nIn general, the data was found to be of high quality. No samples were removed due to low call rate (<97%) or excess heterozygosity. Sex chromosome genotypes showed two individuals with discrepancies between reported and inferred sex, and were unable to determine sex in an additional 20 individuals; the sex for these was changed to unknown. Relationship checking found discrepancies between first-degree relationships in the provided pedigrees and the genotypes in 9 families, including one instance where a reported parent/child pair was unrelated, two instances where full sibs were unrelated, and one set of three individuals who formed a newly defined trio. A set of 1756 individuals who were inferred to be more distant than 3rd degree relatives was extracted and used in PCA. These individuals clustered in a pattern that is consistent with other published reports of global populations. We identified 4 individuals whose genotypes clustered more closely with a different geographic region than the one in the provided data.\\n\\nAlthough the genotype data is of high quality, errors exist in the publicly available dataset that require attention prior to using the genotypes. PLINK-format files including SNPs with good quality metrics and revised pedigree structures is available at http://tcag.ca. Files with distantly related or unrelated individuals, with sex inference consistent with provided gender, and with PCA consistent with continental group are also available.",

Its two main subtypes, HCV-1a and HCV-1b, are associated to differences in epidemic features and risk groups, despite sharing similar features in most biological properties. We have analyzed the impact of positive selection on the evolution of these variants using complete genome coding regions, and compared the levels of genetic variability and the distribution of positively selected sites. We have also compared the distributions of positively selected and conserved sites considering different factors such as RNA secondary structure, the presence of different epitopes (antibody, CD4 and CD8), and secondary protein structure. Less than 10% of the genome was found to be under positive selection, and purifying selection was the main evolutionary force in both subtypes. We found differences in the number of positively selected sites between subtypes in several genes (Core, HVR2 in E2, P7, helicase in NS3 and NS4a). Heterozygosity values in positively selected sites and the rate of non-synonymous substitutions were significantly higher in subtype HCV-1b. Logistic regression analyses revealed that similar selective forces act at the genome level in both subtypes: RNA secondary structure and CD4 T-cell epitopes are associated with conservation, while CD8 T-cell epitopes are associated with positive selection in both subtypes. These results indicate that similar selective constraints are acting along HCV-1a and HCV-1b genomes, despite some differences in the distribution of positively selected sites at independent genes.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in a wide array of devastating diseases but the heterogeneity and complexity of these diseases symptoms challenges theoretical understanding of their causation. With the explosion of -omics data, we have the unprecedented ability to gain deep understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. However, there is also a need to make such datasets interpretable, and quantitative modelling allows us to translate such datasets into intuition and suggest rational biomedical treatments. Working towards this interdisciplinary goal, we use a recently published large-scale dataset, and develop a mathematical model of progressive increase in mutant load of the MELAS 3243A>G mtDNA mutation to develop a descriptive and predictive biophysical model. The experimentally observed behaviour is surprisingly rich, but we find that a simple, biophysically-motivated model intuitively accounts for this heterogeneity and yields a wealth of biological predictions. Our findings suggest that cells attempt to maintain wild-type mtDNA density through cell volume reduction, and thus energy demand reduction, until a minimum cell volume is reached. Thereafter, cells toggle from demand reduction to supply increase, upregulating energy production pathways. Our analysis provides further evidence for the physiological significance of mtDNA density, and emphasizes the need for performing single-cell volume measurements jointly with mtDNA quantification. We propose novel experiments to verify the hypotheses made here, to further develop our understanding of the threshold effect, and connect with rational choices for mtDNA disease therapies.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMitochondria are organelles which produce the major energy currency of the cell: ATP. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a multitude of devastating diseases, from Parkinsons disease to cancer. Large volumes of data related to these diseases are being produced, but translation of these data into rational biomedical treatment is challenged by a lack of theoretical understanding. We develop a mathematical model of progressive increase of mutant load in mitochondrial DNA, for the mutation associated with MELAS (the most common mitochondrial disease), to address this. We predict that cells attempt to maintain the ratio of healthy mtDNA to cell volume by reducing their cell volume until they reach a minimum cell volume. As mutant load continues to increase, cells switch strategy by increasing their energy supply pathways. Our work accounts for large-scale experimental data and makes testable predictions about mitochondrial dysfunction. It also provides support for increasing mitochondrial content, as well as reduction in dependence upon mitochondrial metabolism via the ketogenic diet, as relevant treatments for mitochondrial disease.",

A functional analysis of their predicted gene targets highlighted one class of enhancers as significantly enriched for associations with immune response genes. Moreover, these enhancers were specifically enriched for regulatory motifs recognized by TFs involved in immune response. We observed that enhancers enriched for links to immune response genes were more cell type specific, preferentially activated upon bacterial infection, and with specific response activity. Looking at chromatin capture data, we found that the two classes of enhancers were lying in distinct topologically-associated domains and chromatin loops. Our results suggest that specific nucleotide compositions encode for classes of enhancers that are functionally distinct and specifically organized in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic determinants of phenotypes that impact on disease severity is of fundamental importance for the design of new interventions against malaria. Traditionally, such discovery has relied on labor-intensive approaches that require significant investments of time and resources. By combining Linkage Group Selection (LGS), quantitative whole genome population sequencing and a novel mathematical modeling approach (qSeq-LGS), we simultaneously identified multiple genes underlying two distinct phenotypes, identifying novel alleles for growth rate and strain specific immunity (SSI), while removing the need for traditionally required steps such as cloning, individual progeny phenotyping and marker generation. The detection of novel variants, verified by experimental phenotyping methods, demonstrates the remarkable potential of this approach for the identification of genes controlling selectable phenotypes in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites for which experimental genetic crosses are amenable.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis paper describes a powerful and rapid approach to the discovery of genes underlying medically important phenotypes in malaria parasites. This is crucial for the design of new drug and vaccine interventions. The approach bypasses the most time-consuming steps required by traditional genetic linkage studies and combines Mendelian genetics, quantitative deep sequencing technologies, genome analysis and mathematical modeling. We demonstrate that the approach can simultaneously identify multigenic drivers of multiple phenotypes, thus allowing complex genotyping studies to be conducted concomitantly. This methodology will be particularly useful for discovering the genetic basis of medically important phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites, as well as potentially in any organism undergoing sexual recombination.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses are notorious for their ability to evolve rapidly under selection in novel environments. It is known that the high mutation rate of RNA viruses can generate huge genetic diversity to facilitate viral adaptation. However, less attention has been paid to the underlying fitness landscape that represents the selection forces on viral genomes. Here we systematically quantified the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of about 1,600 single amino acid substitutions in the drug-targeted region of NS5A protein of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). We found that the majority of non-synonymous substitutions incur large fitness costs, suggesting that NS5A protein is highly optimized in natural conditions. We characterized the adaptive potential of HCV by subjecting the mutant viruses to selection by the antiviral drug Daclatasvir. Both the selection coefficient and the number of beneficial mutations are found to increase with the level of environmental stress, which is modulated by the concentration of Daclatasvir. The changes in the spectrum of beneficial mutations in NS5A protein can be explained by a pharmacodynamics model describing viral fitness as a function of drug concentration. We test theoretical predictions regarding the distribution of beneficial fitness effects of mutations. We also interpret the data in the context of Fishers Geometric Model and find an increased distance to optimum as a function of environmental stress. Finally, we show that replication fitness of viruses is correlated with the pattern of sequence conservation in nature and viral evolution is constrained by the need to maintain protein stability.",

    "abstract": "How does our motor system solve the problem of anticipatory control in spite of a wide spectrum of response dynamics from different musculo-skeletal systems, transport delays as well as response latencies throughout the central nervous system? To a great extent, our highly-skilled motor responses are a result of a reactive feedback system, originating in the brain-stem and spinal cord, combined with a feed-forward anticipatory system, that is adaptively fine-tuned by sensory experience and originates in the cerebellum. Based on that interaction we design the counterfactual predictive control (CFPC) architecture, an anticipatory adaptive motor control scheme, in which a feed-forward module, based on the cerebellum, steers an error feedback controller with counterfactual error signals. Those are signals that trigger reactions as actual errors would, but that do not code for any current of forthcoming errors. In order to determine the optimal learning strategy, we derive a novel learning rule for the feed-forward module that involves an eligibility trace and operates at the synaptic level. In particular, our eligibility trace provides a mechanism beyond co-incidence detection in that it convolves a history of prior synaptic inputs with error signals. In the context of cerebellar physiology, this solution implies that Purkinje cell synapses should generate eligibility traces using a forward model of the system being controlled. From an engineering perspective, CFPC provides a general-purpose anticipatory control architecture equipped with a learning rule that exploits the full dynamics of the closed-loop system.",

These AGO4-depdenent siRNAs are likely secondary het-siRNAs produced by a self-reinforcing loop of RdDM.

The biogenesis of most het-siRNAs depends on the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), and ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) is a major het-siRNA effector protein. Through genome-wide analysis of sRNA-seq data sets, we found that AGO4 is required for the accumulation of a small subset of het-siRNAs. The accumulation of AGO4-dependent het-siRNAs also requires several factors known to participate in the effector portion of the RdDM pathway, including RNA POLYMERASE V (POL V), DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) and SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1). Like many AGO proteins, AGO4 is an endonuclease that can  slice RNAs. We found that a slicing-defective AGO4 was unable to fully recover AGO4-dependent het-siRNA accumulation from ago4 mutant plants. Collectively, our data suggest that AGO4-dependent siRNAs are secondary siRNAs dependent on the prior activity of the RdDM pathway at certain loci.",

    "abstract": "Estimating admixture histories is crucial for understanding the genetic diversity we see in present-day populations. Allele frequency or phylogeny-based methods are excellent for inferring the existence of admixture or its proportions. However, to estimate admixture times, spatial information from admixed chromosomes of local ancestry or the decay of admixture linkage disequilibrium (ALD) is used. One popular method, implemented in the programs ALDER and ROLLOFF, uses two-locus ALD to infer the time of a single admixture event, but is only able to estimate the time of the most recent admixture event based on this summary statistic. To address this limitation, we derive analytical expressions for the expected ALD in a three-locus system and provide a new statistical method based on these results that is able to resolve more complicated admixture histories. Using simulations, we evaluate the performance of this method on a range of different admixture histories. As an example, we apply the method to the Colombian and Mexican samples from the 1000 Genomes project. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Genomics-HSE/LaNeta.\n\nAuthor summaryWe establish a theoretical framework to model 3-locus admixture linkage disequilibrium of an admixed population taking into account the effects of genetic drift, migration and recombination. The theory is used to develop a method for estimating the times of multiple admixtures events. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method on simulated data and we apply it to previously published data from Mexican and Columbian populations to explore the complex history of American populations in the post-Columbian period.",

    "abstract": "Dramatic events in human prehistory, such as the spread of agriculture to Europe from Anatolia and the Late Neolithic/Bronze Age (LNBA) migration from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, can be investigated using patterns of genetic variation among the people that lived in those times. In particular, studies of differing female and male demographic histories on the basis of ancient genomes can provide information about complexities of social structures and cultural interactions in prehistoric populations. We use a mechanistic admixture model to compare the sex-specifically-inherited X chromosome to the autosomes in 20 early Neolithic and 16 LNBA human remains. Contrary to previous hypotheses suggested by the patrilocality of many agricultural populations, we find no evidence of sex-biased admixture during the migration that spread farming across Europe during the early Neolithic. For later migrations from the Pontic steppe during the LNBA, however, we estimate a dramatic male bias, with ~5-14 migrating males for every migrating female. We find evidence of ongoing, primarily male, migration from the steppe to central Europe over a period of multiple generations, with a level of sex bias that excludes a pulse migration during a single generation. The contrasting patterns of sex-specific migration during these two migrations suggest a view of differing cultural histories in which the Neolithic transition was driven by mass migration of both males and females in roughly equal numbers, perhaps whole families, whereas the later Bronze Age migration and cultural shift were instead driven by male migration, potentially connected to new technology and conquest.",

Expression of a duplicate gene (SMN2) primarily results in skipping of exon 7 and production of an unstable protein isoform, SMN{Delta}7.

We used a Drosophila model system and label-free proteomics to identify the SCFSlmb ubiquitin E3 ligase complex as a novel SMN binding partner. SCFSlmb interacts with a phospho-degron embedded within the human and fruitfly SMN YG-box oligomerization domains. Substitution of a conserved serine (S270A) interferes with SCFSlmb binding and stabilizes SMN{Delta}7. SMA-causing missense mutations that block multimerization of full-length SMN are also stabilized in the degron mutant background. Overexpression of SMN{Delta}7S270A, but not wild-type SMN{Delta}7, provides a protective effect in SMA model mice and human motor neuron cell culture systems. Our findings support a model wherein the degron is exposed when SMN is monomeric, and sequestered when SMN forms higher-order multimers.",

    "abstract": "MotivationStandard genome sequence alignment tools primarily designed to find one alignment per read have difficulty detecting inversion, translocation and large insertion and deletion (indel) events. Moreover, dedicated split read alignment methods that depend only upon the reference genome may misidentify or find too many potential split read alignments because of reference genome anomalies.\\n\\nMethodsWe introduce MUMdex, a Maximal Unique Match (MUM)-based genomic analysis software package consisting of a sequence aligner to the reference genome, a storage-indexing format and analysis software. Discordant reference alignments of MUMs are especially suitable for identifying inversion, translocation and large indel differences in unique regions. Extracted population databases are used as filters for flaws in the reference genome. We describe the concepts underlying MUM-based analysis, the software implementation and its usage.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate via simulation that the MUMdex aligner and alignment format are able to correctly detect and record genomic events. We characterize alignment performance and output file sizes for human whole genome data and compare to Bowtie 2 and the BAM format. Preliminary results demonstrate the practicality of the analysis approach by detecting de novo mutation candidates in human whole genome DNA sequence data from 510 families. We provide a population database of events from these families for use by others.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://mumdex.com/\\n\\nContactandrewsp@cshl.edu (or paa@drpa.us)\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have investigated general properties of the genetic architecture of gene expression variation. Most of these used controlled crosses and it is unclear whether their findings extend to natural populations. Furthermore, systems biology has established that biological networks are buffered against large effect mutations, but there remains little data resolving this with natural variation of gene expression. Here we utilise RNA-Sequencing to assay gene expression in winter buds undergoing bud flush in a natural population of Populus tremula. We performed expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping and identified 164,290 significant eQTLs associating 6,241 unique genes (eGenes) with 147,419 unique SNPs (eSNPs). We found approximately four times as many local as distant eQTLs, which had significantly higher effect size. eQTLs were primarily located in regulatory regions of genes (UTRs or flanking regions), regardless of whether they were local or distant. We used the gene expression data to infer a co-expression network and investigated to what degree eQTLs could explain the structure of the network: eGenes were present in the core of 28 of 38 network modules, however, eGenes were overall underrepresented in cores and overrepresented in the periphery of the network, with a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and network connectivity. We also observed a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and allele frequency and found that core genes have experienced stronger selective constraint. Our integrated genetics and genomics results suggest that prevalent purifying selection is the primary mechanism underlying the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression in P. tremula and that highly connected network hubs are buffered against deleterious effects as a result of regulation by numerous eSNPs, each of minor effect.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNumerous studies have shown that many genomic polymorphisms contributing to phenotypic variation are located outside of protein coding regions, suggesting that they act by modulating gene expression. Furthermore, phenotypes are seldom explained by individual genes, but rather emerge from networks of interacting genes. The effect of regulatory variants and the interaction of genes can be described by co-expression networks, which are known to contain a small number of highly connected nodes and many more lowly connected nodes, making them robust to random mutation. While previous studies have examined the genetic architecture of gene expression variation, few were performed in natural populations with fewer still integrating the co-expression network.\\n\\nWe undertook a study using a natural population of European aspen (Populus tremula), showing that expression variance is substantially smaller among individuals than between tissues within the same individual, suggesting that stabilizing selection may act to restrict the scale of expression variation. We further show that highly connected genes within the co-expression network are associated with polymorphisms of lower than average effect size, suggesting purifying selection. These genes are therefore buffered against large expression modulation, providing a mechanistic explanation of how network robustness is created and maintained at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Tumor development progresses through a complex path of biomechanical changes leading first to cell growth and contraction followed by cell de-adhesion, scattering and invasion. Tumorigenic factors may act specifically on one of these steps or have wider spectrum of actions, leading to a variety of effects and thus sometimes to apparent contradictory outcomes. Here we used micropatterned lines of collagen type-I/fibronectin on deformable surfaces to standardize cell behavior and to measure simultaneously cell size, speed of motion and the magnitude of the associated contractile forces at the level of a single cell. We analyzed and compared normal human breast cell line MCF10A in control conditions and in response to various tumorigenic factors. In all conditions, distinct populations of cells with a wide range of biomechanical properties were identified. Despite this heterogeneity, normal and transformed motile cells followed a common trend whereby size and contractile forces were negatively correlated with cell speed. Some tumorigenic factors, such as activation of ErbB2 or the loss of the beta subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), shifted the whole population towards a faster speed and lower contractility state. Treatment with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}), induced some cells to adopt opposing behaviors such as extreme high contractility versus extreme low contractility. Thus, tumor transformation amplified the pre-existing population heterogeneity and led some cells to exhibit biomechanical properties that were more extreme than that observed with normal cells.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies found three Neolithic super-grandfather Y haplotypes among Han Chinese, consistent with the legend of Yan and Huang Emperors. Individuals of royal and noble ancestry or high social economic status (SES) are known to practice assortative mating and consanguineous marriages, which can produce offspring of both higher and lower than average fitness. However, the roles of the super-grandfather Y haplotypes and their descendant lines in history, fitness, and the male biased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unknown. Here we show a link between the super-grandfathers and the legend of Yan-Huang Emperors and between their descendant haplotypes and ASD. We found that subjects carrying the O3a1c and O3a2c1a super-grandfather haplotypes were enriched with Yan and Huang related surnames, respectively, in two independent datasets of 1564 and 772 male Han subjects. We identified high and low SES descendant haplotypes of the super-grandfathers using the Han dataset of the 1000 genomes project based on two criteria: more descendant branches and fewer mutations before star-like expansions. By genotyping 505 fathers of ASD affected male children from the Autism Clinical and Genetic Resources in China with surnames either closely related to Huang (Ying group) or less related (Ji group), we found the high SES haplotypes within the O3a2c1a clade at [~]2 fold lower (odds ratio 2.05, 95% CI 1.28-3.26, P=0.0026) while the low SES haplotypes at [~]2 fold higher frequency (odds ratio 1.92, 95% CI 1.01-3.64, P = 0.046) in the fathers relative to 505 normal subjects. The fraction of low SES haplotypes was greater than that of high SES in ASD fathers of the Ying group, in contrast to Ying controls or the Ji fathers and Ji controls. Consistently, analysis of 2366 ASD affected children showed higher male to female ratio for Ying versus Ji group (6.52 +/-1.11 v 4.59 +/-0.41, P = 0.028, one tailed). These results provide evidence for the Yan-Huang legend and suggest a role for Y in ASD.",
