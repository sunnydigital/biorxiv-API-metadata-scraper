    "abstract": "BackgroundCharacterization of genetic variations in maize has been challenging, mainly due to deterioration of collinearity between individual genomes in the species. An international consortium of maize research groups combined resources to develop the maize haplotype version 3 (HapMap 3), built from whole genome sequencing data from 1,218 maize lines, covering pre-domestication and domesticated Zea mays varieties across the world.\\n\\nResultsA new computational pipeline was set up to process over 12 trillion bp of sequencing data, and a set of population genetics filters were applied to identify over 83 million variant sites.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified polymorphisms in regions where collinearity is largely preserved in the maize species. However, the fact that the B73 genome used as the reference only represents a fraction of all haplotypes is still an important limiting factor.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants that disrupt protein-coding DNA are ubiquitous in the human population, with ~100 such loss-of-function variants per individual. While most loss-of-function variants are rare, a subset have risen to high frequency and occur in a homozygous state in healthy individuals. It is unknown why these common variants are well-tolerated, even though some affect essential genes implicated in Mendelian disease. Here, we combine genomic, proteomic, and biochemical data to demonstrate that many common nonsense variants do not ablate protein production from their host genes. We provide computational and experimental evidence for diverse mechanisms of gene rescue, including alternative splicing, stop codon readthrough, alternative translation initiation, and C-terminal truncation. Our results suggest a molecular explanation for the mild fitness costs of many common nonsense variants, and indicate that translational plasticity plays a prominent role in shaping human genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Zfp423 encodes a 30-zinc finger transcription factor that intersects several canonical signaling pathways. Zfp423 mutations result in ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including agenesis of the cerebellar vermis in mice and Joubert syndrome (JBTS19) and nephronophthisis (NPHP14) in humans. Unlike most ciliopathy genes, Zfp423 encodes a nuclear protein and its developmental expression is complex, leading to alternative proposals for cellular mechanisms. Here we show that Zfp423 is expressed by cerebellar granule cell precursors, that loss of Zfp423 in these precursors leads to cell-intrinsic reduction in proliferation, loss of response to Shh, and primary cilia abnormalities that include diminished frequency of both Smoothened and IFT88 localization. Loss of Zfp423 alters expression of several genes encoding key cilium components, including increased expression of Tulp3. Tulp3 is a direct binding target of Zfp423 and reducing the overexpression of Tulp3 in Zfp423-deficient cells suppresses Smoothened translocation defects. These results define Zfp423 deficiency as a bona fide ciliopathy, acting upstream of Shh signaling, and indicate a mechanism intrinsic to granule cell precursors for the resulting cerebellar hypoplasia.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCiliopathies are a broad group of individually rare genetic disorders that share overlapping phenotypes and mutations in genes that make components of the primary cilium. Mutations in ZNF423 are an exception. Patients and mouse models show characteristic hypoplasia of the cerebellar midline (Joubert syndrome), but the gene encodes a nuclear transcription factor. The mouse gene, Zfp423, is expressed in a dynamic developmental pattern, leaving the cellular mechanism for this brain malformation unresolved. One report suggested reduced Purkinje cell expression of Shh, a key mitogen for cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) whose signal transduction occurs at the primary cilium, as the key event. We show that Zfp423 mutants expressed normal Shh levels, but that Zfp423-depleted GCPs were unable to respond. Primary cilia on Zfp423-mutant GCPs in situ typically had a wider base and longer extension. ZNF423-depletion in a human cell culture model resulted in defective translocation of Smoothened, a key event in Shh signaling, and of the intraflagellar transport protein IFT88. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR experiments identified known ciliopathy genes as potential conserved targets of ZNF423 and Zfp423. One of these, TULP3, was both up-regulated in ZNF423/Zfp423-deficient cells and directly bound by Zfp423 in granule cell precursors. Reversing the overexpression of TULP3 in ZNF423-depleted human cell culture model reversed the defect in Smoothened translocation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how host dynamics, including variations of population size and dispersal, may affect the epidemiology of infectious diseases through ecological and evolutionary processes is an active research area. Here we focus on a bank vole (Myodes glareolus) metapopulation surveyed in Finland between 2005 and 2009. Bank vole is the reservoir of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), the agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptom) in humans. M glareolus populations experience multiannual density fluctuations that may influence the level of genetic diversity maintained in bank voles, PUUV prevalence and NE occurrence. We examine bank vole metapopulation genetics at presumably neutral markers and immune-related genes involved in susceptibility to PUUV (Tnf-promoter, Mhc-Drb, Tlr4, Tlr7 and Mx2 gene) to investigate the links between population dynamics, microevolutionary processes and PUUV epidemiology. We show that genetic drift slightly and transiently affects neutral and adaptive genetic variability within the metapopulation. Gene flow seems to counterbalance its effects during the multiannual density fluctuations. The low abundance phase may therefore be too short to impact genetic variation in the host, and consequently viral genetic diversity. Environmental heterogeneity does not seem to affect vole gene flow, which might explain the absence of spatial structure previously detected in PUUV in this area. Besides, our results suggest the role of vole dispersal on PUUV circulation through sex-specific and density-dependent movements. We find little evidence of selection acting on immune-related genes within this metapopulation. Footprint of positive selection is detected at Tlr-4 gene in 2008 only. We observe marginally significant associations between Mhc-Drb haplotypes and PUUV serology, and between Mx2 genotype and PUUV genogroups. These results show that microevolutionary changes and PUUV epidemiology in this metapopulation are mainly driven by neutral processes, although the relative effects of neutral and adaptive forces could vary temporally with density fluctuations.",

We now show that the KRAB domain of PRDM9 forms complexes with additional proteins to allow hotspots to proceed into the next phase of recombination. By a combination of yeast-two hybrid assay, in vitro binding, and co-immunoprecipitation from mouse spermatocytes, we identified four proteins that directly interact with PRDM9s KRAB domain, namely CXXC1, EWSR1, EHMT2, and CDYL. These proteins are co-expressed in spermatocytes at the early stages of meiotic prophase I, the limited period when PRDM9 is expressed. We also detected association of PRDM9-bound complexes with the meiotic cohesin REC8 and the synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and SYCP1. Our results suggest a model in which PRDM9-bound hotspot DNA is brought to the chromosomal axis by the action of these proteins, ensuring the proper chromatin and spatial environment for subsequent recombination events.",

    "abstract": "LONG ABSTRACTHuman perceptual decisions are often described as optimal. This view reflects recent successes of Bayesian approaches to both cognition and perception. However, claims regarding optimality have been strongly criticized for their excessive flexibility and lack of explanatory power. Rebuttals from Bayesian theorists in turn claim that critics unfairly pick on select few papers. To resolve the issue regarding the role of optimality in perceptual decision making, we review the vast literature on suboptimal performance in perceptual tasks. Specifically, we discuss eight different classes of suboptimal perceptual decisions, including improper placement, maintenance, and adjustment of perceptual criteria, inadequate tradeoff between speed and accuracy, inappropriate confidence ratings, misweightings in cue combination, and findings related to various perceptual illusions and biases. We then extract the proposed explanations for the suboptimal behavior seen in each type of task. Critically, we show that these explanations naturally fit within an overarching Bayesian framework. Specifically, each suboptimality can be explained by alternative likelihood functions, priors, cost functions, or decision rules (LPCDs). We argue that unless the observers likelihood functions, priors, and cost functions are known, statements about the optimality or suboptimality of decision rules are meaningless. Further, the very definition of optimal behavior is debatable and may ultimately require appeals to evolutionary history beyond the current scope of perceptual science. The field should therefore shift its focus away from optimality. We propose a \\\"LPCD approach\\\" to perceptual decision making that focuses exclusively on uncovering the LPCD components, without debating whether the uncovered LPCDs are \\\"optimal\\\" or not.\\n\\nSHORT ABSTRACTHuman perceptual decisions are often described as optimal, but this view remains controversial.

The metalloenzymes mediating this metabolism, hydrogenases, are encoded by over 60 microbial phyla and are present in all major ecosystems. We developed a classification system and web tool, HydDB, for the structural and functional analysis of these enzymes. We show that hydrogenase function can be predicted by primary sequence alone using an expanded classification scheme (comprising 29 [NiFe], 8 [FeFe], and 1 [Fe] hydrogenase classes) that defines 11 new classes with distinct biological functions. Using this scheme, we built a web tool that rapidly and reliably classifies hydrogenase primary sequences using a combination of k-nearest neighbors algorithms and CDD referencing. Demonstrating its capacity, the tool reliably predicted hydrogenase content and function in 12 newly-sequenced bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. HydDB provides the capacity to browse the amino acid sequences of 3248 annotated hydrogenase catalytic subunits and also contains a detailed repository of physiological, biochemical, and structural information about the 38 hydrogenase classes defined here.

Simple calculations suggest that the observed diverse recognition of antigens by natural antibodies is only possible by cross-reactivity whereby particular clones of antibodies bind to diverse targets and shared recognition of particular antigens by multiple antibody clones contribute to the maintenance of antigen control. We also argue that natural antibodies are none else than the result of thymus independent responses against immunological self.

In this first paper we describe the cycles of B-cell expansion and differentiation driven by B-cell receptor engagement.\\n\\nThe fate of a B cell is determined by the signals it receives via its antigen receptor at any point of its lifetime. We express BCR engagement as a function of apparent affinity and free antigen concentration, using the range of 10-14 to 10-3 M for both factors. We assume that for keeping their BCR responsive B cells must maintain partial BCR saturation, which is a narrow region defined by [Ag]{approx}KD. To remain in this region, B cells respond to changes in [Ag] by proliferation or apoptosis and modulate KD by changing BCR structure. We apply this framework to various niches of B-cell development, such as the bone marrow, blood, lymphoid follicles and germinal centers. We propose that clustered B cells in the bone marrow and in follicles present antigen to surrounding B cells by exposing antigen captured on complement and Fc receptors. The model suggests that antigen-dependent selection in the bone marrow results in 1) effector BI cells, which develop in blood as a consequence of the inexhaustible nature of soluble antigens, 2) memory cells that survive in antigen rich niches, identified as marginal zone B cells. Finally, the model implies that memory B cells could derive survival signals from abundant non-cognate antigens.",

    "abstract": "The 2013-2016 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in West Africa was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Extensive collaborative sequencing projects have produced a large collection of over 1600 Ebola virus genomes, representing over 5% of known cases, unmatched for any single human epidemic. In a comprehensive analysis of this entire dataset, we reconstruct in detail the history of migration, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region. We test the association of geography, climate, administrative boundaries, demography and culture with viral movement among 56 administrative regions. Our results show that during the outbreak viral lineages moved according to a classic  gravity model, with more intense migration between larger and more proximate population centers. Despite a strong attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, localized cross-border transmission beforehand had already set the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures relatively ineffective in curbing the epidemic. We use this empirical evidence to address why the epidemic did not spread into neighboring countries, showing that although these regions were susceptible to developing significant outbreaks, they were also at lower risk of viral introductions. Finally, viral genome sequence data uniquely reveals this large epidemic to be a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help inform approaches to intervention in such epidemics in the future.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been both great interest and confusion about whether recent demographic events--notably the Out-of-Africa-bottleneck and recent population growth--have led to differences in mutation load among human populations. The confusion can be traced to the use of different summary statistics to measure load, which lead to apparently conflicting results. We argue, however, that when statistics more directly related to load are used, the results of different studies and data sets consistently reveal little or no difference in the load of non-synonymous mutations among human populations. Theory helps to understand why no such differences are seen, as well as to predict in what settings they are to be expected. In particular, as predicted by modeling, there is evidence for changes in the load of recessive loss of function mutations in founder and inbred human populations. Also as predicted, eastern subspecies of gorilla, Neanderthals and Denisovans, who are thought to have undergone reductions in population sizes that exceed the human Out-of-Africa bottleneck in duration and severity, show evidence for increased load of non-synonymous mutations (relative to western subspecies of gorillas and modern humans, respectively). A coherent picture is thus starting to emerge about the effects of demographic history on the mutation load in populations of humans and close evolutionary relatives.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction.\\n\\nMethodThis paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model contact occurring patterns and very complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question.\\n\\nResultsOur method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore>0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained by only non-membrane proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one {beta} protein of 182 residues, one +{beta} protein of 125 residues, one  protein of 140 residues and one  protein of 217 residues.\\n\\nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/ContactMap/\\n\\nAuthor SummaryProtein contact prediction from sequence alone is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem due to the development of direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA). However, DCA is effective on only some proteins with a very large number (>1000) of sequence homologs. To further improve contact prediction, we borrow ideas from the latest breakthrough of deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique that has recently revolutionized object recognition, speech recognition and the GO game. We have developed a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both sequence conservation and co-variation information through an ultra-deep neural network, which can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as high-order correlation among residues.\\n\\nOur test results suggest that deep learning can revolutionize protein contact prediction. Tested on 398 membrane proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy obtained by our method is 77.6% while that by the state-of-the-art methods CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 51.8% and 61.2%, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can generate much better 3D structural models than the other contact prediction methods. In particular, without using any force fields our predicted contacts yield correct folds for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (TBM) built from the training proteins. For example, our contact-assisted models have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins while TBMs have TMscore >0.5 for only 10 of them. Even without using any membrane proteins to train our deep learning models, our method still performs very well on membrane protein contact prediction. Recent blind test of our method in CAMEO shows that our method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.",

    "abstract": "A mouse line with heterozygous transgenic expression of phospholamban carrying a substitution of cysteine for arginine 9 (PLNR9C) under the control of -myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter features dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure and premature death. In this line the transgenic array of 13 PLNR9C expression cassettes, arranged in a head-to-tail tandem orientation, has integrated into the homologous genomic site, the bi-directional promoter of the MHC (Myh6) gene and the gene for the regulatory non-coding RNA Myheart (Mhrt), both of which are involved in the execution of the /{beta} MHC switch during cardiac development and pathology. PLNR9C overexpression is evident at the age of 1 month but declines dramatically along with a less pronounced concomitant decline of the resident PLN expression, until the animals die. Expression of the non-coding RNA Mhrt in PLNR9C mice also exhibits a profound deregulation, despite the presence of the second, intact allele. Hence the mouse strain does not faithfully model a human PLNR9C heterozygote, wherein both the mutant and the wildtype PLN alleles have, in all likelihood, the same temporal expression profile. The intricate regulatory circuit of the /{beta} MHC switch, involving the non-coding RNA Mhrt, was described in detail only recently, and since publications about MHC-driven transgenes rarely contain the definition of the transgene integration site or temporal expression profile, it is suggested that some of the pathological phenomena attributed to expression of MHC-driven transgenes may have an alternative explanation.",

    "abstract": "Human administrative borders have no effect on wild animals, and the vast home ranges of large carnivores often cause them to live simultaneously on the territory of two or more countries or jurisdictions with different management policies. Here, we investigate the importance of transboundary population monitoring using as a case study the Pyrenean brown bear population (Ursus arctos) that lives in France, Andorra and Spain. Using capture-recapture models and the Pollocks robust design, we estimated abundance and demographic parameters using data collected separately in France and Spain and a dataset gathered from joint monitoring on both sides of the border. As expected, the abundance estimates from French (from 11 bears in 2008 to 13 in 2014) or Spanish (from 4 bears in 2008 to 9 in 2014) data only were lower than abundance obtained from both sides of the border (from 11 in 2008 to 18 in 2014). The joint monitoring dataset also highlighted the importance of individual detection heterogeneity that, if ignored, would lead to underestimation. Our results reinforce the importance of transboundary cooperation when dealing with animal populations with territory spanning two or more administrative jurisdictions for collecting reliable scientific data and providing relevant abundance estimation to take sound management decisions.",

    "abstract": "How the size of organelles in cells is controlled despite a constant turnover of their constituent parts is a central problem in cell biology. A general mechanism has been proposed based on the idea that an organelle grows by self-assembly of molecular subunits that freely diffuse in the cytoplasm. Assembly continues until the available pool of subunits is depleted to the point when the stochastic addition and removal of subunits is balanced, leading to a structure of well-defined size. Here we focus on length control of multiple filamentous structures in cells, such as actin cables and flagella. Using queueing theory and computation we show that the limiting pool mechanism leads to three different phases of assembly, starting with a rapid growth phase when all filaments quickly accumulate a large number of available subunits. Then, the slower growing filamentous structures enter a disassembly phase as they gradually lose all of their subunits to the faster growing structures. Finally, when multiple, equivalent fast-growing filaments are present, their lengths undergo protracted diffusive dynamics due to the stochastic swapping of subunits between them. This eventually leads to a broad, power-law distribution of filament lengths in steady state. Our findings demonstrate that the limiting-pool mechanism is incapable of controlling lengths of multiple filamentous structures that are assembled from a common pool of subunits, and at best, can produce only one filament of a well-defined size. Overall, our theoretical results reveal physical limitations of the limiting-pool mechanism of organelle size control.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhat determines the size of organelles in cells is a classic problem in cell biology. Recent experiments on mitotic spindles, and nucleolus have singled out the limiting-pool mechanism of size control. As these structures assemble, they deplete a finite pool of subunits present in the cell, thereby reducing the rate of subunit addition. Eventually the stochastic addition and removal of subunits are balanced and a well-defined size is achieved. We find that, while the limiting-pool mechanism does control the size of an individual structure, it fails when multiple structures are competing for the same pool of subunits. In that case we predict large size fluctuations and that the fastest growing structure takes up practically all the subunits from the pool.",

    "abstract": "In temperate humid catchments, evapotranspiration returns more than half of the annual precipitation to the atmosphere, thereby determining the balance available to recharge groundwaters and support stream flow and lake levels. Changes in evapotranspiration rates and therefore catchment hydrology could be driven by changes in land use or climate. Here we examine the catchment water balance over the past 50 y for a catchment in southwest Michigan covered by cropland, grassland, forest, and wetlands. Over the study period about 27% of the catchment has been abandoned from row-crop agriculture to perennial vegetation and about 20% of the catchment has reverted to deciduous forest, and the climate has warmed by 1.14{degrees}C. Despite these changes in land use, precipitation and stream discharge, and by inference catchment-scale evapotranspiration, have been stable over the study period. The remarkably stable rates of evapotranspirative water loss from the catchment across a period of significant land cover change suggest that rainfed annual crops and perennial vegetation do not differ greatly in evapotranspiration rates, and this is supported by measurements of evapotranspiration from various vegetation types based on soil water monitoring in the same catchment. Compensating changes in the other meteorological drivers of evaporative water demand besides air temperature--wind speed, atmospheric humidity, and net radiation--are also possible, but cannot be evaluated due to insufficient local data across the 50-y period. Regardless of the explanation, this study shows that the water balance of this landscape has been resilient in the face of both land cover and climate change over the past 50 y.",

We then ask: How and when is it possible to delineate species in a way satisfying these properties?\\n\\nWe point out that the three desirable properties cannot in general be satisfied simultaneously, but that any two of them can. We mathematically prove the existence of the finest partition satisfying (A) and (M) and the coarsest partition satisfying (B) and (M). For each of them, we propose a simple algorithm to build the associated phylogeny out of the genealogy.\\n\\nThe ways we propose to phrase the species problem shed new light on the interaction between the genealogical and phylogenetic scales in modeling work. The two definitions centered on the monophyly property can readily be used at a higher taxonomic level as well, e.g. to cluster species into monophyletic genera.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular accumulation of lipids and swollen dysfunctional lysosomes are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases including lysosomal storage disorders (LSD). A detailed characterization of lipid metabolic changes in relation to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration is currently missing. In this study, we systematically analyzed lipid perturbations in spinster (spin) mutants, a Drosophila model of neurodegeneration associated with LSD. Our results highlight an imbalance in brain ceramide and sphingosine as a crucial phenotype in the early stages of neurodegeneration. This perturbation in ceramide metabolism precedes the accumulation of endomembranous structures, manifestation of altered behavior and buildup of lipofuscin (the ageing pigment). Manipulating levels of ceramidase, and, consequently further altering these lipids in spin mutants have allowed us to conclude that ceramide/sphingosine homeostasis is the driving force in disease progression and is integral to spin function in the adult nervous system. Furthermore, we have identified 29 novel and direct interaction partners of Spin. We specifically focused on the lipid carrier protein, Lipophorin (Lpp), and demonstrate its localization with Spin in the adult nervous system and in organs specialized for lipid metabolism including fat bodies and oenocytes. Our observations in spin mutants of altered Lpp immunostaining, and of increased levels of lipid metabolites produced by oenocytes, allude to a functional relevance of the Spin-Lpp interaction.\\n\\nOverall, these results detailing the kinetics of ceramide perturbations in the context of lipofuscin accumulation, as well as the proteomics experiment, represent a valuable resource to further unravel the mechanistic link between systemic changes in lipid metabolism and lysosomal storage disorders.\\n\\nSummary StatementElevations in specific brain lipids and connections to relevant metabolic genes are identified in a fly model for lysosomal storage disorders.

The prevailing opinion is that these bacteria exclusively metabolise single-carbon, and in limited instances, short-chain hydrocarbons for growth. This specialist lifestyle juxtaposes metabolic flexibility, a key strategy for environmental adaptation of microorganisms. Here we show that a methanotrophic bacterium from the phylum Verrucomicrobia oxidises hydrogen gas (H2) during growth and persistence. Methylacidiphilum sp. RTK17.1 expresses a membrane-bound hydrogenase to aerobically respire molecular H2 at environmentally significant concentrations. While H2 oxidation did not support growth as the sole electron source, it significantly enhanced mixotrophic growth yields under both oxygen-replete and oxygen-limiting conditions and was sustained in non-growing cultures starved for methane. We propose that H2 is consumed by this bacterium for mixotrophic growth and persistence in a manner similar to other non-methanotrophic soil microorganisms. We have identified genes encoding oxygen-tolerant uptake hydrogenases in all publicly-available methanotroph genomes, suggesting that H2 oxidation serves a general strategy for methanotrophs to remain energised in chemically-limited environments.",

    "abstract": "There is an abundance of information about the genetic basis, physiological and molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. In contrast, relatively little is known about population dynamic processes, by which bacteria colonize hosts and invade tissues and cells and thereby cause disease. In an article published in 1978, Moxon and Murphy presented evidence that, when inoculated intranasally with a mixture streptomycin sensitive and resistant (SmS and SmR) and otherwise isogenic stains of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), neonatal rats develop a bacteremic infection that often is dominated by only one strain, SmS or SmR. After rulling out other possibilities through years of related experiments, the field seems to have settled on a plausible explanation for this phenomenon: the first bacterium to invade the host activates the host immune response that  shuts the door on the second invading strain. To explore this hypothesis in a necessarily quantitative way, we modeled this process with a set of mixed stochastic and deterministic differential equations. Our analysis of the properties of this model with realistic parameters suggests that this hypothesis cannot explain the experimental results of Moxon and Murphy, and in particular the observed relationship between the frequency of different types of blood infections (bacteremias) and the inoculum size. We propose modifications to the model that come closer to explaining these data. However, the modified and better fitting model contradicts the common theory of independent action of individual bacteria in establishing infections. We discuss the implications of these results.",

For some genes it is essential to maintain two functional chromosomal copies, while other genes may tolerate the loss of one or both copies. Exome sequence data from 60,706 individuals provide sufficient observations of rare protein truncating variants (PTVs) to make genome-wide estimates of selection against heterozygous loss of gene function. The cumulative frequency of rare deleterious PTVs is primarily determined by the balance between incoming mutations and purifying selection rather than genetic drift. This enables the estimation of the genome-wide distribution of selection coefficients for heterozygous PTVs and corresponding Bayesian estimates for individual genes. The strength of selection can help discriminate the severity, age of onset, and mode of inheritance in Mendelian exome sequencing cases. We find that genes under the strongest selection are enriched in embryonic lethal mouse knockouts, putatively cell-essential genes inferred from human tumor cells, Mendelian disease genes, and regulators of transcription. Using an essentiality screen, we find a large set of genes under strong selection that are likely to have critical function but that have not yet been studied extensively.",

Using this method, we explored the relative efficacy of six bactericidal and three bacteriostatic antibiotics to inhibit the growth and kill Staphylococcus aureus colonies of different sizes, densities and ages. As measured by the reduction in viable cell density relative to untreated controls, of the bactericidal drugs tested ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were most effective. By this criteria, ampicillin was more effective than oxacillin. Daptomycin and vancomycin were virtually ineffective for treating S. aureus growing as colonies. The bacteriostatic antibiotic tested, tetracycline, linezolid and erythromycin were all able to prevent the growth of S. aureus colonies and did so even more effectively than daptomycin, which is highly bactericidal in liquid culture. The results of these experiments and other observations suggest that relative inefficacy of oxacillin, vancomycin and daptomycin to kill S. aureus in colonies is due to the density and physiological state of the bacteria rather than the inability of these drugs to penetrate the colonies.

    "abstract": "Modern genomics techniques generate overwhelming quantities of data. Extracting population genetic variation demands computationally efficient methods to determine genetic relatedness between individuals or samples in an unbiased manner, preferably de novo. The rapid and unbiased estimation of genetic relatedness has the potential to overcome reference genome bias, to detect mix-ups early, and to verify that biological replicates belong to the same genetic lineage before conclusions are drawn using mislabelled, or misidentified samples.\\n\\nWe present the k-mer Weighted Inner Product (kWIP), an assembly-, and alignment-free estimator of genetic similarity. kWIP combines a probabilistic data structure with a novel metric, the weighted inner product (WIP), to efficiently calculate pairwise similarity between sequencing runs from their k-mer counts. It produces a distance matrix, which can then be further analysed and visualised. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the underlying genomes and applications include detecting sample identity and mix-up, non-obvious genomic variation, and population structure.\\n\\nWe show that kWIP can reconstruct the true relatedness between samples from simulated populations. By re-analysing several published datasets we show that our results are consistent with marker-based analyses. kWIP is written in C++, licensed under the GNU GPL, and is available from https://github.com/kdmurray91/kwip.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCurrent analysis of the genetic similarity of samples is overly dependent on alignment to reference genomes, which are often unavailable and in any case can introduce bias. We address this limitation by implementing an efficient alignment free sequence comparison algorithm (kWIP). The fast, unbiased analysis kWIP performs should be conducted in preliminary stages of any analysis to verify experimental designs and sample metadata, catching catastrophic errors earlier.\\n\\nkWIP extends alignment-free sequence comparison methods by operating directly on sequencing reads. kWIP uses an entropy-weighted inner product over k-mers as a estimator of genetic relatedness. We validate kWIP using rigorous simulation experiments. We also demonstrate high sensitivity and accuracy even where there is modest divergence between genomes, and/or when sequencing coverage is low. We show high sensitivity in replicate detection, and faithfully reproduce published reports of population structure and stratification of microbiomes. We provide a reproducible workflow for replicating our validation experiments.\\n\\nkWIP is an efficient, open source software package. Our software is well documented and cross platform, and tutorial-style workflows are provided for new users.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) studies have highlighted how visual experience influences the brains functional architecture. Reduced RSFC coupling between occipital (visual) and temporal (auditory) regions has been reliably observed in early blind individuals (EB) at rest. In contrast, task-dependent activation studies have repeatedly demonstrated enhanced co-activation and connectivity of occipital and temporal regions during auditory processing in EB. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, the functional coupling between temporal and occipital networks at rest was directly compared to that of an auditory task in both EB and sighted controls (SC). Functional brain clusters shared across groups and cognitive states (rest and auditory task) were defined. In EBs, we observed higher occipito-temporal correlations in activity during the task than at rest. The reverse pattern was observed in SC. We also observed higher temporal variability of occipito-temporal RSFC in EB suggesting that occipital regions in this population may play a role of multiple demand system. Our study reveals how the connectivity profile of sighted and early blind people is differentially influenced by their cognitive state, bridging the gap between previous task-dependent and RSFC studies. Our results also highlight how inferring group-differences in functional brain architecture solely based on resting-state acquisition has to be considered with caution.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIOccipito-temporal functional connectivity is modified by cognitive states.\\nC_LIO_LIThis modulation is different in blind and sighted individuals.\\nC_LIO_LIBlind participants have higher occipito-temporal temporal variability at rest.\\nC_LIO_LIThe group difference in variability at rest explains the differences in modulation.\\nC_LIO_LIInferring group differences with resting-state data should be subject to caution.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The methods proposed for the detection of cancer driver mutations are based on the estimation of background mutation rate, impact on protein function, or network influence. Instead, we focus on those influencing patient survival. For this, an approximation of the log-rank test has been systematically applied even though it assumes a large and similar number of patients in both risk groups, which is violated in cancer genomics. Here, we propose VALORATE, a novel algorithm for the estimation of the null distribution for the log-rank test independently of the number of mutations. VALORATE is based on conditional distributions of the co-occurrences between events and mutations. The results using simulations, comparisons with other methods, TCGA and ICGC cancer datasets, and validations, suggests that VALORATE is accurate, fast, and can identify known and novel gene mutations. Our proposal and results may have important implications in cancer biology, in bioinformatics analyses, and ultimately in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of neuroplasticity following stroke is predominantly based on neuroimaging measures that cannot address the subsecond neurodynamics of impaired language processing. We combined behavioral and electrophysiological measures and structural-connectivity estimates to characterize neuroplasticity underlying successful compensation of language abilities after left-hemispheric stroke. We recorded the electroencephalogram from patients with stroke lesions to the left temporal lobe and matched controls during context-driven word retrieval. Participants heard lead-in sentences that either constrained the final word (\\\"He locked the door with the\\\") or not (\\\"She walked in here with the\\\"). The last word was shown as a picture to be named. We conducted individual-participant analyses and focused on oscillatory power as a subsecond indicator of a brain region's functional neurophysiological computations. All participants named pictures faster following constrained than unconstrained sentences, except for two patients, who had extensive damage to the left temporal lobe. Left-lateralized alpha-beta oscillatory power decreased in controls pre-picture presentation for constrained relative to unconstrained contexts. In patients, the alpha-beta power decreases were observed with the same time course as in controls but were lateralized to the intact right hemisphere. The right lateralization depended on the probability of white-matter connections between the bilateral temporal lobes. The two patients who performed poorly behaviorally showed no alpha-beta power decreases. Our findings suggest that incorporating direct measures of neural activity into investigations of neuroplasticity can provide important neural markers to help predict language recovery, assess the progress of neurorehabilitation, and delineate targets for therapeutic neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Downstream of gene expression, effectors such as the actomyosin contractile machinery drive embryo morphogenesis. During Drosophila embryonic axis extension, actomyosin has a specific planar-polarised organisation, which is responsible for oriented cell intercalation. In addition to these cell rearrangements, cell shape changes also contribute to tissue deformation. While cell-autonomous dynamics are well described, understanding the tissue-scale behaviour challenges us to solve the corresponding mechanical problem at the scale of the whole embryo, since mechanical resistance of all neighbouring epithelia will feedback on individual cells. Here we propose a novel numerical approach to compute the whole-embryo dynamics of the actomyosin-rich apical epithelial surface. We input in the model specific patterns of actomyosin contractility, such as the planar-polarisation of actomyosin in defined ventro-lateral regions of the embryo. Tissue strain rates and displacements are then predicted over the whole embryo surface according to the global balance of stresses and the material behaviour of the epithelium. Epithelia are modelled using a rheological law that relates the rate of deformation to the local stresses and actomyosin anisotropic contractility. Predicted flow patterns are consistent with the cell flows observed when imaging Drosophila axis extension in toto, using light sheet microscopy. The agreement between model and experimental data indicates that the anisotropic contractility of planar-polarised actomyosin in the ventro-lateral germband tissue can directly cause the tissue-scale deformations of the whole embryo. The three-dimensional mechanical balance is dependent on the geometry of the embryo, whose curved surface is taken into account in the simulations. Importantly, we find that to reproduce experimental flows, the model requires the presence of the cephalic furrow, a fold located anteriorly of the extending tissues. The presence of this geometric feature, through the global mechanical balance, guides the flow and orients extension towards the posterior end.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe morphogenesis of living organisms is a facinating process during which a genetic programme controls a sequence of molecular changes which will cause the original embryo to acquire a new shape. While we have a growing knowledge of the timing and spatial distribution of key molecules downstream of genetic programmes, there remain gaps of understanding on how these patterns can generate the appropriate mechanical force, so as to deform the tissues in the correct manner. In this paper, we show how a model of tissue mechanics can link the known pattern of actomyosin distribution in Drosophila tissues to the process of axis extension, which is a ubiquitous morphogenetic movement of developing animal embryos. We show in numerical simulations that the correct movement is obtained only if the geometry of the embryo presents some precise features. This means that prior morphogenetic movements responsible for these features need to have succeeded in order to carry on the next round of morphogenesis. This highlights the contribution of mechanical feedback on the morphogenetic programme and also how mechanical action integrates at the scale of the whole embryo.",

    "abstract": "Synaesthesia is a developmental condition involving cross-communication between sensory modalities or substreams whereby an inducer (e.g. a sound) automatically evokes a concurrent percept in another modality (e.g. a colour). Whether this condition arises due to atypical structural connectivity (e.g., between normally unconnected cortical areas) or altered neurochemistry remains a central question. We report the exceptional cases of two synaesthetes - subjects AB and CD - both of whom experience coloured auras around individuals, as well as coloured perceptions in response to music. Both subjects have, in recent years, suffered a complete loss or reduction of their synaesthetic experiences, one (AB) through successive head traumas, including a lightning strike, followed by a number of medications, and the other (CD) while taking anxiolytic medications. Using semi-structured interviews and data from the Synaesthesia Battery and a colourpicker task, we characterise the phenomenological characteristics of their pre-loss synaesthesia, as well as the subsequent restoration of each subject's synaesthetic experiences (in the months post-trauma for AB, and after cessation of medication for CD). Even after years of suppression, the patterns of associations were highly consistent with those experienced pre-injury. The phenomenological experience of synaesthesia can, thus, like most conscious experiences, be modulated by pharmacologically diverse medications or head injury. However, the underlying neural substrates mediating specific synaesthetic pairings appear remarkably \\\"hard-wired\\\" and can persist over very long periods even under conditions that alter or completely suppress the conscious synaesthetic experience itself.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for analyzing environmental DNA and provides the comprehensive molecular view of microbial communities. For obtaining the copy number of particular sequences in the NGS library, however, additional quantitative analysis as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or digital PCR (dPCR) is required. Furthermore, number of sequences in a sequence library does not always reflect the original copy number of a target gene because of biases caused by PCR amplification, making it difficult to convert the proportion of particular sequences in the NGS library to the copy number using the mass of input DNA. To address this issue, we applied stochastic labeling approach with random-tag sequences and developed a NGS-based quantification protocol, which enables simultaneous sequencing and quantification of the targeted DNA. This quantitative sequencing (qSeq) is initiated from single-primer extension (SPE) using a primer with random tag adjacent to the 5 end of target-specific sequence. During SPE, each DNA molecule is stochastically labeled with the random tag. Subsequently, first-round PCR is conducted, specifically targeting the SPE product, followed by second-round PCR to index for NGS. The number of random tags is only determined during the SPE step and is therefore not affected by the two rounds of PCR that may introduce amplification biases. In the case of 16S rRNA genes, after NGS sequencing and taxonomic classification, the absolute number of target phylotypes 16S rRNA gene can be estimated by Poisson statistics by counting random tags incorporated at the end of sequence. To test the feasibility of this approach, the 16S rRNA gene of Sulfolobus tokodaii was subjected to qSeq, which resulted in accurate quantification of 5.0 x 103 to 5.0 x 104 copies of the 16S rRNA gene. Furthermore, qSeq was applied to mock microbial communities and environmental samples, and the results were comparable to those obtained using digital PCR and relative abundance based on a standard sequence library. We demonstrated that the qSeq protocol proposed here is advantageous for providing less-biased absolute copy numbers of each target DNA with NGS sequencing at one time. By this new experiment scheme in microbial ecology, microbial community compositions can be explored in more quantitative manner, thus expanding our knowledge of microbial ecosystems in natural environments.",
