    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and other functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators involved in multiple biological processes. Recently, ncRNA control of gene expression has been identified as a critical regulatory mechanism in the immune system. Despite the great efforts made to discover and characterize ncRNAs, the functional role for most remains unknown. To facilitate discoveries in ncRNA regulation of immune system-related processes we developed the database of immunologically relevant ncRNAs and target genes (IRNdb). We integrated mouse data on predicted and experimentally supported ncRNA-target interactions, ncRNA and gene annotations, biological pathways and processes, and experimental data in a uniform format with a user-friendly web interface. The current version of IRNdb documents 12,930 experimentally supported miRNA-target interactions between 724 miRNAs and 2,427 immune-related murine targets. In addition, we recorded 22,453 lncRNA-immune target and 377 PIWI-interacting RNA-immune target interactions. IRNdb is a comprehensive searchable data repository which will be of help in studying the role of ncRNAs in the immune system.\\n\\nDatabase URL: http://irndb.org",

    "abstract": "The site frequency spectrum (SFS) has long been used to study demographic history and natural selection. Here, we extend this summary by examining the SFS conditional on the alleles found at the same site in other species. We refer to this extension as the \\\"phylogenetically-conditioned SFS\\\" or cSFS. Using recent large-sample data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), combined with primate genome sequences, we find that human variants that occurred independently in closely related primate lineages are at higher frequencies in humans than variants with parallel substitutions in more distant primates. We show that this effect is largely due to sites with elevated mutation rates causing significant departures from the widely-used infinite sites mutation model. Our analysis also suggests substantial variation in mutation rates even among mutations involving the same nucleotide changes. We additionally find evidence for epistatic effects on the cSFS: namely, that parallel primate substitutions at nonsynonymous sites are more informative about constraint in humans when the parallel substitution occurs in a closely related species. In summary, we show that variable mutation rates and local sequence context are important determinants of the SFS in humans.",

    "abstract": "The study of fitness landscapes, which aims at mapping genotypes to fitness, is receiving ever-increasing attention. Novel experimental approaches combined with NGS methods enable accurate and extensive studies of the fitness effects of mutations - allowing us to test theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of the shape of the true underlying fitness landscape, and its implications for the predictability and repeatability of evolution.\\n\\nHere, we present a uniquely large multi-allelic fitness landscape comprised of 640 engineered mutants that represent all possible combinations of 13 amino-acid changing mutations at six sites in the heat-shock protein Hsp90 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under elevated salinity. Despite a prevalent pattern of negative epistasis in the landscape, we find that the global fitness peak is reached via four positively epistatic mutations. Combining traditional and extending recently proposed theoretical and statistical approaches, we quantify features of the global multi-allelic fitness landscape. Using subsets of the data, we demonstrate that extrapolation beyond a known part of the landscape is difficult owing to both local ruggedness and amino-acid specific epistatic hotspots, and that inference is additionally confounded by the non-random choice of mutations for experimental fitness landscapes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe study of fitness landscapes is fundamentally concerned with understanding the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in adaptive evolution. Here, the authors present a uniquely large and complete multi-allelic intragenic fitness landscape of 640 systematically engineered mutations in yeast Hsp90. Using a combination of traditional and recently proposed theoretical approaches, they study the accessibility of the global fitness peak, and the potential for predictability of the fitness landscape topography. They report local ruggedness of the landscape and the existence of epistatic hotspot mutations, which together make extrapolation and hence predictability inherently difficult, if mutation-specific information is not considered.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal gamma-band synchronization shapes information flow during sensory and cognitive processing. A common view is that a stable and shared frequency over time is required for robust and functional synchronization. To the contrary, we found that non-stationary instantaneous frequency modulations were essential for synchronization. First, we recorded gamma rhythms in monkey visual area V1, and found that they synchronized by continuously modulating their frequency difference in a phase-dependent manner. The frequency modulation properties regulated both the phase-locking and the preferred phase-relation between gamma rhythms. Second, our experimental observations were in agreement with a biophysical model of gamma rhythms and were accurately predicted by the theory of weakly coupled oscillators revealing the underlying theoretical principles that govern gamma synchronization. Thus, synchronization through instantaneous frequency modulations represents a fundamental principle of gamma-band neural coordination that is likely generalizable to other brain rhythms.",

We further show that a genetically defined subtype of ASD, Duplication 15q Syndrome, shares the core transcriptomic signature of idiopathic ASD, indicating that observed molecular convergence in autism brain is the likely consequence of manifold genetic alterations.

    "abstract": "Bacteria often live in biofilms, which are microbial communities surrounded by a secreted extracellular matrix. Here, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency, in competition with matrix mutants, wild type cells always increase in relative abundance in straight-tunnel microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast, in microenvironments with complex, irregular flow profiles - which are common in natural environments - wild type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers, which generates regions of near-zero flow speed that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate. Our findings connect the evolutionary stability of matrix production with the hydrodynamics and spatial structure of the surrounding environment, providing a potential explanation for the variation in biofilm matrix secretion observed among bacteria in natural environments.\\n\\nImpact StatementThe feedback between hydrodynamic flow conditions and biofilm spatial architecture drives competition in P. aeruginosa biofilms, and can explain the variation in biofilm production observed among bacteria in natural environments.",

In this research we analyzed the differences between avian and human cognition. Twelve Greek listeners and four Zebra finches were tested in speech category learning tasks. In particular, both humans and Zebra finches had to categorize between Dutch vowels that differ on duration, frequency or both depending on the condition. Feedback was given for correct and incorrect responses. The results showed that humans and Zebra finches are probably using the same methods of learning depending on the categorization tasks that they are exposed to.

We developed many of these in the course of a large scale whole genome deep sequencing study of HIV-1 populations. We measured the substitution and indel errors that arose during sequencing and PCR and quantified PCR-mediated recombination.

In the present study, we evaluated the ability of physiological parameters (Transpiration, E; Fv/Fm; leaf water potential, {psi}leaf; leaf temperature, LT; and, leaf relative water content, RWC) to distinguish between contrasting Z. mauritiana clones subjected to a 30-d drought cycle. Four field-grown clones Seb and Gola (tetraploid) and Q 29 and B 5/4 (diploid) were studied. By 30 d after the onset of water stress treatment, the E, Fv/Fm, {psi}leaf and RWC of drought-stressed plants had declined significantly in all genotypes compared to values of well-watered treatments. However, the reductions were more severe in leaves of diploid clones. Under drought stress, the Seb and Gola, maintained higher E (31.5%), Fv/Fm (6.28%), {psi}leaf; (11.2%), and RWC (9.3 %) than Q 29 and B 5/4 clones. In general, LT of drought-stressed plants was higher (~4{degrees}C) than that of well-watered plants but the relative increase was greater among later than former ones. Under maximum drought stress, LT of Seb and Gola clones was on average 3.0{degrees}C lower than that of Q 29 and B 5/4. Former clones yielded 20% more than later ones, mainly reason being (14.8%) less fruit drop as an effect of water stress. The results indicate that presented parameters can be reliable in screening for water stress tolerance ability, with Fv/Fm, {psi}leaf, RWC and LT having the added advantage of being easily and quickly assessed.",

    "abstract": "The reproductive biology of three Ziziphus species: Z. jujube, Z. mauritiana and Z. spina-christi, with respect to seasonal growth stages, floral biology, pollen performance, fruit set and seed viability were compared. To elucidate the reasons for variations in reproductive success we also estimated the ploidy levels among the genotypes of these tree species. Four genotypes of Z. mauritiana and Z. jujube each, and two natural selections of Z. spina-christi were grown in the Negev highlands at the Sde Boqer experimental plot. Field observations were conducted to determine seasonal growth stages and floral biology; laboratory studies included florescent microscopy, differential interference contrast microscopy, in vitro pollen germination and histological techniques. Seasonal growth stages were similar in Z. spina-christi and Z. mauritiana but distinct in Z. jujube, which was the earliest species. Flower opening stages were similar in all species and genotypes. Anthesis timing was genotype specific and did not depend on species. Anthesis types were subdivided into early and late morning as well as afternoon. We found a wide range of values for the number of flowers per inflorescence between species and genotypes, but all genotypes set one fruit per inflorescence with the exception of Z. jujube genotype Tamar, which set two fruit per inflorescence. Significant variation in fruit weight was observed between species as well as genotypes. Fruit of Z. mauritiana and Z jujube weighed between 9 to 37 g while fruit weight of Z. spina-christi was between 0.5 to 0.7 g. Flowers of all species and genotypes had two ovules but viable seed set per fruit differed dramatically between species under open pollination. Viable seed set was about 18% for Z. mauritiana and Z jujube, while Z. spina-christi, had the highest viable seed set at about 84%. Histological analysis revealed post fertilization embryo abortion which may be responsible for the relatively low reproductive success in Z. mauritiana and Z. jujube. The results obtained in this study provide an important basis for selecting elite complementary genotypes toward the optimization of Ziziphus fruit production in semi-arid regions.",

Although more than 58,000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterised. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detection of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevents their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. Here, we present \\\"RIblast\\\", an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",

Most importantly, different choices of Coulombs constant between programs are one of the largest sources of discrepancies in energies.

Here we combined both techniques by decomposing neural activity into multiple components, each representing a portion of the stimulus. We tested this hybrid approach on encephalographic responses to auditory and audiovisual narratives identically experienced across subjects, as well as uniquely experienced video game play. The highest stimulus-response correlations (SRC) were detected for dynamic visual features. During narratives both auditory and visual SRC were modulated by attention and tracked correlations between subjects. During video game play, SRC was modulated by task difficulty and attentional state. Importantly, the strongest component extracted for visual and auditory features had nearly identical spatial distributions, suggesting that the predominant encephalographic response to naturalistic stimuli is supramodal.

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause persistent pathological alteration of neurons. This may lead to cognitive dysfunctions, depression, and even increased susceptibility to life threatening diseases, such as epilepsy and Alzheimers Disease. To investigate the underlying genetic and molecular basis of TBI, Wasserman and colleagues developed an inexpensive and reproducible model for simulating TBI in Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit Fly). Using a modified version of this high impact trauma (HIT) device, we subjected w1118 fruit flies to mild closed head trauma. To determine the transcriptomic changes that contribute to survival post TBI, we collected fly heads from the survivors at 2 time points; 4 hours and 24 hours post-trauma. Mild TBI had limited impact on the steady state RNA levels but showed large perturbations in alternative splicing (AS) 24 hours post-trauma. Classification of these AS changes showed selective retention (RI) of long introns (>81bps), with a mean size of ~3000bps. Some of these RI genes also showed a significant reduction in transcript abundance and were specifically enriched in genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. The RI are enriched in ACACACA motifs known to bind to Smooth (SM), an hnRNPL class of splicing factor. Mutating SM (sm4/Df) resulted in reversal of RI observed 24 hours post-trauma, and in some cases, elimination of basal levels of RI in long introns. This observation suggests that SM is critical regulator of RI and that this process is enhanced by TBI. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) revealed increased levels of this histone modification in retained introns post-trauma. Consistent with this observation, mutations in lysine specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A), which de-methylate H3K36me3, increased RI in many of the same long introns affected by TBI. Additionally, higher H3K36me3 levels are observed around intronic SM-binding motifs post-trauma, suggesting interaction between H3K36me3 and SM binding to intronic splicing suppressor sites might be responsible for increasing RI of metabolic genes as a novel mechanism to improve survival after TBI.",

    "abstract": "As part of a broader collaborative network of exome sequencing studies, we developed a jointly called data set of 5,685 Ashkenazi Jewish exomes. We make publicly available a resource of site and allele frequencies, which should serve as a reference for medical genetics in the Ashkenazim. We estimate that 30% of protein-coding alleles present in the Ashkenazi Jewish population at frequencies greater than 0.2% are significantly more frequent (mean 7.6-fold) than their maximum frequency observed in other reference populations. Arising via a well-described founder effect, this catalog of enriched alleles can contribute to differences in genetic risk and overall prevalence of diseases between populations. As validation we document 151 AJ enriched protein-altering alleles that overlap with \\\"pathogenic\\\" ClinVar alleles, including those that account for 10-100 fold differences in prevalence between AJ and non-AJ populations of some rare diseases including Gaucher disease (GBA, p.Asn409Ser, 8-fold enrichment); Canavan disease (ASPA, p.Glu285Ala, 12-fold enrichment); and Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA, c.1421+1G>C, 27-fold enrichment; p.Tyr427IlefsTer5, 12-fold enrichment). We next sought to use this catalog, of well-established relevance to Mendelian disease, to explore Crohns disease, a common disease with an estimated two to four-fold excess prevalence in AJ. We specifically evaluate whether strong acting rare alleles, enriched by the same founder-effect, contribute excess genetic risk to Crohns disease in AJ, and find that ten rare genetic risk factors in NOD2 and LRRK2 are strongly enriched in AJ, including several novel contributing alleles, show evidence of association to CD. Independently, we find that genomewide common variant risk defined by GWAS shows a strong difference between AJ and non-AJ European control population samples (0.97 s.d. higher, p<10-16). Taken together, the results suggest coordinated selection in AJ population for higher CD risk alleles in general. The results and approach illustrate the value of exome sequencing data in case-control studies along with reference data sets like ExAC to pinpoint genetic variation that contributes to variable disease predisposition across populations.",

    "abstract": "Targeted enrichment of conserved genomic regions is a popular method for collecting large amounts of sequence data from non-model taxa for phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and population genetic studies. Yet, few open-source workflows are available to identify conserved genomic elements shared among divergent taxa and to design enrichment baits targeting these regions. These shortcomings limit the application of targeted enrichment methods to many organismal groups. Here, I describe a universal workflow for identifying conserved genomic regions in available genomic data and for designing targeted enrichment baits to collect data from these conserved regions. I demonstrate how this computational approach can be applied to diverse organismal groups by identifying sets of conserved loci and designing enrichment baits targeting thousands of these loci in the understudied arthropod groups Arachnida, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, or Lepidoptera. I then use in silico analyses to demonstrate that these conserved loci reconstruct the accepted relationships among genome sequences from the focal arthropod orders, and we perform in vitro validation of the Arachnid probe set as part of a separate manuscript (Starrett et al. Submitted). All of the documentation, design steps, software code, and probe sets developed here are available under an open-source license for restriction-free testing and use by any research group, and although the examples in this manuscript focus on understudied and exceptionally diverse arthropod groups, the software workflow is applicable to all organismal groups having some form of pre-existing genomic information.",

    "abstract": "Most fMRI experiments record the brains responses to samples of stimulus materials (e.g., faces or words). Yet the statistical modeling approaches used in fMRI research universally fail to model stimulus variability in a manner that affords population generalization--meaning that researchers conclusions technically apply only to the precise stimuli used in each study, and cannot be generalized to new stimuli. A direct consequence of this stimulus-as-fixed-effect fallacy is that the majority of published fMRI studies have likely overstated the strength of the statistical evidence they report. Here we develop a Bayesian mixed model (the random stimulus model; RSM) that addresses this problem, and apply it to a range of fMRI datasets. Results demonstrate considerable inflation (50 - 200 % in most of the studied datasets) of test statistics obtained from standard \\\"summary statistics\\\"-based approaches relative to the corresponding RSM models. We demonstrate how RSMs can be used to improve parameter estimates, properly control false positive rates, and test novel research hypotheses about stimulus-level variability in human brain responses.",

    "abstract": "Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important staple food crop in Africa and South America, however, ubiquitous deleterious mutations may severely reduce its fitness. To evaluate these deleterious mutations in the cassava genome, we constructed a cassava haplotype map using deep sequencing from 241 diverse accessions and identified over 28 million segregating variants. We found that, 1) while domestication modified starch and ketone metabolism pathways for human consumption, the concomitant bottleneck and clonal propagation resulted in a large proportion of fixed deleterious amino acid changes, raised the number of deleterious mutations by 26%, and shifted the mutational burden towards common variants; 2) deleterious mutations are ineffectively purged due to limited recombination in cassava genome; 3) recent breeding efforts maintained the yield by masking the most damaging recessive mutations in the heterozygous state, but unable to purge the mutation burden, which should be a key target for future cassava breeding.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed the noninvasive study of task-based and resting-state brain dynamics in humans by inferring neural activity from blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes. An accurate interpretation of the hemodynamic changes that underlie fMRI signals depends on the understanding of the quantitative relationship between changes in neural activity and changes in cerebral blood flow, oxygenation and volume. While there has been extensive study of neurovascular coupling in anesthetized animal models, anesthesia causes large disruptions of brain metabolism, neural responsiveness and cardiovascular function. Here, we review work showing that neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal are profoundly different from those in the anesthetized state. We argue that the time is right to study neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal to bridge the physiological mechanisms that underlie animal and human neuroimaging signals, and to interpret them in light of underlying neural mechanisms. Lastly, we discuss recent experimental innovations that have enabled the study of neurovascular coupling and brain-wide circuit function in un-anesthetized and behaving animal models.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the functional consequences of protein variants can reveal how a protein works or help unlock the meaning of an individuals genome. Deep mutational scanning is a widely used method for multiplex measurement of the functional consequences of protein variants. A major limitation of this method has been the lack of a common analysis framework. We developed a statistical model for estimating variant scores that can be applied to many experimental designs. Our method generates an error estimate for each score that captures both sampling error and consistency between replicates. We apply our model to one novel and five published datasets comprising 243,732 variants and demonstrate its superiority, particularly for removing noisy variants, detecting variants of small effect, and conducting hypothesis testing. We implemented our model in easy-to-use software, Enrich2, that can empower researchers analyzing deep mutational scanning data.",
