    "abstract": "In the dawning era of large-scale biomedical data, multidimensional phenotype vectors will play an increasing role in examining the genetic underpinnings of brain features, behavior and disease. For example, shape measurements derived from brain MRI scans are multidimensional geometric descriptions of brain structure and provide an alternate class of phenotypes that remains largely unexplored in genetic studies. Here we extend the concept of heritability to multidimensional traits, and present the first comprehensive analysis of the heritability of neuroanatomical shape measurements across an ensemble of brain structures based on genome-wide SNP and MRI data from 1,320 unrelated, young and healthy individuals. We replicate our findings in an extended twin sample from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our results demonstrate that neuroanatomical shape can be significantly heritable, above and beyond volume, and can serve as a complementary phenotype to study the genetic determinants and clinical relevance of brain structure.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAccurate identification of genotypes is critical in identifying de novo mutations, linking mutations with disease, and determining mutation rates. Because de novo mutations are rare, even low levels of genotyping error can cause a large fraction of false positive de novo mutations. Biological and technical processes that adversely affect genotyping include copy-number-variation, paralogous sequences, library preparation, sequencing error, and reference-mapping biases, among others.\\n\\nResultsWe modeled the read depth for all data as a mixture of Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, resulting in significant improvements over previously used models. In most cases the best model was comprised of two distributions. The major-component distribution is similar to a binomial distribution with low error and low reference bias. The minor-component distribution is overdispersed with higher error and reference bias. We also found that sites fitting the minor component are enriched for copy number variants and low complexity region. We expect that this approach to modeling the distribution of NGS data, will lead to improved genotyping. For example, this approach provides an expected distribution of reads that can be incorporated into a model to estimate de novo mutations using reads across a pedigree.\\n\\nAvailabilityMethods and data files are available at https://github.com/CartwrightLab/WuEtAl2016/.\\n\\nContactcartwright@asu.edu",

Strikingly, however, satellite cells, the adult muscle stem cells that are essential for the regeneration of damaged muscles in vertebrates, have not been reported in invertebrates. In this study we show role of Muscle stem cells (Gunage et al., 2014) identified in a previous study, in muscle regeneration. We show that muscle stem cells lineal descendants are present in adult muscle as small, unfused cells located superficially and in close proximity to the mature muscle fibers. Normally quiescent cells, following muscle fiber injury become mitotically active, engage in Notch-Delta signaling-dependent proliferative activity and generate lineal descendant populations, which fuse with the injured muscle fiber. In view of their strikingly similar morphological and functional features, we consider these novel cells to be Drosophila muscle satellite cells",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular signatures identified from high-throughput transcriptomic studies often have poor reliability and fail to reproduce across studies. One solution is to combine independent studies into a single integrative analysis, additionally increasing sample size. However, the different protocols and technological platforms across transcriptomic studies produce unwanted systematic variation that strongly confounds the integrative analysis results. When studies aim to discriminate an outcome of interest, the common approach is a sequential two-step procedure; unwanted systematic variation removal techniques are applied prior to classification methods.\\n\\nResultsTo limit the risk of overfitting and over-optimistic results of a two-step procedure, we developed a novel multivariate integration method, MINT, that simultaneously accounts for unwanted systematic variation and identifies predictive gene signatures with greater reproducibility and accuracy. In two biological examples on the classification of three human cell types and four subtypes of breast cancer, we combined high-dimensional microarray and RNA-seq data sets and MINT identified highly reproducible and relevant gene signatures predictive of a given phenotype. MINT led to superior classification and prediction accuracy compared to the existing sequential two-step procedures.\\n\\nConclusionsMINT is a powerful approach and the first of its kind to solve the integrative classification framework in a single step by combining multiple independent studies.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary history of vertebrates is marked by three ancient whole-genome duplications: two successive rounds in the ancestor of vertebrates, and a third one specific to teleost fishes. Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for specific genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebrafish and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in non-renewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampus stores spatial representations, or maps, which are recalled each time a subject is placed in the corresponding environment. Across different environments of similar geometry, these representations show strong orthogonality in CA3 of hippocampus, whereas in the CA1 subfield a considerable overlap between the maps can be seen. The lower orthogonality decreases reliability of various decoders developed in an attempt to identify which of the stored maps is active at the mo-ment. Especially, the problem with decoding emerges with a need to analyze data at high temporal resolution. Here, we introduce a functional-connectivity-based de-coder, which accounts for the pairwise correlations between the spiking activities of neurons in each map and does not require any positional information, i.e. any knowledge about place fields. We first show, on recordings of hippocampal activity in constant environmental conditions, that our decoder outperforms existing decoding methods in CA1. Our decoder is then applied to data from teleportation experiments, in which an instantaneous switch between the environment identity triggers a recall of the corresponding spatial representation. We test the sensitivity of our approach on the transition dynamics between the respective memory states (maps). We find that the rate of spontaneous state shifts (flickering) after a teleportation event is increased not only within the first few seconds as already reported, but this instability is sustained across much longer (> 1 min.) periods.",

We have used a common model framework for gene expression where both motif structures have an activating input and repressing regulator, with the same set of parameters to enable comparison of the responses. We studied the global sensitivity of the system properties such as steady-state gain, overshoot, peak time, and peak duration, to parameters. We find that, in all motifs, overshoot correlated negatively whereas peak duration varied concavely, with peak time. Differences in other system properties were found to be mainly dependent on the the nature of the regulator, than the motif structure. Protein mediated motifs showed a higher degree of adaptation; feedforward motifs exhibited perfect adaptation. RNA mediated motifs had a mild regulatory effect; they also exhibited lower peaking tendency and mean overshoot. Protein mediated feedforward motifs showed higher overshoot and lower peak time compared to corresponding feedback motifs.",

    "abstract": "Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence, but the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial, due to a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic evolution. Army ants are ecologically dominant arthropod predators of the world's tropics, with large nomadic colonies housing diverse communities of socially parasitic myrmecophiles. Remarkable among these are many species of rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking \\\"myrmecoid\\\" body forms and are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts' societies: emigrating with colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with workers, but also consuming the brood. Here we demonstrate that myrmecoid rove beetles are strongly polyphyletic, with this novel adaptive morphological and behavioral syndrome having evolved at least twelve times during the evolution of a single staphylinid subfamily, Aleocharinae. Each independent myrmecoid clade is restricted to one zoogeographic region and highly host-specific on a single army ant genus. Dating estimates reveal that myrmecoid clades are separated by substantial phylogenetic distances--as much as 105 million years (My). All such groups arose in parallel during the Cenozoic, as army ants are proposed to have risen to ecological dominance. This work uncovers a rare example of an ancient system of complex morphological and behavioral convergence, with replicate beetle lineages following a predictable phenotypic trajectory during their parasitic coevolution with army ants.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with  multiband sequences is now relatively widespread. These sequences can be used to dramatically reduce the repetition time (TR) and produce a time-series sampled at a higher temporal resolution. We tested the effects of higher temporal resolutions for fMRI on statistical outcome measures in a comprehensive manner on two different MRI scanner platforms. Experiment 1 tested a range of acceleration factors (1-6) against a standard EPI sequence on a single composite task that maps a number of basic sensory, motor, and cognitive networks. Experiment 2 compared the standard sequence with acceleration factors of 2 and 3 on both resting-state and two task paradigms (an N-back task, and faces/places task), with a number of different analysis approaches. Results from experiment 1 showed modest but relatively inconsistent effects of the higher sampling rate on statistical outcome measures. Experiment 2 showed strong benefits of the multiband sequences on results derived from resting-state data, but more varied effects on results from the task paradigms. Notably, the multiband sequences were superior when Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis was used to interrogate the faces/places data, but showed less benefit in conventional General Linear Model analyses of the same data. In general, ROI-derived measures of statistical effects benefitted relatively little from higher sampling resolution, with decrements even seen in one task (N-back). Across both experiments, results from the two scanner platforms were broadly comparable. The statistical benefits of high temporal resolution fMRI with multiband sequences may therefore depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the investigation (resting-state vs. task-based), the experimental design, the particular statistical outcome measure, and the type of analysis used. Higher sampling rates in fMRI are not a panacea, and it is recommended that researchers use multiband acquisition sequences conservatively.",

Therefore, it is crucial to utilize extraction protocols that retrieve short DNA molecules. Improvements in extraction and library preparation protocols for animal remains have allowed efficient retrieval of molecules shorter than 50 bp. We adapted those improvements to extraction protocols for herbarium specimens and evaluated their performance by shotgun sequencing, which allows an accurate estimation of the distribution of fragment lengths. Extraction with PTB buffer decreased median fragment length by 35% when compared to CTAB. Modifying the binding conditions of DNA to silica allowed for an additional decrease of 10%. We did not observe a further decrease in length when we used single-stranded instead of double-stranded library preparation methods. Our protocol enables the retrieval of ultrashort molecules from herbarium specimens and will help to unlock the genetic information stored in herbaria.",

    "abstract": "For nearly 100 years, Growth Hormone (GH) has been known to impact insulin sensitivity and risk of diabetes. However, the tissue governing the effects of GH signaling on insulin and glucose homeostasis remains unknown. Excess GH reduces fat mass and insulin sensitivity. Conversely, GH insensitivity (GHI) is associated with increased adiposity, augmented insulin sensitivity, and protection from diabetes. Here we induce adipocyte-specific GHI through conditional deletion of Jak2 (JAK2A), an obligate transducer of GH signaling. Similar to whole-body GHI, JAK2A mice had increased adiposity and extreme insulin sensitivity. Loss of adipocyte Jak2 augmented hepatic insulin sensitivity and conferred resistance to diet-induced metabolic stress without overt changes in circulating fatty acids. While GH injections induced hepatic insulin resistance in control mice, the diabetogenic action was absent in JAK2A mice. Adipocyte GH signaling directly impinged on both adipose and hepatic insulin signal transduction. Collectively, our results show that adipose tissue governs the effects of GH on insulin and glucose homeostasis. Further, we show that JAK2 mediates liver insulin sensitivity via an extra-hepatic, adipose tissue-dependent mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic changes in biological systems can be captured by measuring molecular expression from different levels (e.g., genes and proteins) across time. Integration of such data aims to identify molecules that show similar expression changes over time; such molecules may be co-regulated and thus involved in similar biological processes. Combining data sources presents a systematic approach to study molecular behaviour. It can compensate for missing data in one source, and can reduce false positives when multiple sources highlight the same pathways. However, integrative approaches must accommodate the challenges inherent in  omics data, including high-dimensionality, noise, and timing differences in expression. As current methods for identification of co-expression cannot cope with this level of complexity, we developed a novel algorithm called DynOmics. DynOmics is based on the fast Fourier transform, from which the difference in expression initiation between trajectories can be estimated. This delay can then be used to realign the trajectories and identify those which show a high degree of correlation. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that DynOmics is efficient and accurate compared to existing approaches. We consider two case studies highlighting its application, identifying regulatory relationships across  omics data within an organism and for comparative gene expression analysis across organisms.",

Activity in this \\\"Multiple Demand (MD)\\\" network scales with comprehension difficulty, but also with cognitive effort across a wide range of non-linguistic tasks in a domain-general fashion. Given the functional dissociation between the language and MD networks, their respective contributions to comprehension are likely distinct, yet such differences remain elusive.

Here, we used fMRI to directly test this assumption by comparing the BOLD signal time-courses in each network across different people listening to the same story. Language network activity showed fewer individual differences, indicative of closer input tracking, whereas MD network activity was more idiosyncratic and, moreover, showed lower reliability within an individual across repetitions of a story. These findings constrain cognitive models of language comprehension by suggesting a novel distinction between the processes implemented in the language and MD networks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLanguage comprehension recruits both language-specific mechanisms and domain-general mechanisms that are engaged in many cognitive processes. In the human cortex, language-selective mechanisms are implemented in the left-lateralized \\\"core language network\\\", whereas domain-general mechanisms are implemented in the bilateral \\\"Multiple Demand (MD)\\\" network. Here, we report the first direct comparison of the respective contributions of these networks to naturalistic story comprehension. Using a novel combination of neuroimaging approaches we find that MD regions track stories less closely than language regions. This finding constrains the possible contributions of the MD network to comprehension, contrasts with accounts positing that this network has continuous access to linguistic input, and suggests a new typology of comprehension processes based on their extent of input tracking.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria adapt to changes in their environment by regulating gene expression, often at the level of transcription. However, since the molecular processes underlying gene regulation are subject to thermodynamic and other stochastic fluctuations, gene expression is inherently noisy, and identical cells in a homogeneous environment can display highly heterogeneous expression levels. To study how stochasticity affects gene regulation at the single-cell level, it is crucial to be able to directly follow gene expression dynamics in single cells under changing environmental conditions. Recently developed microfluidic devices, used in combination with quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, represent a highly promising experimental approach, allowing tracking of lineages of single cells over long time-scales while simultaneously measuring their growth and gene expression. However, current devices do not allow controlled dynamical changes to the environmental conditions which are needed to study gene regulation. In addition, automated analysis of the imaging data from such devices is still highly challenging and no standard software is currently available. To address these challenges, we here present an integrated experimental and computational setup featuring, on the one hand, a new dual-input microfluidic chip which allows mixing and switching between two growth media and, on the other hand, a novel image analysis software which jointly optimizes segmentation and tracking of the cells and allows interactive user-guided fine-tuning of its results. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we study the lac operon regulation in E. coli cells grown in an environment that switches between glucose and lactose, and quantify stochastic lag times and memory at the single cell level.",

With the increasing availability of whole genome sequences (WGS) for pathogens, it is important to establish whether GWAS of viral genomes could reveal important biological insights. Here we perform the first proof of concept viral GWAS examining drug resistance (DR), a phenotype with well understood genetics.\\n\\nWe performed a GWAS of DR in a sample of 343 HIV subtype C patients failing 1st line antiretroviral treatment in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The majority and minority variants within each sequence were called using PILON, and GWAS was performed within PLINK. HIV WGS from patients failing on different antiretroviral treatments were compared to sequences derived from individuals naive to the respective treatment.\\n\\nGWAS methodology was validated by identifying five associations on a genetic level that led to amino acid changes known to cause DR. Further, we highlighted the ability of GWAS to identify epistatic effects, identifying two replicable variants within amino acid 68 of the reverse transcriptase protein previously described as potential fitness compensatory mutations. A possible additional DR variant within amino acid 91 of the matrix region of the Gag protein was associated with tenofovir failure, highlighting the ability of GWAS to identify variants outside classical candidate genes. Our results also suggest a polygenic component to DR.\\n\\nThese results validate the applicability of GWAS to HIV WGS data even in relative small samples, and emphasise how high throughput sequencing can provide novel and clinically relevant insights. Further they suggested that for viruses like HIV, population structure was only minor concern compared to that seen in bacteria or parasite GWAS. Given the small genome length and reduced burden for multiple testing, this makes HIV an ideal candidate for GWAS.",

Phylogenetic analysis clearly places this as a species of G. sulphuraria.

We have therefore investigated the presence of miRNAs and the necessary miRNA biogenesis machinery in a large group of unicellular relatives of animals, Ichthyosporea. By small RNA sequencing we find evidence for at least four genes in the genus Sphaeroforma that satisfy the criteria for the annotation of animal miRNA genes. Three of these miRNAs are conserved and expressed across sphaeroformid species. Furthermore, we identify homologues of the animal miRNA biogenesis genes across a wide range of ichthyosporeans, including Drosha and Pasha which make up the animal specific Microprocessor complex. Taken together we report the first evidence for bona fide miRNA genes and the presence of the miRNA-processing pathway in unicellular Choanozoa, implying that the origin of animal miRNAs and the Microprocessor complex predates multicellular animals.",

Numerous candidate equation types (development functions) exist to describe the effect of temperature on development time, yet most studies use only a single type of equation and there is no consensus as to which, if any model predicts development rates better than the others, nor what the consequences of selecting a potentially incorrect model equation are on predicted development times. In this study, a literature search was performed of studies fitting development functions to development of arthropod larvae (99 species). The published data of most (79) of these species were then fit with 33 commonly-used development functions. Overall performance of each function type and consequences of using a function other than the best one to model data were assessed. Performance was also related to taxonomy and the range of temperatures examined. The majority (91.1 %) of studies were found to not use the best function out of those tested. Using the incorrect model lead to significantly less accurate (e.g., mean difference {+/-} SE 85.9 {+/-} 27.4 %, range: -1.7 to 1725.5 %) predictions of development times than the best function. Overall, more complex functions performed poorly relative to simpler ones. However, performance of some complex functions improved when wide temperature ranges were tested, which tended to be confined to studies of insects or arachnids compared with those of crustaceans.

    "abstract": "Localised mRNA translation is a widespread mechanism for targeting protein synthesis, important for cell fate, motility and pathogenesis. In Drosophila, the spatiotemporal control of gurken/TGF- mRNA translation is required for establishing the embryonic body axes. A number of recent studies have highlighted key aspects of the mechanism of gurken mRNA translational control at the dorsoanterior corner of the mid-stage oocyte. Orb/CPEB and Wispy/GLD-2 are required for polyadenylation of gurken mRNA, but mis-localised gurken mRNA in the oocyte is not fully polyadenylated1. At the dorsoanterior corner, Orb and gurken mRNA have been shown to be enriched at the edge of Processing bodies, where translation occurs2. Over-expression of Orb in the adjacent nurse cells, where gurken mRNA is transcribed, is sufficient to cause mis-expression of Gurken protein3. In orb mutant egg chambers, reducing the activity of CK2, a Serine/Threonine protein kinase, enhances polarity defects, consistent with a phenotype relating to a mutation of a factor involved in gurken translation4. Here we show that sites phosphorylated by CK2 overlap with active Orb and with Gurken protein expression. We also consolidate the current literature into a working model for gurken mRNA translational control and review the role of kinases, cell cycle factors and polyadenylation machinery highlighting a multitude of conserved factors and mechanisms in the Drosophila egg chamber.",

    "abstract": "Our overall hypothesis is that host population immunity directed at multiple antigens will influence the prevalence, diversity and evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) in avian populations where the vast subtype diversity is maintained. To investigate how initial infection influences the outcome of later infections with homologous or heterologous IAV subtypes and how viruses interact through host immune responses; we carried out experimental infections in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards were pre-challenged with an H3N8 low-pathogenic IAV and were divided into six groups. At five weeks post H3N8 inoculation, each group was challenged with a different IAV subtype or the same H3N8. Two additional pre-challenged groups were inoculated with the homologous H3N8 virus at weeks 11 and 15 after pre-challenge to evaluate the duration of protection, which showed that mallards were still resistant to re-infection after 15 weeks. There was a significant reduction in shedding for all pre-challenged groups compared to controls and the outcome of the heterologous challenges varied according to hemagglutinin (HA) phylogenetic relatedness between the viruses used. There was a boost in the H3 antibody titer after re-infection with H4N5, which is consistent with original antigenic sin or antigenic seniority and suggest a putative strategy of virus evasion. These results imply strong competition between related subtypes that could regulate IAV subtype population dynamics in nature. Collectively, we provide new insights into within-host IAV complex interactions as drivers of IAV antigenic diversity that could allow the circulation of multiple subtypes in wild ducks.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMany features of pathogen diversification remain poorly explored although host immunity is recognized as a major driver of pathogen evolution. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can infect many avian and mammalian hosts, but while few IAV subtypes circulate in human populations, subtype diversity is extensive in wild bird populations. How do these subtypes coexist in wild avian populations and do they compete within these natural host populations? Here we experimentally challenged mallard ducks with different IAVs to study how an initial infection with H3N8 determines the outcome of later infections (duration of infection and virus load) and antibody responses. There was complete protection to re-infection with the same H3N8 virus based on virus isolation. In addition, there was partial protection induced by H3N8 pre-challenge to other subtypes and development of heterosubtypic immunity indicated by shorter infections and reduction in viral load compared to controls. This indicates that subtype dynamics in the host population are not independent. Amongst H3N8 pre-challenged groups, the highest protection was conferred to the H4N5 subtype which was most genetically related to H3N8. The H4N5 challenge also induced an increase in H3 antibody levels and evidence for antigenic seniority. Thus, previous infections with IAV can influence the outcome of subsequent infection with different IAV subtypes. Results not only have relevance to understanding naturally occurring subtype diversity in wild avian populations but also in understanding potential outcomes associated with introduction of novel viruses such as highly pathogenic IAV H5 viruses in wild bird populations.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsConceived and designed the experiments: NLM, DES.
