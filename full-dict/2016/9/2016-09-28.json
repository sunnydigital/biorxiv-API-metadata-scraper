    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks are lesions that form during metabolism, DNA replication and exposure to mutagens. When a double-strand break occurs one of a number of repair mechanisms is recruited, all of which have differing propensities for mutational events. Despite DNA repair being of crucial importance, the relative contribution of these mechanisms and their regulatory interactions remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding these mutational processes will have a profound impact on our knowledge of genomic instability, with implications across health, disease and evolution. Here we present a new method to model the combined activation of non-homologous end joining, single strand annealing and alternative end joining, following exposure to ionizing radiation. We use Bayesian statistics to integrate eight biological data sets of double-strand break repair curves under varying genetic knockouts and confirm that our model is predictive by re-simulating and comparing to additional data. Analysis of the model suggests that there are at least three disjoint modes of repair, which we assign as fast, slow and intermediate. Our results show that when multiple data sets are combined, the rate for intermediate repair is variable amongst genetic knockouts. Further analysis suggests that the ratio between slow and intermediate repair depends on the presence or absence of DNA-PKcs and Ku70, which implies that non-homologous end joining and alternative end joining are not independent. Finally, we consider the proportion of double-strand breaks within each mechanism as a time series and predict activity as a function of repair rate. We outline how our insights can be directly tested using imaging and sequencing techniques and conclude that there is evidence of variable dynamics in alternative repair pathways. Our approach is an important step towards providing a unifying theoretical framework for the dynamics of DNA repair processes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCodon models are widely used to identify the signature of selection at the molecular level and to test for changes in selective pressure during the evolution of genes encoding proteins. The large size of the state space of the Markov processes used to model codon evolution makes it difficult to use these models with large biological datasets. We propose here to use state aggregation to reduce the state space of codon models and, thus, improve the computational performance of likelihood estimation on these models.\\n\\nResultsWe show that this heuristic speeds up the computations of the M0 and branch-site models up to 6.8 times. We also show through simulations that state aggregation does not introduce a detectable bias. We analysed a real dataset and show that aggregation provides highly correlated predictions compared to the full likelihood computations. Finally, state aggregation is a very general approach and can be applied to any continuous-time Markov process-based model with large state space, such as amino acid and coevolution models. We therefore discuss different ways to apply state aggregation to Markov models used in phylogenetics.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe heuristic is implemented in the godon package (https://bitbucket.org/Davydov/godon) and in a version of FastCodeML (https://gitlab.isb-sib.ch/phylo/fastcodeml).",

Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets.

Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations were tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology.

    "abstract": "Small molecule distribution coefficients between immiscible nonaqueuous and aqueous phases--such as cyclohexane and water--measure the degree to which small molecules prefer one phase over another at a given pH. As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water-saturated octanol phases, since it has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released. In this work, we describe the experimental protocol we utilized for measurement of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients, report the measured data, propose a new bootstrap-based data analysis procedure to incorporate multiple sources of experimental error, and provide insights to help guide future iterations of this valuable exercise in predictive modeling.\\n\\nAbbreviations used in this paper",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 grows in the presence of membrane-permeant organic acids that can depress cytoplasmic pH and accumulate in the cytoplasm. We conducted experimental evolution by daily diluting cultures in increasing concentrations of benzoic acid (up to 20 mM) buffered at external pH 6.5, a pH at which permeant acids concentrate in the cytoplasm. By 2,000 generations, clones isolated from evolving populations showed increasing tolerance to benzoate but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Sixteen clones grew to stationary phase in 20 mM benzoate, whereas the ancestral strain W3110 peaked and declined. Similar growth occurred in 10 mM salicylate. Benzoate-evolved strains grew like W3110 in the absence of benzoate; in media buffered at pH 4.8, pH 7.0, or pH 9.0; or in 20 mM acetate or sorbate at pH 6.5. Genomes of 16 strains revealed over 100 mutations including SNPs, large deletions, and insertion knockouts. Most strains acquired deletions in the benzoate-induced multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) regulon or in associated regulators such as rob and cpxA, as well as MDR efflux pumps emrA, emrY, and mdtA. Strains also lost or down-regulated the Gad acid fitness regulon. In 5 mM benzoate, or in 2 mM salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate), most strains showed increased sensitivity to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracycline; some strains were more sensitive than a marA knockout. Thus, our benzoate-evolved strains may reveal additional unknown drug resistance components. Benzoate or salicylate selection pressure may cause general loss of MDR genes and regulators.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBenzoate is a common food preservative, and salicylate is the primary active metabolite of aspirin. In the gut microbiome, genetic adaptation to salicylate may involve loss or downregulation of inducible multidrug resistance systems. This discovery implies that aspirin therapy may modulate the human gut microbiome to favor salicylate tolerance at the expense of drug resistance. Similar aspirin-associated loss of drug resistance might occur in bacterial pathogens found in arterial plaques.",

They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped.

By small RNA sequencing we find evidence for at least four genes in the genus Sphaeroforma that satisfy the criteria for the annotation of animal miRNA genes. Three of these miRNAs are conserved and expressed across sphaeroformid species. Furthermore, we identify homologues of the animal miRNA biogenesis genes across a wide range of ichthyosporeans, including Drosha and Pasha which make up the animal specific Microprocessor complex.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic methods have shown promise in understanding the development of broadly neutralizing antibody lineages (bNAbs). However, the mutational process that generates these lineages - somatic hypermutation (SHM) - is biased by hotspot motifs, which violates important assumptions in most phylogenetic substitution models. Here, we develop a modified GY94-type substitution model that partially accounts for this context-dependency while preserving independence of sites during calculation. This model shows a substantially better fit to three well-characterized bNAb lineages than the standard GY94 model. We show through simulations that accounting for hotspot motifs can lead to reduced bias of other substitution parameters, and more accurate ancestral state reconstructions. We also demonstrate how our model can be used to test hypotheses concerning the roles of different hotspot and coldspot motifs in the evolution of B-cell lineages. Further, we explore the consequences of the idea that the number of hotspot motifs - and perhaps the mutation rate in general - is expected to decay over time in individual bNAb lineages.",

    "abstract": "A large number of human diseases result from disruptions to protein structure and function caused by missense mutations. Computational methods are frequently employed to assist in the prediction of protein stability upon mutation. These methods utilize a combination of protein sequence data, protein structure data, empirical energy functions, and physicochemical properties of amino acids. In this work, we present the first use of dynamic protein structural features in order to improve stability predictions upon mutation. This is achieved through the use of a set of timeseries extracted from microsecond timescale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of proteins. Standard machine learning algorithms using mean, variance, and histograms of these timeseries were found to be 60-70% accurate in stability classification based on experimental {Delta}{Delta}G or protein-chaperone interaction measurements. A recurrent neural network with full treatment of timeseries data was found to be 80% accurate according the F1 score. The performance of our models was found to be equal or better than two recently developed machine learning methods for binary classification as well as two industry-standard stability prediction algorithms. In addition to classification, understanding the molecular basis of protein stability disruption due to disease-causing mutations is a significant challenge that impedes the development of drugs and therapies that may be used treat genetic diseases. The use of dynamic structural features allows for novel insight into the molecular basis of protein disruption by mutation in a diverse set of soluble proteins. To assist in the interpretation of machine learning results, we present a technique for determining the importance of features to a recurrent neural network using Garsons method. We propose a novel extension of neural interpretation diagrams by implementing Garsons method to scale each node in the neural interpretation diagram according to its relative importance to the network.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks are ultimately encoded by the sequence-specific binding of (TFs) to short DNA segments. Although it is customary to represent the binding specificity of a TF by a position-specific weight matrix (PSWM), which assumes each position within a site contributes independently to the overall binding affinity, evidence has been accumulating that there can be significant dependencies between positions. Unfortunately, methodological challenges have so far hindered the development of a practical and generally-accepted extension of the PSWM model. On the one hand, simple models that only consider dependencies between nearest-neighbor positions are easy to use in practice, but fail to account for the distal dependencies that are observed in the data. On the other hand, models that allow for arbitrary dependencies are prone to overfitting, requiring regularization schemes that are difficult to use in practice for non-experts.\\n\\nHere we present a new regulatory motif model, called dinucleotide weight tensor (DWT), that incorporates arbitrary pairwise dependencies between positions in binding sites, rigorously from first principles, and free from tunable parameters. We demonstrate the power of the method on a large set of ChIP-seq data-sets, showing that DWTs outperform both PSWMs and motif models that only incorporate nearest-neighbor dependencies. We also demonstrate that DWTs outperform two previously proposed methods. Finally, we show that DWTs inferred from ChIP-seq data also outperform PSWMs on HT-SELEX data for the same TF, suggesting that DWTs capture inherent biophysical properties of the interactions between the DNA binding domains of TFs and their binding sites.\\n\\nWe make a suite of DWT tools available at dwt.unibas.ch, that allow users to automatically perform  motif finding, i.e. the inference of DWT motifs from a set of sequences, binding site prediction with DWTs, and visualization of DWT  dilogo motifs.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGene regulatory networks are ultimately encoded in constellations of short binding sites in the DNA and RNA that are recognized by regulatory factors such as transcription factors (TFs). For several decades, computational analysis of regulatory networks has relied on a model of TF sequence-specificity, the position-specific weight-matrix (PSWM), that assumes different positions in a binding site contribute independently to the total binding energy of the TF. However, in recent years evidence has been accumulating that, at least for some TFs, this assumption does not hold. Here we present a new model for the sequence-specificity of TFs, the dinucleotide weight tensor (DWT), that takes arbitrary dependencies between positions in binding sites into account and show that it consistently outperforms PSWMs on high-throughput datasets on TF binding. Moreover, in contrast to previous approaches, DWTs are directly derived from first principles within a Bayesian framework, and contain no tunable parameters. This allows them to be easily applied in practice and we make a suite of tools available for computational analysis with DWTs.",

To identify proteins that regulate the kinetochore we used a genome-wide fluorescence microscopy approach. We combined an array of mutants of either non-essential gene deletions or essential temperature-sensitive alleles with fluorescently tagged spindle pole bodies (centrosome) and outer kinetochores. Quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed mutants that affect the levels and distribution of kinetochores respectively. These mutants are enriched for those involved in mRNA processing, chromatin organization, DNA replication/repair and mitosis. Our data show that the Pkc1 kinase maintains the kinetochore focus via its ability to prevent cell stress and this phenotype is rescued by an osmotic stabilizer. These data support the notion that kinetochore and microtubule homeostasis are perturbed by the stress response pathways. Hence this observation provides a candidate mechanism for extracellular stress leading to chromosome segregation defects.",

We performed expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping and identified 164,290 significant eQTLs associating 6,241 unique genes (eGenes) with 147,419 unique SNPs (eSNPs). We found approximately four times as many local as distant eQTLs, which had significantly higher effect size. eQTLs were primarily located in regulatory regions of genes (UTRs or flanking regions), regardless of whether they were local or distant. We used the gene expression data to infer a co-expression network and investigated to what degree eQTLs could explain the structure of the network: eGenes were present in the core of 28 of 38 network modules, however, eGenes were overall underrepresented in cores and overrepresented in the periphery of the network, with a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and network connectivity. We also observed a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and allele frequency and found that core genes have experienced stronger selective constraint. Our integrated genetics and genomics results suggest that prevalent purifying selection is the primary mechanism underlying the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression in P. tremula and that highly connected network hubs are buffered against deleterious effects as a result of regulation by numerous eSNPs, each of minor effect.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNumerous studies have shown that many genomic polymorphisms contributing to phenotypic variation are located outside of protein coding regions, suggesting that they act by modulating gene expression. Furthermore, phenotypes are seldom explained by individual genes, but rather emerge from networks of interacting genes. The effect of regulatory variants and the interaction of genes can be described by co-expression networks, which are known to contain a small number of highly connected nodes and many more lowly connected nodes, making them robust to random mutation. While previous studies have examined the genetic architecture of gene expression variation, few were performed in natural populations with fewer still integrating the co-expression network.\\n\\nWe undertook a study using a natural population of European aspen (Populus tremula), showing that expression variance is substantially smaller among individuals than between tissues within the same individual, suggesting that stabilizing selection may act to restrict the scale of expression variation. We further show that highly connected genes within the co-expression network are associated with polymorphisms of lower than average effect size, suggesting purifying selection. These genes are therefore buffered against large expression modulation, providing a mechanistic explanation of how network robustness is created and maintained at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Localized genomic variability is crucial for the ongoing conflicts between infectious microbes and their hosts. An understanding of evolutionary and adaptive patterns associated with genomic variability will help guide development of vaccines and anti-microbial agents. While most analyses of the human microbiome have focused on taxonomic classification and gene annotation, we investigated genomic variation of skin-associated viral communities. We evaluated patterns of viral genomic variation across 16 healthy human volunteers. HPV and Staphylococcus phages contained 106 and 465 regions of diversification, or hypervariable loci, respectively. Propionibacterium phage genomes were minimally divergent and contained no hypervariable loci. Genes containing hypervariable loci were involved in functions including host tropism and immune evasion. HPV and Staphylococcus phage hypervariable loci were associated with purifying selection. Amino acid substitution patterns were virus dependent, as were predictions of their phenotypic effects. We identified diversity generating retroelements as one likely mechanism driving hypervariability. We validated these findings in an independently collected skin metagenomic sequence dataset, suggesting that these features of skin virome genomic variability are widespread. Our results highlight the genomic variation landscape of the skin virome and provide a foundation for better understanding community viral evolution and the functional implications of genomic diversification of skin viruses.",

    "abstract": "The natural ends of chromosomes resemble DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and telomeres are therefore necessary to prevent recognition by the DNA damage response. The enzyme telomerase can also generate new telomeres at DSBs, resulting in the loss of genetic information distal to the break. How cells deal with different DNA ends is therefore an important decision. One critical point of regulation is to limit telomerase activity at DSBs and this is primarily accomplished in budding yeast by the telomerase inhibitor Pif1. Here we use Pif1 as a sensor to gain insight into the cellular decision at DSB ends with increasing telomeric character. We uncover a striking transition point in which 34 bp of telomeric (TG1-3)n repeat sequence is sufficient to render a DNA end insensitive to Pif1, thereby facilitating extension by telomerase. This phenomenon is unlikely to be due to Pif1 modification and we propose that Cdc13 confers a unique property to the TG34 end that prevents Pif1 action. We identify novel Cdc13 mutations that resensitize DNA ends to Pif1 and discover that many Cdc13 telomerase-null mutations are dependent on Pif1 status. Finally, the observed threshold of Pif1 activity recapitulates several properties of both DSBs and telomeres and we propose that this is the dividing line between these entities.",

    "abstract": "SynopsisWe emphasise and demonstrate the importance of modelling the superpositions of ligand-bound and unbound states that commonly occur in crystallographic datasets. Generation of an ensemble that describes not only the dominant state in the crystal is important for the high-quality refinement of low-occupancy ligands, as well as to present a model that explains all of the observed density.\\n\\nAbstractSmall molecules bind to only a fraction of the proteins in the crystal lattice, but occupancy refinement of ligands is often avoided by convention; occupancies are set to unity, assuming that the error will be adequately modelled by the B-factors, and weak ligand density is generally ignored or attributed to disorder. Where occupancy refinement is performed, the superposed atomic state is rarely modelled. We show here that these modelling approaches lead to a degradation of the quality of the ligand model, and potentially affect the interpretation of the interactions between the bound ligand and the protein. Instead, superior accuracy is achieved by modelling the ligand as partially occupied and superposed on a ligand-free \\\"ground-state\\\" solvent model. Explicit modelling of the superposed unbound fraction of the crystal using a reference dataset allows constrained refinement of the occupancy of the ligand with minimal fear of over-fitting. Better representation of the crystal also leads to more meaningful refined atomic parameters such as the B-factor, allowing more insight into dynamics in the crystal. We present a simple approach and simple guidelines for generating the ensemble of bound and unbound states, assuming that datasets representing the unbound states (the ground state) are available. Judged by various electron density metrics, ensemble models are consistently better than corresponding single-state models. Furthermore, local modelling of the superposed ground state is found to be generally more important for the quality of the ligand model than convergence of the overall phases.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, thus leading to birth defects including more than microcephaly. It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika, but unfortunately no vaccine or medicine is available so far. Zika NS2B-NS3pro is essential for its replication and thus represents an attractive target for drug discovery/design. Here we characterized conformation, catalysis, inhibition and dynamics of linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes by both experiments and MD simulations. The results unveil the unique properties of Zika NS2B-NS3pro which are very different from Dengue one. Particularly, CD and NMR studies indicate that unlike Dengue, the C-terminal region of Zika NS2B with a significant sequence variation is highly disordered in the open conformation. Indeed, MD simulations reveal that up to 100 ns, the Dengue NS2B C-terminus constantly has close contacts with its NS3pro domain. By a sharp contrast, the Zika NS2B C-terminus loses the contacts with its NS3pro domain after 10 ns, further forming a short {beta}-sheet characteristic of the closed conformation at 30 ns. Furthermore, we found that a small molecule, previously identified as an active site inhibitor for other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro, inhibited Zika NS2B-NS3pro potently in an allosteric manner. Our study provides the first insight into the dynamics of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and further deciphers that it is susceptible to allosteric inhibition, which thus bears critical implications for the future development of therapeutic allosteric inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "There is significant controversy over the anatomical existence and potential function of a direct subcortical visual pathway to the amygdala. It is thought that this pathway rapidly transmits low spatial frequency information to the amygdala independently of the cortex and yet this function has never been causally determined. In this study, neural activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants discriminated the gender of neutral and fearful faces filtered for low or high spatial frequencies. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) revealed that the most likely underlying neural network consisted of a subcortical pulvino-amygdala connection that was not modulated by spatial frequency or emotion and a cortico-amygdala connection that conveyed predominantly high spatial frequencies. Crucially, data-driven neural simulations demonstrated a clear temporal advantage of the subcortical route (70ms) over the cortical route (155ms) in influencing amygdala activity. Thus, our findings support the existence of a rapid functional subcortical pathway that is unselective of the spatial frequency or emotional content of faces.",

One reason is the nonselective binding of a drug to unintended proteins such as its paralogs, which are highly homologous in sequences and exhibit similar structures and drug-binding pockets. In this study, we analyzed amino acid residues with type-II functional divergence, i.e., sites that are conserved in sequence constraints but differ in physicochemical properties between paralogs, to identify targetable differences between two paralogs. We analyzed paralogous protein receptors in the glucagon-like subfamily, glucagon receptor (GCGR) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which are clinically validated drug targets in patients with type 2 diabetes and exhibit divergence in ligands, showing opposing roles in regulating glucose homeostasis. We identified 8 residues related to type-II functional divergence, which are conserved in functional constraints but differ in physicochemical properties between GCGR and GLP-1R. We detected significant enrichment of predicted residues in binding sites of the antagonist MK-0893 to GCGR. We also identified a type-II functional divergence-related residue involved in ligand-specific effects that was critical for agonist-mediated activation of GLP-1R. We describe the important role of type-II functional divergence-related sites in paralog discrimination, enabling the identification of binding sites to reduce undesirable side effects and increase the target specificity of drugs.",

    "abstract": "Theta oscillations play a critical role in learning and memory by coordinating the spiking activity of neuronal ensembles via mechanisms such as spike timing dependent plasticity1-7. This rhythm is present in rodents where it is continuously evident during movement at frequencies within 6-12Hz8,9. In humans, however, the presence of continuous theta rhythm has been elusive; indeed, a functionally similar theta is thought to occur at lower frequency ranges (3-7Hz) and in shorter bouts10-12. This lower frequency theta rhythm is observed during a variety of behaviors, including virtual navigation, but has never been tested during real world ambulatory movement. Here we examined the oscillatory properties of theta within the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) in freely moving human subjects chronically implanted with the clinical NeuroPace RNS(R) responsive neurostimulator device, capable of wireless recordings of continuous intracranial deep brain electroencephalographic (iEEG) activity. MTL iEEG recordings, together with sub-millimeter position tracking, revealed the presence of high frequency theta oscillations (6-12Hz) during ambulation. The prevalence of these oscillations was increased during fast movement compared to slow movement. These theta bouts, although occurring more frequently, were not significantly different in durations during fast versus slow movements. In a rare opportunity to study one subject with congenital blindness, we found that both the prevalence and duration of theta bouts were much greater than those in sighted subjects. Our results suggest that higher frequency theta indeed exists in humans during movement providing critical support for conserved neurobiological mechanisms for spatial navigation. The precise link between this pattern and its behavioral correlates will be an exciting area for future studies given this novel methodology for simultaneous motion capture and long term chronic recordings from deep brain targets during ambulatory human behavior.",

Using a binary mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids, and a ternary mixture of a saturated lipid, an unsaturated lipid and cholesterol we reproduce the coexistence of liquid-crystalline and gel, as well as liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. By raising the temperature or adding hybrid lipids (with a saturated and an unsaturated chain), we induce a gradual transition from a two-phase to a one-phase state.

The flexible nature of our method further allows for arbitrarily complex population histories using unphased and unpolarized whole genome sequences. In silico experiments demonstrate accurate parameter estimates across a range of divergence models with increasing complexity, and as a proof of principle, we infer the demographic history of the two species of orangutan from multiple genome sequences (over 160 Mbp in length) from each species. Our results indicate that the two orangutan species split approximately 650-950 thousand years ago but experienced a pulse of secondary contact much more recently, most likely during a period of low sea-level South East Asia ([~]300,000 years ago).

Twenty-one laboratories measured four blinded samples containing different quantities of a KRAS fragment encoding G12D, an important genetic marker for guiding therapy of certain cancers. This marker is challenging to quantify reproducibly using qPCR or NGS due to the presence of competing wild type sequences and the need for calibration. Using dPCR, eighteen laboratories were able to quantify the G12D marker within 12% of each other in all samples. Three laboratories appeared to measure consistently outlying results; however, proper application of a follow-up analysis recommendation rectified their data. Our findings show that dPCR has demonstrable reproducibility across a large number of laboratories without calibration and could enable the reproducible application of molecular stratification to guide therapy, and potentially for molecular diagnostics.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe poor reproducibility of molecular diagnostic methods limits their application in part due to the challenges associated with calibration of what are relative measurement approaches. In this study we investigate the performance of one of the only absolute measurement methods available today, digital PCR (dPCR), and demonstrated that when compared across twenty-one laboratories, dPCR has unprecedented reproducibility. These results were achieved when measuring a challenging single nucleotide variant and without calibration to any reference samples. This opens the possibility for dPCR to offer a method to transform reproducibility in the molecular diagnostic field, both by direct use as well as in support of other currently used clinical methods.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of liver diseases manifest as biliary obstruction, or cholestasis. However, the sequence of molecular events triggered as part of the early hepatocellular homeostatic response to abnormal elevations in biliary pressure remains poorly elucidated. Bile canaliculi are dynamic luminal structures that undergo actomyosin-mediated periodic contractions to propel secreted bile. Additionally, pericanalicular actin is accumulated during obstructive cholestasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that the pericanalicular actin cortex undergoes significant remodeling as a regulatory response against increased biliary pressure. Here, we report that, actomyosin contractility induces transient deformations along the canalicular membrane, a process we have termed inward blebbing. We show that these membrane intrusions are initiated by local ruptures in the pericanalicular actin cortex, and they typically retract following repair by actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction. However, above a certain osmotic pressure threshold, these inward blebs pinch away from the canalicular membrane into the hepatocyte cytoplasm as large vesicles (2-8 {micro}m). Importantly, we show that these vesicles aid in the regurgitation of bile from the canalicular system. Conclusion: Actomyosin contractility induces the formation of bile-regurgitative vesicles, thus serving as an early homeostatic mechanism against increased biliary pressure during cholestasis.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of sensing noxious mechanical force by nociceptive sensory neurons remain poorly understood. Traditional methods for probing mechanical nociception behavioral responses are labor intensive and involve the testing of one animal at a time. This time consuming process of behavioral testing has largely precluded large scale analyses. Indeed, large scale genetic screens that have been performed thus far have been largely restricted to the investigation of ion channel genes [1]. Here we describe a new behavioral assay for mechanical nociception in which tens of animals can be stimulated simultaneously. In this assay, third instar larvae of the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster are mechanically stimulated with tungsten particles that are fired from a gun. We have used the new assay to carry out a genetic screen in which we investigated the function of 231 nociceptor enriched genes with tissue-specific RNA interference. Targeting of 21 genes resulted in mechanically insensitive phenotypes and targeting of a single gene resulted in a hypersensitive mechanical nociception phenotype. Six of the identified genes were previously uncharacterized and these were named after famed Roman gladiators (Spartacus (CG14186), Commodus (CG1311), Flamma (CG10914), Crixus(CG6685), Spiculus (CG10932), and Verus (CG31324)).",
