    "abstract": "Many species are shifting their ranges in response to global climate change. The evolution of dispersal during range expansion increases invasion speed, provided that a species can adapt sufficiently fast to novel local conditions. Mutation rates can evolve too, under conditions that favor an increased rate of adaptation. However, evolution at the mutator gene has thus far been deemed of minor importance in sexual populations due to its dependence on genetic hitchhiking with a beneficial mutation at a gene under selection, and thus its sensitivity to recombination. Here we use an individual-based model to show that the mutator gene and the gene under selection can be effectively linked at the population level during invasion. This causes the evolutionary increase of mutation rates in sexual populations, even if they are not linked at the individual level. The observed evolution of mutation rate is adaptive and clearly advances range expansion both through its effect on the evolution of dispersal rate, and the evolution of local adaptation. In addition, we observe the evolution of mutation rates in a spatially stable population under strong directional selection, but not when we add variance to the mean selection pressure. By this we extend the existing theory on the evolution of mutation rates, which is generally thought to be limited to asexual populations, with possibly far-reaching consequences concerning invasiveness and the rate at which species can adapt to novel environmental conditions as experienced under global climate change.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins fail to adopt a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. It is now understood that many disordered proteins are not dysfunctional, but instead engage in numerous cellular processes, including signaling and regulation. Disorder characterization from amino acid sequence relies on computational disorder prediction algorithms. While numerous large-scale investigations of disorder have been performed using these algorithms, and have offered valuable insight regarding the prevalence of protein disorder in many organisms, critical proteome-based descriptive statistical guidelines that would enable the objective assessment of intrinsic disorder in a protein of interest remain to be established. Here we present a quantitative characterization of numerous disorder features using a rigorous non-parametric statistical approach, providing expected values and percentile cutoffs for each feature in ten eukaryotic proteomes. Our estimates utilize multiple ab initio disorder prediction algorithms grounded on physicochemical principles. Furthermore, we present novel threshold values, specific to both the prediction algorithms and the proteomes, defining the longest primary sequence length in which the significance of a continuous disordered region can be evaluated on the basis of length alone. The guidelines presented here are intended to improve the interpretation of disorder content and continuous disorder predictions from the proteomic point of view.",

    "abstract": "Distant-dependent correlations in spontaneous retinal activity are thought to be instructive in the development of the retinotopic map and eye-specific segregation maps. Many studies which seek to investigate these correlations and their role in map formation record spontaneous retinal activity from different pheno-types or experimental conditions and compare the distance-dependence of the correlations between different conditions. They seek to demonstrate that these correlations differ significantly, and this analysis is often key to the studys conclusions. In this work, we assess the methods of inference which have been previously used to investigate this problem and conclude that they are inadequate. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian framework to model distant-dependent correlations in spontaneous retinal activity data and specify a method which uses the data to specify the form of the model. This model allows us to assess the evidence for/against differences in correlations between experimental conditions in a more robust and credible way. We demonstrate the use of this method by applying it to data from two studies of spontaneous retinal activity. We believe however the framework to be rather more general and that it can be used in a wide range of datasets where distance and correlation are substitute for other independent and dependent variables from experiments.",

The notion that a two-state system is physically defined only for a set temperature range is introduced. The implications of this novel treatment for protein folding are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Dose from radiation exposure can be estimated from dicentric chromosome (DC) frequencies in metaphase cells of peripheral blood lymphocytes. We automated DC detection by extracting features in Giemsa-stained metaphase chromosome images and classifying objects by machine learning (ML). DC detection involves i) intensity thresholded segmentation of metaphase objects, ii) chromosome separation by watershed transformation and elimination of inseparable chromosome clusters, fragments and staining debris using a morphological decision tree filter, iii) determination of chromosome width and centreline, iv) derivation of centromere candidates and v) distinction of DCs from monocentric chromosomes (MC) by ML. Centromere candidates are inferred from 14 image features input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM). 16 features derived from these candidates are then supplied to a Boosting classifier and a second SVM which determines whether a chromosome is either a DC or MC. The SVM was trained with 292 DCs and 3135 MCs, and then tested with cells exposed to either low (1 Gy) or high (2-4 Gy) radiation dose. Results were then compared with those of 3 experts. True positive rates (TPR) and positive predictive values (PPV) were determined for the tuning parameter, {sigma}. At larger {sigma}, PPV decreases and TPR increases. At high dose, for {sigma}= 1.3, TPR = 0.52 and PPV = 0.83, while at {sigma}= 1.6, the TPR = 0.65 and PPV = 0.72. At low dose and {sigma} = 1.3, TPR = 0.67 and PPV = 0.26. The algorithm differentiates DCs from MCs, overlapped chromosomes and other objects with acceptable accuracy over a wide range of radiation exposures.",

    "abstract": "Exome sequencing is becoming a standard tool for gene mapping of genetic diseases. Given the vast amount of data generated by Next Generation Sequencing techniques, identification of disease causal variants is like finding a needle in a haystack. The impact assessment and the prioritization of potential pathogenic variants are expected to reduce work in biological validation, which is long and costly.\\n\\nOne of the possible approaches to determine the most probable deleterious variants in individual exomes is to use protein function alteration prediction. We propose in this paper to use a machine learning approach, the random forest to build a new meta-score based on five previously described scores (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT, PhyloP and MutationTaster) and compiled in the dbNSFP database.\\n\\nThe functional meta-score was trained on a dataset of 61 500 non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The random forest method (rfPred) appears to be globally better than each of the classifiers separately or in combination in a logistic regression model, and better than a newly described score (CADD) on independent validation sets.\\n\\nRfPred scores have been pre-calculated for all the possible non-synonymous SNPs of human exome and are freely accessible at the web-server http://www.sbim.fr/rfPred/",
