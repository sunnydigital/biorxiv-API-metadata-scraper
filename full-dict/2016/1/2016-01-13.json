    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered as a major source of innovation in bacteria, and as such is expected to drive adaptation to new ecological niches. However, among the many genes acquired through HGT along the diversification history of genomes, only a fraction may have actively contributed to sustained ecological adaptation. We used a phylogenetic approach accounting for the transfer of genes (or groups of genes) to estimate the history of genomes in Agrobacterium biovar 1, a diverse group of soil and plant-dwelling bacterial species. We identified clade-specific blocks of co-transferred genes encoding coherent biochemical pathways that may have contributed to the evolutionary success of key Agrobacterium clades. This pattern of gene co-evolution rejects a neutral model of transfer, in which neighbouring genes would be transferred independently of their function and rather suggests purifying selection on collectively coded acquired pathways. The acquisition of these synapomorphic blocks of co-functioning genes probably drove the ecological diversification of Agrobacterium and defined features of ancestral ecological niches, which consistently hint at a strong selective role of host plant rhizospheres.",

    "abstract": "IBackgroundEpistasis and gene-environment interactions are known to contribute significantly to variation of complex phenotypes in model organisms. However, their identification in human association studies remains challenging for myriad reasons. In the case of epistatic interactions, the large number of potential interacting sets of genes presents computational, multiple hypothesis correction, and other statistical power issues. In the case of gene-environment interactions, the lack of consistently measured environmental covariates in most disease studies precludes searching for interactions and creates difficulties for replicating studies.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we develop a new statistical approach to address these issues that leverages genetic ancestry in admixed populations. We applied our method to gene expression and methylation data from African American and Latino admixed individuals respectively, identifying nine interactions that were significant at p < 5x10-8, we show that two of the interactions in methylation data replicate, and the remaining six are significantly enriched for low p-values (p < 1.8x10-6).\\n\\nConclusionWe show that genetic ancestry can be a useful proxy for unknown and unmeasured covariates in the search for interaction effects. These results have important implications for our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits.",

In this article we will review some key recent advances: improved fluorophores for single cell resolution functional neuroimaging using a two photon microscope; improved approaches to the problem of scanning active circuits; and the prospect of scanless microscopes which overcome some of the bandwidth limitations of current imaging techniques. These advances in technology for experimental neuroscience have in themselves led to technical challenges, such as the need for the development of novel signal processing and data analysis tools in order to make the most of the new experimental tools. We review recent work in some active topics, such as region of interest segmentation algorithms capable of demixing overlapping signals, and new highly accurate algorithms for calcium transient detection. These advances motivate the development of new data analysis tools capable of dealing with spatial or spatiotem-poral patterns of neural activity, that scale well with pattern size.",

    "abstract": "How neural stem cells generate the correct number and type of differentiated neurons in appropriate places is an important question in developmental biology. Although nervous systems are diverse across phyla, many taxa have a larva that forms an anterior concentration of neurons, or apical organ. The number of neurons in these organs is highly variable. We show that neurogenesis in the sea star larvae begins with soxc-expressing multipotent progenitors. These give rise to restricted progenitors that express lhx2/9. Soxc- and lhx2/9-expressing cells are capable of undergoing both asymmetric divisions, which allow for progression towards a particular neural fate, and symmetric proliferative divisions. Nested concentric domains of gene expression along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, which have been observed in a great diversity of metazoans, control neurogenesis in the sea star by promoting particular division modes and progression towards becoming a neuron. This work, therefore, explains how spatial patterning in the ectoderm controls progression of neurogenesis. Modification to the sizes of these AP territories provides a simple mechanism to explain the diversity of neuron number found among apical organs.\\n\\nSummary StatementThe progression of apical organ neurogenesis in the sea star is controlled by regulatory anterior-posterior patterning domains.",

    "abstract": "Striatal projection neurons form a sparsely-connected inhibitory network, and this arrangement may be essential for the appropriate temporal organization of behavior. Here we show that a simplified, sparse inhibitory network of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons can reproduce some key features of striatal population activity, as observed in brain slices. In particular we develop a new metric to determine the conditions under which sparse inhibitory networks form anti-correlated cell assemblies with time-varying activity of individual cells. We find that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific sequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates similar inputs. Our results support the proposal that GABAergic connections between striatal projection neurons allow stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell assemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal GABAergic signaling may produce aberrant network-level information processing in disorders such as Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeuronal networks that are loosely coupled by inhibitory connections can exhibit potentially useful properties. These include the ability to produce slowly-changing activity patterns, that could be important for organizing actions and thoughts over time. The striatum is a major brain structure that is critical for appropriately timing behavior to receive rewards. Striatal projection neurons have loose inhibitory interconnections, and here we show that even a highly simplified model of this striatal network is capable of producing slowly-changing activity sequences. We examine some key parameters important for producing these dynamics, and help explain how changes in striatal connectivity may contribute to serious human disorders including Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIPO) is a rare, but life-threatening, disease characterized by severe intestinal dysmotility. Histopathological studies of CIPO patients have identified several different mechanisms that appear to be responsible for the dysmotility, including defects in neurons, smooth muscle or interstitial cells of Cajal. Currently there are few mouse models of the various forms of CIPO. We generated a mouse with a point mutation in the RNA Recognition Motif of the Nup35 gene, which encodes a component of the nuclear pore complex. Nup35 mutants developed a severe megacolon and exhibited reduced lifespan. Histopathological examination revealed a degenerative myopathy that developed after birth and specifically affected smooth muscle in the colon; smooth muscle in the small bowel and the bladder were not affected. Furthermore, no defects were found in enteric neurons or interstitial cells of Cajal. Nup35 mice are likely to be a valuable model for the sub-type of CIPO characterized by degenerative myopathy. Our study also raises the possibility that Nup35 polymorphisms could contribute to some cases of CIPO.\\n\\nSignificance StatementChronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIPO) is a disabling bowel disorder in which the symptoms resemble those caused by mechanical obstruction, but no physical obstruction is present. Some patients with CIPO have defects in intestinal neurons while in other CIPO patients the muscle cells in the bowel wall appear to degenerate, but the underlying cause of these defects is unknown in most CIPO patients. We generated a mouse that has a mutation in Nup35, which encodes a component of the pores found within the membrane of the cell nucleus. The mutant mice developed intestinal obstruction, which we showed was due to degeneration of the muscle cells in the colon. This mouse is likely to provide new insights into some forms of CIPO.",

    "abstract": "The genomics era has led to an increase in the dimensionality of the data collected to investigate biological questions. In this context, dimension-reduction techniques can be used to summarize high-dimensional signals into low-dimensional ones, to further test for association with one or more covariates of interest. This paper revisits one such approach, previously known as Principal Component of Heritability and renamed here as Principal Component of Explained Variance (PCEV). As its name suggests, the PCEV seeks a linear combination of outcomes in an optimal manner, by maximising the proportion of variance explained by one or several covariates of interest. By construction, this method optimises power but limited by its computational complexity, it has unfortunately received little attention in the past. Here, we propose a general analytical PCEV framework that builds on the assets of the original method, i.e. conceptually simple and free of tuning parameters. Moreover, our framework extends the range of applications of the original procedure by providing a computationally simple strategy for high-dimensional outcomes, along with exact and asymptotic testing procedures that drastically reduce its computational cost. We investigate the merits of the PCEV using an extensive set of simulations. Furthermore, the use of the PCEV approach will be illustrated using three examples taken from the epigenetics and brain imaging areas.",

However, due to the large variability in gene expression, identifying cell types based on the transcriptome remains challenging. We present Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3), a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data. SC3 achieves high accuracy and robustness by consistently integrating different clustering solutions through a consensus approach. Tests on twelve published datasets show that SC3 outperforms five existing methods while remaining scalable, as shown by the analysis of a large dataset containing 44,808 cells. Moreover, an interactive graphical implementation makes SC3 accessible to a wide audience of users, and SC3 aids biological interpretation by identifying marker genes, differentially expressed genes and outlier cells. We illustrate the capabilities of SC3 by characterising newly obtained transcriptomes from subclones of neoplastic cells collected from patients.",

Here, we use a variant of NMF, termed non-smooth NMF, to generate sparse matrix factorizations of somatic mutation profiles present in 7129 tumors. nsNMF factorization revealed 21 mutational signatures.
