    "abstract": "BackgroundThe miniaturised and portable DNA sequencer MinIONTM has been released to the scientific community within the framework of an early access programme to evaluate its application for a wide variety of genetic approaches. This technology has demonstrated great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinIONTM system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences.\\n\\nResultsUsing R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. These data were sufficient to reconstruct more than 90% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock reference community. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to assign taxonomic classification down to the species level. Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using  universal primers.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, the MinIONTM DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and the nucleotide bias reported here for 16S amplicon sequencing, will further deliver more reliable information that is useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrug treatments and vaccine designs against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have multiple issues, all associated with the diverse genetic traits present in this pathogen, ranging from multi-drug resistant genes to the molecular machinery for the biosynthesis of biofilms. Several candidate vaccines against P. aeruginosa have been developed, which target the outer membrane proteins; however, major issues arise when attempting to establish complete protection against this pathogen due to its presumably genotypic variation at the strain level. To shed light on this concern, we proposed this study to assess the P. aeruginosa pangenome and its molecular evolution across multiple strains.\\n\\nResultsThe P. aeruginosa pangenome was estimated to contain more than 16,000 non-redundant genes, and approximately 15% of these constituted the core genome. Functional analyses of the accessory genome indicated a wide presence of genetic elements directly associated with pathogenicity. An in-depth molecular evolution analysis revealed the full landscape of selection forces acting on the P. aeruginosa pangenome, in which purifying selection drives evolution in the genome of this human pathogen. We also detected distinctive positive selection in a wide variety of outer membrane proteins, with the data supporting the concept of substantial genetic variation in proteins probably recognized as antigens. Approaching the evolutionary information of genes under extremely positive selection, we designed a new Multi-Locus Sequencing Typing assay for an informative, rapid, and cost-effective genotyping of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.\\n\\nConclusionsWe report the unprecedented pangenome characterization of P. aeruginosa on a large scale, which included almost 200 bacterial genomes from one single species and a molecular evolutionary analysis at the pangenome scale. Evolutionary information presented here provides a clear explanation of the issues associated with the use of protein conjugates from pili, flagella, or secretion systems as antigens for vaccine design, which exhibit high genetic variation in terms of non-synonymous substitutions in P. aeruginosa strains.",

    "abstract": "Motif analysis has long been an important method to characterize biological functionality and the current growth of sequencing-based genomics experiments further extends its potential. These diverse experiments often generate sequence lists ranked by some functional property. There is therefore a growing need for motif analysis methods that can exploit this coupled data structure and be tailored for specific biological questions. Here, we present a motif analysis tool, Regmex (REGular expression Motif EXplorer), which offers several methods to identify overrepresented motifs in a ranked list of sequences. Regmex uses regular expressions to define motifs or families of motifs and embedded Markov models to calculate exact probabilities for motif observations in sequences. Motif enrichment is optionally evaluated using random walks, Brownian bridges, or modified rank based statistics. These features make Regmex well suited for a range of biological sequence analysis problems related to motif discovery. We demonstrate different usage scenarios including rank correlation of microRNA binding sites co-occurring with a U-rich motif. The method is available as an R package.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving a memory can modify its influence on subsequent behavior. Whether this phenomenon arises from modification of the contents of the memory trace or its accessibility is a matter of considerable debate. We develop a computational theory that incorporates both mechanisms. Modification of the contents of the memory trace occurs through classical associative learning, but which memory trace is accessed (and thus made eligible for modification) depends on a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation. Simulations demonstrate that our model can reproduce the major experimental findings from studies of memory modification in the Pavlovian conditioning literature, including dependence on the strength and age of memories, the interval between memory retrieval and extinction, and prediction errors following retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Events in primate evolution are often dated by assuming a \\\"molecular clock\\\", i.e., a constant rate of substitution per unit time, but the validity of this assumption remains unclear. Among mammals, it is well known that there exists substantial variation in yearly substitution rates. Such variation is to be expected from differences in life-history traits, suggesting that it should also be found among primates. Motivated by these considerations, we analyze whole genomes from ten primate species, including Old World Monkeys (OWMs), New World Monkeys (NWMs) and apes, focusing on putatively neutral autosomal sites and controlling for possible effects of biased gene conversion and methylation at CpG sites. We find that substitution rates are {small tilde}65% higher in lineages leading from the hominoid-NWM ancestor to NWMs than to apes. Within apes, rates are {small tilde}2% higher in chimpanzees and {small tilde}7% higher in the gorilla than in humans. Substitution types subject to biased gene conversion show no more variation among species than those not subject to it. Not all mutation types behave similarly, however: in particular, transitions at CpG sites exhibit a more clock-like behavior than do other types, presumably due to their non-replicative origin. Thus, not only the total rate, but also the mutational spectrum varies among primates. This finding suggests that events in primate evolution are most reliably dated using CpG transitions. Taking this approach, we estimate that the average time to the most recent common ancestor of human and chimpanzee is 12.1 million years and their split time 7.9 million years.\\n\\nSignificance statementMuch of our understanding of the chronology of human evolution relies on the \\\"molecular clock\\\", i.e., a constant rate of substitutions per unit time. To evaluate the validity of this assumption, we analyze whole genome sequences from ten primate species. We find that there is substantial variation in the molecular clock between apes and monkeys, and rates even differ within hominoids. Importantly, not all mutation types behave similarly: notably, transitions at CpG sites exhibit a more clock-like behavior than other substitutions, presumably due to their non-replicative origin. Thus, the mutation spectra, and not just the overall substitution rates, are changing across primates. This finding further suggests that events in primate evolution are most reliably dated using CpG transitions.",

    "abstract": "RNAseq is a relatively new tool for ecological genetics that offers researchers insight into changes in gene expression in response to a myriad of natural or experimental conditions. However, standard RNAseq methods (e.g., Illumina TruSeq(R) or NEBNext(R)) can be cost prohibitive, especially when study designs require large sample sizes. Consequently, RNAseq is often underused as a method, or is applied to small sample sizes that confer poor statistical power. Low cost RNAseq methods could therefore enable far greater and more powerful applications of transcriptomics in ecological genetics and beyond. Standard mRNAseq is costly partly because one sequences portions of the full length of all transcripts. Such whole-mRNA data is redundant for estimates of relative gene expression. TagSeq is an alternative method that focuses sequencing effort on mRNAs 3-prime end, thereby reducing the necessary sequencing depth per sample, and thus cost. Here we present a revised TagSeq protocol, and compare its performance against NEBNext(R), the gold-standard whole mRNAseq method. We built both TagSeq and NEBNext(R) libraries from the same biological samples, each spiked with control RNAs. We found that TagSeq measured the control RNA distribution more accurately than NEBNext(R), for a fraction of the cost per sample ({bsim}10%). The higher accuracy of TagSeq was particularly apparent for transcripts of moderate to low abundance. Technical replicates of TagSeq libraries are highly correlated, and were correlated with NEBNext(R) results. Overall, we show that our modified TagSeq protocol is an efficient alternative to traditional whole mRNAseq, offering researchers comparable data at greatly reduced cost.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide studies revealed that as much as 80% of the human genome can be transcribed whereas only 2% of this RNA is translated into proteins. Non-coding transcripts can be subdivided into several groups, with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) representing the largest and most diverse class. With breast cancer being the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide, we set out to investigate the potential of lncRNAs as novel therapeutic targets. By performing RNA-Seq on tumor sections and mammary organoids from MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-Neu-NDL mice, modeling the luminal B and HER2/neu-amplified subtypes of human breast cancer respectively, we generated a comprehensive catalog of differentially expressed lncRNAs. We identified several hundred potentially oncogenic lncRNAs that were over-expressed in a subtype-specific manner as well as numerous lncRNAs up-regulated in both models. Among these lncRNA we defined a subset of 30 previously uncharacterized lncRNAs as Mammary Tumor Associated RNAs (MaTARs) and we identified human orthologs. We functionally validated the role of these MaTARs by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) mediated knockdown in primary mammary tumor cells and 3D ex vivo organoids. Upon independent knockdown of 15 MaTARs, we observed significantly reduced cell proliferation, invasion and/or collective cell migration in a cancer-specific context. Thus, MaTARs are likely key drivers of mammary tumor progression and/or metastasis and represent promising new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "As a result of a high rate of mutations and recombination events, an RNA-virus exists as a heterogeneous \\\"swarm\\\". The ability of next-generation sequencing to produce massive quantities of genomic data inexpensively has allowed virologists to study the structure of viral populations from an infected host at an unprecedented resolution. However, high similarity and low frequency of the viral variants impose a huge challenge to assembly of individual full-length genomes. The long read length offered by a single-molecule sequencing technologies allows each mutant variant to be sequenced in a single pass. However, high error rate limits the ability to reconstruct heterogeneous viral population composed of rare, related mutant variants. In this paper, we present 2SNV, a method able to tolerate the high error-rate of the single-molecule protocol and reconstruct mutant variants. The proposed protocol is able to eliminate sequencing errors and reconstruct closely related viral mutant variants. 2SNV uses linkage between single nucleotide variations to efficiently distinguish them from read errors. To benchmark the sensitivity of 2SNV, we performed a single-molecule sequencing experiment on a sample containing a titrated level of known viral mutant variants.\\n\\nOur method is able to accurately reconstruct clone with frequency of 0.2% and distinguish clones that differed in only two nucleotides distantly located on the genome. 2SNV outperforms existing methods for full-length viral mutant reconstruction. With a high sensitivity and accuracy, 2SNV is anticipated to facilitate not only viral quasispecies reconstruction, but also other biological questions that require detection of rare haplotypes such as genetic diversity in cancer cell population, and monitoring B-cell and T-cell receptor repertoire.
