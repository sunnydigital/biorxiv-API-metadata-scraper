    "abstract": "A central aim of evolutionary genomics is to identify the relative roles that various evolutionary forces have played in generating and shaping genetic variation within and among species. Here we use whole-genome re-sequencing data to characterize and compare genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism, site frequency spectrum and population-scaled recombination rates in three species of Populus: P. tremula, P. tremuloides and P. trichocarpa. We find that P. tremuloides has the highest level of genome-wide variation, skewed allele frequencies and population-scaled recombination rates, whereas P. trichocarpa harbors the lowest. Our findings highlight multiple lines of evidence suggesting that natural selection, both due to purifying and positive selection, has widely shaped patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at linked neutral sites in all three species. Differences in effective population sizes and rates of recombination are largely explaining the disparate magnitudes and signatures of linked selection we observe among species. The present work provides the first phylogenetic comparative study at genome-wide scale in forest trees. This information will also improve our ability to understand how various evolutionary forces have interacted to influence genome evolution among related species.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of pest species to laboratory conditions and selection for resistance to toxins in the laboratory are expected to cause inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks that reduce genetic variation. Heliothis virescens, a major cotton pest, has been colonized in the laboratory many times, and a few laboratory colonies have been selected for Bt resistance. We developed 350 bp Double-Digest Restriction-site Associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq) molecular markers to examine and compare changes in genetic variation associated with laboratory adaptation, artificial selection, and inbreeding in this non-model insect species. We found that allelic and nucleotide diversity declined dramatically in laboratory-reared H. virescens as compared with field-collected populations. The declines were primarily due to the loss of low frequency alleles present in field-collected H. virescens. A further, albeit modest decline in genetic diversity was observed in a Bt-selected population. The greatest decline was seen in H. virescens that were sib-mated for 10 generations, where more than 80% of loci were fixed for a single allele. To determine which regions of the genome were resistant to fixation in our sib-mated line, we generated a dense intraspecific linkage map containing 3 PCR-based, and 659 ddRAD-seq markers. Markers that retained polymorphism were observed in small clusters spread over multiple linkage groups, but this clustering was not statistically significant. Here, we confirmed and extended the general expectations for reduced genetic diversity in laboratory colonies, provided tools for further genomic analyses, and produced highly homozygous genomic DNA for future whole genome sequencing of H. virescens.",

    "abstract": "Parasites can take over their hosts and trigger dramatic changes in host appearance and behaviour that are typically interpreted as extended phenotypes to promote parasite survival and fitness1. For example, Toxoplasma gondii manipulates the behaviour of infected rodents to aid transmission to cats2 and parasitic trematodes of the genus Ribeiroia alter limb development in their amphibian hosts to facilitate predation by birds3. Plant parasites and pathogens also reprogram host development and morphology4. Phytoplasma parasites of plants induce extensive leaf-like flower phenotype (phyllody) in their host plants, presumably to attract insect vectors on which these bacteria depend for transmission5,6. However, it remains debatable whether morphological phenotypes, such as phyllody, are directly beneficial to the parasites or are side-products of parasite infection7,8. Previously, we found that phytoplasma virulence protein (effector) SAP54 binds and mediates degradation of host MADS-box transcription factors 26 (MTFs), regulatory hubs of plant development and hormone physiology, to induce phyllody and promote insect vector colonisation5. Here we show that plants heterologously expressing SAP54 are strongly attractive to insects, but surprisingly, insect attraction was independent of the presence of leaf-like flowers. Moreover, plants that produce leaf-like flowers in the absence of SAP54 did not attract insects. We conclude that the SAP54 effector mediates insect vector attraction in host plants by exploiting the role of its MTF targets in insect defence and that perturbation of floral development may be a secondary effect of the effector activity.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the ancestral dynamics of effective population size is a long-standing question in population genetics, which can now be tackled much more accurately thanks to the massive genomic data available in many species. Several promising methods that take advantage of whole-genome sequences have been recently developed in this context. However, they can only be applied to rather small samples, which limits their ability to estimate recent population size history. Besides, they can be very sensitive to sequencing or phasing errors. Here we introduce a new approximate Bayesian computation approach named PopSizeABC that allows estimating the evolution of the effective population size through time, using a large sample of complete genomes. This sample is summarized using the folded allele frequency spectrum and the average zygotic linkage disequilibrium at different bins of physical distance, two classes of statistics that are widely used in population genetics and can be easily computed from unphased and unpolarized SNP data. Our approach provides accurate estimations of past population sizes, from the very first generations before present back to the expected time to the most recent common ancestor of the sample, as shown by simulations under a wide range of demographic scenarios. When applied to samples of 15 or 25 complete genomes in four cattle breeds (Angus, Fleckvieh, Holstein and Jersey), PopSizeABC revealed a series of population declines, related to historical events such as domestication or modern breed creation. We further highlight that our approach is robust to sequencing errors, provided summary statistics are computed from SNPs with common alleles.",

    "abstract": "Physical interactions between genomic regions play critical roles in the regulation of genome functions, including gene expression. However, the methods for confidently detecting physical interactions between genomic regions remain limited. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) (enChIP-Seq) to detect such interactions. In enChIP-Seq, the target genomic region is captured by an engineered DNA-binding complex, such as a CRISPR system consisting of a catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) and a single guide RNA (sgRNA). Subsequently, the genomic regions that physically interact with the target genomic region in the captured complex are sequenced by NGS. Using enChIP-Seq, we found that the 5HS5 locus, which regulates expression of the {beta}-globin genes, interacts with multiple genomic regions upon erythroid differentiation in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Genes near the genomic regions inducibly associated with the 5HS5 locus were transcriptionally up-regulated in the differentiated state, suggesting the existence of a coordinated transcription mechanism directly or indirectly mediated by physical interactions between these loci. Our data suggest that enChIP-Seq is a potentially useful tool for detecting physical interactions between genomic regions in a non-biased manner, which would facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of genome functions.",

An improved understanding of the roles that HOT regions play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying HOT regions across the spectrum of human cell types. We characterised and validated HOT regions in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and produced a catalogue of HOT regions in a broad range of human cell types. We found that HOT regions are associated with genes that control and define the developmental processes of the respective cell and tissue types. We also showed evidence of the developmental persistence of HOT regions at primitive enhancers and demonstrate unique signatures of HOT regions that distinguish them from typical enhancers and super-enhancers. Finally, we performed an epigenetic analysis to reveal the dynamic epigenetic regulation of HOT regions upon H1 differentiation. Taken together, our results provide a resource for the functional exploration of HOT regions and extend our understanding of the key roles of HOT regions in development and differentiation.",

Such cooperation is often via interaction between DBPs that bind to loci located distal in the linear genome but close in the 3D space, referred as trans-cooperation. Due to the lack of 3D chromosomal structure, identification of DBP cooperation has been limited to those binding to neighbor regions in the linear genome, referred as cis-cooperation. Here we present the first study that integrates protein ChIP-seq and Hi-C data to systematically identify both cis- and trans-cooperation between DBPs. We developed a new network model that allows identification of cooperation between multiple DBPs and reveals cell type specific or independent regulations. Particularly interesting, we have retrieved many known and previously unknown trans-cooperation between DBPs in the chromosomal loops that may be a key factor for influencing 3D chromosomal structure.

    "abstract": "Although the cost of high-throughput DNA sequencing continues to drop, extensively characterizing a given cell type using assays such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq is still expensive. As a result, epigenomic characterization of a cell type is typically carried out using a small panel of assay types. Deciding a priori which assays to perform--e.g., a few complementary histone modification ChIP-seq experiments, perhaps an open chromatin assay, plus a few diverse transcription factor assays--is thus a critical step in many studies. Unfortunately, the field currently lacks a principled method for making these choices. We present submodular selection of assays (SSA), a method for choosing a diverse panel of genomic assays that leverages methods from the field of submodular optimization. We also describe a series of evaluation methods that allow us to measure the quality of a selected assay panel in the context of inference tasks such as data imputation, functional element prediction, and semi-automated genome annotation. Applying this evaluation framework to data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics Consortia, we provide empirical evidence that SSA provides high quality panels of assays. The method is computationally efficient and is theoretically optimal under certain assumptions. SSA is extremely flexible, and can be employed to select assays for a new cell type or to select additional assays to be performed in a partially characterized cell type. More generally, this application serves as a model for how submodular optimization can be applied to other discrete problems in biology. SSA is available at http://melodi.ee.washington.edu/assay_panel_selection.html.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs. However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers on a genome-wide scale remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.",

After a brief overview of Actinobacteria biosynthetic potential as compared to other bacterial taxa, we use similarity thresholds derived from 4 pairs of known similar gene clusters to identify up to 40-48% of 3247 gene clusters in our set of genomes as unique. There is no saturation of the cumulative unique gene clusters curve within the examined dataset, and Heaps alpha is 0.129, suggesting an open pan-clustome.

We recently reported an Rnl2-based RASL-seq protocol (RRASL-seq) that offers improved ligation efficiency and a probe decoy strategy to optimize sequencing usage. Here, we describe an open source software package, RASLseqTools, that provides computational methods to design and analyze RASL-seq experiments. Furthermore, using data from a large RRASL-seq experiment, we demonstrate how normalization methods can be used for characterizing and correcting experimental, sequencing, and alignment error. We provide evidence that the three principal predictors of RRASL-seq reproducibility are barcode/probe sequence dissimilarity, sequencing read depth, and normalization strategy. Using dozens of technical and biological replicates across multiple 384-well plates, we find simple normalization strategies yield similar results to more statistically complex methods.",

Methods to prototype and evaluate multiple RNA controls were developed as part of the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) assessment process. These approaches included a modified Latin square design to provide a broad dynamic range of relative abundance with known differences between four complex pools of ERCC RNA transcripts spiked into a human liver total RNA background.\\n\\nRESULTSERCC pools were analyzed on four different microarray platforms: Agilent 1- and 2-color, Illumina bead, and NIAID lab-made spotted microarrays; and two different second-generation sequencing platforms: the Life Technologies 5500xl and the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Individual ERCCs were assessed for reproducible performance in signal response to concentration among the platforms. Most demonstrated linear behavior if they were not located near one of the extremes of the dynamic range. Performance issues with any individual ERCC transcript could be attributed to detection limitations, platform-specific target probe issues, or potential mixing errors. Collectively, these pools of spike-in RNA controls were evaluated for suitability as surrogates for endogenous transcripts to interrogate the performance of the RNA measurement process of each platform. The controls were useful for establishing the dynamic range of the assay, as well as delineating the useable region of that range where differential expression measurements, expressed as ratios, would be expected to be accurate.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThe modified Latin square design presented here uses a composite testing scheme for the evaluation of multiple performance characteristics: linear performance of individual controls, signal response within dynamic range pools of controls, and ratio detection between pairs of dynamic range pools. This compact design provides an economical sample format for the evaluation of multiple external RNA controls within a single experiment per platform. These results indicate that well-designed pools of RNA controls, spiked-into samples, provide measurement assurance for endogenous gene expression experiments.",
