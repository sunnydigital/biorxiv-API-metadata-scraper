    "abstract": "Despite considerable efforts, known genetic associations only explain a small fraction of predicted heritability. Regional associations combine information from multiple contiguous genetic variants and can improve variance explained at established association loci. However, regional associations are not easily amenable to estimation using summary association statistics because of sensitivity to linkage disequilibrium (LD). We now propose a novel method to estimate phenotypic variance explained by regional associations using summary statistics while accounting for LD. Our method is asymptotically equivalent to multiple regression models when no interaction or haplotype effects are present. It has multiple applications, such as ranking of genetic regions according to variance explained or comparison of variance explained by to or more regions. Using height and BMI data from the Health Retirement Study (N=7,776), we show that most genetic variance lies in a small proportion of the genome and that previously identified linkage peaks have higher than expected regional variance.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Bisulfite sequencing is the gold standard method for analyzing methylomes. However, the effect of quality control in bisulfite sequencing has not been studied extensively. We developed a package ME-Plot to detect the errors in bisulfite sequencing mapping data and produce higher quality methylation calls by trimming low quality portions of the reads. Our simulation results on both randomly generated reads where methylation status is known and real world data indicate that ME-plot can detect errors in methylation mapping procedures and suggest post-processing steps to reduce the errors. ME-Plot requires SAM/BAM files for its analysis. Availability: The python package is available at the following URL. https://github.com/joshuabhk/methylsuite",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFerox Trout are large, long-lived piscivorous Brown Trout (Salmo trutta). Due to their exceptionally large size, Ferox Trout are highly sought after by anglers while their life-history strategy, which includes delayed maturation, multiphasic growth and extended longevity, is of interest to ecological and evolutionary modelers. However, despite their recreational and theoretical importance, little is known about the typical abundance of Ferox Trout.\\n\\nMethodsTo rectify this situation a 16 year angling-based mark-recapture study was conducted on Loch Rannoch, which at 19 km2 is one of the largest lakes in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nResultsA hierarchical Bayesian Jolly-Seber analysis of the data suggest that if individual differences in catchability are negligible the population of Ferox Trout in Loch Rannoch in 2009 was approximately 71 fish. The results also suggest that a single, often unaccompanied, highly-experienced angler was able to catch roughly 8% of the available fish on an annual basis.\\n\\nDiscussionIt is recommended that anglers adopt a precautionary approach and release all trout with a fork length [&ge;] 400 mm caught by trolling in Loch Rannoch. There is an urgent need to assess the status of Ferox Trout in other lakes.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

    "abstract": "The genomics era has led to an increase in the dimensionality of the data collected to investigate biological questions. In this context, dimension-reduction techniques can be used to summarize high-dimensional signals into low-dimensional ones, to further test for association with one or more covariates of interest. This paper revisits one such approach, previously known as Principal Component of Heritability and renamed here as Principal Component of Explained Variance (PCEV). As its name suggests, the PCEV seeks a linear combination of outcomes in an optimal manner, by maximising the proportion of variance explained by one or several covariates of interest. By construction, this method optimises power but limited by its computational complexity, it has unfortunately received little attention in the past. Here, we propose a general analytical PCEV framework that builds on the assets of the original method, i.e. conceptually simple and free of tuning parameters. Moreover, our framework extends the range of applications of the original procedure by providing a computationally simple strategy for high-dimensional outcomes, along with exact and asymptotic testing procedures that drastically reduce its computational cost. We investigate the merits of the PCEV using an extensive set of simulations. Furthermore, the use of the PCEV approach will be illustrated using three examples taken from the epigenetics and brain imaging areas.",

    "abstract": "I.Biomedical literature represents one of the largest and fastest growing collections of unstructured biomedical knowledge. Finding critical information buried in the literature can be challenging. In order to extract information from freeflowing text, researchers need to: 1. identify the entities in the text (named entity recognition), 2. apply a standardized vocabulary to these entities (normalization), and 3. identify how entities in the text are related to one another (relationship extraction). Researchers have primarily approached these information extraction tasks through manual expert curation, and computational methods. We have previously demonstrated that named entity recognition (NER) tasks can be crowdsourced to a group of nonexperts via the paid microtask platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); and can dramatically reduce the cost and increase the throughput of biocuration efforts. However, given the size of the biomedical literature even information extraction via paid microtask platforms is not scalable. With our web-based application Mark2Cure (http://mark2cure.org), we demonstrate that NER tasks can also be performed by volunteer citizen scientists with high accuracy. We apply metrics from the Zooniverse Matrices of Citizen Science Success and provide the results here to serve as a basis of comparison for other citizen science projects. Further, we discuss design considerations, issues, and the application of analytics for successfully moving a crowdsourcing workflow from a paid microtask platform to a citizen science platform. To our knowledge, this study is the first application of citizen science to a natural language processing task.",

Applying INC-Seq for 16S rRNA based bacterial profiling generated full-length amplicon sequences with median accuracy >97%.

    "abstract": "Experiments (Clarke et al., Nat. Nanotech., 2009, 4, 265-270) have shown that DNA could be sequenced using a nanopore-based electrolytic cell in which an exonuclease enzyme in the cis chamber cleaves the leading base of a strand of DNA. The base is identified (with a reported accuracy that exceeds 99%) by the level of the current blockade it causes in the pore; a biological adapter inside slows down the base to lower the detection bandwidth required. This approach, which has been mathematically modeled, analyzed, and simulated (Reiner et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2012, 137, 214903; Brady and Reiner, ibid., 2015, 143, 074904), is error-prone because bases may be lost to diffusion or enter the pore out of order. Here a modified cell with three stacked nanopores (UNP, MNP, and DNP) and the enzyme attached to the trans side of UNP is proposed. Translocation of a base is simulated with the random walk of a dimensionless particle; the results show that bases translocate through MNP and DNP in sequence order without loss. If this holds in practice then with a suitably designed adapter and compatible enzyme turnover rates base calling accuracy would be limited only by the accuracy of base discrimination. Potential implementation issues are discussed.",

Subjects between 6 to 20 years of age were included for analysis. After matching the intelligence quotient between groups for each dataset, and removing subjects due to excessive head motion, the resulting effective sample contained 28 females with ASD, 49 TD females, 129 males with ASD, and 141 TD males, with a two (diagnosis) by two (sex) design. Functional connectivity among 153 regions of interest (ROIs) comprising the whole brain was computed. Two by two analysis of variance was used to identify connectivity that showed diagnosis by sex interaction or main effects of diagnosis.\\n\\nResultsThe main effects of diagnosis were found mainly between visual cortex and other brain regions, indicating sex-independent connectivity alterations. We also observed two connections whose connectivity showed diagnosis by sex interaction between the precuneus and medial cerebellum as well as the precunes and dorsal frontal cortex. While males with ASD showed higher connectivity in these connections compared with TD males, females with ASD had lower connectivity than their counterparts.\\n\\nConclusionsBoth sex-dependent and sex-independent functional connectivity alterations are present in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Despite progress in developing small molecule inhibitors, a quantitative understanding of drug action in the physiological context of cells is lacking. Here, we apply single-cell analysis of signal transduction and proliferation to probe cellular responses to small molecule inhibitors. We use the model of cellular activation of T lymphocytes responding to cytokines and antigens. We uncover two distinct modes of drug action, in terms of signaling inhibition: digital inhibition (e.g. when the fraction of activated cells diminishes upon drug treatment, but cells remaining active appear unperturbed), and analog inhibition (e.g. when the fraction of activated cells is unperturbed while their overall activation is diminished). We introduce a computational model of the signaling cascade in order to account for such dichotomy. We test the predictions of our model in terms of the phenotypic variability of cellular responses under drug inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate that the digital/analog dichotomy of cellular response as revealed on short timescales with signal transduction, translates into similar dichotomy on long timescales. Overall, our analysis of drug action at the single cell level illustrates the strength of quantitative approaches to translate the promise of in vitro pharmacology into functionally-relevant cellular settings.",
