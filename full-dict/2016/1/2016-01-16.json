    "abstract": "The  priming effect, in which addition of labile substances changes the rem-ineralization rate of recalcitrant organic matter, has been intensively studied in soils, but is less well-documented in aquatic systems. We investigated the extent to which additions of nutrients or labile organic carbon could influence remineralization rates of 14C-labeled, microbially-degraded, phytoplankton-derived organic matter (OM) in microcosms inoculated with microbial communities drawn from Groves Creek Estuary in coastal Georgia, USA. We found that amendment with labile protein plus phosphorus increased remineralization rates of degraded, phytoplankton-derived OM by up to 100%, whereas acetate slightly decreased remineralization rates relative to an unamended control. Addition of ammonium and phosphate induced a smaller effect, whereas addition of ammonium alone had no effect. Counterintuitively, alkaline phosphatase activities increased in response to the addition of protein under P-replete conditions, indicating that production of enzymes unrelated to the labile priming compound may be a mechanism for the priming effect. The observed priming effect was transient: after 36 days of incubation roughly the same quantity of organic carbon had been mineralized in all treatments including no-addition controls. This timescale is on the order of the typical hydrologic residence times of well-flushed estuaries suggesting that priming in estuaries has the potential to influence whether OC is remineralized in situ or exported to the coastal ocean.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: The alignment of sequencing reads to a transcriptome is a common and important step in many RNA-seq analysis tasks. When aligning RNA-seq reads directly to a transcriptome (as is common in the de novo setting or when a trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. This can pose a substantial computational burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow downstream analysis.\\n\\nResults: We introduce a novel concept, quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. By attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, RapMap-- our tool implementing quasi-mapping-- is capable of mapping sequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools. The algorithm we employ to implement quasi-mapping uses several efficient data structures and takes advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly-accurate mapping information. We demonstrate how quasi-mapping can be successfully applied to the problems of transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq reads and the clustering of contigs from de novo assembled transcriptomes into biologically-meaningful groups.\\n\\nAvailability: RapMap is implemented in C++11 and is available as open-source software, under GPL v3, at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap.\\n\\nContact: rob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu",

    "abstract": "The abundance of bacteria in liquid culture is commonly inferred by measuring optical density at 600 nm. Red fluorescent proteins (RFP) can strongly absorb light at 600 nm. Increasing RFP expression can falsely inflate apparent cell density and lead to underestimations of mean per-cell fluorescence by up to 10%. Measuring optical density at 700 nm would allow estimation of cell abundance unaffected by the presence of nearly all fluorescent proteins.",

    "abstract": "RNA-sequencing of single-cells enables characterization of transcriptional heterogeneity in seemingly homogenous cell populations. In this study we propose and apply a novel method, ISOform-Patterns (ISOP), based on mixture modeling, to characterize the expression patterns of pairs of isoforms from the same gene in single-cell isoform-level expression data. We define six principal patterns of isoform expression relationships and introduce the concept of differential pattern analysis. We applied ISOP for analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from a breast cancer cell line, with replication in two independent datasets. In the primary dataset we detected and assigned pattern type of 16562 isoform-pairs from 4929 genes. Our results showed that 78% of the isoform pairs displayed a mutually exclusive expression pattern, 14% of the isoform pairs displayed bimodal isoform preference and 8% isoform pairs displayed isoform preference. 26% of the isoform-pair patterns were significant, while remaining isoform-pair patterns can be understood as effects of transcriptional bursting, drop-out and biological heterogeneity. 32% of genes discovered through differential pattern analysis were novel and not detected by differential expression analysis. ISOP provides a novel approach for characterization of isoform-level expression in single-cell populations. Our results reveal a common occurrence of isoform-level preference, commitment and heterogeneity in single-cell populations.",

    "abstract": "How should fitness be measured to determine which phenotype or \\\"strategy\\\" is uninvadable when evolution occurs in subdivided populations subject to local demographic and environmental heterogeneity? Several invasion fitness measures, such as basic reproductive number, lifetime dispersal success of a local lineage, or inclusive fitness have been proposed to address this question, but the relationships between them and their generality remains unclear. Here, we ascertain uninvadability (all mutant strategies always go extinct) in terms of the growth rate of a mutant allele arising as a single copy in a population. We show from this growth rate that uninvadability is equivalently characterized by at least three conceptually distinct invasion fitness measures: (i) lineage fitness, giving the average personal fitness of a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; (ii) inclusive fitness, giving a reproductive value weighted average of the direct fitness cost and relatedness weighted indirect fitness benefits accruing to a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; and (iii) three types of reproductive numbers, giving lifetime success of a local lineage. Our analysis connects approaches that have been deemed different, generalizes the exact version of inclusive fitness to class-structured populations, and provides a biological interpretation of selection on a mutant allele under arbitrary strength of selection.",
