    "abstract": "Like a moth into the flame - Phototaxis is an iconic example for innate preferences. Such preferences likely reflect evolutionary adaptations to predictable situations and have traditionally been conceptualized as hard-wired stimulus-response links. Perhaps therefore, the century-old discovery of flexibility in Drosophila phototaxis has received little attention. Here we report that across several different behavioral tests, light/dark preference tested in walking is dependent on various aspects of flight. If we temporarily compromise flying ability, walking photopreference reverses concomitantly. Neuronal activity in circuits expressing dopamine and octopamine, respectively, plays a differential role in photopreference, suggesting a potential involvement of these biogenic amines in this case of behavioral flexibility. We conclude that flies monitor their ability to fly, and that flying ability exerts a fundamental effect on action selection in Drosophila. This work suggests that even behaviors which appear simple and hard-wired comprise a value-driven decision-making stage, negotiating the external situation with the animals internal state, before an action is selected.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSimulation under the coalescent model is ubiquitous in the analysis of genetic data. The rapid growth of real data sets from multiple human populations led to increasing interest in simulating very large sample sizes at whole-chromosome scales.

Analytical and computational treatment of the DTWF, however, is generally harder.\\n\\nResultsWe present a simulator (ARGON) for the DTWF process that scales up to hundreds of thousands of samples and whole-chromosome lengths, with a time/memory performance comparable or superior to currently available methods for coalescent simulation.

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry or CyTOF is an emerging technology for high-dimensional multiparameter single cell analysis that overcomes many limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry. New methods for analyzing CyTOF data attempt to improve automation, scalability, performance, and interpretation of data generated in large studies. Assigning individual cells into discrete groups of cell types (gating) involves time-consuming sequential manual steps, untenable for larger studies. We introduce DeepCyTOF, a standardization approach for gating, based on deep learning techniques. DeepCyTOF requires labeled cells from only a single sample. It is based on domain adaptation principles and is a generalization of previous work that allows us to calibrate between a target distribution and a source distribution in an unsupervised manner. We show that Deep-CyTOF is highly concordant (98%) with cell classification obtained by individual manual gating of each sample when applied to a collection of 16 biological replicates of primary immune blood cells, even when measured accross several instruments. Further, DeepCyTOF achieves very high accuracy on the semi-automated gating challenge of the FlowCAP-I competition as well as two CyTOF datasets generated from primary immune blood cells: (i)14 subjects with a history of infection with West Nile virus (WNV), (ii) 34 healthy subjects of different ages. We conclude that deep learning in general, and DeepCyTOF specifically, offers a powerful computational approach for semi-automated gating of CyTOF and flow cytometry data.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is under threat by the ongoing global change and especially freshwater ecosystems are under threat by intensified land use, water abstraction and other anthropogenic stressors. In order to monitor the impacts that stressors have on freshwater biodiversity, it is important to know the current state of ecosystems and species living in them. This is often hampered by lacking knowledge on species and genetic diversity due to the fact that many taxa are complexes of several morphologically cryptic species. Lacking knowledge on species identity and ecology can lead to wrong biodiversity and stream quality assessments and molecular tools can greatly help resolving this problem. Here, we studied larvae of the caddisfly family Sericostomatidae in the Montseny mountains on the Iberian Peninsula. We expected to find cryptic species and that species would not occur in syntopy due to different ecological niches. We sampled 44 stream sites and sequenced 247 larval specimens for the barcoding region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene. A modeling approach was used to assess the bioclimatic preferences of the found species. Two molecular groups were identified. One could be assigned to Schizopelex furcifera and one to Sericostoma spp. We did find both taxa in syntopy in >50% of sampling sites and could show that the taxa prefer similar bioclimatic conditions. A reexamination of larval specimens showed that Sericostoma and Schizopelex larvae could not be unambiguously identified to the genus level. Overall, our results show the importance of including molecular tools into biodiversity assessments in order to correctly identify the species diversity of a region and to prevent wrong assessment results.",

    "abstract": "GPR4 is a proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor that can be activated by extracellular acidosis. It has recently been demonstrated that activation of GPR4 by acidosis increases the expression of numerous inflammatory and stress response genes in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and also augments EC-leukocyte adhesion. Inhibition of GPR4 by siRNA or small molecule inhibitors reduces endothelial cell inflammation. As acidotic tissue microenvironments exist in many types of inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we examined the role of GPR4 in IBD using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. We observed that GPR4 mRNA expression was increased in mouse and human IBD tissues when compared to control intestinal tissues. To determine the function of GPR4 in IBD, wild-type and GPR4-deficient mice were treated with 3% DSS for 7 days to induce acute colitis. Our results showed that the severity of colitis was decreased in GPR4-deficient DSS-treated mice in comparison to wild-type DSS-treated mice. Clinical parameters, macroscopic disease indicators, and histopathological features were less severe in the DSS-treated GPR4-deficient mice than the DSS-treated wild-type mice. Inflammatory gene expression, leukocyte infiltration, and isolated lymphoid follicle (ILF) formation were reduced in intestinal tissues of DSS-treated GPR4-null mice. Collectively, our results suggest GPR4 provides a pro-inflammatory role in IBD as the absence of GPR4 ameliorates intestinal inflammation in the acute DSS-induced IBD mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic convergence is an exciting outcome of adaptive evolution, occurring when species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the molecular basis of convergence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing convergence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene tree discordance as an alternative driver of convergence levels over time. We demonstrate that gene tree discordance can produce patterns of diminishing convergence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent convergence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of molecular convergence among closely related primate species. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, errors in species tree inference can drive these same patterns. Though intramolecular epistasis is undoubtedly affecting many proteins, our results suggest an additional explanation for this widespread pattern. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene tree discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of molecular evolution.",

Movements of the electrode tip cause recording instabilities while spike amplitudes decline over the weeks/months post-implantation due to glial cell activation caused by sustained mechanical trauma. We compared the glial response over a 26-96 week period following implantation in the rabbit cortex of microwires and a novel flexible electrode. Horizontal sections were used to obtain a depth profile of the radial distribution of microglia, astrocytes and neurofilament. We found that the flexible electrode was associated with decreased gliosis compared to the microwires over these long indwelling periods. This was in part due to a decrease in overall microgliosis and enhanced neuronal density around the flexible probe, especially at longer periods of implantation.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical circuits exhibit spontaneous neuronal activity whose functional relevance remains enigmatic. Several proposed functions assume that sensory experience can influence subsequent spontaneous activity. However, long-term alterations in spontaneous firing rates following sensory stimulation have not been reported until now. Here we show that multi-whisker, spatiotemporally rich stimulation of mouse vibrissae induces a laminar-specific, long-term increase of spontaneous activity in the somatosensory cortex. Such stimulation additionally produces stereotypical neural ensemble firing patterns from simultaneously recorded single neurons, which are maintained during spontaneous activity following stimulus offset. The increased neural activity and concomitant ensemble firing patterns are sustained for at least 25 minutes after stimulation, and specific to layers IV and Vb. In contrast, the same stimulation protocol applied to a single whisker fails to elicit this effect. Since layer Vb has the largest receptive fields and, together with layer IV, receives direct thalamic and lateral drive, the increase in firing activity could be the result of mechanisms involving the integration of spatiotemporal patterns across multiple whiskers. Our results provide direct evidence of modification of spontaneous cortical activity by sensory stimulation and could offer insight into the role of spatiotemporal integration in memory storage mechanisms for complex stimuli.",

To address this question, we propose a framework which couples 3D chromatin folding dynamics, to a \\\"recolouring\\\" process modeling the writing of epigenetic marks. Because many intra-chromatin interactions are mediated by bridging proteins, we consider a \\\"two-state\\\" model with self-attractive interactions between two epigenetic marks which are alike (either active or inactive). This model displays a first-order-like transition between a swollen, epigenetically disordered, phase, and a compact, epigenetically coherent, chromatin globule. If the self-attraction strength exceeds a threshold, the chromatin dynamics becomes glassy, and the corresponding interaction network freezes. By modifying the epigenetic read-write process according to more biologically-inspired assumptions, our polymer model with recolouring recapitulates the ultrasensitive response of epigenetic switches to perturbations, and accounts for long-lived multi-domain conformations, strikingly similar to the topologically-associating-domains observed in eukaryotic chromosomes.",

However, following the removal of motor cortex, rats retain most of their adaptive behaviours, including previously learned skilled movements. Here we revisit these two conflicting views of motor cortex and present a new behaviour assay, challenging animals to respond to unexpected situations while navigating a dynamic obstacle course. Surprisingly, rats with motor cortical lesions show clear impairments facing an unexpected collapse of the obstacles, while showing no impairment with repeated trials in many motor and cognitive metrics of performance. We propose a new role for motor cortex: extending the robustness of sub-cortical movement systems, specifically to unexpected situations demanding rapid motor responses adapted to environmental context.

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation, one of the most classic post-translational modification, plays a critical role in the diverse cellular processes including cell cycle, growth and signal transduction pathways. However, the available information of phosphorylation in fungi is limited. Here we provided a Fungi Phosphorylation Database (FPD) that comprises high-confidence in vivo phosphosites identified by MS-based proteomics in various fungal species. This comprehensive phosphorylation database contains 62,272 non-redundant phosphorylation sites in 11,222 proteins across eight organisms, including Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nidulans, Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe oryzae, Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Cryptococcus neoformans. A fungi-specific phosphothreonine motif and several conserved phosphorylation motif were discovered by comparatively analyzing the pattern of phosphorylation sites in fungi, plants and animals.\\n\\nDatabase URL: http://bis.zju.edu.cn/FPD/index.php",

    "abstract": "Ji et al.,1 recently detailed the structure of the extracytoplasmic Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain of WalK (WalKEC-PAS), the sensor kinase of the essential two-component system WalKR in Staphylococcus aureus. The authors made two independent walK mutants in S. aureus, each with a single amino acid alteration in WalKEC-PAS. They postulated from comparative structural analysis and primary sequence comparisons that these residues might be important for extra cellular signal transduction. We have also been exploring the function of WalKR and were surprised by the striking phenotypic impact of a single amino acid substitutions in the WalK sensor, which were contrary to our own unpublished observations.\\n\\nThe authors subjected their WalKEC-PAS mutants (WalKD119A and WalKVl49A) to a series of phenotypic screens to probe the function of this domain.

    "abstract": "We utilize an Answer Set Programming (ASP) approach to show that the principles of nomenclature are tractable in computational logic. To this end we design a hypothetical, 20 nomenclatural taxon use case with starting conditions that embody several overarching principles of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature; including Binomial Nomenclature, Priority, Coordination, Homonymy, Typification, and the structural requirement of Gender Agreement. The use case ending conditions are triggered by the reinterpretation of the diagnostic features of one of 12 type specimens anchoring the corresponding species-level names. Permutations of this child-to-parent reassignment action lead to 36 alternative scenarios, where each scenario requires 1-14 logically contingent nomenclatural emendations. We show that an ASP transition system approach can correctly infer the Code-mandated changes for each scenario, and visually output the ending conditions. The results provide a foundation for further developing logic-based nomenclatural change optimization and compliance verification services, which could be applied in globally coordinated nomenclatural registries. More generally, logic explorations of nomenclatural and taxonomic change scenarios provide a novel means of assessing design biases inherent in the principles of nomenclature, and thus may inform the design of future, big data-compatible identifier systems for systematic products that recognize and mitigate these constraints.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have identified many genes with rare de novo mutations in autism, but a limited number of these have been conclusively established as disease-susceptibility genes due to lack of recurrence and confounding background mutations. Such extreme genetic heterogeneity severely limits recurrence-based statistical power even in studies with a large sample size. In addition, the cellular contexts in which these genomic lesions confer disease risks remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the use of cell-type specific expression profiles to differentiate mutations in autism patients or unaffected siblings. Using 24 distinct cell types isolated from the mouse central nervous system, we identified an expression signature shared by genes with likely gene disrupting (LGD) mutations detected by exome-sequencing in autism cases. The signature reflects haploinsufficiency of risk genes enriched in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, with the strongest positive associations with specific types of neurons in different brain regions, including cortical neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and striatal medium spiny neurons. Based on this signature, we assigned a D score to all human genes to prioritize candidate autism-susceptibility genes. When applied to genes with only a single LGD mutation in cases, the D score achieved a precision of 40% as compared to the 15% baseline with a minimal loss in sensitivity. Further improvement was made by combining D score and mutation intolerance metrics from ExAC which were derived from orthogonal data sources. The ensemble model achieved precision of 60% and predicted 117 high-priority candidates. These prioritized lists can facilitate identification of additional autism-susceptibility genes.",

    "abstract": "Insect nephrocytes provide a valuable model for kidney disease, as they are structurally and functionally homologous to mammalian kidney podocytes. They possess an exceptional macromolecular assembly, the nephrocyte diaphragm (ND), which serves as a filtration barrier and helps maintain tissue homeostasis by filtering out wastes and toxic products. However, the nephrocyte architecture and elements that maintain the ND are not understood. We show that Drosophila nephrocytes have a unique cytoplasmic cluster of F-actin, which is maintained by the microtubule cytoskeleton and Rho-GTPases. A balance of Racl and Cdc42 activity as well as proper microtubule organization is required for positioning the actin cluster. Further, ND proteins Sns and Duf also localize to this cluster and regulate organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Perturbation of any of these inter-dependent components impairs nephrocyte ultrafiltration. Thus cytoskeletal components, Rho-GTPases and ND proteins work in concert to maintain the specialized nephrocyte architecture and function.",
