    "abstract": "Better protocols and decreasing costs have made high-throughput sequencing experiments now accessible even to small experimental laboratories. However, comparing one or few experiments generated by an individual lab to the vast amount of relevant data freely available in the public domain might be limited due to lack of bioinformatics expertise. Though several tools, including genome browsers, allow such comparison at a single gene level, they do not provide a genome-wide view. We developed Heat*seq, a web-tool that allows genome scale comparison of high throughput experiments (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and CAGE) provided by a user, to the data in the public domain. Heat*seq currently contains over 12,000 experiments across diverse tissue and cell types in human, mouse and drosophila. Heat*seq displays interactive correlation heatmaps, with an ability to dynamically subset datasets to contextualise user experiments. High quality figures and tables are produced and can be downloaded in multiple formats.\\n\\nAvailabilityWeb application: www.heatstarseq.roslin.ed.ac.uk/.

    "abstract": "Deleterious mutations are expected to evolve under negative selection and are usually purged from the population. However, deleterious alleles segregate in the human population and some disease-associated variants are maintained at considerable frequencies. Here we test the hypothesis that balancing selection may counteract purifying selection in neighboring regions and thus maintain deleterious variants at higher frequency than expected from their detrimental fitness effect. We first show in realistic simulations that balancing selection reduces the density of polymorphic sites surrounding a locus under balancing selection, but at the same time markedly increases the population frequency of the remaining variants, including even substantially deleterious alleles. To test the predictions of our simulations empirically, we then use whole exome sequencing data from 6,500 human individuals and focus on the most established example for balancing selection in the human genome, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our analysis shows an elevated frequency of putatively deleterious coding variants in non-HLA genes localized in the MHC region. The mean frequency of these variants declined with physical distance from the classical HLA genes, indicating dependency on genetic linkage. These results reveal an indirect cost of the genetic diversity maintained by balancing selection, which has hitherto been perceived as mostly advantageous, and have implications both for the evolution of recombination and also for the epidemiology of various MHC-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Many epithelial tissues within large multicellular organisms are continually replenished by small independent populations of stem cells. These stem cells divide within their niches and differentiate into the constituent cell types of the tissue, and are largely responsible for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Mutations can accumulate in stem cell niches and change the rate of stem cell division and differentiation, contributing to both aging and tumorigenesis. Here, we create a mathematical model of the intestinal stem cell niche, crypt system, and epithelium. We calculate the expected effect of fixed mutations in stem cell niches and their expected effect on tissue homeostasis throughout the intestinal epithelium over the lifetime of an organism. We find that, due to the small population size of stem cell niches, fixed mutations are expected to accumulate via genetic drift and decrease stem cell fitness, leading to niche and tissue attrition, and contributing to organismal aging. We also explore mutation accumulation at various stem cell niche sizes, and demonstrate that an evolutionary trade-off exists between niche size, tissue aging, and the risk of tumorigenesis; where niches exist at a size that minimizes the probability of tumorigenesis, at the expense of accumulating deleterious mutations due to genetic drift. Finally, we show that the probability of tumorigenesis and the extent of aging trade-off differently depending on whether mutational effects confer a selective advantage, or not, in the stem cell niche.",

    "abstract": "Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) is a legume crop that is resilient to hot and drought-prone climates, and a primary source of protein in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world. However, genome resources for cowpea have lagged behind most other major crop plants. Here we describe foundational genome resources and their application to analysis of germplasm currently in use in West African breeding programs. Resources developed from the African cultivar IT97K-499-35 include bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries and a BAC-based physical map, assembled sequences from 4,355 BACs, as well as a whole-genome shotgun (WGS) assembly. These resources and WGS sequences of an additional 36 diverse cowpea accessions supported the development of a genotyping assay for over 50,000 SNPs, which was then applied to five biparental RIL populations to produce a consensus genetic map containing 37,372 SNPs. This genetic map enabled the anchoring of 100 Mb of WGS and 420 Mb of BAC sequences, an exploration of genetic diversity along each linkage group, and clarification of macrosynteny between cowpea and common bean. The genomes of West African breeding lines and landraces have regions of marked depletion of diversity, some of which coincide with QTL that may be the result of artificial selection or environmental adaptation. The new publicly available resources and knowledge help to define goals and accelerate the breeding of improved varieties to address food security issues related to limited-input small-holder farming and climate stress.",

    "abstract": "Capillaric circuits (CCs) are advanced capillary microfluidic devices that move liquids in complex pre-programmed sequences without external pumps and valves-relying instead on microfluidic control elements powered by capillary forces. CCs were thought to require high-precision micro-scale features manufactured by photolithography in a cleanroom, which is slow and expensive. Here we present rapidly and inexpensively 3D-printed autonomous CCs. Molds for CCs were fabricated with a benchtop 3D-printer, Poly(dimethylsiloxane) replicas were made, and fluidic functionality was verified with aqueous solutions. We established design rules for 3D-printed CCs by a combination of modelling and experimentation. The functionality and reliability of 3D-printed trigger valves-an essential fluidic element that stops one liquid until flow is triggered by a second liquid-was tested for different geometries and different solutions. Trigger valves with geometries up to 80-fold larger than cleanroom-fabricated ones were found to function reliably. We designed 3D-printed retention burst valves that encode sequential liquid drainage and delivery using capillary pressure differences encoded by varying valve height and width. Using an electrical circuit analogue of the CC, we established circuit design rules for ensuring strictly sequential liquid delivery. We realized a 3D-printed CC with reservoir volumes 60 times larger than cleanroom-fabricated circuits and autonomously delivered eight liquids in a pre-determined sequence in < 7 min, exceeding the number of sequentially-encoded, self-regulated fluidic delivery events apreviously reported. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 3D-printing enables rapid prototyping of reliable CCs with improved functionality and potential applications in diagnostics, research and education.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an important tool used by cell biologists to study the diffusion and binding kinetics of vesicles, proteins, and other molecules in the cytoplasm, nucleus or cell membrane. While many FRAP models have been developed over the past decades, the influence of the complex boundaries of three-dimensional cellular geometries on the recovery curves, in conjunction with ROI and optical effects (imaging, photobleaching, photoswitching, and scanning), has not been well studied. Here, we developed a three-dimensional computational model of the FRAP process that incorporates particle diffusion, cell boundary effects, and the optical properties of the scanning confocal microscope, and validated this model using the tip-growing cells of Physcomitrella patens. We then show how these cell boundary and optical effects confound the interpretation of FRAP recovery curves, including the number of dynamic states of a given fluorescent protein, in a wide range of cellular geometries-both in two and three dimensions-namely nuclei, filopodia, and lamellipodia of mammalian cells, and in cell types such as the budding yeast, S. pombe, and tip-growing plant cells. We explored the performance of existing analytical and algorithmic FRAP models in these various cellular geometries, and determined that the VCell VirtualFRAP tool provides the best accuracy to measure diffusion coefficients. Our computational model is not limited only to these cells types, but can easily be extended to other cellular geometries via the graphical Java-based application we also provide. This particle-based simulation-called the Digital Confocal Microscopy Suite, DCMS-can also perform fluorescence dynamics assays, such as Number and Brightness (N&B), Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS), and could help shape the way these techniques are interpreted.",

A surprising diversity of regulatory mechanisms is being uncovered not only between insect Orders, but also within the Order of the Diptera. This raises the question whether the same diversity of regulatory mechanisms exists within other insect Orders. This paper draws attention to the promise of the pea beetle Callosobruchus maculatus for elucidating the evolution of pattern regulation mechanisms in Coleoptera and other insect Orders. Introduction of RNase in eggs of Callosobruchus replaces anterior segments with posterior segments oriented in mirror image symmetry to the original posterior segments (double abdomens). Reversal is specific for RNase activity, for treatment of the anterior egg pole and for cytoplasmic RNA. Yield depends on developmental stage, enzyme concentration and temperature. A maximum of 30% of treated eggs reversed segment sequence after puncture in 10.0 g/ml RNase S reconstituted from S-protein and S-peptide at 30 {degrees}C. This result sets the stage for an analysis of the genetic regulation of segment pattern formation in the long germ embryo of the Coleopteran Callosobruchus and for comparison with the short germ embryo of the Coleopteran Tribolium.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome is organized into submegabase-sized chromatin domains (CDs) including topologically associating domains, which have been identified using chromosome conformation capture-based methods. Single-nucleosome imaging in living mammalian cells has revealed subdiffusively dynamic nucleosome movement. It is unclear how single nucleosomes within CDs fluctuate and how the CD structure reflects the nucleosome movement. Here, we present a polymer model wherein CDs are characterized by fractal dimensions and the nucleosome fibers fluctuate in a viscoelastic medium with memory. We analytically show that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of nucleosome fluctuations within CDs is subdiffusive. The diffusion coefficient and the subdiffusive exponent depend on the structural information of CDs. This analytical result enabled us to extract information from the single-nucleosome imaging data for HeLa cells. Our observation that the MSD is lower at the nuclear periphery region than the interior region indicates that CDs in the heterochromatin-rich nuclear periphery region are more compact than those in the euchromatin-rich interior region with respect to the fractal dimensions as well as the size. Finally, we evaluated that the average size of CDs is in the range of 100-500 nm and that the relaxation time of nucleosome movement within CDs is a few seconds. Our results provide physical and dynamic insights into the genome architecture in living cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe mammalian genome is partitioned into topological chromatin domains (CDs) in the living cell nuclei. Gene expression is highly regulated within CDs according to their structure, whereas chromatin itself is highly dynamic. This raises the following question: how is the CD structure in such dynamic chromatin? We developed a conceptual framework that unifies chromatin dynamics and structure. Using a polymer model with a fractal domain structure in a viscoelastic medium, we analytically show that nucleosome movement is subdiffusive and depends on CD structure. Hence, structural information can be extracted based on nucleosome movement in living cells with single-particle tracking experiments. This framework provides physical insights into the relationship between dynamic genome organization and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Since domestication, population bottlenecks, breed formation, and selective breeding have radically shaped the genealogy and genetics of Bos taurus. In turn, characterization of population structure among globally diverse bull genomes enables detailed assessment of genetic resources and origins. By analyzing 432 unrelated bull genomes from 13 breeds and 16 countries, we demonstrate genetic diversity and structural complexity among the global bull population. Importantly, we relaxed a strong assumption of discrete or admixed population, by adapting latent variable models for individual-specific allele frequencies that directly capture a wide range of complex structure from genome-wide genotypes. We identified a highly complex population structure that defies the conventional hypothesis based on discrete membership and contributes to pervasive genetic differentiation in bull genomes. As measured by magnitude of differentiation, selection pressure on SNPs within genes is substantially greater than that on intergenic regions. Additionally, broad regions of chromosome 6 harboring largest genetic differentiation suggest positive selection underlying population structure. We carried out gene set analysis using SNP annotations to identify enriched functional categories such as energy-related processes and multiple development stages. Our comprehensive analysis of bull population structure can support genetic management strategies that capture structural complexity and promote sustainable genetic breadth.",

    "abstract": "If improvements are to be made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, an increased understanding of disease in the lung is needed. Studies have shown that bacteria in a less metabolically active state, associated with the presence of lipid bodies, are less susceptible to antibiotics, and recent results have highlighted the disparity in concentration of different compounds into lesions. Treatment success therefore depends critically on the responses of the individual bacteria that constitute the infection.\\n\\nWe propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the cellular level, linking the behaviour of individual bacteria and host cells with the macroscopic behaviour of the microenvironment. The individual elements (bacteria, macrophages and T cells) are modelled using cellular automaton (CA) rules, and the evolution of oxygen, drugs and chemokine dynamics are incorporated in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in the pathological lesion. We allow bacteria to switch states depending on oxygen concentration, which affects how they respond to treatment. This is the first multiscale model of its type to consider both oxygen-driven phenotypic switching of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antibiotic treatment. Using this model, we investigate the role of bacterial cell state and of initial bacterial location on treatment outcome. We demonstrate that when bacteria are located further away from blood vessels, less favourable outcomes are more likely, i.e. longer time before infection is contained/cleared, treatment failure or later relapse. We also show that in cases where bacteria remain at the end of simulations, the organisms tend to be slower-growing and are often located within granulomas, surrounded by caseous material.",

    "abstract": "1Eukaryotes carry numerous asexual cytoplasmic genomes (mitochondria and plastids). Lacking recombination, asexual genomes should theoretically suffer from impaired adaptive evolution. Yet, empirical evidence indicates that cytoplasmic genomes experience higher levels of adaptive evolution than predicted by theory. In this study, we use a computational model to show that the unique biology of cytoplasmic genomes--specifically their organization into host cells and their uniparental (maternal) inheritance--enable them to undergo effective adaptive evolution. Uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes decreases competition between different beneficial substitutions (clonal interference), promoting the accumulation of beneficial substitutions. Uniparental inheritance also facilitates selection against deleterious cytoplasmic substitutions, slowing Mullers ratchet. In addition, uniparental inheritance generally reduces genetic hitchhiking of deleterious substitutions during selective sweeps. Overall, uniparental inheritance promotes adaptive evolution by increasing the level of beneficial substitutions relative to deleterious substitutions. When we assume that cytoplasmic genome inheritance is biparental, decreasing the number of genomes transmitted during gametogenesis (bottleneck) aids adaptive evolution. Nevertheless, adaptive evolution is always more efficient when inheritance is uniparental. Our findings explain empirical observations that cytoplasmic genomes--despite their asexual mode of reproduction--can readily undergo adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) occurs in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. While PCD plays a key role in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms, explaining why single-celled organisms would evolve to actively commit suicide has been far more challenging. Here, we explore the potential for PCD to act as an accessory to microbial bet-hedging strategies that utilize stochastic phenotype switching. We consider organisms that face unpredictable and recurring disasters, in which fitness depends on effective phenotypic diversification. We show that when reproductive opportunities are limited by carrying capacity, PCD drives population turnover, providing increased opportunities for phenotypic diversification through stochastic phenotype switching. The main cost of PCD, providing resources for growth to a PCD(-) competitor, is ameliorated by genetic assortment driven by population spatial structure. Using three dimensional agent based simulations, we explore how basic demographic factors, namely cell death and clonal reproduction, can create populations with sufficient spatial structure to favor the evolution of high PCD rates.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome studies have documented that most Native American ancestry stems from a single population that diversified within the continent more than twelve thousand years ago. However, this shared ancestry hides a more complex history whereby at least four distinct streams of Eurasian migration have contributed to present-day and prehistoric Native American populations. Whole genome studies enhanced by technological breakthroughs in ancient DNA now provide evidence of a sequence of events involving initial migration from a structured Northeast Asian source population, followed by a divergence into northern and southern Native American lineages. During the Holocene, new migrations from Asia introduced the Saqqaq/Dorset Paleoeskimo population to the North American Arctic ~4,500 years ago, ancestry that is potentially connected with ancestry found in Athabaskan-speakers today. This was then followed by a major new population turnover in the high Arctic involving Thule-related peoples who are the ancestors of present-day Inuit.

    "abstract": "Mainstream cognitive science and neuroscience both rely heavily on the notion of representation in order to explain the full range of our behavioral repertoire. The relevant feature of representation is its ability to designate (stand in for) spatially or temporally distant properties, When we organize our behavior with respect to mental or neural representations, we are (in principle) organizing our behavior with respect to the property it designates. While representational theories are a potentially a powerful foundation for a good cognitive theory, problems such as grounding and system-detectable error remain unsolved. For these and other reasons, ecological explanations reject the need for representations and do not treat the nervous system as doing any mediating work. However, this has left us without a straight-forward vocabulary to engage with so-called  representation-hungry problems or the role of the nervous system in cognition.\n\nIn an effort to develop such a vocabulary, here we show that James J Gibsons ecological information functions to designate the ecologically-scaled dynamical world to an organism. We then show that this designation analysis of information leads to an ecological conceptualization of the neural activity caused by information, which in turn we argue can together support intentional behavior with respect to spatially and temporally distal properties. Problems such as grounding and error detection are solved via law-based specification. This analysis extends the ecological framework into the realm of  representation-hungry problems, making it as powerful a potential basis for theories of behavior as traditional cognitive approaches. The resulting analysis does, according to some definitions, allow information and the neural activity to be conceptualized as representations; however, the key work is done by information and the analysis remains true to Gibsons ecological ontology.",

Many of these applications are apropos to efforts to eliminate Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria from locations throughout the world, yet the serial interval for this disease is poorly understood quantitatively.\\n\\nResults: To obtain a quantitative estimate of the serial interval for Pf malaria, we took the sum of components of the Pf malaria transmission cycle based on a combination of mathematical models and empirical data. During this process, we identified a number of factors that account for substantial variability in the serial interval across different contexts. Treatment with antimalarial drugs roughly halves the serial interval, seasonality results in different serial intervals at different points in the transmission season, and variability in within-host dynamics results in many individuals whose serial intervals do not follow average behavior.\\n\\nConclusions: These results have important implications for epidemiological applications that rely on quantitative estimates of the serial interval of Pf malaria and other diseases characterized by prolonged infections and complex ecological drivers.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation mainly controls how genes are expressed and how cells behave based on the transcription factor (TF) proteins that bind upstream of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. These TF DNA binding sites (TFBSs) are usually short (5-15 base pairs) and degenerate (some positions can have multiple possible alternatives). Traditionally, computational methods scan DNA sequences using the position weight matrix (PWM) of a given TF, calculate binding scores for each K-mer against the PWM, and finally classify a K-mer as to whether it is a putative TFBS or a background sequence based on a cut-off threshold. The FSCAN system, which is proposed in this paper, employs machine learning techniques to build a learner model that is able to identify TFBSs in a set of bound sequences without the need for a cut-off threshold. Our proposed method utilizes fuzzy inference techniques along with a distribution-based filtering algorithm to predict the binding sites of a TF given its PWM model and phastCons scores for the input DNA sequences. Data imbalance reduction techniques are also used to ease the learning of the adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm. The proposed system is tested on 22 ChIP-chip sequence-sets from the Saccharomyces Cerevisiae genome. Our results show that FSCAN outperforms other approaches like MatInspector and MATCH and is quite robust. As more transcriptional data becomes available, our proposed framework encourages the use of fuzzy logic techniques in the prediction of TFBSs.",

The objectives of this study were to determine if female V. carolinianus prefer to form aggregations under large cover objects or seek out retreat sites where they would be the sole occupant. Based on past research, we hypothesized that females would form aggregations under large cover objects instead of being the sole occupant. A total of 32 scorpions were captured during August and September 2014. During laboratory trials, three scorpions were placed in a plywood tray containing sand substrate and three equally-sized large ceramic tiles. The scorpions were left undisturbed for a 24-hour period, after which the tiles were lifted to check for aggregations. Each group of three scorpions was in the research tray for three consecutive days. Four rounds of aggregation trials were conducted, and t-tests as well as linear regression were used to analyze the data collected. The results of the t-test showed that female V. carolinianus, when given a choice of similarly-sized large cover objects, would select a retreat site where they were the sole occupant; therefore, our initial hypothesis was rejected. Linear regression found relative humidity affected aggregation occurrence, for the largest number of aggregations occurred when the relative humidity was between 67 and 73%.",

Little is known about its ecology, so the objectives of my study were to determine if: (1) V. carolinianus selected cover objects based on surface area; (2) V. carolinianus preferred moister soils under the cover object; and (3) length of time in captivity altered the preferences. Scorpions were captured from two different locations: (1) a roadcut parallel to State Highway 96 near Edgar Evins State Park; (2) France Mountain in Overton County. In laboratory trials, scorpions were allowed to choose among three retreat sites and three soil moisture levels. Transects were established at both field locations to count and measure rocks that may serve as retreat sites. Surface area trials indicated that V. carolinianus selected large objects as retreat sites most often, but overall retreat site selection did not differ from that expected based on random choice weighted by cover object size. Soil moisture trial results varied, with no statistical significance in the results from the Highway 96 and 2013 France Mountain populations. The 2014 France Mountain population did show statistically significant differences. The surface area trials did not exhibit a time in captivity effect, but the soil moisture trials indicated a time in captivity effect between the 2013 and 2014 France Mountain populations. Based on test results, it appears V. carolinianus selected larger rocks as cover sites, perhaps due to chance or perhaps to escape sunlight and heat, for predator avoidance, or for higher soil moisture levels.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) offers many benefits, but major factors limiting NGS include reducing costs of: 1) start-up (i.e., doing NGS for the first time); 2) buy-in (i.e., getting the smallest possible amount of data from a run); and 3) sample preparation. Reducing sample preparation costs is commonly addressed, but start-up and buy-in costs are rarely addressed. We present dual-indexing systems to address all three of these issues. By breaking the library construction process into universal, re-usable, combinatorial components, we reduce all costs, while increasing the number of samples and the variety of library types that can be combined within runs. We accomplish this by extending the Illumina TruSeq dual-indexing approach to 768 (384 + 384) indexed primers that produce 384 unique dual-indexes or 147,456 (384 x 384) unique combinations. We maintain eight nucleotide indexes, with many that are compatible with Illumina index sequences. We synthesized these indexing primers, purifying them with only standard desalting and placing small aliquots in replicate plates. In qPCR validation tests, 206 of 208 primers tested passed (99% success). We then created hundreds of libraries in various scenarios. Our approach reduces start-up and per-sample costs by requiring only one universal adapter that works with indexed PCR primers to uniquely identify samples. Our approach reduces buy-in costs because: 1) relatively few oligonucleotides are needed to produce a large number of indexed libraries; and 2) the large number of possible primers allows researchers to use unique primer sets for different projects, which facilitates pooling of samples during sequencing. Our libraries make use of standard Illumina sequencing primers and index sequence length and are demultiplexed with standard Illumina software, thereby minimizing customization headaches. In subsequent Adapterama papers, we use these same primers with different adapter stubs to construct amplicon and restriction-site associated DNA libraries, but their use can be expanded to any type of library sequenced on Illumina platforms.",
