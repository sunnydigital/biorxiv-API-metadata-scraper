    "abstract": "Because of the potential link between -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting and response of a pseudoknot (PK) RNA to force, a number of single molecule pulling experiments have been performed on PKs to decipher the mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Motivated in part by these experiments, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces (fs) and monovalent salt concentrations (Cs). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By varying f and C, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states. As f and C are changed, the stem-loop tertiary interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding of the 3-end hairpin (I{rightleftharpoons}F). Finally, the 5-end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state (E{rightleftharpoons}I). A theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as (log Cm) with  = 1 (0.5) for E{rightleftharpoons}I (I{rightleftharpoons}F) transition. This relation is used to obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be quantitatively measured in single-molecule experiments, as done previously for DNA hairpins. A by-product of our work is the suggestion that the frameshift efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the 5 end hairpin that the ribosome first encounters during translation.",

    "abstract": "Fast and accurate alignment of long-reads plays an important role in reducing the overall cost of long-read sequencing. In this paper, we propose Meta-aligner, an efficient and accurate long-read aligner that exploits the statistics of reference genome to improve performance in terms of reducing time complexity and achieving significantly higher recall for very noisy and long reads. The first step of algorithm adopts well-known short-read aligners in order to rapidly align a large fraction of reads through a progressive process of aligning read fragments to the reference genome. In the second phase, the remaining reads are handled by simultaneous alignment of all read fragments and a decision making process which exploits the overall information provided by the corresponding mapped fragments. By using this procedure, significant performance improvement is attained in comparison with traditional schemes in the case of PacBio long-reads.",

    "abstract": "Transcript levels are a critical determinant of the proteome and hence cellular function. Because the transcriptome is an outcome of the interactions between genes and their products, it may be accurately represented by a subset of transcript abundances. We developed a method, Tradict (transcriptome predict), capable of learning and using the expression measurements of a small subset of 100 marker genes to predict transcriptome-wide gene abundances and the expression of a comprehensive, but interpretable list of transcriptional programs that represent the major biological processes and pathways of the cell. By analyzing over 23,000 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, we show that Tradict is robust to noise and accurate. Coupled with targeted RNA sequencing, Tradict may therefore enable simultaneous transcriptome-wide screening and mechanistic investigation at large scales.",

    "abstract": "The visual system has the remarkable ability to integrate fragmentary visual input into a perceptually organized collection of surfaces and objects, a process we refer to as perceptual integration. Despite a long tradition of perception research, it is not known whether access to consciousness is required to complete perceptual integration. To investigate this question, we manipulated access to consciousness using the attentional blink. We show that behaviorally, the attentional blink impairs perceptual decisions about the presence of integrated surface structure from fragmented input. However, when applying a multivariate classifier to electroencephalogram (EEG) data, the ability to decode the presence of integrated percepts remains intact when conscious access is impaired. In contrast, when disrupting consciousness through masking, decisions about integrated percepts and decoding of integrated percepts are impaired in concert with each other, while leaving feedforward representations intact. Together, these data show a dissociation between access to consciousness and perceptual integration.\\n\\nSignificance statementOur brain constantly selects salient and/or goal-relevant objects from the visual environment, so that it can operate on neural representations of these objects. But what is the fate of objects that are not selected? Are these discarded, so that the brain only has an impoverished non-perceptual representation of them? Or does the brain construct perceptually rich representations, even when objects are not consciously accessed by our cognitive system? Here we answer that question by manipulating the information that enters into awareness, while simultaneously measuring cortical activity using EEG. We show that objects that do not enter consciousness can nevertheless have a neural signature that is indistinguishable from perceptually rich representations that occur for objects that do enter into conscious awareness.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of sex-determination systems are of particular interest in insect vectors of human pathogens like mosquitoes because novel control strategies aim to convert pathogen-transmitting females into non-biting males, or rely on accurate sexing for the release of sterile males. In Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue and Zika viruses, sex determination is governed by a dominant male-determining locus, previously thought to reside within a small, non-recombining, sex-determining region (SDR) of an otherwise homomorphic sex chromosome. Here, we provide evidence that sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti are genetically differentiated between males and females over a region much larger than the SDR. Our linkage mapping intercrosses failed to detect recombination between X and Y chromosomes over a 123-Mbp region (40% of their physical length) containing the SDR. This region of reduced male recombination overlapped with a smaller 63-Mbp region (20% of the physical length of the sex chromosomes) displaying high male-female genetic differentiation in unrelated wild population from Brazil and Australia and in a reference laboratory strain originating from Africa. In addition, the sex-differentiated genomic region was associated with a significant excess of male-to-female heterozygosity and contained a small cluster of loci consistent with Y-specific null alleles. We demonstrate that genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes is sufficient to assign individuals to their correct sex with high accuracy. We also show how data on allele frequency differences between sexes can be used to estimate linkage disequilibrium between loci and the sex-determining locus. Our discovery of large-scale genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti lays a new foundation for mapping and population genomic studies, as well as for mosquito control strategies targeting the sex-determination pathway.",

    "abstract": "Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system is largely carried out by AMPA-sensitive ionotropic glutamate receptors. Localized within the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic spines, AMPA receptors are composed of heterotetrameric receptor assemblies associated with auxiliary subunits, the most common of which are transmembrane AMPA-receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). The association of TARPs with AMPA receptors modulates the kinetics of receptor gating and pharmacology, as well as trafficking. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the homomeric GluA2 AMPA receptor saturated with TARP {gamma}2 subunits, showing how the TARPs are arranged with four-fold symmetry around the ion channel domain, making extensive interactions with the M1, M2 and M4 TM helices. Poised like partially opened  hands underneath the two-fold symmetric ligand binding domain (LBD)  clamshells, one pair of TARPs are juxtaposed near the LBD dimer interface, while the other pair are near the LBD dimer-dimer interface. The extracellular  domains of TARP are positioned to not only modulate LBD  clamshell closure, but also to affect conformational rearrangements of the LBD layer associated with receptor activation and desensitization, while the TARP transmembrane (TM) domains buttress the ion channel pore.",

    "abstract": "Habitat loss and fragmentation is one of the most severe threats to global biodiversity. Because human development often fragments natural areas into habitat \\\"islands\\\", studies which characterize the genetic structure of species isolated on oceanic islands may provide insight into the management of anthropogenic habitat islands. The San Clemente Island night lizard, Xantusia riversiana reticulata, is endemic to two California Channel Islands, each with a history of anthropogenic disturbance. We genotyped 917 individuals from San Clemente Island and Santa Barbara Island at 23 microsatellite loci to quantify population structure and identify natural and anthropogenic landscape features affecting intra-island connectivity. We found significant, but shallow, population structure on each island with sites < 400 m apart identified as distinct genepools. Landscape genetic analyses identified conductive habitat as California boxthorn and prickly pear cactus on both islands. Landscape features which decreased connectivity were unique to each island and included natural and human-mediated features. These results can inform management plans on each island by identifying habitat targets for mitigation and restoration efforts designed to improve connectivity. Our results highlight the need for considering fine-scale features correlated with contemporary and historical patterns of fragmentation, especially in small and isolated habitats on the mainland that may be analogous to oceanic islands.",

    "abstract": "Cells monitor protein folding by an inbuilt quality-control system in which incorrectly or misfolded folded proteins are tagged for degradation or sent back through a refolding cycle. However, continued accumulation of incorrectly folded proteins triggers the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which attempts to re-establish folding homeostasis or commits the cell to apoptosis. In this study, we developed a family of mechanistic models of the mammalian UPR system. An ensemble of models parameters was estimated by minimizing the difference between simulations and experimental measurements using multiobjective optimization. The ensemble of model parameters was validated using cross-validation. Analysis of the model ensemble suggested the three branches of UPR fired simultaneously. However, the importance of each brach was ranked ordered in time; PERK and IRE1 were more important early, while ATF6 was important later in the response. The activity of all three branches as coordinated by the molecular chaperone BiP. Model analysis suggested that BiP feedback was critical to the overall robustness of the system. Removal of any one branch of BiP feedback, destabilized the other branches. On the other hand, removal of all nodes of BiP feedback increased the overall robustness of the system. Thus, while BiP feedback is crucial to allowing the cell to adapt to small perturbations, it also makes the system fragile and susceptible to manipulation.",

    "abstract": "The poly(A) tail, co-transcriptionally added to most eukaryotic RNAs, plays an important role in post-transcriptional regulation through modulating mRNA stability and translational efficiency. The length of the poly(A) tail is dynamic, decreasing or increasing in response to various stimuli through the action of enzymatic complexes, and changes in tail length are exploited in regulatory pathways implicated in various biological processes.\\n\\nTo date, assessment of poly(A) tail length has mostly relied on protocols targeting only a few transcripts. We present PASP ( poly(A) tail sequencing protocol), a whole-transcriptome approach to measure tail lengths -- including a computational pipeline implementing all necessary analyses. PASP uses direct Illumina sequencing of cDNA fragments obtained through G-tailing of poly(A)-selected mRNA followed by fragmentation and reverse transcription.\\n\\nAnalysis of reads corresponding to spike-in poly(A) tracts of known length indicated that mean tail lengths can be confidently measured, given sufficient coverage. We further explored the utility of our approach by comparing tail lengths estimated from wild type and {Delta}ccr4-1/pan2 mutant yeasts. The yeast whole-transcriptome tail length distributions showed high consistency between biological replicates, and the expected upward shift in tail lengths in the mutant samples was detected. This suggests that PASP is suitable for the assessment of global polyadenylation status in yeast.\\n\\nThe correlation of per-transcript mean tail lengths between biological and technical replicates was low (higher between mutant samples). Both, however, reached high values after filtering for transcripts with greater coverage. We also compare our results with those of other methods. We identify a number of improvements that could be used in future PASP experiments and, based on our results, believe that direct sequencing of poly(A) tails can become the method of choice for studying polyadenylation using the Illumina platform",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance and wide exploitation of heterosis in commercial crop breeding, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not well understood. Interestingly, there is growing evidence that beside genetic also epigenetic factors contribute to heterosis. Here we used near-isogenic but epigenetically divergent parents to create epigenetic F1 hybrids (epiHybrids) in Arabidopsis, allowing us to quantify the contribution of epigenetics to heterosis. We measured traits such as leaf area (LA), growth rate (GR), flowering time (FT), main stem branching (MSB), rosette branching (RB) and final plant height (HT) and observed several strong positive and negative heterotic phenotypes among the epiHybrids. For LA and HT mainly positive heterosis was observed, while FT and MSB mostly displayed negative heterosis. Heterosis for FT, LA and HT could be associated with several heritable, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the parental genomes. These DMRs contain 35 (FT and LA) and 14 (HT) genes, which may underlie the heterotic phenotypes observed. In conclusion, our study indicates that epigenetic divergence can be sufficient to cause heterosis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCrossing two genetically distinct parents generates hybrid offspring. Sometimes hybrids are performing better than their parents in particular traits and this is referred to as heterosis. Hybridization and heterosis are naturally occurring processes and crop breeders intentionally cross genetically different parental lines in order to generate hybrids with maximized traits such as yield or stress tolerance. So far, the mechanisms behind heterosis are not well understood. In this study we focused on the effect of epigenetic variation onto heterosis in hybrids, and for this purpose we created epigenetic hybrids (epiHybrids) by crossing wildtype plants with a selection of genetically very similar but epigenetically divergent lines. An extensive phenotypic analysis of the epiHybrids and their parental lines showed that epigenetic divergence between parental genomes can be a major determinant of heterosis. Importantly, multiple heterotic phenotypes could be associated with meiotically heritable differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the parental genomes, allowing us to map epigenetic quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for heterosis. Our results indicate that epigenetic variation can contribute to heterosis and suggests that heritable epigenetic variation could be exploited for the improvement of crop traits.",

The deposition of m6dA is generally associated with increased genome-wide occupancy of the mammalian m6dA methyltransferase, N6amt1, and this correlates with fear extinction learning-induced gene expression. Of particular relevance for fear extinction memory, the accumulation of m6dA is associated with an active chromatin state and the recruitment of transcriptional machinery to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) P4 promoter, which is required for Bdnf exon IV mRNA expression and for the extinction of conditioned fear. These results expand the scope of DNA modifications in the adult brain and highlight changes in m6dA as a novel neuroepigenetic mechanism associated with activity-induced gene expression and the formation of fear extinction memory.",
