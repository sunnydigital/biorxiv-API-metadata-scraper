    "abstract": "Lay AbstractIndividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are reported to speak in distinctive ways. Distinctive vocal production should be better understood as it can affect social interactions and social development and could represent a non-invasive marker for ASD. We systematically review the existing scientific literature reporting quantitative acoustic analysis of vocal production in ASD and identify repeated and consistent findings of higher pitch mean and variability but not of other differences in acoustic features. We also identify a recent approach relying on multiple aspects of vocal production and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify ASD from voice only. This latter approach is very promising, but requires more systematic replication and comparison across languages and contexts. We outline three recommendations to further develop the field: open data, open methods, and theory-driven research.\\n\\nScientific AbstractIndividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tend to show distinctive, atypical acoustic patterns of speech. These behaviours affect social interactions and social development and could represent a non-invasive marker for ASD. We systematically reviewed the literature quantifying acoustic patterns in ASD. Search terms were: (prosody OR intonation OR inflection OR intensity OR pitch OR fundamental frequency OR speech rate OR voice quality OR acoustic) AND (autis* OR Asperger). Results were filtered to include only: empirical studies quantifying acoustic features of vocal production in ASD, with a sample size > 2, and the inclusion of a neurotypical comparison group and/or correlations between acoustic measures and severity of clinical features. We identified 32 articles, including 27 univariate studies and 15 multivariate machine-learning studies. We performed meta-analyses of the univariate studies, identifying significant differences in mean pitch and pitch range between individuals with ASD and comparison participants (Cohens d of about 0.4 and discriminatory accuracy of about 61%). The multivariate studies reported higher accuracies than the univariate studies (63-96%). However, the methods used and the acoustic features investigated were too diverse for performing meta-analysis. We conclude that multivariate studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but yet unsystematic avenue for establishing ASD markers. We outline three recommendations for future studies: open data, open methods, and theory-driven research.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBranching events in phylogenetic trees reflect strictly bifurcating and/or multifurcating speciation and splitting events. In the presence of gene flow, a phylogeny cannot be described by a tree but is instead a directed acyclic graph known as a phylogenetic network. Both phylogenetic trees and networks are typically reconstructed using computational analysis of multi-locus sequence data. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has brought about two main scalability challenges:(1) dataset size in terms of the number of taxa and (2) the evolutionary divergence of the taxa in a study. The impact of both dimensions of scale on phylogenetic tree inference has been well characterized by recent studies; in contrast, the scalability limits of phylogenetic network inference methods are largely unknown. In this study, we quantify the performance of state-of-the-art phylogenetic network inference methods on large-scale datasets using empirical data sampled from natural mouse populations and synthetic data capturing a wide range of evolutionary scenarios.\\n\\nResultsWe find that, as in the case of phylogenetic tree inference, the performance of leading network inference methods is negatively impacted by both dimensions of dataset scale. In general, we found that topological accuracy degrades as the number of taxa increases; a similar effect was observed with increased sequence mutation rate. The most accurate methods were probabilistic inference methods which maximize either likelihood under coalescent-based models or pseudo-likelihood approximations to the model likelihood. Furthermore, probabilistic inference methods with optimization criteria which did not make use of gene tree root and/or branch length information performed best-a result that runs contrary to widely held assumptions in the literature. The improved accuracy obtained with probabilistic inference methods comes at a computational cost in terms of runtime and main memory usage, which quickly become prohibitive as dataset size grows past thirty taxa.\\n\\nConclusionsWe conclude that the state of the art of phylogenetic network inference lags well behind the scope of current phylogenomic studies. New algorithmic development is critically needed to address this methodological gap.",

Large-scale experiment and sequence-based predictions have identified thousands of SUMOylated proteins. However, the overlap between the datasets is small, suggesting many false positives with low functional relevance. Therefore, we integrated ~800 sequence features and protein characteristics such as cellular function and protein-protein interactions in a machine learning approach to score likely functional SUMOylation events (iSUMO). iSUMO is trained on a total of 24 large-scale datasets, and it predicts 2,291 and 706 SUMO targets in human and yeast, respectively. These estimates are five times higher than what existing sequence-based tools predict at the same 5% false positive rate. Protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions are highly predictive of protein SUMOylation, supporting a role of the modification in protein complex formation. We note the marked prevalence of SUMOylation amongst RNA-binding proteins. We validate iSUMO predictions by experimental or other evidence. iSUMO therefore represents a comprehensive tool to identify high-confidence, functional SUMOylation events for human and yeast.",

Many tissue types radically alter their gene expression profile after becoming oncogenic. We evaluate this change in gene expression in 8 different cancer lines by comparing their expression profiles to that of their associated differentiated tissues as well as profiles for proliferative human embryonic stem cells. We find that, for non-proliferative tissues, the alterations in expression after oncogenesis result in a profile that is significantly more similar to the embryonic expression profile than to the original tissue profile. Wealso find that the lists of co-similar genes among embryonic and tumor cells are clustered within gene regulatory, protein interaction and metabolicnetworks. There is however little overlap in these lists between cancer lines and no pattern shared among all cancers in this analysis. We conclude that the manner in which cancers instantiate a proliferative pattern of expression following oncogenesis is diverse and we find no uniform proliferative program among the cancers in this analysis.",

    "abstract": "FGIN-1-27 is an agonist at the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a cholesterol transporter that is associated with neurosteroidogenesis. This protein has been identified as a peripheral binding site for benzodiazepines; in anamniotes, however, a second TSPO isoform that is absent in amniotes has been implicated in erythropoiesis. Functional conservation of the central benzodiazepine-binding site located in the GABAA receptors has been demonstrated in anamniotes and amniotes alike; however, it was not previously demonstrated for TSPO. The present investigation explored the behavioral effects of FGIN-1-27 on an anxiety test in zebrafish (Danio rerio, Family: Cyprinide) and on a mixed anxiety/panic test on wall lizards (Tropidurus oreadicus, Family: Tropiduridae). Results showed that FGIN-1-27 reduced anxiety-like behavior in the zebrafish light/dark preference test similar to diazepam, but with fewer sedative effects. Similarly, FGIN-1-27 also reduced anxiety- and fear-like behaviors in the defense test battery in wall lizards, again producing fewer sedative-like effects than diazepam; the benzodiazepine was also unable to reduce fear-like behaviors in this species. These results A) underline the functional conservation of TSPO in defensive behavior in anamniotes; B) strengthen the proposal of using anamniote behavior as models in behavioral pharmacology; and C) suggest TSPO/neurosteroidogenesis as a target in treating anxiety disorders.",

Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming.

We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed \\\"continuous analysis\\\" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code.

While recent studies have refined the 3-D models of chromatin organization with high resolution at the genome sequence level, little is known about how the most fundamental units of chromatin -- nucleosomes -- are positioned in 3-D in vivo. Here we have used electron cryotomography to study chromatin organization in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Direct visualization of yeast nuclear densities shows no evidence of 30-nm chromatin fibers. Aside from pre-ribosomes and spindle microtubules, few nuclear structures are larger than a tetranucleosome. Yeast chromatin does not form compact structures in interphase or mitosis and is consistent with being in an \\\"open\\\" configuration that is conducive to high levels of transcription. In the absence of higher-order chromatin packing, we propose that yeast can regulate its transcription using local nucleosome-nucleosome associations.",

The structure of C3(H2O) has not been determined. Here we subjected C3(H2O) to quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry (QCLMS). This revealed details of the structural differences and similarities between C3(H2O) and C3, as well as between C3(H2O) and its pivotal proteolytic cleavage product, C3b, which shares functionally similarity with C3(H2O). Considered in combination with the crystal structures of C3 and C3b, the QCMLS data suggest that C3(H2O) generation is accompanied by the migration of the thioester-containing domain of C3 from one end of the molecule to the other. This creates a stable C3b-like platform able to bind the zymogen, factor B, or the regulator, factor H. Integration of available crystallographic and QCLMS data allowed the determination of a 3D model of the C3(H2O) domain architecture. The unique arrangement of domains thus observed in C3(H2O), which retains the anaphylatoxin domain (that is excised when C3 is enzymatically activated to C3b), can be used to rationalize observed differences between C3(H2O) and C3b in terms of complement activation and regulation.",

Using a novel technique, we show that VEFs exhibit a constant delay, whereas AEPs exhibit delay that accumulates over time. Visual delay is mediated by white-matter microstructure in the optic radiation, presumably reflecting increased transmission time, whereas auditory delay is mediated by gray-matter differences in auditory cortex, presumably reflecting less efficient local processing.

    "abstract": "MotivationNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) has enabled studying structural genomic variants (SVs) such as duplications and inversions in large cohorts. SVs have been shown to play important roles in multiple diseases, including cancer. As costs for NGS continue to decline and variant databases become ever more complete, the relevance of genotyping also SVs from NGS data increases steadily, which is in stark contrast to the lack of tools to do so.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel statistical approach, called DIGTYPER (Duplication and Inversion GenoTYPER), which computes genotype likelihoods for a given inversion or duplication and reports the maximum likelihood genotype. In contrast to purely coverage-based approaches, DIGTYPER uses breakpoint-spanning read pairs as well as split alignments for genotyping, enabling typing also of small events. We tested our approach on simulated and on real data and compared the genotype predictions to those made by DELLY, which discovers SVs and computes genotypes. DIGTYPER compares favorable especially for duplications (of all lengths) and for shorter inversions (up to 300 bp). In contrast to DELLY, our approach can genotype SVs from data bases without having to rediscover them.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://bitbucket.org/jana_ebler/digtyper.git",

    "abstract": "Anticorrelation between the default network (DN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) is thought to be an intrinsic aspect of functional brain organization reflecting competing functions. However, the stability of anticorrelations across distinct DN subsystems, different contexts, and time, remains unexplored. Here we examine DN-DAN functional connectivity across six different cognitive states. We show that:(i) the DAN is anticorrelated with the DN core subsystem, but not with the two DN subsystems involved in mentalizing and mnemonic functions, respectively; (ii) DN-DAN interactions vary significantly across cognitive states; (iii) DN-DAN connectivity fluctuates across time between periods of anticorrelation and periods of positive correlation; and (iv) coupling between the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and DAN predicts variation in the strength of DN-DAN anticorrelation across time. These findings reveal substantial variability in DN-DAN interactions, suggesting that these networks are not strictly competitive, and that the FPCN may act to modulate their anticorrelation strength.",

    "abstract": "DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts)-epigenetic writers catalyzing the transfer of methyl-groups to cytosine-regulate stimulus-specific olfactory long-term memory (LTM) formation and extinction in honeybees. The physiological relevance of their function in neural networks, however, remains unknown. Here, we investigated how Dnmts impact neuroplasticity in the bees primary olfactory center, the antennal lobe (AL) an equivalent of the olfactory bulb of vertebrates. The AL is crucial for odor discrimination, an indispensable process in stimulus-specific LTM. Using pharmacological inhibition, we show that Dnmts promote fast odor pattern separation in trained bees. We show Dnmt activity during memory formation increases both the number of responding glomeruli and the response magnitude to a novel odor. These data suggest that Dnmts are necessary for a form of homoeostatic network control which might involve inhibitory interneurons in the AL network and demonstrate that Dnmts influence neural network properties during memory formation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Action of arsenate reductase is crucial for the survival of an organism in arsenic polluted area. Pteris vittata, also known as Chinese ladder brake, was the first identified arsenic hyperaccumulating fern with the capability to convert [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)]. This study aims at sequence analysis of the most important protein of the arsenic reduction mechanism in this specie. Phosphorylation potential of the protein along with possible interplay of phosphorylation with O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation was predicted using neural network based webservers. Secondary and tertiary structure of arsenate reductase was then analysed. Active site region of the protein comprised a rhodanese-like domain. Cursory dynamics simulation revealed that folds remained conserved in the rhodanese main but variations were observed in the structure in other regions. This information sheds light on the various characteristics of the protein and may be useful to enzymologists working on the improvement of its traits for arsenic reduction.",

    "abstract": "Imaging is used to map activity across populations of neurons. Microscopes with cellular resolution have small (< 1 millimeter) fields of view and cannot simultaneously image activity distributed across multiple brain areas. Typical large field of view microscopes do not resolve single cells, especially in the axial dimension. We developed a 2-photon random access mesoscope (2p-RAM) that allows high-resolution imaging anywhere within a volume spanning multiple brain areas (O 5 mm x 1 mm cylinder). 2p-RAM resolution is near diffraction limited (lateral, 0.66 m, axial 4.09 m at the center; excitation wavelength = 970 nm; numerical aperture = 0.6) over a large range of excitation wavelengths. A fast threedimensional scanning system allows efficient sampling of neural activity in arbitrary regions of interest across the entire imaging volume. We illustrate the use of the 2p-RAM by imaging neural activity in multiple, non-contiguous brain areas in transgenic mice expressing protein calcium sensors.",
