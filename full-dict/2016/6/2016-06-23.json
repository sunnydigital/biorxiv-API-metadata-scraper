    "abstract": "Extracellular polysaccharides are compounds secreted by microorganisms into the surrounding environment and which are important for surface attachment and maintaining structural integrity within biofilms. The social nature of many extracellular polysaccharides remains unclear, and it has been suggested that they could function as either co-operative public goods, or as traits that provide a competitive advantage. Here we empirically test the co-operative nature of the PSL polysaccharide, which is crucial for the formation of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that: (1) PSL is not metabolically costly to produce; (2) PSL provides population level benefits in biofilms, for both growth and antibiotic tolerance; (3) the benefits of PSL production are social and are shared with other cells; (4) the benefits of PSL production appear to be preferentially directed towards cells which produce PSL; (5) cells which do not produce PSL are unable to successfully exploit cells which produce PSL. Taken together, this suggests that PSL is a social but relatively non-exploitable trait, and that growth within biofilms selects for PSL-producing strains, even when multiple strains can interact (low relatedness).",

    "abstract": "The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) has carried out extensive rodent toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) at frequencies and modulations used in the U.S. telecommunications industry. This report presents partial findings from these studies. The occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed to RFR, malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were considered of particular interest and are the subject of this report. The findings in this report were reviewed by expert peer reviewers selected by the NTP and National Institutes of Health (NIH). These reviews and responses to comments are included as appendices to this report, and revisions to the current document have incorporated and addressed these comments. When the studies are completed, they will undergo additional peer review before publication in full as part of the NTP's Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Technical Reports Series. No portion of this work has been submitted for publication in a scientific journal. Supplemental information in the form of four additional manuscripts has or will soon be submitted for publication.

These studies found low incidences of malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart of male rats exposed to RFR of the two types [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)] currently used in U.S. wireless networks. Potentially preneoplastic lesions were also observed in the brain and heart of male rats exposed to RFR.\\n\\nThe review of partial study data in this report has been prompted by several factors. Given the widespread global usage of mobile communications among users of all ages, even a very small increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to RFR could have broad implications for public health. There is a high level of public and media interest regarding the safety of cell phone RFR and the specific results of these NTP studies. Lastly, the tumors in the brain and heart observed at low incidence in male rats exposed to GSM-and CDMA-modulated cell phone RFR in this study are of a type similar to tumors observed in some epidemiology studies of cell phone use. These findings appear to support the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic potential of RFR.2\\n\\nIt is important to note that this document reviews only the findings from the brain and heart and is not a complete report of all findings from the NTPs studies. Additional data from these studies in Hsd:Sprague Dawley(R) SD(R) (Harlan) rats and similar studies conducted in B6C3F1/N mice are currently under evaluation and will be reported together with the current findings in two forthcoming NTP Technical Reports.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the main determinants of species coexistence across space and time is a central question in ecology. However, ecologists still know little about the scales and conditions at which biotic interactions matter and their interplay with the environment to structure species assemblages. Here we develop ecological theory to analyze plant distribution and trait data across Europe and find that plant height clustering is related to evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity. Our analysis suggests competitive dominance as a plausible mechanism underlying community assembly patterns over these continental scales. In particular, we find a clear signal of plant-to-plant competition in mid-latitude ecoregions, where conditions for growth (reflected in actual evapotranspiration rates and gross primary productivities) are optimal. Under severe conditions, either climate is too harsh and overrides the effect of competition or other interactions play a relevant role. Our approach bridges the gap between modern coexistence theory and large-scale species distribution data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed \\\"Ouija\\\" that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify \\\"metastable\\\" states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories - that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods.

    "abstract": "Hepatitis E occurs sporadically and as outbreaks due to contamination of drinking water. The causative agent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a hepatotropic non-enveloped RNA virus, which grows poorly in vitro. Consequently, many aspects of HEV biology are poorly characterized, including its cellular receptor and entry mechanism(s). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as attachment factors for the virus. In the absence of purified high titer infectious virus, we have used hepatitis E virus-like particles (HEV-LPs) expressed and purified from E. coli to identify HEV entry factor(s) on liver cells in culture. Using a pull down and mass spectrometric approach, we identified the ATP synthase subunit {beta} (ATP5B) to bind the HEV capsid protein. Its role in the entry of HEV was then validated using antibody and siRNA mediated approaches, and infectious HEV from the stools of a hepatitis E patient. Though ATP synthase is largely a mitochondrial protein, the cell surface expressed form of ATP5B is implicated in other viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing has identified millions of somatic mutations in human cancers, but distinguishing cancer driver genes remains a major challenge. Numerous methods have been developed to identify driver genes, but evaluation of the performance of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard, i.e., bona fide driver gene mutations. Here, we establish an evaluation framework that can be applied when a gold standard is not available. We used this framework to compare the performance of eight driver gene prediction methods. One of these methods, newly described here, incorporated a machine learning-based ratiometric approach. We show that the driver genes predicted by each of these eight methods vary widely. Moreover, the p-values reported by several of the methods were inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into question the assumptions that were used to generate them. Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained variability in mutation rates on false positive driver gene predictions. Our analysis points to the strengths and weaknesses of each of the currently available methods and offers guidance for improving them in the future.\\n\\nSignificanceModern large-scale sequencing of human cancers seeks to comprehensively discover mutated genes that confer a selective advantage to cancer cells. Key to this effort has been development of computational algorithms to find genes that drive cancer, based on their patterns of mutation in large patient cohorts. However, since there is no generally accepted gold standard of driver genes, it has been difficult to quantitatively compare these methods. We present a new machine learning method for driver gene prediction and a rigorous protocol to evaluate and compare prediction methods. Our results suggest that most current methods do not adequately account for heterogeneity in the number of mutations expected by chance and consequently have many false positive calls. The problem is most acute for cancers with high mutation rates and comprehensive discovery of drivers in these cancers may be more difficult than currently anticipated.",

Female BRCA mutation-positive relatives of ovarian cancer patients could undergo risk-reducing mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\\n\\nMethodsA discrete event simulation model was developed that included the risks of breast and ovarian cancer, the costs, utilities and effects of risk-reducing surgery on cancer rates, and the costs, utilities and mortality rates associated with cancer.\\n\\nResultsBRCA testing all women with epithelial ovarian cancer each year is cost-effective at a UK willingness-to-pay threshold of {pound}20,000/QALY compared with no testing, with an ICER of {pound}4,339/QALY. The result was primarily driven by fewer cases of breast (142) and ovarian (141) cancer and associated reductions in mortality (77 fewer deaths) in relatives over the subsequent 50 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to variations in the input parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of germline BRCA mutation testing being cost-effective at a threshold of {pound}20,000/QALY was 99.9%.\\n\\nConclusionsImplementing germline BRCA testing in all ovarian cancer patients would be cost-effective in the UK. The consequent reduction of future cases of breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of mutation-positive individuals would ease the burden of cancer treatments in subsequent years and result in significantly better outcomes and reduced mortality rates for these individuals.",

    "abstract": "1. Inventorying requires comprehensive sampling, while monitoring should build on it and focus on as few components as possible to detect changes in time or space. To sample or acquire information for both purposes can therefore be viewed as different processes, herewith called -sampling and {beta}-sampling. Biodiversity covers species, their genetic diversity and the way they interact in communities and ecosystems. Quantifying these aspects leads to the need to study taxon (TD), phylogenetic (PD) and functional diversity (FD). Here we propose and test a method for the optimization of sampling protocols to inventorying and monitoring TD, PD and FD for a wide range of taxa.\\n\\n2. We used spiders as a case-study, although the same optimization procedure could be applied to any taxon requiring a combination of sampling methods. Spiders were sampled in multiple sites in the Iberian Peninsula. PD and FD were measured as the sum of the length of branches on a phylogenetic or functional tree. To reach the optimal combination of methods for inventory, we followed an iterative procedure optimizing the accumulation curve of diversity values. Optimal monitoring in space or time required minimizing the difference between sampled and true {beta}-diversity. We used a framework that disentangles species replacement and richness differences contributions to overall {beta}-diversity.\\n\\n3. For -diversity, the optimal combination of 24 samples for TD, PD and FD allowed sampling more than 50% of real diversity. For {beta}-diversity, the optimal combination of six samples for all measures allowed reaching a bias (difference between sampled and true diversity) below 0.08.\\n\\n4. The widespread use of similar sampling protocols worldwide and regular repetition in time can have a major impact on the scope and usefulness of global monitoring projects. In addition, the comparable sampling of biodiversity in space and/or time allows reusing of data collected for specific purposes, potentiating a synergistic effect among different projects. This makes data useful much beyond their initial plan. We strongly advocate the optimization, standardization and widespread adoption of sampling protocols for all taxa at a global level, for both inventory and monitoring of all levels of biodiversity: taxon, phylogenetic and functional.",

In fact, their bound is a direct consequence of the well-known solution to the coupon collectors problem which proves that for such genome, the total number of bases to be sequenced should be O (G ln G). Although the result leads to a tight bound, it is based on a tacit assumption that the set of reads are first collected through a sequencing process and then are processed through a computation process, i.e., there are two different machines: one for sequencing and one for processing. In this paper, we present a significant improvement compared to Lander-Watermans result and prove that by combining the sequencing and computing processes, one can re-sequence the whole genome with as low as O(G) sequenced bases in total. Our approach also dramatically reduces the required computational power for the combined process. Simulation results are performed on real genomes with different sequencing error rates. The results support our theory predicting the log G improvement on coverage bound and corresponding reduction in the total number of bases required to be sequenced.",

We have used ribosome profiling to explore the contribution of translation efficiency to temporal gene expression in kidney, and contrasted our findings with liver data available from the same mice.\\n\\nRESULTSRhythmic translation of constantly abundant mRNAs affected largely non-overlapping transcript sets with distinct phase clustering in the two organs. Moreover, tissue differences in translation efficiency modulated the timing and amount of protein biosynthesis from rhythmic mRNAs, consistent with organ-specificity in clock output gene repertoires and rhythmicity parameters. Our comprehensive datasets provided insights into translational control beyond temporal regulation. Between tissues, many transcripts showed differences in translation efficiency, which were, however, of markedly smaller scale than mRNA abundance differences. Tissue-specific changes in translation efficiency were associated with specific transcript features and, intriguingly, globally counteracted and compensated transcript abundance variations, leading to higher similarity at the level of protein biosynthesis between both tissues.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe show that tissue-specificity in rhythmic gene expression extends to the translatome and contributes to define the identities, the phases and the expression levels of rhythmic protein biosynthesis. Moreover, translational compensation of transcript abundance divergence leads to overall higher similarity at the level of protein production across organs. The unique resources provided through our study will serve to address fundamental questions of post-transcriptional control and differential gene expression in vivo.",

    "abstract": "To identify cell cycle regulators that enable cancer cells to replicate DNA and divide in an unrestricted manner, we performed a parallel genome-wide RNAi screen in normal and cancer cell lines. In addition to many shared regulators, we found that tumor and normal cells are differentially sensitive to loss of the histone genes transcriptional regulator CASP8AP2. In cancer cells, loss of CASP8AP2 leads to a failure to synthesize sufficient amount of histones in the S-phase of the cell cycle, resulting in slowing of individual replication forks. Despite this, DNA replication fails to arrest, and tumor cells progress in an elongated S-phase that lasts several days, finally resulting in death of most of the affected cells. In contrast, depletion of CASP8AP2 in normal cells triggers a response that arrests viable cells in S-phase. The arrest is dependent on p53, and preceded by accumulation of markers of DNA damage, indicating that nucleosome depletion is sensed in normal cells via a DNA-damage-like response that is defective in tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "Clinical variability is a hallmark of neurogenetic disorders. They involve widespread neurological entities such as neuropathies, ataxias, myopathies, mitochondrial encephalopathies, leukodystrophies, epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Despite the use of considerable time and resources, the diagnostic yield in this field has been disappointingly low. This etiologic search has been called a \\\"diagnostic odyssey\\\" for many families. Whole exome sequencing (WES) has proved to be useful across a variety of genetic disorders, simplifying the odyssey of many patients and their families and leading to subsequent changes in clinical management in a proportion of them. Although a diagnostic yield of about 30% in neurogenetic disorders can be extrapolated from the results of large series that have included other medical conditions as well, there are not specific reports assessing its utility in a setting such as ours: a neurogeneticist led academic group serving in a low-income country. Herein, we report on a series of our first 40 consecutive cases that were selected for WES in a research-based neurogenetics laboratory. We demonstrated the clinical utility of WES in our patient cohort, obtaining a diagnostic yield of 40% (95% CI, 24.8%-55.2%), describing cases in which clinical management was altered, and suggesting the potential cost-effectiveness of WES as a single test by examining the number and types of tests that were performed prior to WES which added up to a median cost of $3537.6 ($2892 to $5084) for the diagnostic odysseys experienced by our cohort.",

    "abstract": "A significant proportion of children suffer from unexplained problems acquiring proficient linguistic skills despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. These developmental speech and language disorders are highly heritable and have a substantial impact on society. Molecular studies have begun to identify candidate loci, but much of the underlying genetic architecture remains undetermined. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 43 unrelated probands affected by severe forms of specific language impairment, followed by independent validations with Sanger sequencing, and analyses of segregation patterns in parents and siblings, to try to shed new light on the aetiology of the disorder. By first focusing on a pre-defined set of known candidates from the literature, we identified potentially pathogenic variants in genes already implicated in diverse language-related syndromes, including ERC1, GRIN2A, and SRPX2. Complementary analyses suggested novel putative candidate genes carrying validated variants which were predicted to have functional effects, such as OXR1, SCN9A and KMT2D. We also searched for potential \\\"multiple-hit\\\" cases; one proband carried a rare AUTS2 variant in combination with a rare inherited haplotype affecting STARD9, while another carried a novel nonsynonymous variant in SEMA6D together with a rare stop-gain in SYNPR. When we broadened our scope to all rare and novel variants throughout the exomes, we identified several biological themes that were enriched for such variants, most notably microtubule transport and cytoskeletal regulation.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new hypothesis concerning the dissociated role of the basal ganglia in the selection and the evaluation of action that has been formulated using a theoretical model and confirmed experimentally in monkeys. To do so, prior to learning, we inactivated the internal part of the Globus Pallidus (GPi, the main output structure of the BG) with injections of muscimol and we tested monkeys on a variant of a two-armed bandit task where two stimuli are associated with two distinct reward probabilities (0.25 and 0.75 respectively). Unsurprisingly, performance in such condition are at the chance level because the output of basal ganglia is suppressed and they cannot influence behaviour. However, the theoretical model predicts that in the meantime, values of the stimuli are nonetheless covertly evaluated and learned. This has been tested and confirmed on the next day, when muscimol has been replaced by a saline solution: monkeys instantly showed significantly improved performances (above chance level), hence demonstrating they have covertly learned the relative value of the two stimuli. This tends to suggest a competition takes place in the Cortex-BG loop between two actors, one of whom being sensitive to criticism and the other not. Ultimately, the actual choice is valuated, independently of the origin of the decision.",

    "abstract": "Kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins that convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work for a variety of essential intracellular processes. Kinesin-14s (i.e. kinesins with a C-terminal motor domain) are commonly considered to be nonprocessive minus end-directed motors that mainly function for mitotic spindle assembly and maintenance. Here, we show that KlpA - a mitotic kinesin-14 motor from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans - contains a context-dependent directionality switch. KlpA exhibits canonical minus end-directed motility inside microtubule bundles, but on individual microtubules it unexpectedly moves processively toward the plus ends. Removal of the N-terminal nonmotor microtubule-binding domain renders KlpA diffusive on individual microtubules but does not abolish its minus end-directed motility to collectively glide microtubules, suggesting that the nonmotor microtubule-binding domain likely acts as a switch for controlling the direction of KlpA motility. Collectively, these findings provide important insights into the mechanism and regulation of KlpA functions inside the mitotic spindle.",

    "abstract": "Cells react to extracellular perturbations with complex and intertwined responses. Systematic identification of the regulatory mechanisms that control these responses is still a challenge and requires tailored analyses integrating different types of molecular data. Here we acquired time-resolved metabolomics measurements in yeast under salt and pheromone stimulation and developed a machine learning approach to explore regulatory associations between metabolism and signal transduction. Existing phosphoproteomics measurements under the same conditions and kinase-substrate regulatory interactions were used to estimate the enzymatic activity of signalling kinases. Our approach identified informative associations between kinases and metabolic enzymes capable of predicting metabolic changes. We extended our analysis to two studies containing transcriptomics, phosphoproteomics and metabolomics measurements across a comprehensive panel of kinases/phosphatases knockouts and time-resolved perturbations to the nitrogen metabolism, conveying a total of 143 unique conditions. Our approach accurately estimated the change in activity of transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases and these were capable of building predictive models to infer the metabolic adaptations of previously unseen conditions across different dynamic experiments. Time-resolved experiments were significantly more informative than genetic perturbations to infer metabolic adaptation. This difference may be due to the indirect nature of the associations and of general cellular states that can hinder the identification of causal relationships. This work provides a novel genome-scale integrative analysis to propose putative transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms of metabolic processes.",
