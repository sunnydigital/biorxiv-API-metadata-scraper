    "abstract": "Recent years have seen substantial developments in technology for imaging neural circuits, raising the prospect of large scale imaging studies of neural populations involved in information processing, with the potential to lead to step changes in our understanding of brain function and dysfunction. In this article we will review some key recent advances: improved fluorophores for single cell resolution functional neuroimaging using a two photon microscope; improved approaches to the problem of scanning active circuits; and the prospect of scanless microscopes which overcome some of the bandwidth limitations of current imaging techniques. These advances in technology for experimental neuroscience have in themselves led to technical challenges, such as the need for the development of novel signal processing and data analysis tools in order to make the most of the new experimental tools. We review recent work in some active topics, such as region of interest segmentation algorithms capable of demixing overlapping signals, and new highly accurate algorithms for calcium transient detection. These advances motivate the development of new data analysis tools capable of dealing with spatial or spatiotem-poral patterns of neural activity, that scale well with pattern size.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory priority effects, in which early-arriving species exclude competing species from local communities, are thought to enhance regional species diversity via community divergence. Theory suggests, however, that these same priority effects make it difficult for species to coexist in the region unless individuals are continuously supplied from an external species pool, often an unrealistic assumption. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary hypothesis to solve this conundrum. We build a metacommunity model in which local priority effects occur between two species via interspecific interference. Within each species there are two genotypes: one is more resistant to interspecific interference than the other, but pays a fitness cost for its resistance. Because of this trade-off, species evolve to become less resistant as they become regionally more common. Rare species can then invade some local patches and consequently recover in regional frequency. This \\\"eco-evolutionary buffering\\\" enables the regional coexistence of species despite local priority effects, even in the absence of immigration from an external species pool. Our model predicts that eco-evolutionary buffering is particularly effective when local communities are small and connected by infrequent dispersal.",

    "abstract": "The use of  selfish gene drive systems to suppress or even extinguish populations has been proposed on theoretical grounds for almost half a century. Creating these genes has recently become possible with CRISPR technology. One seemingly feasible approach, originally proposed by Burt, is to create a homing endonuclease gene (HEG) that inserts into an essential gene, enabling heterozygote viability but causing homozygote lethality. With 100% segregation distortion in gametes, such genes can cause profound population suppression if resistance does not evolve. Here, population genetic models are used to consider the evolution of inbreeding (specifically selfing) as a possible response to a recessively lethal HEG with complete segregation distortion. Numerical analyses indicate a rich set of outcomes, but selfing often evolves in response to the HEG, with a corresponding partial restoration of mean fitness. Whether selfing does indeed evolve and its effect in restoring fitness depends heavily on the magnitude of inbreeding depression. Overall, these results point toward an underappreciated evolutionary response to block the harmful effects of a selfish gene. They raise the possibility that extreme population suppression may be more difficult to achieve than currently imagined.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor NF-{kappa}B plays an important role in the immune system as an apoptotic and inflammatory factor. In the Drosophila melanogaster embryo, a homolog of NF-KB called Dorsal (dl) patterns the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis in a concentration-dependent manner. During early development, dl is sequestered outside the nucleus by Cactus (Cact), homologous to I{kappa}B. Toll signaling at the ventral midline breaks the dl/Cact complex, allowing dl to enter the nucleus where it transcribes target genes. Here we show that dl accumulates on the ventral side of the embryo over the last 5 cleavage cycles and that this accumulation is the result of facilitated diffusion of dl/Cact complex. We speculate that the predominant role for Cact in DV axis specification is to shuttle dl towards the ventral midline. Given that this mechanism has been found in other, independent systems, we suggest it may be more prevalent than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial-derived gastroenteritis. A previous mutant screen demonstrated that the heme uptake system (Chu) is required for full colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Subsequent work found identified a PAS domain-containing regulator, termed HeuR, as required for chicken colonization. Here we confirmthat both the heme uptake system and HeuR are required for full chicken gastrointestinal tract colonization, with the heuR mutant being particularlyaffected during competition with wild-type C. jejuni. Transcriptomic analysis identified the chu genes-and those encoding other iron uptake systems-as likely regulatory targets of HeuR. Purified HeuR specifically bound the chuZA promoter region in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Consistentwith a role forHeuR in chu expression, heuR mutants wereunable to efficiently use heme asa source of iron in iron-limitingconditions and, mutants exhibited decreased levels of cell-associated ironby massspectrometry.Finally, we demonstrate that a heuR mutant of C. jejuni isresistant to hydrogen peroxide, and that this resistance correlates to elevated levels ofcatalase activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCampylobacter jejuni causes millions of gastrointestinal infection every year. This is primarily due to the its ability to reside in the gastrointestinal tract of chickens. C.jejuni contaminates chicken meat during harvesting and processing. Following consumption of undercooked chicken or uncooked food that was contaminated with raw chicken juice, humans develop a debilitating illness that is characterized by diarrhea and abdominal cramps. As chickens are the source of most human infections, there is a need to understand how C. jejuni colonizes chickens so we can develop ways to reduce its presence in chickens and thereby improve food safety. Most organisms require iron to thrive and that some bacteria steal iron from host molecules, including hemoglobin. Here we demonstrate that C. jejuni may need to get iron from hemoglobin in order to colonize the chicken and that aregulatory protein, HeuR, controls the ability ofthe bacteria to do this. If we can understand how this protein works, we may be able to develop ways to inhibit its function and reduce the ability of C. jejuni to get iron during chicken colonization. This would limit theamount of C. jejuni in the chicken and make food safer.",

    "abstract": "HIV has a high mutation rate, which contributes to its ability to evolve quickly. However, we know little about the fitness costs of individual HIV mutations in vivo, their distribution and the different factors shaping the viral fitness landscape. We calculated the mean frequency of transition mutations at 870 sites of the pol gene in 160 patients, allowing us to determine the cost of these mutations. As expected, we found high costs for non-synonymous and nonsense mutations as compared to synonymous mutations. In addition, we found that non-synonymous mutations that lead to drastic amino acid changes are twice as costly as those that do not and mutations that create new CpG dinucleotides are also twice as costly as those that do not. We also found that G[-&gt;]A and C[-&gt;]T mutations are more costly than A[-&gt;]G mutations. We anticipate that our new in vivo frequency-based approach will provide insights into the fitness landscape and evolvability of not only HIV, but a variety of microbes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHIVs high mutation rate allows it to evolve quickly. However, most mutations probably reduce the virus ability to replicate - they are costly to the virus. Until now, the actual cost of mutations is not well understood. We used within-patient mutation frequencies to estimate the cost of 870 HIV mutations in vivo. As expected, we found high costs for non-synonymous and nonsense mutations. In addition, we found surprisingly high costs for mutations that lead to drastic amino acid changes, mutations that create new CpG sites (possibly because they trigger the hosts immune system), and G[-&gt;]A and C[-&gt;]T mutations.

    "abstract": "Kin selection theory predicts that closely related individuals should be more altruistic and less antagonistic towards one another. In addition, it would predict that the higher the relatedness value (R) between individuals, such as in clonal organisms, the more likely kin selection is to evolve. One benefit of kin selection is a reduction in aggression towards kininvarious social contexts, such as foraging. In the gynogenetic Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa, females have been shown to differentiate between clone types, preferring to associate with clonal sisters to non-sisters, and regulate their aggressive behaviors accordingly. We ask ifAmazon mollies in resource-limited environments: 1) still maintain the ability to regulate aggressive behaviors according to relatedness (heterospecific females, clonal sisters or non-sisters), and 2) how their aggressivebehaviors change relative to a females social partner? Using a repeated-measures design, we found that focal females regulated their aggressive behaviors depending on partner type (i.e., a heterospecific female, clonal sister, or non-sister). Heterospecific females and the non-sister clones spent more time behaving aggressively towards the focal females, and these females also received significantly more bites from heterospecific females. Interestingly, the clonal sisters, when compared to the other two female types, performed significantly more tail beats towards focal females.We are able to confirm that females do show more aggression towards heterospecific females and non-sister clones in a food-limited environment, andthat their aggression scales with relatedness (R).\\n\\nLay SummaryKin recognition allows individuals to adjust costly behaviors, such as aggression, according to the degree of genetic relatedness. We show that in a food-limited environment, a clonal species of fish, the Amazon molly, females regulate aggressive behaviors depending on how closely related they are to the recipient female, behaving more aggressively to both heterospecific females and non-sister clones. The ability to regulate costly behaviors under variable socialconditions is advantageous, especially when resources are limited.",

    "abstract": "Human use of the ocean and its ecosystems continues to degrade coastal habitats around the world. Assessing anthropogenic impacts on these environments can be cost and manpower intensive; thus, developing rapid, remote techniques to assess habitat quality has become increasingly important. We employed autonomous hydrophone receivers to record the soundscapes of healthy hard-bottom habitat in Florida Bay, Florida (USA) and hard-bottom areas impacted by sponge die-offs. We also recorded sounds emanating from individual sponges of three species that were isolated in underwater sound booths, and then enumerated the invertebrates (mostly snapping shrimp) dwelling within the canals of each sponge. From these recordings, a modified cylindrical sound propagation model was used to estimate distances to snapping shrimp snaps. Using the program Distance, which applies distance sampling theory to cue count surveys, we estimated snapping shrimp population density and abundance within both habitat types. More snapping shrimp snaps per unit time were recorded in healthy hard-bottom areas as compared to degraded hard-bottom areas. In addition, the average distance to a snap source was greater within degraded hard-bottom areas than within healthy hard-bottom areas. As a consequence, the estimated density and abundance of snapping shrimp were one to two orders of magnitude greater within healthy habitat than within degraded habitat. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using acoustic sampling and modeling to rapidly assess populations of soniferous benthic indicator species, whose vocalizations may yield indirect estimates of habitat quality.",

    "abstract": "In the noisy cellular environment, gene products are subject to inherent random fluctuations in copy numbers over time. How cells ensure precision in the timing of key intracellular events, in spite of such stochasticity is an intriguing fundamental problem. We formulate event timing as a first-passage time problem, where an event is triggered when the level of a protein crosses a critical threshold for the first time. Novel analytical calculations are preformed for the first-passage time distribution in stochastic models of gene expression, including models with feedback regulation. Derivation of these formulas motivates an interesting question: is there an optimal feedback strategy to regulate the synthesis of a protein to ensure that an event will occur at a precise time, while minimizing deviations or noise about the mean. Counter-intuitively, results show that for a stable long-lived protein, the optimal strategy is to express the protein at a constant rate without any feedback regulation, and any form of feedback (positive, negative or any combination of them) will always amplify noise in event timing. In contrast, a positive feedback mechanism provides the highest precision in timing for an unstable protein. These theoretical results explain recent experimental observations of single-cell lysis times in bacteriophage{lambda} . Here, lysis of an infected bacterial cell is orchestrated by the expression and accumulation of a stable{lambda} protein up to a threshold, and precision in timing is achieved via feedforward, rather than feedback control. Our results have broad implications for diverse cellular processes that rely on precise temporal triggering of events.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater fungi are a poorly studied paraphyletic group that include a high diversity of phyla. Most studies of aquatic fungal diversity have focussed on single habitats, thus the linkage between habitat heterogeneity and fungal diversity remains largely unexplored. We took 216 samples from 54 locations representing eight different habitats in meso-oligotrophic, temperate Lake Stechlin in northern Germany, including the pelagic and littoral water column, sediments, and biotic substrates. We pyrosequenced with an universal eukaryotic marker within the ribosomal large subunit (LSU) in order to compare fungal diversity, community structure, and species turnover among habitats. Our analysis recovered 1024 fungal OTUs (97% criterion). Diversity was highest in the sediment, biofilms, and benthic samples (293-428 OTUs), intermediate in water and reed samples (36-64 OTUs), and lowest in plankton (8 OTUs) samples. NMDS clustering clearly grouped the eight studied habitats into six clusters, indicating that total diversity was strongly influenced by turnover among habitats. Fungal communities exhibited pronounced changes at the levels of phylum and order along a gradient from littoral to pelagic habitats. The large majority of OTUs could not be classified below the order level due to the lack of aquatic fungal entries in taxonomic databases. Our study provides a first estimate of lake-wide fungal diversity and highlights the important contribution of habitat-specificity to total fungal diversity. This remarkable diversity is probably an underestimate, because most lakes undergo seasonal changes and previous studies have uncovered differences in fungal communities among lakes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvances in research relating to menstruation and associated disorders (such as endometriosis and pre-menstrual syndrome) have been hindered by the lack of an appropriate animal model. Thus, many aspects of this phenomenon remain poorly understood limiting the development of efficacious treatment for women. Menstruating species account for only 1.5% of mammals, and less than 0.09% of these are non-primates. Menstruation occurs as a consequence of progesterone priming of the endometrial stroma and a spontaneous decidual reaction. At the end of each infertile cycle as progesterone levels decline the uterus is unable to maintain this terminally differentiated stroma and the superficial endometrium is shed. True menstruation has never been reported in rodents.\\n\\nObjectiveHere we describe the first observation of menstruation in a rodent, the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus).\\n\\nStudy DesignVirgin female spiny mice (n=14) aged 12-16 weeks were sampled through daily vaginal lavage for 2 complete reproductive cycles in our in-house colony at Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, Australia. Stage-specific collection of reproductive tissue and plasma was used for histology, prolactin immunohistochemistry, and ELISA assay of progesterone (n=5 / stage of the menstrual cycle). Normally distributed data are reported as the mean {+/-} standard error and significant differences calculated using a one-way ANOVA. Non-normal data are displayed as the median values of replicates (with interquartile range) and significant differences calculated using Kruskal-Wallis test.\\n\\nResultsMean cycle length was 8.7 {+/-} 0.4 days with red blood cells observed in the lavages over 3.0 {+/-} 0.2 days. Cyclic endometrial shedding and blood in the vaginal canal concluding with each infertile cycle was confirmed in all virgin females. The endometrium was thickest during the luteal phase, when plasma progesterone peaked at ~102.1 ng/mL and the optical density for prolactin immunoreactivity was strongest. The spiny mouse undergoes spontaneous decidualisation, demonstrating for the first time menstruation in a rodent.\\n\\nConclusionThe spiny mouse is the first rodent species known to menstruate and provides an unprecedented natural non-primate model to study the mechanisms of menstrual shedding and repair, and may be useful in furthering our understanding of human specific menstrual and pregnancy associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "While genome assembly projects have been successful in a number of haploid or inbred species, one of the current main challenges is assembling non-inbred or rearranged heterozygous genomes. To address this critical need, we introduce the open-source FALCON and FALCON-Unzip algorithms (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/FALCON/) to assemble Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT(R)) Sequencing data into highly accurate, contiguous, and correctly phased diploid genomes. We demonstrate the quality of this approach by assembling new reference sequences for three heterozygous samples, including an F1 hybrid of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the widely cultivated V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, and the coral fungus Clavicorona pyxidata that have challenged short-read assembly approaches. The FALCON-based assemblies were substantially more contiguous and complete than alternate short or long-read approaches. The phased diploid assembly enabled the study of haplotype structures and heterozygosities between the homologous chromosomes, including identifying widespread heterozygous structural variations within the coding sequences.",

The flexible reconfiguration of these patterns enables behavioral adaptation, such as the acquisition of a new motor skill. Yet, the degree to which these reconfigurations depend on the brains baseline sensorimotor integration is far from understood. Here, we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in sensorimotor networks at baseline were predictive of individual differences in future learning. We analyzed functional MRI data from 19 participants prior to six weeks of training on a new motor skill. We found that visual-motor connectivity was inversely related to learning rate: sensorimotor autonomy at baseline corresponded to faster learning in the future. Using three additional scans, we found that visual-motor connectivity at baseline is a relatively stable individual trait. These results suggest that individual differences in motor skill learning can be predicted from sensorimotor autonomy at baseline prior to task execution.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISensorimotor autonomy at rest predicts faster motor learning in the future.\\nC_LIO_LIConnection between calcarine and superior precentral sulci form strongest predictor.\\nC_LIO_LISensorimotor autonomy is a relatively stable individual trait.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The delineation of conservation units (CUs) is a challenging issue that has profound implications for minimizing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. CU delineation typically seeks to prioritize evolutionary significance and genetic methods play a pivotal role in the delineation process by quantifying overall differentiation between populations. While CUs that primarily reflect overall genetic differentiation do protect adaptive differences between distant populations, they do not necessarily protect adaptive variation within highly connected populations. Advances in genomic methodology facilitate the characterization of adaptive genetic variation, but the potential utility of this information for CU delineation is unclear. Here we use genomic methods to investigate the evolutionary basis of premature migration in Pacific salmon, a complex behavioral and physiological adaptation that exists within highly-connected populations and has experienced severe declines. Strikingly, we find that premature migration is associated with the same single locus across multiple populations in each of two different species. Patterns of variation at this locus suggest that the premature migration alleles arose from a single evolutionary event within each species and were subsequently spread to distant populations through straying and positive selection. Our results reveal that complex adaptive variation can depend on rare mutational events at a single locus, demonstrate that CUs reflecting overall genetic differentiation can fail to protect evolutionarily significant variation that has substantial ecological and societal benefits, and suggest that a supplemental framework for protecting specific adaptive variation will sometimes be necessary to prevent the loss of significant biodiversity and ecosystem services.",

Four experiments were developed to study how subjects (n=10) operate with different number and behaviour of supernumerary hands. The behaviours involved inserting movement delays to the virtual hands and adjustingtheir movement scale or position. It was found that having more hands to operate with does not necessarily mean higher success rate while performinga certain task. However, supernumerary hands could bemade more effective by adjusting the associated movement scales of the extra hands. The subjective feeling and ownership of the hands diminished when a delay was inserted for the virtual hands or when their position was altered.",

    "abstract": "Camera trapping surveys frequently capture individuals whose identity is only known from a single flank. The most widely used methods for incorporating these partial identity individuals into density analyses discard some of the partial identity capture histories, reducing precision, and while not previously recognized, introducing bias. Here, we present the spatial partial identity model (SPIM), which uses the spatial location where partial identity samples are captured to probabilistically resolve their complete identities, allowing all partial identity samples to be used in the analysis. We show that the SPIM out-performs other analytical alternatives. We then apply the SPIM to an ocelot data set collected on a trapping array with double-camera stations and a bobcat data set collected on a trapping array with single-camera stations. The SPIM improves inference in both cases and in the ocelot example, individual sex determined from photographs is used to further resolve partial identities, one of which is resolved to near certainty. The SPIM opens the door for the investigation of trapping designs that deviate from the standard 2 camera design, the combination of other data types between which identities cannot be deterministically linked, and can be extended to the problem of partial genotypes.",

To identify these  host-exposed proteins, we used spatially restricted enzymatic tagging followed by mass spectrometry analysis of C. elegans infected with two species of Nematocida microsporidia. We identified 82 microsporidia proteins inside of intestinal cells, including several pathogen proteins in the nucleus. These microsporidia proteins are enriched in targeting signals, are rapidly evolving, and belong to large, Nematocida-specific gene families. We also find that large, species-specific families are common throughout microsporidia species. Our data suggest that the use of a large number of rapidly evolving species-specific proteins represents a common strategy for these intracellular pathogens to interact with their hosts. The unbiased method described here for identifying potential pathogen effectors represents a powerful approach for the study of a broad range of pathogens.",

An emerging non-conventional role of TRF2 is as a transcriptional regulator through extra-telomeric bindings.

Decrease in TRF2 occupancy was found on multiple gene promoters in cells with elongated telomeres, including the cell cycle regulator kinase-p21. We found that TRF2 is a transcriptional repressor of p21, and, interestingly, TRF2-mediated regulatory control of p21 is telomere length dependent.",

    "abstract": "Telomere maintenance is a hallmark of cancer as it provides cancer cells with cellular immortality. A significant fraction of tumors uses the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway to elongate their telomeres and to gain an unlimited proliferation potential. Since the ALT pathway is unique to cancer cells, it represents a potentially valuable, currently unexploited target for anticancer therapies. Recently, it was proposed that ALT renders cells hypersensitive to ataxia telangiectasia-and RAD3-related (ATR) protein inhibitors (Flynn et al., Science 347, 273). Here, we measured the response of various ALT or telomerase positive cell lines to the ATR inhibitor VE-821. In addition, we compared the effect of the inhibitor on cell viability in an isogenic cell line, in which ALT was active or suppressed. In these experiments a general ATR inhibitor sensitivity of cells with ALT could not be confirmed. We rather propose that the observed variations in sensitivity reflect differences between cell lines that are unrelated to ALT.",
