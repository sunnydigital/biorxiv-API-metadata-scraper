    "abstract": "BackgroundThree to four gene expression-based subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) have been previously reported. We sought to systematically determine the similarity of HGSC subtypes between populations.\\n\\nMethodsWe independently clustered (k = 3 and k = 4) five publicly-available HGSC mRNA expression datasets with >130 tumors using k-means and non-negative matrix factorization. Within each population, we summarized differential expression patterns for each cluster as moderated t statistic vectors using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. We calculated Pearsons correlations of these vectors to determine similarities and differences in expression patterns between clusters. We defined syn-clusters (SC) as sets of clusters that were strongly correlated across populations, and associated their expression patterns with biological pathways using geneset overrepresentation analyses.\\n\\nResultsAcross populations, for k = 3, moderated t score correlations for clusters 1, 2 and 3, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.80-0.90, and 0.65-0.77. For k = 4, correlations for clusters 1-4, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.83-0.89, 0.51-0.76, and 0.61-0.75. Within populations, comparing analogous clusters (k = 3 versus k = 4), correlations were high for clusters 1 and 2 (0.91-1.00), but were lower for cluster 3 (0.22-0.80). Results are similar using non-negative matrix factorization. SC1 corresponds to previously-reported mesenchymal-like, SC2 to proliferative-like, SC3 to immunoreactive-like, and SC4 to differentiated-like subtypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe mesenchymal-like and proliferative-like subtypes are remarkably consistent across populations and could be uniquely targeted for treatment. The other two previously described subtypes are considerably less robust, and since cross-population comparison reveals that k = 3 and k = 4 are both consistent with our results, they may not represent clear subtypes.",

    "abstract": "New integrative approaches are needed to harness the potential of rapidly growing datasets of protein expression and microbial community composition in colorectal cancer (CRC). Chemical and thermodynamic models offer theoretical tools to describe populations of biomacromolecules and their relative potential for formation in different microenvironmental conditions. The average oxidation state of carbon (ZC) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from the chemical formulas of proteins, and water demand per residue [Formula] is computed by writing the overall formation reactions of proteins from basis species. Using reported results from clinical proteomic studies and microbial community profiling, many datasets exhibit higher mean ZC or [Formula] of proteins in carcinoma or adenoma compared to normal tissue. Microbial protein compositions have lower ZC in bacteria enriched in fecal samples from cancer patients. In thermodynamic calculations, the potential for formation of the cancer-related proteins is energetically favored by changes in the chemical activity of H2O and fugacity of O2 that reflect the compositional differences. The compositional analysis suggests that a systematic shift in chemical composition is an essential feature of the cancer proteome, and the thermodynamic descriptions show that the observed proteomic transformations could be promoted by microenvironments shifted toward more oxidizing conditions and increased hydration levels.",

    "abstract": "Proteasomes are essential for protein homeostasis in eukaryotes. To preserve cellular function, transcription of proteasome subunit genes is induced in response to proteasome dysfunction caused by pathogen attacks or proteasome inhibitor drugs. In Caenorhabditis elegans, this response requires SKN-1, a transcription factor related to mammalian Nrf1/2. Here, we use comprehensive genetic analyses to identify the pathway required for C. elegans to detect proteasome dysfunction and activate SKN-1. Genes required for SKN-1 activation encode regulators of ER traffic, a peptide N-glycanase, and DDI-1, a conserved aspartic protease. DDI-1 expression is induced by proteasome dysfunction, and we show that DDI-1 is required to cleave and activate an ER-associated isoform of SKN-1. Mammalian Nrf1 is also ER-associated and subject to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a conserved mechanism of proteasome surveillance. Targeting mammalian DDI1 protease could mitigate effects of proteasome dysfunction in aging and protein aggregation disorders, or increase effectiveness of proteasome inhibitor cancer chemotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Levelts Propositions have been a touchstone for experimental and modeling studies of perceptual multistability. We asked whether Levelts Propositions extend to perceptual multistability involving interocular grouping. To address this question we used split-grating stimuli withcomplementary halves of the same color. As in previous studies, subjects reported four percepts in alternation: the two stimuli presented to each eye (single-eye percepts), as well as two interocularly grouped, single color percepts (grouped percepts). Most subjects responded to increased color saturation by more frequently reporting a single color image, thus increasingthe predominance of grouped percepts (Levelts Proposition I). In these subjects increased predominance was due to a decrease in the average dominance duration of single-eye percepts, while that of grouped percepts remained largely unaffected. This is in accordance with generalized Levelts Proposition II which posits that the average dominance duration of the stronger (in this case single-eye) percept is primarily affectedbychanges in stimulus strength. In accordance with Proposition III, thealternation rate increased as the difference in the strength of the percepts decreased. To explain the mechanism behind these observations, we introduce a hierarchical model consisting of low-level neural populations, eachresponding to input at a visual hemifield, and higher-level populations representing the percepts. The model exhibits the changes in dominance durationobserved in the data, and conforms to all of Levelts Propositions.",

    "abstract": "Many SNPs that are predicted to encode deleterious amino acid variants. These mildly deleterious mutations may provide unique insights into population history, the dynamics of selection, and the genetic bases of phenotypes. This may be especially true for domesticated species, where a history of bottlenecks and selection can contribute to the accumulation of deleterious SNPs (dSNPs). Here we investigate the numbers and frequencies of deleterious variants in Asian rice (O. sativa), focusing on two varieties (japonica and indica) that may have been domesticated independently and their wild relative (O. rufipogon). Most dSNPs were lost during domestication, but comparative analyses in two population datasets indicated that the remaining dSNPs shifted in site frequency spectrum (SFS) relative to synonymous SNPs. Moreover, dSNPs were enriched within low recombination regions of the genome and experienced frequency increases similar to synonymous SNPs within regions of putative selective sweeps. A characteristic feature of rice domestication was a shift in mating system from outcrossing to predominantly selfing. Forward simulations suggest that this shift in mating system may have been the dominant factor in shaping extant rice diversity.",

    "abstract": "Within a rational framework, a decision-maker selects actions based on the reward-maximisation principle, i.e., acquiring the highest amount of reward with the lowest cost. Action selection can be divided into two dimensions: (i) selecting an action among several alternatives, and (ii) choosing the response vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. Previous works have addressed the computational substrates of such a selection process under the assumption that outcome values are stationary and do not change during the course of a session. This assumption does not hold when the motivational drive of the decision-maker is variable, because it leads to changes in the values of the outcomes, e.g., satiety decreases the value of the outcome. Here, we utilize an optimal control framework and derive the optimal choice and response vigor under different experimental conditions. The results imply that, in contrast to previous suggestions, even under conditions that the values of the outcomes are changing during the session, the optimal response rate in an instrumental conditioning experiment is a constant response rate rather than decreasing. Furthermore, we prove that the uncertainty of the decision-maker about the duration of the session explains the commonly observed decrease in response rates within a session. We also show that when the environment consists of multiple outcomes, the model explains probability matching as well as maximisation choice strategies. These results, therefore, provide a quantitative analysis of optimal choice and response vigor under variable motivational drive, and provide predictions for future testing.",

    "abstract": "Testing for associations in big data faces the problem of multiple comparisons, with true signals buried inside the noise of all associations queried. This is particularly true in genetic association studies where a substantial proportion of the variation of human phenotypes is driven by numerous genetic variants of small effect. The current strategy to improve power to identify these weak associations consists of applying standard marginal statistical approaches and increasing study sample sizes. While successful, this approach does not leverage the environmental and genetic factors shared between the multiple phenotypes collected in contemporary cohorts. Here we develop a method that improves the power of detecting associations when a large number of correlated variables have been measured on the same samples. Our analyses over real and simulated data provide direct support that large sets of correlated variables can be leveraged to achieve dramatic increases in statistical power equivalent to a two or even three folds increase in sample size.",

    "abstract": "Lysine acetylation is a key post-translational modification that regulates diverse proteins involved in a range of biological processes. The role of histone acetylation in plant defense is well established and it is known that pathogen effector proteins encoding acetyltransferses can directly acetylate host proteins to alter immunity. However, it is unclear whether endogenous plant enzymes can modulate protein acetylation during an immune response. Here we investigate how the effector molecule HC-toxin, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, produced by Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 promotes pathogen virulence in maize through altering protein acetylation. Using mass spectrometry we globally quantified the abundance of 3,636 proteins and the levels of acetylation at 2,791 sites in maize plants treated with HC-toxin as well as HC-toxin deficient or producing strains of C. carbonum. Analyses of these data demonstrate that acetylation is a widespread post-translational modification impacting proteins encoded by many intensively studied maize genes. Furthermore, the application of exogenous HC-toxin enabled us to show that the activity of plant-encoded enzymes can be modulated to alter acetylation of non-histone proteins during an immune response. Collectively, these results provide a resource for further mechanistic studies examining the regulation of protein function and offer insight into the complex immune response triggered by virulent C. carbonum.",

Neurons are highly polarized cells in which autophagosome biogenesis is spatially compartmentalized. The mechanisms and physiological importance of this spatial compartmentalization of autophagy in the neuronal development of living animals are not well understood. Here we determine that, in C. elegans neurons, autophagosomes form near synapses and are required for neurodevelopment. We first determined, through unbiased genetic screens and systematic genetic analyses, that autophagy is required cell-autonomously for presynaptic assembly and for axon outgrowth dynamics in specific neurons. We observe autophagosomes in the axon near synapses, and this localization depends on the synaptic vesicle kinesin, KIF1A/UNC-104. KIF1A/UNC-104 coordinates localized autophagosome formation by regulating the transport of the integral membrane autophagy protein, ATG-9. Our findings indicate that autophagy is spatially regulated in neurons through the transport of ATG-9 by KIF1A/UNC-104 to regulate neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "In the noisy cellular environment, gene products are subject to inherent random fluctuations in copy numbers over time. How cells ensure precision in the timing of key intracellular events, in spite of such stochasticity is an intriguing fundamental problem. We formulate event timing as a first-passage time problem, where an event is triggered when the level of a protein crosses a critical threshold for the first time. Novel analytical calculations are preformed for the first-passage time distribution in stochastic models of gene expression, including models with feedback regulation. Derivation of these formulas motivates an interesting question: is there an optimal feedback strategy to regulate the synthesis of a protein to ensure that an event will occur at a precise time, while minimizing deviations or noise about the mean. Counter-intuitively, results show that for a stable long-lived protein, the optimal strategy is to express the protein at a constant rate without any feedback regulation, and any form of feedback (positive, negative or any combination of them) will always amplify noise in event timing. In contrast, a positive feedback mechanism provides the highest precision in timing for an unstable protein. These theoretical results explain recent experimental observations of single-cell lysis times in bacteriophage{lambda} . Here, lysis of an infected bacterial cell is orchestrated by the expression and accumulation of a stable{lambda} protein up to a threshold, and precision in timing is achieved via feedforward, rather than feedback control. Our results have broad implications for diverse cellular processes that rely on precise temporal triggering of events.",

In the past twenty years, complex adaptive systems has been sharpened from an abstract concept into a series of tools that can be used to solve concrete problems. These advances have been led by the development of new techniques for coupling ecological and evolutionary dynamics, for integrating dynamics across multiple scales of organization, and for using data to infer the complex interactions among different components of ecological systems. Focusing on the development and usage of these new methods, we explore how they have led to an improved understanding of three universal features of complex adaptive systems, emergent patterns; tipping points and critical phenomena; and cooperative behavior. We restrict our attention primarily to marine ecosystems, which provide numerous successful examples of the application of complex adaptive systems. Many of these are currently undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic perturbations, and we take the opportunity to discuss how complex adaptive systems can be used to improve the management of public goods and to better preserve critical ecosystem services.",
