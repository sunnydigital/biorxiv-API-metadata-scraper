    "abstract": "Cell-free environments are becoming viable alternatives for implementing biological networks in synthetic biology. The reconstituted cell-free expression system (PURE) allows characterization of genetic networks under defined conditions but its applicability to native bacterial promoters and endogenous genetic networks is limited due to the poor transcription rate of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in this minimal system. We found that addition of transcription elongation factors GreA and GreB to the PURE system increased transcription rates of E. coli RNA polymerase from sigma factor 70 promoters up to 6-fold and enhanced the performance of a genetic network. Furthermore, we reconstituted activation of natural E. coli promoters controlling flagella biosynthesis by the transcriptional activator FlhDC and sigma factor 28. Addition of GreA/GreB to the PURE system allows efficient expression from natural and synthetic E. coli promoters and characterization of their regulation in minimal and defined reaction conditions making the PURE system more broadly applicable to study genetic networks and bottom-up synthetic biology.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/024604_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (13K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@53902org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1ba85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c961eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143928d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Rapid species radiations can obscure phylogenetic relationships between even distantly related species and lead to incorrect evolutionary inferences. For this reason, we examined evolutionary relationships among the three North American milkweed butterflies, Danaus plexippus, D. gilippus and D. eresimus using >400 orthologous gene sequences assembled from transcriptome data. Contrary to previous phylogenetic assessments, our results indicate that D. plexippus and D. eresimus are the sister taxa among these species. This result explains many previously noted phylogenetic incongruences such as an amino acid substitution in the sodium-potassium pump (Na+,K+-ATPase) of D. eresimus and D. plexippus, which increases resistance to the toxins found in these butterflies host plants. In accordance with a rapid radiation of Danaus butterflies, we also find evidence that both incomplete lineage sorting and post-speciation genetic exchange have contributed significantly to the evolutionary histories of these species. Furthermore, our findings suggest that D. plexippus is highly derived both morphologically and behaviorally.",

Salmonella typhimurium and E.coli Methionyl tRNA synthetase taken in current study as these bacteria are closely related to each other and have fewer differences in amino acid sequences for MetG. This study helps to identify various structural and functional differences at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, with functional differences by Docking study with Methionine. Study involves analysis of differences based on observation of differences in modeled 3D protein for sequences available at NCBI and its comparison with Known 3D structure. As sequences difference are in functional protein from non-mutant species, the differences are analysed in context of Primary, secondary, tertiary structure differences, Disorder differences, and docking differences.",

    "abstract": "In order to produce dependable results, the output of models must be carefully evaluated and compared to the experimental data. One of the main goals of analyzing a model is understanding the effect of input factors on the model output. This task is carried out using a methodology known as sensitivity analysis. The analysis of Individual-based Models is hindered by the lack of simple tools allowing a complete and throughout evaluation without much effort. This kind of models tends to have a high level of complexity and the manual execution of a large experimental setup is generally not a feasible choice. Thus, it is required that model evaluation should ideally be simple and robust without demanding a high level of knowledge from modelers. In this work we present the RRepast, an open source GNU R package for executing, calibrating and analyzing Repast Symphony models directly from the R environment.",

    "abstract": "Prior research on cooperative breeders has considered correlations between group reproductive output (GRO) and the number of individuals in each age-sex class, but without controlling for uneven sampling efforts, the underlying effects of group size, and pseudoreplication at the group and species levels. Among callitrichids, age-sex classes do not provide meaningful categories, as individuals within an age-sex class can demonstrate varying reproductive development due to reproductive dominance of a few individuals per group. This study re-assesses the drivers of GRO in callitrichids by a) conducting a meta-analysis of published studies of callitrichid group composition; b) determining a novel method to assign developmental class based on reproductive morphology; and c) utilizing a multistep modelling approach to assess whether any sex-based developmental class predicts both the presence and the numbers of surviving offspring among free-ranging saddleback (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor tamarins (Saguinus imperator) in Peru. The meta-analysis utilizing a historical dataset revealed that adult females and group size, but not the number of adult males is significantly correlated with GRO. Statistical models of the new dataset revealed that only mature males predicted if groups had any infants at all, but that the number of surviving infants was predicted by mature females and group size. Thus mature males appear to be necessary for groups to raise any infants, but mature females and a larger group size increase group reproductive output overall.",

    "abstract": "The thalamus mediates diverse brain functions including arousal, perception and memory formation, and is characterized by widespread connectivity. One thalamus projection that is evolutionarily conserved is to the habenula, a regulator of broadly acting neuromodulators. The function of this projection is unknown, as the information transmitted has not been identified. By two-photon calcium imaging of larval zebrafish, we show that change in irradiance triggers dynamic responses in the habenula. Neuroanatomical tracing shows that the dorsal left habenula neuropil, which has the most prominent response to irradiance change and influences irradiance-dependent behavior and raphe response, is innervated by retinorecipient nuclei in the thalamus. Optogenetic stimulation of the thalamus triggers habenula activity, while lesion reduces light-evoked habenula activity. These data establish that the thalamus controls habenula activity following irradiance change, thereby suggesting that the thalamo-habenula projection provides a pathway for visual stimuli to affect neuromodulator release and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster P transposable element provides one of the best cases of horizontal transfer of a mobile DNA sequence in eukaryotes. Invasion of natural populations by the P element has led to a syndrome of phenotypes known as \\\"P-M hybrid dysgenesis\\\" that emerges when strains differing in their P element composition mate and produce offspring. Despite extensive research on many aspects of P element biology, questions remain about the stability and genomic basis of variation in P-M dysgenesis phenotypes. Here we report the P-M status for a number of populations sampled recently from Ukraine that appear to be undergoing a shift in their P element composition. Gondal dysgenesis assays reveal that Ukrainian populations of D. melanogaster are currently dominated by the P cytotype, a cytotype that was previously thought to be rare in nature, suggesting that a new active form of the P element has recently spread in this region. We also compared gondal dysgenesis phenotypes and genomic P element predictions for isofemale strains obtained from three worldwide populations of D. melanogaster in order to guide further work on the molecular basis of differences in cytotype status across populations. We find that the number of euchromatic P elements per strain can vary significantly across populations but that total P element numbers are not strongly correlated with the degree of gondal dysgenesis. Our work shows that rapid changes in cytotype status can occur in natural populations of D. melanogaster, and informs future efforts to decode the genomic basis of geographic and temporal differences in P element induced phenotypes.",
