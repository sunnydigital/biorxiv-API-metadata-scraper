    "abstract": "Hyponatremia is a serious complication of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use. We investigated potential mechanisms in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In study 1, healthy drug-experienced volunteers received MDMA or placebo alone and in combination with the alpha-1 adrenergic inverse agonist prazosin, used as a positive control to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In study 2, volunteers received MDMA or placebo followed by standardized water intake. MDMA lowered serum sodium, but did not increase ADH or copeptin, although the control prazosin did increase ADH. Water loading reduced serum sodium more after MDMA than after placebo. There was a trend for women to have lower baseline serum sodium than men, but there were no significant interactions with drug condition. Combining studies, MDMA potentiated the ability of water to lower serum sodium. Thus, hyponatremia appears to be a significant risk when hypotonic fluids are consumed during MDMA use. Clinical trials and events where MDMA use is common should anticipate and mitigate this risk.",

    "abstract": "Two-component signaling (TCS) is the primary means by which bacteria sense and respond to the environment. TCS involves two partner proteins working in tandem, which interact to perform cellular functions while limiting interactions with non-partners (i.e., \\\"cross-talk\\\"). We construct a Potts model for TCS that can quantitatively predict how mutating amino acid identities affect the interaction between TCS partners and non-partners. The parameters of this model are inferred directly from protein sequence data. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of exploring the sequence-space of TCS proteins. As a stringent test, we compare its predictions to a recent comprehensive mutational study, which characterized the functionality of 204 mutational variants of the PhoQ kinase in Escherichia coli. We find that our best predictions accurately reproduce the amino acid combinations found in experiment, which enable functional signaling with its partner PhoP. These predictions demonstrate the evolutionary pressure to preserve the interaction between TCS partners as well as prevent unwanted \\\"crosstalk\\\". Further, we calculate the mutational change in the binding affinity between PhoQ and PhoP, providing an estimate to the amount of destabilization needed to disrupt TCS.",

    "abstract": "Bilateria constitute a monophyletic group of organisms comprising about 99% of all living animals. Since their initial radiation about 540Mya they have evolved a plethora of traits and body forms allowing them to conquer almost any habitat on earth. There are only few truly uniting and shared morphological features retained across the phylum. Unsurprisingly, also the genetic toolkit of bilateria is highly diverged.\\n\\nIn the light of this divergence we investigated if a set of Bilaterian-specific genes exists and, beyond this, if such genes are related with respect to function and expression patterns among organisms as distant as fly, worm and fish. Using a conservative pyramidal approach of orthology inference we first employed BLAST to extract a set of protein-coding genes which has orthologs in all major branches of Bilateria, but no homologs in non-Bilaterian species. To characterize the proteins with respect to function, we developed a new method for multi-species GO analysis and augmented it by a human-curated annotation based on an extensive literature search. Finally, we extracted characteristic developmental expression profiles for Bilateria from the detailed data available for three model organisms and we explored the relation between expression and function.\\n\\nWe find 85 clusters of pan-bilaterian proteins. Although some of these proteins belong to common developmental processes, they cover a wide range of biological components, from transcription factors to metabolic enzymes. The 85 groups include myoD, an important regulator of mesodermal cell fate and muscle development, and prospero and several other factors involved in nervous system development. They reveal a so far unknown connection between bilaterian key innovations (mesoderm, complex nervous system) and the emergence of new genes in the ancestor of bilaterians. In addition, the majority of these genes tends to be highly expressed when the adult body plan is constructed. These observations are compatible with the idea that bilaterians are characterized by the unfolding of an additional developmental phase, namely the transition of the larva to morphologically distinct adults.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBilateria represent by far the largest and morphologically most diverse clade of all extant animals. The bilaterian radiation dates back to the so-called Cambrian explosion of species. Although bilateria show a large variety of very distinct body plans, they are also characterized by several common developmental and morphological properties, upon which their monophyly is based. Here, we wanted to know whether these common phenotypic features may also have a common genetic basis, manifested by a set of bilaterian lineage-specific genes. To address this question we compared the proteomes of bilaterian and non-bilaterian species and extracted an initial set of a few hundred candidate proteins. Their underlying genes were further post-processed by means of orthology clustering, multi-species GO enrichment, expression analysis and extensive literature mining. This resulted in a set of 85 clusters of orthologous genes with roles in body morphology-, neuronal system-and muscle development, as well as in cell-cell signalling processes. These genes can be regarded as very promising candidates for further investigation of the genetic basis of a pan-bilaterian pheno-or morphotype and they should be highly interesting targets for functional studies in non-model organisms.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference pathways mediate multiple biological processes through Argonaute-family proteins, which bind small RNAs as guides to silence complementary target nucleic acids. In insects and crustaceans, Argonaute-2 silences viral nucleic acids, and therefore acts as a primary effector of innate antiviral immunity. Although the function of the major of Argonaute-2 domains, which are conserved across most Argonaute-family proteins, are known, many invertebrate Argonaute-2 homologs contain a glutamine-rich repeat (GRR) region of unknown function at the N-terminus. Here we combine long-read amplicon sequencing of Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines with publicly available sequence data from many insect species to show that this region evolves extremely rapidly and is hypervariable within species. We identify distinct GRR haplotype groups in D. melanogaster, and suggest that one of these haplotype groups has recently risen to high frequency in North American populations. Finally, we use published data from genome-wide association studies of viral resistance in D. melanogaster to test whether GRR haplotypes are associated with survival after virus challenge. We find a marginally significant association with survival after challenge with Drosophila C Virus in the DGRP, but we were unable to replicate this finding using lines from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource panel.",

    "abstract": "The study of fitness landscapes, which aims at mapping genotypes to fitness, is receiving ever-increasing attention. Novel experimental approaches combined with NGS methods enable accurate and extensive studies of the fitness effects of mutations - allowing us to test theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of the shape of the true underlying fitness landscape, and its implications for the predictability and repeatability of evolution.\\n\\nHere, we present a uniquely large multi-allelic fitness landscape comprised of 640 engineered mutants that represent all possible combinations of 13 amino-acid changing mutations at six sites in the heat-shock protein Hsp90 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under elevated salinity. Despite a prevalent pattern of negative epistasis in the landscape, we find that the global fitness peak is reached via four positively epistatic mutations. Combining traditional and extending recently proposed theoretical and statistical approaches, we quantify features of the global multi-allelic fitness landscape. Using subsets of the data, we demonstrate that extrapolation beyond a known part of the landscape is difficult owing to both local ruggedness and amino-acid specific epistatic hotspots, and that inference is additionally confounded by the non-random choice of mutations for experimental fitness landscapes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe study of fitness landscapes is fundamentally concerned with understanding the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in adaptive evolution. Here, the authors present a uniquely large and complete multi-allelic intragenic fitness landscape of 640 systematically engineered mutations in yeast Hsp90. Using a combination of traditional and recently proposed theoretical approaches, they study the accessibility of the global fitness peak, and the potential for predictability of the fitness landscape topography. They report local ruggedness of the landscape and the existence of epistatic hotspot mutations, which together make extrapolation and hence predictability inherently difficult, if mutation-specific information is not considered.",
