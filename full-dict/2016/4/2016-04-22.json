    "abstract": "Two broad paradigms exist for inferring dN/dS, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates, from coding sequences: i) a one-rate approach, where dN/dS is represented with a single parameter, or ii) a two-rate approach, where dN and dS are estimated separately. The performances of these two approaches have been well-studied in the specific context of proper model specification, i.e. when the inference model matches the simulation model. By contrast, the relative performances of one-rate vs. two-rate parameterizations when applied to data generated according to a different mechanism remains unclear. Here, we compare the relative merits of one-rate and two-rate approaches in the specific context of model misspecification by simulating alignments with mutation-selection models rather than with dN/dS-based models. We find that one-rate frameworks generally infer more accurate dN/dS point estimates, even when dS varies among sites. In other words, modeling dS variation may substantially reduce accuracy of dN/dS point estimates. These results appear to depend on the selective constraint operating at a given site. In particular, for sites under strong purifying selection (dN/dS<~0.3), one-rate and two-rate models show comparable performances. However, one-rate models significantly outperform two-rate models for sites under moderate-to-weak purifying selection. We attribute this distinction to the fact that, for these more quickly evolving sites, a given substitution is more likely to be nonsynonymous than synonymous. The data will therefore be relatively enriched for nonsynonymous changes, and modeling dS contributes excessive noise to dN/dS estimates. We additionally find that high levels of divergence among sequences, rather than the number of sequences in the alignment, are more critical for obtaining precise point estimates.",

    "abstract": "Fibrillogenesis, the production or development of protein fibers, has been linked to protein folding diseases. The progress curve of fibrils or aggregates typically takes on a sigmoidal shape witha lag phase, a rapid growth phase, and a final plateau regime. The study of the lag phase and the estimation of its critical timescale provide insight into the factors regulating the fibrillation process. However, methods to estimate a quantitative expression for the lag time rely on empirical expressions, which cannot connect the lag time to kinetic parameters associated with the reaction mechanisms of protein fibrillation. Here we introduce an approach for the estimation of the lag time using the governing rate equations of the elementary reactions of a subsequent monomer addition model for protein fibrillation as a case study. We show that the lag time is given by the sum of the critical timescales for each fibril intermediate in the subsequent monomer addition mechanism and therefore reveals causal connectivity between intermediate species. Furthermore, we find that single-molecule assays of protein fibrillation can exhibit a lag phase without a nucleation process, while dyes and extrinsic fluorescent probe bulk assays of protein fibrillation do not exhibit an observable lag time phase during template-dependent elongation. Our approach could be valuable for investigating the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the protein fibrillation reaction mechanism and provides physicochemical insights into parameters regulating the lag phase.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping is a powerful technique for dissecting the genetic basis of traits and species differences. Established tomato mapping populations between domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its more distant interfertile relatives typically follow a near isogenic line (NIL) design, such as the Solanum pennellii Introgression Line (IL) population, with a single wild introgression per line in an otherwise domesticated genetic background. Here we report on a new advanced backcross QTL mapping resource for tomato, derived from a cross between the M82 tomato cultivar and S. pennelli. This so-called Backcrossed Inbred Line (BIL) population is comprised of a mix of BC2 and BC3 lines, with domesticated tomato as the recurrent parent. The BIL population is complementary to the existing S. pennellii IL population, with which it shares parents. Using the BILs we mapped traits for leaf complexity, leaflet shape, and flowering time. We demonstrate the utility of the BILs for fine-mapping QTL, particularly QTL initially mapped in the ILs, by fine-mapping several QTL to single or few candidate genes. Moreover, we confirm the value of a backcrossed population with multiple introgressions per line, such as the BILs, for epistatic QTL mapping. Our work was further enabled by the development of our own statistical inference and visualization tools, namely a heterogeneous Hidden Markov Model for genotyping the lines, and by using state of the art sparse regression techniques for QTL mapping.",

    "abstract": "A major puzzle in ecology is how antibiotic resistant, sensitive and producer species coexist in close proximity. Recently, we showed that antibiotic degrading species dramatically alter community dynamics: replacing intrinsic resistance with resistance through degradation generates stable communities resilient to spatial mixing, large species abundance perturbations, changes in interaction strengths, and differences in species growth rates. In addition to ecological stability, it is interesting to consider evolutionary stability of these communities to the appearance of cheater species that either cease production or degradation of antibiotics. Our investigation of evolutionary stability of cyclical 3-species communities revealed that these communities are robust to cheaters that stop degrading antibiotics. Our simulations also showed that cheaters that stop producing antibiotics do not take over the community, yet they can transiently invade and cause community collapse. In the analytical approximation we initially investigated, production cheaters with a small fitness advantage can invade the community simply because the benefit of inhibiting competitors is shared among all cells. Here, we consider evolutionary stability to cheaters in our complete model, where spatial mixing is introduced only after a short range colonization step. In this regime, an antibiotic producer cell directly benefits from killing nearby competitor species as it has a greater chance of colonizing the newly voided spaces created by the action of its antibiotic. Simulating response to cheater invasions for the cyclical three species community and for random 4-species ecologically stable topologies, we find that these communities can be fully resilient to both degradation and production cheaters. The strength of selection against cheaters varies with the area of the zone of inhibition around producers and is maximized for weak inhibition, where there is less overlap between the killing zones of neighboring cells. These results may aid the construction of complex synthetic communities that are both ecological and evolutionary stable.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the main etiological agent of pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia is initiated by bacterial adherence to lung epithelial cells. Infection to the epithelium is a disruptive interspecies interaction involving numerous transcription-mediated processes. Revealing transcriptional changes may provide valuable insights into pneumococcal disease. Dual RNA-Seq allows simultaneous monitoring of the transcriptomes of both host and pathogen. Here, we developed a time-resolved infection model of human lung alveolar epithelial cells by S. pneumoniae and assessed transcriptome changes by dual RNA-Seq. Our data provide new insights into host-microbe interactions and show that the epithelial glutathione-detoxification pathway is activated by bacterial presence. We observed that adherent pneumococci, not free-floating bacteria, access host-associated carbohydrates and repress innate immune responses. In conclusion, we provide a dynamic dual-transcriptomics overview of early pneumococcal infection with easy online access (http://dualrnaseq.molgenrug.nl). Further database exploration may expand our understanding of epithelial-pneumococcal interaction, leading to novel antimicrobial strategies.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=199 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/048959_fig7.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 7\\\">\\nView larger version (60K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@351367org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8cd781org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@985c96org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e6b6a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The microbiome of Drosophila promotes intestinal stem cell division through evolutionarily conserved biochemical pathways. As such, axenic flies have lower rates of gut stem cell division than age-matched wild type counterparts. Additionally, flies with a full consortium of symbiotic bacteria are shorter lived than those maintained in the absence of a microbiome. However, we do not know if stem cell division is essential for symbiont-dependent regulation of adult fly lifespan. To determine if individual symbionts cause aging-dependent death in Drosophila, we examined the impacts of common symbionts on host longevity. In this study, we found that mono-association of adult Drosophila with Lactobacillus plantarum, a widely reported fly symbiont, and member of the probiotic Lactobacillus genus, curtails adult longevity relative to germ-free counterparts. However, the effects of plantarum on lifespan were independent of intestinal aging. Instead, we found that association with plantarum causes an extensive intestinal pathology within the host, characterized by loss of intestinal stem cells, impaired epithelial renewal, and a gradual erosion of epithelial integrity. Our study uncovers an unknown aspect of Lactobacillus plantarum-Drosophila interactions, and establishes a simple model to characterize symbiont-dependent disruption of intestinal homeostasis.",

According to one view, hippocampal coding differentiates between similar events to reduce interference, whereas an alternative view is that the hippocampus assigns similar representations to events that share item and context information. Here, we used multivariate analyses of activity patterns measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize how the hippocampus distinguishes between memories based on similarity of their item and/or context information. Hippocampal activity patterns discriminated between events that shared either item or context information, but generalized across events that shared similar item-context associations. The current findings provide novel evidence that, whereas the hippocampus can resist mnemonic interference by separating events that generalize along a single attribute dimension, overlapping hippocampal codes may support memory for events with overlapping item-context relations.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genetic engineering have made it possible to reprogram individual immune cells to express receptors that recognise markers on tumour cell surfaces. The process of re-engineering T cell lymphocytes to express Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs), and then re-infusing the CAR-modified T cells into patients to treat various cancers is referred to as CAR T cell therapy. This therapy is being explored in clinical trials - most prominently for B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (B-ALL), a common B cell malignancy, for which CAR T cell therapy has led to remission in up to 90% of patients. Despite this extraordinary response rate, however, potentially fatal inflammatory side effects occur in up to 10% of patients who have positive responses. Further, approximately 50% of patients who initially respond to the therapy relapse. Significant improvement is thus necessary before the therapy can be made widely available for use in the clinic.\\n\\nTo inform future development, we develop a mathematical model to explore interactions between CAR T cells, inflammatory toxicity, and individual patients tumour burdens in silico. This paper outlines the underlying system of coupled ordinary differential equations designed based on well-known immunological principles and widely accepted views on the mechanism of toxicity development in CAR T cell therapy for B-ALL - and reports in silico outcomes in relationship to standard and recently conjectured predictors of toxicity in a heterogeneous, randomly generated patient population. Our initial results and analyses are consistent with and connect immunological mechanisms to the clinically observed, counterintuitive hypothesis that initial tumour burden is a stronger predictor of toxicity than is the dose of CAR T cells administered to patients.\\n\\nWe outline how the mechanism of action in CAR T cell therapy can give rise to such non-standard trends in toxicity development, and demonstrate the utility of mathematical modelling in understanding the relationship between predictors of toxicity, mechanism of action, and patient outcomes.",

For luminal N-glycoproteins, demannosylation of their N-glycan to expose a terminal 1,6-linked mannose is necessary for their degradation via ERAD, but whether this modification is specific to misfolded proteins is unknown. Here we report that the Htm1p-Pdi1p complex acts as a folding-sensitive mannosidase for catalyzing this first committed step. We reconstitute this step in vitro with Htm1p-Pdi1p and model glycoprotein substrates whose structural states we can manipulate. We find that Htm1p-Pdi1p is a glycoprotein-specific mannosidase, which preferentially targets nonnative glycoproteins trapped in partially structured states. As such, Htm1p-Pdi1p is suited to act as a licensing factor that monitors folding in the ER lumen and preferentially commits glycoproteins trapped in partially structured states for degradation.",

We applied SeRPeNT to: a) generate an extended human annotation with 671 new sncRNAs from known classes and 131 from new potential classes, b) show pervasive differential processing between cell compartments and c) predict new molecules with miRNA-like behaviour from snoRNA, tRNA and long non-coding RNA precursors, potentially dependent on the miRNA biogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we validated experimentally four predicted novel non-coding RNAs: a miRNA, a snoRNA-derived miRNA, a processed tRNA and a new uncharacterized sncRNA.

The social nature of many extracellular polysaccharides remains unclear, and it has been suggested that they could function as either co-operative public goods, or as traits that provide a competitive advantage. Here we empirically test the co-operative nature of the PSL polysaccharide, which is crucial for the formation of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that: (1) PSL is not metabolically costly to produce; (2) PSL provides population level benefits in biofilms, for both growth and antibiotic tolerance; (3) the benefits of PSL production are social and are shared with other cells; (4) the benefits of PSL production appear to be preferentially directed towards cells which produce PSL; (5) cells which do not produce PSL are unable to successfully exploit cells which produce PSL. Taken together, this suggests that PSL is a social but relatively non-exploitable trait, and that growth within biofilms selects for PSL-producing strains, even when multiple strains can interact (low relatedness).",

The social nature of many extracellular polysaccharides remains unclear, and it has been suggested that they could function as either co-operative public goods, or as traits that provide a competitive advantage. Here we empirically test the co-operative nature of the PSL polysaccharide, which is crucial for the formation of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that: (1) PSL is not metabolically costly to produce; (2) PSL provides population level benefits in biofilms, for both growth and antibiotic tolerance; (3) the benefits of PSL production are social and are shared with other cells; (4) the benefits of PSL production appear to be preferentially directed towards cells which produce PSL; (5) cells which do not produce PSL are unable to successfully exploit cells which produce PSL. Taken together, this suggests that PSL is a social but relatively non-exploitable trait, and that growth within biofilms selects for PSL-producing strains, even when multiple strains can interact (low relatedness).",

    "abstract": "Understanding gene regulatory networks is critical to understanding cellular differentiation and response to external stimuli. Methods for global network inference have been developed and applied to a variety of species. Most approaches consider the problem of network inference independently in each species, despite evidence that gene regulation can be conserved even in distantly related species. Further, network inference is often confined to single data-types (single platforms) and single cell types. We introduce a method for multi-source network inference that allows simultaneous estimation of gene regulatory networks in multiple species or biological processes through the introduction of priors based on known gene relationships such as orthology incorporated using fused regression. This approach improves network inference performance even when orthology mapping and conservation are incomplete. We refine this method by presenting an algorithm that extracts the true conserved subnetwork from a larger set of potentially conserved interactions and demonstrate the utility of our method in cross species network inference. Last, we demonstrate our methods utility in learning from data collected on different experimental platforms.",

    "abstract": "A major aim of evolutionary biology is to explain the respective roles of adaptive versus non-adaptive changes in the evolution of complexity. While selection is certainly responsible for the spread and maintenance of complex phenotypes, this does not automatically imply that strong selection enhances the chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origination of complexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative importance of adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size decreases, selection weakens and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of this relationship, many theories invoke a role for population size in the evolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test empirically because of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological populations. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large or small asexual populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that both small and large--but not intermediate-sized--populations are favored to evolve larger genomes, which provides the opportunity for subsequent increases in phenotypic complexity. However, small and large populations followed different evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small populations evolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large populations fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These results demonstrate that genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity in small populations and that purifying selection is not powerful enough to prevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySince the early days of theoretical population genetics. scientists have debated the role of population size in shaping evolutionary dynamics. Do large populations possess an evolutionary advantage towards complexity due to the strength of natural selection in these populations? Or do small populations have the advantage, as genetic drift allows for the exploration of fitness landscapes inaccessible to large populations? There are many theories that predict whether large or small populations-those with strong selection or those with strong drift-should evolve the greatest complexity. Here, we use digital experimental evolution to examine the interplay between population size and the evolution of complexity. We found that genetic drift could lead to increased genome size and phenotypic complexity in very small populations. However, large populations also evolved similar large genomes and complexity. Small populations evolved larger genomes through the fixation of slightly deleterious insertions, while large populations utilized rare beneficial insertions. Our results suggest that both strong drift and strong selection can allow populations to evolve similar complexity, but through different evolutionary trajectories.",

We demonstrate that the chloroplast NADPH dehydrogenase complex (NDH), a homolog to respiratory Complex I, pumps approximately two protons from the chloroplast stroma to the lumen per electron transferred from ferredoxin to plastoquinone, effectively increasing the efficiency of ATP production via CEF by two-fold compared to CEF pathways involving non-proton-pumping plastoquinone reductases. Under certain physiological conditions, the coupling of proton and electron transfer reactions within NDH should enable a non-canonical mode of photosynthetic electron transfer, allowing electron transfer from plastoquinol to NADPH to be driven by the thylakoid proton motive force possibly helping to sense or remediate mismatches in the photosynthetic budget.",

Understanding the mechanisms of cone cell death and the identification of key players therein could provide new treatment options. We studied the neuroprotective effects of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA), in a mouse model of inherited, primary cone degeneration (cpfl1). We show that HDAC inhibition protects cones in vitro, in retinal explant cultures. More importantly, in vivo a single TSA injection increased cone survival for up to 10 days post-injection. In addition, the abnormal, incomplete cone migration pattern in the cpfl1 retina was significantly improved by HDAC inhibition. These findings suggest a crucial role for HDAC activity in primary cone degeneration and highlight a new avenue for future therapy developments for cone dystrophies and diseases associated with impaired cone migration.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes under different environmental or developmental conditions. Phenotypic plasticity is an ubiquitous feature of living organisms, and is typically based on variable patterns of gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which gene expression is influenced and regulated during plastic responses are poorly understood in most organisms. While modifications to DNA and histone proteins have been implicated as likely candidates for generating and regulating phenotypic plasticity, specific details of each modification and its mode of operation have remained largely unknown. In this study, we investigated how epigenetic mechanisms affect phenotypic plasticity in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. By measuring reaction norms of strains that are deficient in one of several key physiological processes we show that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in homeostasis and phenotypic plasticity of the fungus across a range of controlled environments. Effects on plasticity are specific to an environment and mechanism, indicating that epigenetic regulation is context dependent and is not governed by general plasticity genes. In our experiments with Neurospora, histone methylation and the RNA interference pathway had the greatest influence on phenotypic plasticity, while lack of DNA methylation had the least.",

    "abstract": "Not all visual memories are equal--some endure in our minds, while others quickly disappear. Recent behavioral work shows we can reliably predict which images will be remembered. This image property is called memorability. Memorability is intrinsic to an image, robust across observers, and unexplainable by low-level visual features. However, its neural bases and relation with perception and memory remain unknown. Here we characterize the representational dynamics of memorability using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We find memorability is indexed by brain responses starting at 218ms for faces and 371ms for scenes--later than classical early face/scene discrimination perceptual signals, yet earlier than the late memory encoding signal observed at ~700ms. The results show memorability is a high-level image property whose spatio-temporal neural dynamics are different from those of memory encoding. Together, this work brings new insights into the underlying neural processes of the transformation from what we perceive to what we remember.",

We compared the performance of the most popular methods against a dated tree of fossil Canidae derived from previously published monographs. Using a canid morphology dataset, we performed tip-dating using Beast 2.1.3 and MrBayes 3.2.5. We find that for key nodes (Canis, ~3.2 Ma, Caninae ~11.7 Ma) a non-mechanistic model using a uniform tree prior produces estimates that are unrealistically old (27.5, 38.9 Ma). Mechanistic models (incorporating lineage birth, death, and sampling rates) estimate ages that are closely in line with prior research. We provide a discussion of these two families of models (mechanistic vs. non-mechanistic) and their applicability to fossil datasets.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders (DDs) are enriched for damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important genes. We exome sequenced 4,293 families with individuals with DDs, and meta-analysed these data with published data on 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most significant factors influencing the diagnostic yield of de novo mutations are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents and the age of both father and mother. We identified 94 genes enriched for damaging de novo mutation at genome-wide significance (P < 7 x 10-7), including 14 genes for which compelling data for causation was previously lacking. We have characterised the phenotypic diversity among these genetic disorders. We demonstrate that, at current cost differentials, exome sequencing has much greater power than genome sequencing for novel gene discovery in genetically heterogeneous disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs (single nucleotide variants and indels) in coding sequences, with approximately half operating by a loss-of-function mechanism, and the remainder resulting in altered-function (e.g. activating, dominant negative). We established that most haplo insufficient developmental disorders have already been identified, but that many altered-function disorders remain to be discovered. Extrapolating from the DDD cohort to the general population, we estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average birth prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 (0.22-0.47% of live births), depending on parental age.\\n\\nAbbreviations",
