    "abstract": "Biomolecular temperature sensors can be used for efficient control of large-volume bioreactors, for spatiotemporal control and imaging of gene expression, as well as to engineer robustness to temperature in biomolecular circuit design. While RNA-based sensors, called  thermometers, have been investigated in natural and synthetic contexts, an important challenge is to design different responses to temperature, differing in sensitivities and thresholds. We address this issue using experimental measurements in cells and in cell-free biomolecular  breadboards in combination with computations of RNA thermodynamics. We designed a library of RNA thermometers, finding, computationally, that it could contain a multiplicity of responses to temperature. We constructed this library and found a wide range of responses to temperature, ranging from 3.5-fold to over 10-fold in the temperature range 29{degrees}C - 37{degrees}C. These were largely linear responses with over 10-fold difference in slopes. We correlated the measured responses with computational expectations, finding that while there was no strong correlation in the individual values, the overall trends were similar. These results present a toolbox of RNA-based circuit elements with varying temperature sensitivities.",

    "abstract": "The recently introduced Oxford Nanopore MinION platform generates DNA sequence data in real-time. This opens immense potential to shorten the sample-to-results time and is likely to lead to enormous benefits in rapid diagnosis of bacterial infection and identification of drug resistance. However, there are very few tools available for streaming analysis of real-time sequencing data. Here, we present a framework for streaming analysis of MinION real-time sequence data, together with probabilistic streaming algorithms for species typing, multi-locus strain typing, gene presence strain-typing and antibiotic resistance profile identification. Using three culture isolate samples as well as a mixed-species sample, we demonstrate that bacterial species and strain information can be obtained within 30 minutes of sequencing and using about 500 reads, initial drug-resistance profiles within two hours, and complete resistance profiles within 10 hours. Multi-locus strain typing required more than 15x coverage to generate confident assignments, whereas gene-presence typing could detect the presence of a known strain with 0.5x coverage. We also show that our pipeline can process over 100 times more data than the current throughput of the MinION on a desktop computer.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing increases the diversity of transcriptomes and proteomes in metazoans. The extent to which alternative splicing is active and functional in unicellular organisms is less understood. Here we exploit a single-molecule long-read sequencing technique and develop an open-source software program called SpliceHunter, to characterize the transcriptome in the meiosis of fission yeast. We reveal 17017 alternative splicing events in 19741 novel isoforms at different stages of meiosis, including antisense and read-through transcripts. Intron retention is the major type of alternative splicing, followed by \\\"alternate intron in exon\\\". 887 novel transcription units are detected; 60 of the predicted proteins show homology in other species and form theoretical stable structures. We compare the dynamics of novel isoforms based on the number of supporting full-length reads with those of annotated isoforms and explore the translational capacity and quality of novel isoforms. The evaluation of these factors indicates that the majority of novel isoforms are unlikely to be both condition-specific and translatable but the possibility of functional novel isoforms is not excluded. Moreover, the co-option of these unusual transcripts into newly born genes seems likely. Together, this study highlights the diversity and dynamics at the isoform level in the sexual development of fission yeast.",

    "abstract": "Herbivores often move among spatially interspersed host plants, tracking high-quality resources through space and time. This dispersal is of particular interest for vectors of plant pathogens. Existing molecular tools to track such movement have yielded important insights, but often provide insufficient genetic resolution to infer spread at finer spatiotemporal scales. Here, we explore the use of Nextera-tagmented reductively-amplified DNA (NextRAD) sequencing to infer movement of a highly-mobile winged insect, the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), among host plants. The psyllid vectors the pathogen that causes zebra chip disease in potato (Solanum tuberosum), but understanding and managing the spread of this pathogen is limited by uncertainty about the insects host plant(s) outside of the growing season. We identified 8,443 polymorphic loci among psyllids separated spatiotemporally on potato or in patches of bittersweet nightshade (S. dulcumara), a weedy plant proposed to be the source of potato-colonizing psyllids. A subset of the psyllids on potato exhibited close genetic similarity to insects on nightshade, consistent with regular movement between these two host plants. However, a second subset of potato-collected psyllids was genetically distinct from those collected on bittersweet nightshade; this suggests that a currently unrecognized host-plant species could be contributing to psyllid populations in potato. Oftentimes, dispersal of vectors of plant or animal pathogens must be tracked at a relatively fine scale in order to understand, predict, and manage disease spread. We demonstrate that emerging sequencing technologies that detect SNPs across a vectors entire genome can be used to infer such localized movement.",

    "abstract": "It is clear that prior expectations shape perceptual decision-making, yet their contribution to the construction of subjective decision confidence remains largely unexplored. We recorded fMRI data while participants made perceptual decisions and confidence judgements, controlling for potential confounds of attention. Results show that subjective confidence increases as perceptual prior expectations increasingly support the decision, and that this relationship is associated with BOLD activity in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Specifically, rIFG is sensitive to the discrepancy between expectation and decision (mismatch), and, crucially, higher mismatch responses are associated with lower decision confidence. Connectivity analyses revealed the source of the expectancy information to be bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the source of sensory signals to be intracalcarine sulcus. Altogether, our results indicate that predictive information is integrated into subjective confidence in rIFG, and reveal an occipital-frontal network that constructs confidence from top-down and bottom-up signals. This interpretation was further supported by exploratory findings that the white matter density of intracalcarine sulcus and OFC negatively predicted their respective contributions to the construction of confidence. Our findings advance our understanding of the neural basis of subjective perceptual processes by revealing an occipito-frontal functional network that integrates prior beliefs into the construction of confidence.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increase in the popularity of multivariate pattern (MVP) analysis of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data, and, to a much lesser extent, magneto-and electro-encephalography (M/EEG) data. We present CoSMoMVPA, a lightweight MVPA (MVP analysis) toolbox implemented in the intersection of the Matlab and GNU Octave languages, that treats both fMRI and M/EEG data as first-class citizens.\\n\\nCoSMoMVPA supports all state-of-the-art MVP analysis techniques, including searchlight analyses, classification, correlations, representational similarity analysis, and the time generalization method. These can be used to address both data-driven and hypothesis-driven questions about neural organization and representations, both within and across: space, time, frequency bands, neuroimaging modalities, individuals, and species.\\n\\nIt uses a uniform data representation of fMRI data in the volume or on the surface, and of M/EEG data at the sensor and source level. Through various external toolboxes, it directly supports reading and writing a variety of fMRI and M/EEG neuroimaging formats, and, where applicable, can convert between them. As a result, it can be integrated readily in existing pipelines and used with existing preprocessed datasets.\\n\\nCoSMoMVPA overloads the traditional volumetric searchlight concept to support neighborhoods for M/EEG and surface-based fMRI data, which supports localization of multivariate effects of interest across space, time, and frequency dimensions. CoSMoMVPA also provides a generalized approach to multiple comparison correction across these dimensions using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement with state-of-the-art clustering and permutation techniques.\\n\\nCoSMoMVPA is highly modular and uses abstractions to provide a uniform interface for a variety of MVP measures. Typical analyses require a few lines of code, making it accessible to beginner users. At the same time, expert programmers can easily extend its functionality.\\n\\nCoSMoMVPA comes with extensive documentation, including a variety of runnable demonstration scripts and analysis exercises (with example data and solutions). It uses best software engineering practices including version control, distributed development, an automated test suite, and continuous integration testing. It can be used with the proprietary Matlab and the free GNU Octave software, and it complies with open source distribution platforms such as NeuroDebian.\\n\\nCoSMoMVPA is Free/Open Source Software under the permissive MIT license.\\n\\nWebsite: https://cosmomvpa.org\\n\\nSource code: https://github.com/CoSMoMVPA/CoSMoMVPA",

    "abstract": "Amino acid propensities at amino acid sites change with time due to epistatic interactions or changing environment, affecting the probabilities of fixation of different amino acids. Such changes should lead to an increased rate of homoplasies (reversals, parallelisms, and convergences) at closely related species. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny of twelve mitochondrial proteins from several thousand metazoan species, and measure the phylogenetic distances between branches at which either the same allele originated repeatedly due to homoplasies, or different alleles originated due to divergent substitutions. The mean phylogenetic distance between parallel substitutions is [~]20% lower than the mean phylogenetic distance between divergent substitutions, indicating that a variant fixed in a species is more likely to be deleterious in a more phylogenetically remote species, compared to a more closely related species. These findings are robust to artefacts of phylogenetic reconstruction or of pooling of sites from different conservation classes or functional groups, and imply that single-position fitness landscapes change at rates similar to rates of amino acid changes.",

    "abstract": "Human DNA identification is currently performed by amplifying a small, defined set of short tandem repeat (STR) loci (e.g. CODIS) and analyzing the size of the alleles present at those loci by capillary electrophoresis. High-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) could enable the simultaneous analysis of many additional STR and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, improving accuracy and discrimination. However, it is necessary to demonstrate that HTS can generate accurate data on the CODIS loci to enable backwards compatibility with the FBI NDIS database. Sequencing can also detect novel polymorphisms within alleles that migrate with identical sizes by capillary electrophoresis, improving allele discrimination, and enhancing human identification analysis. All CODIS alleles from an individual can be amplified in a single, multiplex PCR reaction, and combined with additional barcoded samples prior to sequencing. A computational tool for allele identification from multiplexed sequence data has been developed. With longer-read-length platforms, 99.6% allele calling accuracy can be achieved. In the course of STR sequencing protocol development, 12 novel allele sequences have been identified for multiple loci. Sequencing STR loci combined with SNPs will enable new forensic applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic surveillance of the human filarial parasite, Onchocerca volvulus, from onchocerciasis endemic regions will ideally focus on genotyping individual infective larval stages collected from their intermediate host, Simuliid blackflies. However, blackflies also transmit other Onchocerca species, including the cattle parasite O. ochengi, which are difficult to distinguish from the human parasite based on morphological characteristics alone. This study describes a versatile approach to discriminate between O. volvulus and O. ochengi that is demonstrated using parasite infective larvae dissected from blackflies.\\n\\nResultsA speciation assay was designed based on genetic differentiation between O. volvulus and O. ochengi mitochondrial genome sequences that can be performed in highthroughput high-resolution melt (HRM)- or lower throughput conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. This assay was validated on 185 Onchocerca larvae dissected from blackflies captured from 14 communities in Ghana throughout 2011-13. The frequency of O. ochengi was approximately 67 % of all larvae analysed, which is significantly higher than previously reported in this region. Furthermore, the species distribution was not uniform throughout the study region, with 25 %, 47 % and 93 % of O. volvulus being found in the western-most (Black Volta, Tain and Tombe), the central (Pru) and eastern-most (Daka) river basins, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsThis tool provides a simple and cost-effective approach to determine the identity and distribution of two Onchocerca species, and will be valuable for future genetic studies that focus on parasites collected from blackflies. The results presented highlight the need to discriminate Onchocerca species in transmission studies, as the frequency of each species varied significantly between the communities studied.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict familial relationships from source DNA in multiple samples has a number of forensic and medical applications. Kinship testing of suspect DNA profiles against relatives in a law enforcement database can provide valuable investigative leads, determination of familial relationships can inform immigration decisions, and remains identification can provide closure to families of missing individuals. The proliferation of High-Throughput Sequencing technologies allows for enhanced capabilities to accurately predict familial relationships to the third degree and beyond. KinLinks, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, is a software tool that predicts pairwise relationships and reconstructs kinship pedigrees for multiple input samples using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles. The software has been trained and evaluated on a set of 175 subjects (30,450 pairwise relationships), consisting of three multi-generational families and 52 geographically diverse subjects. Though a panel of 5396 SNPs was selected for kinship prediction, KinLinks is highly modular, allowing for the substitution of expanded SNP panels and additional training models as sequencing capabilities continue to progress. KinLinks builds on the SNP-calling capabilities of Sherlocks Toolkit, and is fully integrated with the Sherlocks Toolkit pipeline.",

This problem is formalized as the Minimum Error Correction (MEC) problem and can be solved using algorithms such as WhatsHap. The runtime of WhatsHap is exponential in the maximum coverage, which is hence controlled in a pre-processing step that selects reads to be used for phasing. Here, we report on a heuristic algorithm designed to choose beneficial reads for phasing, in particular to increase the connectivity of the phased blocks and the number of correctly phased variants compared to the random selection previously employed in by WhatsHap.

    "abstract": "Identification of drug targets and mechanism of action (MoA) for new and uncharacterlzed drugs is important for optimization of drug efficacy. Current MoA prediction approaches largely rely on prior information including side effects, therapeutic indication and/or chemo-informatics. Such information is not transferable or applicable for newly identified, previously uncharacterlzed small molecules. Therefore, a shift in the paradigm of MoA predictions is necessary towards development of unbiased approaches that can elucidate drug relationships and efficiently classify new compounds with basic input data. We propose a new integrative computational pharmacogenomlc approach, referred to as Drug Network Fusion (DNF), to infer scalable drug taxonomies that relies only on basic drug characteristics towards elucidating drug-drug relationships. DNF is the first framework to integrate drug structural information, high-throughput drug perturbation and drug sensitivity profiles, enabling drug classification of new experimental compounds with minimal prior information. We demonstrate that the DNF taxonomy succeeds in identifying pertinent and novel drug-drug relationships, making it suitable for investigating experimental drugs with potential new targets or MoA. We highlight how the scalability of DNF facilitates identification of key drug relationships across different drug categories, and poses as a flexible tool for potential clinical applications in precision medicine. Our results support DNF as a valuable resource to the cancer research community by providing new hypotheses on the compound MoA and potential insights for drug repurposlng.",

Despite carbon limitation, metal-reducing microbial communities are present in potentially ancient anoxic brines continuously emanating from exploratory boreholes on Level 27. Using graphite electrodes deposited in situ as bait, we enriched and isolated a novel halophilic iron-reducing Deltaproteobacterium, Desul-furomonas soudanensis strain WTL, from an acetate-fed three-electrode bioreactor poised at +0.24 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Cyclic voltammetry revealed that D. soudanensis releases electrons at redox potentials approximately 100 mV more positive than the model freshwater surface isolate Geobacter sulfurreducens, suggesting that its extracellular respiration is tuned for higher potential electron acceptors. D. soudanensis contains a 3,958,620-bp circular genome, assembled to completion using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing reads, which encodes a complete TCA cycle, 38 putative multiheme c-type cytochromes, one of which contains 69 heme-binding motifs, and a LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing cassette that produces an unidentified N-acyl homoserine lactone. Another cytochrome is predicted to lie within a putative prophage, suggesting that horizontal transfer of respiratory proteins plays a role in respiratory flexibility among metal reducers. Isolation of D. soudanensis underscores the utility of electrode-based approaches for enriching rare metal reducers from a wide range of habitats.",

    "abstract": "Brain decoding is a popular multivariate approach for hypothesis testing in neuroimaging. Linear classifiers are widely employed in the brain decoding paradigm to discriminate among experimental conditions. Then, the derived linear weights are visualized in the form of multivariate brain maps to further study the spatio-temporal patterns of underlying neural activities. It is well known that the brain maps derived from weights of linear classifiers are hard to interpret because of high correlations between predictors, low signal to noise ratios, and the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data. Therefore, improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of multivariate brain maps. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, first, we present a theoretical definition of interpretability in brain decoding; we show that the interpretability of multivariate brain maps can be decomposed into their reproducibility and representativeness. Second, as an application of the proposed definition, we formalize a heuristic method for approximating the interpretability of multivariate brain maps in a binary magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding scenario. Third, we pro pose to combine the approximated interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our results for the MEG data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative multivariate brain maps. More importantly, the presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability, and hence, facilitates the development of more effective brain decoding algorithms in the future.",

    "abstract": "We introduce PICS (Pathway Informed Classification System) for classifying cancers based on tumor sample gene expression levels. PICS is a computational method capable of expeditiously elucidating both known and novel biological pathway involvement specific to various cancers, and uses that learned pathway information to separate patients into distinct classes. The method clearly separates a pan-cancer dataset into their tissue of origin and is also able to sub-classify individual cancer datasets into distinct survival classes. Gene expression values are collapsed into pathway scores that reveal which biological activities are most useful for clustering cancer cohorts into sub-types. Variants of the method allow it to be used on datasets that do and do not contain non-cancerous samples. Activity levels of all types of pathways, broadly grouped into metabolic, cellular processes and signaling, and immune system, are useful for separating the pan-cancer cohort. In the clustering of specific cancer types, certain pathway types become more valuable depending on the site being studied. For lung cancer, signaling pathways dominate, for pancreatic cancer signaling and metabolic pathways, and for melanoma immune system pathways are the most useful. This work suggests the utility of pathway level genomic analysis and points in the direction of using pathway classification for predicting the efficacy and side effects of drugs and radiation.",

    "abstract": "In the premature ageing disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) the underlying genetic defect in the lamin A gene leads to accumulation at the nuclear lamina of progerin - a mutant form of lamin A that cannot be correctly processed. This has been reported to result in defects in the DNA damage response and in DNA repair, leading to the hypothesis that, as in normal ageing and in other progeroid syndromes caused by mutation of genes of the DNA repair and DNA damage response pathways, increased DNA damage may be responsible for the premature ageing phenotypes in HGPS patients. However, this hypothesis is based upon the study of markers of the DNA damage response, rather than measurement of DNA damage per se or the consequences of unrepaired DNA damage -mutation. Here, using a mutation reporter cell line, we directly compared the inherent and induced mutation rates in cells expressing wild-type lamin A or progerin. We find no evidence for an elevated mutation rate in progerin-expressing cells. We conclude that the cellular defect in HGPS cells does not lie in the repair of DNA damage per se.",

Polar bears possess unique adaptations to life on the Arctic sea ice, whereas their closest relatives -brown bears - are boreal and subarctic generalists. Despite largely non-overlapping modern distributions, genomic evidence demonstrates ancient admixture between these species. Here, we analyze new genomes from contemporary zones of species overlap as well as a previously sequenced 120,000-year old polar bear subfossil. We use explicit statistical fitting of data to admixture graphs to provide a framework for testing alternative scenarios of population relationships and gene flow directionality. Our analyses favor a single, parsimonious introgression event from relatives of extant Southeast Alaskan coastal brown bears into the ancestor of extant polar bears, which inverts the current paradigm of unidirectional gene flow from polar into brown bear. This conclusion has clear implications for our understanding of the impact of climate change: a specialist Arctic lineage may have been the recipient of generalist, boreal genetic variants at crucial times during critical phases of Northern Hemisphere glacial oscillations.",

We then conduct simulation experiments with empirical population models to quantify the relative influence of these factors on the synchrony of dominant species in five semiarid grasslands. We found that the average synchrony of per capita growth rates, which can range from 0 (perfect asynchrony) to 1 (perfect synchrony), was higher when environmental variation was present (0.62) rather than absent (0.43). Removing interspecific interactions and demographic stochasticity had small effects on synchrony. For the dominant species in these plant communities, where species interactions and demographic stochasticity have little influence, synchrony reflects the covariance in species responses to the environment.",

Embryos of T. toreumaticus invaginate continuously at gastrulation, whereas in some others invagination is stepwise. We studied blastula and gastrula formation in four temnopleurids using light and scanning electron microscopy to clarify the mechanisms producing these differences. Unlike T. toreumaticus, blastomeres of mid-blastulae in T. reevesii, T. hardwickii and Mespilia globulus formed pseudopods. Before primary mesenchyme cells ingressed, embryos developed an area of orbicular cells in the vegetal plate. The cells surrounding the orbicular cells extended pseudopods toward the orbicular cell area in T. toreumaticus, T. reevesii and T. hardwickii. In T. toreumaticus, the extracellular matrix was well-developed and developed a hole-like structure that was not formed in others. Gastrulation of T. reevesii, T. hardwickii and M. globulus was stepwise, suggesting that differences of gastrulation are caused by all or some of factors: change of cell shape, rearrangement, pushing up and towing of cells. These species-specific morphologies may be caused by the shape and surface structure of blastomeres with cell-movement.\\n\\nSummary statementTemonopleurid embryology",

We model ChIP-Seq read count frequencies as products of smooth functions along chromosomes. Smoothing parameters are objectively estimated from the data by cross-validation, eliminating ad-hoc binning and windowing needed by current approaches. GenoGAM provides base-level and region-level significance testing for full factorial designs. Application to a ChIP-Seq dataset in yeast showed increased sensitivity over existing differential occupancy methods while controlling for type I error rate. By analyzing a set of DNA methylation data and illustrating an extension to a peak caller, we further demonstrate the potential of GenoGAM as a generic statistical modeling tool for genome-wide assays.\\n\\nAvailabilitySoftware is available from Bioconductor: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenoGAM.html\\n\\nContactgagneur@in.tum.de\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The recently introduced Kallisto[1] pseudoaligner has radically simplified the quantification of transcripts in RNA-sequencing experiments. However, as with all computational advances, reproducibility across experiments requires attention to detail. The elegant approach of Kallisto reduces dependencies, but we noted differences in quantification between versions of Kallisto, and both upstream preparation and downstream interpretation benefit from an environment that enforces a requirement for equivalent processing when comparing groups of samples. Therefore, we created the Arkas[3] and TxDbLite[4] R packages to meet these needs and to ease cloud-scale deployment of the above. TxDbLite extracts structured information directly from source FASTA files with per-contig metadata, while Arkas enforces versioning of the derived indices and annotations, to ensure tight coupling of inputs and outputs while minimizing external dependencies. The two packages are combined in Illumina's BaseSpace cloud computing environment to offer a massively parallel and distributed quantification step for power users, loosely coupled to biologically informative downstream analyses via gene set analysis (with special focus on Reactome annotations for ENSEMBL transcriptomes). Previous work (e.g. Soneson et al., 2016[34]) has revealed that filtering transcriptomes to exclude lowly-expressed isoforms can improve statistical power, while more-complete transcriptome assemblies improve sensitivity in detecting differential transcript usage. Based on earlier work by Bourgon et al., 2010[11], we included this type of filtering for both gene- and transcript-level analyses within Arkas. For reproducible and versioned downstream analysis of results, we focused our efforts on ENSEMBL and Reac-tome[2] integration within the qusage[19] framework, adapted to take advantage of the parallel and distributed environment in Illuminas BaseSpace cloud platform. We show that quantification and interpretation of repetitive sequence element transcription is eased in both basic and clinical studies by just-in-time annotation and visualization. The option to retain pseudoBAM output for structural variant detection and annotation, while not insignificant in its demand for computation and storage, nonetheless provides a middle ground between de novo transcriptome assembly and routine quantification, while consuming a fraction of the resources used by popular fusion detection pipelines and providing options to quantify gene fusions with known breakpoints without reassembly. Finally, we describe common use cases where investigators are better served by cloud-based computing platforms such as BaseSpace due to inherent efficiencies of scale and enlightened common self-interest. Our experiences suggest a common reference point for methods development, evaluation, and experimental interpretation.",
