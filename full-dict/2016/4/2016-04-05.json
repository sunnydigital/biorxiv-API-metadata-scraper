The user manual for SEX-DETector is available here: https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/Download-5251.html?lang=en.\\n\\nPaper submitted as a Genome Resource.\\n\\nWe propose a probabilistic framework to infer autosomal and sex-linked genes from RNA-seq data of a cross for any sex chromosome type (XY, ZW, UV). Sex chromosomes (especially the nonrecombining and repeat-dense Y, W, U and V) are notoriously difficult to sequence. Strategies have been developed to obtain partially assembled sex chromosome sequences. However, most of them remain difficult to apply to numerous non-model organisms, either because they require a reference genome, or because they are designed for evolutionarily old systems. Sequencing a cross (parents and progeny) by RNA-seq to study the segregation of alleles and infer sex-linked genes is a cost-efficient strategy, which also provides expression level estimates. However, the lack of a proper statistical framework has limited a broader application of this approach. Tests on empirical data show that our method identifies many more sex-linked genes than existing pipelines, while making reliable inferences for downstream analyses. Simulations suggest few individuals are needed for optimal results. For species with unknown sex-determination system, the method can assess the presence and type (XY versus ZW) of sex chromosomes through a model comparison strategy. The method is particularly well optimised for sex chomosomes of young or intermediate age, which are expected in thousands of yet unstudied lineages. Any organism, including non-model ones for which nothing is known a priori, that can be bred in the lab, is suitable for our method. SEX-DETector is made freely available to the community through a Galaxy workflow.",

    "abstract": "ATRX is a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler proposed to govern genomic stability through the regulation of repetitive sequences such as rDNA, retrotransposons, and pericentromeric and telomeric repeats. However, few direct ATRX target genes have been identified and high-throughput genomic approaches are currently lacking for ATRX. Here we present a comprehensive ChIP-sequencing study of ATRX in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562, in which we identify the 3 exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) as a new class of ATRX targets. These 3 exonic regions encode the zinc finger motifs, which can range from 1-40 copies per ZNF gene and share large stretches of sequence similarity. These regions often contain an atypical chromatin signature: they are transcriptionally active, contain high levels of H3K36me3 and are paradoxically enriched in H3K9me3. We find that these ZNF 3 exons are also co-occupied by SETDB1, TRIM28 and ZNF274. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function studies demonstrate a significant reduction of H3K9me3 at the ZNF 3 exons in the absence of ATRX and that H3K9me3 levels at atypical chromatin regions are particularly sensitive to ATRX loss compared to other H3K9me3-occupied regions. As ZNFs are one of the most rapidly expanding gene families in primates and genomic rearrangements are believed to be responsible for ZNF duplications, our results suggest that ATRX binds to the 3 exons of ZNFs to maintain their genomic stability through preservation of H3K9me3.",

We investigated the impact of urbanization on white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in the New York City metropolitan area using coalescent-based simulations to infer demographic history from the site frequency spectrum. We assigned individuals to evolutionary clusters and then inferred recent divergence times, population size changes, and migration using genome-wide SNPs genotyped in 23 populations sampled along an urban-to-rural gradient. Both prehistoric climatic events and recent urbanization impacted these populations. Our modeling indicates that post-glacial sea level rise led to isolation of mainland and Long Island populations. These models also indicate that several urban parks represent recently-isolated P. leucopus populations, and the estimated divergence times for these populations are consistent with the history of urbanization in New York City.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are central contributors to microbial evolution and genome innovation. Recently, they have been found to have important roles in antibiotic resistance and in affecting production of metabolites used in industrial and agricultural applications. However, their characterization through deep sequencing remains challenging, in spite of rapid drops in cost and throughput increases for sequencing. Here, we attempt to ameliorate this situation by introducing a new plasmid-specific assembly algorithm, leveraging assembly graphs provided by a conventional de novo assembler and alignments of paired- end reads to assembled graph nodes. We introduce the first tool for this task, called Recycler, and demonstrate its merits in comparison with extant approaches. We show that Recycler greatly increases the number of true plasmids recovered while remaining highly accurate. On simulated plasmidomes, Recycler recovered 5-14% more true plasmids compared to the best extant method with overall precision of about 90%. We validated these results in silico on real data, as well as in vitro by PCR validation performed on a subset of Recyclers predictions on different data types. All 12 of Recyclers outputs on isolate samples matched known plasmids or phages, and had alignments having at least 97% identity over at least 99% of the reported reference sequence lengths. For the two E. Coli strains examined, most known plasmid sequences were recovered, while in both cases additional plasmids only known to be present in different hosts were found. Recycler also generated plasmids in high agreement with known annotation on real plasmidome data. Moreover, in PCR validations performed on 77 sequences, Recycler showed mean accuracy of 89% across all data types - isolate, microbiome, and plasmidome.

By contrast, here we report continuous variation in the induced frequency of cells with slow osmotic stress signaling, survival and proliferation among 50 ecologically-distinct strains of budding yeast challenged by sudden hyperosmotic stress. Despite extensive variation in early mortality, strains displayed robust perfect adaptation and recovery of steady-state viability in moderate stress. In severe stress survival depended on strain-specific proportions of cells with divergent strategies.  Cautious cells survived without dividing;  reckless cells attempted to divide too soon and failed, killing both mother and daughter. We show that heritable frequencies of cautious and reckless cells produce a rapidly diversifying template for microbial bet hedging that mimics natural variation in stress responses whose timing, amplitude and frequency could evolve - be  tuned by - different patterns of environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "A long standing debate in biochemistry is to determine whether the conformational changes observed during biomolecular interactions proceed through conformational selection (of preexisting isoforms) or induced fit (ligand-induced 3D reshaping). The latter mechanism had been invoked in certain circumstances, for example to explain the non-Michaelian activity of monomeric enzymes like glucokinase. But the relative importance of induced fit has been recently depreciated in favor of conformational selection, assumed to be always sufficient, predominant in general and in particular for glucokinase. The relative contributions of conformational selection and induced fit are reconsidered here in and out of equilibrium, in the light of earlier concepts such as the cyclic equilibrium rule and the turning wheel of Wyman, using single molecule state probability, one way fluxes and net fluxes. The conditions for a switch from conformational selection to induced fit at a given ligand concentration are explicitly determined. Out of equilibrium, the inspection of the enzyme states circuit shows that conformational selection alone would give a Michaelian reaction rate but not the established nonlinear behavior of glucokinase. Moreover, when induced fit and conformational selection coexist and allow kinetic cooperativity, the net flux emerging in the linkage cycle necessarily corresponds to the induced fit path.",

    "abstract": "Malaria transmission is dependent on the propensity of Anopheles mosquitoes to bitehumans (anthropophily) instead of other dead end hosts. Recent increases in the usage of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs) in Africa have been associated with reductions in highly anthropophilic vectors such as Anopheles gambiae s.s.,leaving less anthropophilic species such as Anopheles arabiensis as the most prominent remaining source of transmission in many settings. An.arabiensis is more of a generalist in terms of its host choice and resting behavior, which may be due to phenotypic plasticity and/or segregating allelic variation. To investigate the potential genetic basis of host choice and resting behavior in An. arabiensis we performed a genome-wide association study on host choice (human-or cattle-fed) and resting position (collected indoors or outdoors) in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. This represents the first genomic/molecular analysis of host choice and resting behavior in a malaria vector. We identified a total of 4,820,851 SNPs, which were used to conduct the first genome-wide estimates of 'SNP heritability' for host choice and resting behavior in this species. A genetic component was detected for host choice (human vs cow fed; permuted P = 0.002), but there was no evidence of a genetic component for resting behavior (indoors versus outside; permuted P = 0.465). A principal component analysis (PCA) segregated individuals based on genomic variation into three groups which are characterized by differences at the 2Rb and/or 3Ra paracentromeric chromosome inversions. There was a non-random distribution of cattle-fed mosquitoes between the PCA clusters, suggesting that alleles linked to the 2Rb and/or 3Ra inversions may influence host choice. Using a novel inversion genotyping assay, we detected a significant enrichment of the standard arrangement (non-inverted) of 3Ra among cattle-fed mosquitoes (N=129) versus all non-cattle-fed individuals (N=234; 2, p=0.007). Thus, tracking the frequency of the 3Ra in An. arabiensis populations is important, especially in relation to the emergence of behavioral avoidance(e.g. shifting toward cattle-feeding) in some populations. A better understanding of the genetic basis for host choice in An. arabiensis may also open avenues for novel vector control strategies based on introducing genes for zoophily into wild mosquito populations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMalaria transmission is driven by the propensity for mosquito vectors to bite people, whilst its control depends on the tendency of mosquitoes to bite and rest in places where they will come into contact with insecticides. In many parts of Africa, Anopheles arabiensis is now the only remaining vec 63 tor in areas where coverage with Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets is high. We sought to assess the potential for An. arabiensis to adapt its behavior to avoid control measures by investigating the genetic basis for its host choice and resting behavior. Blood fed An. arabiensis were collected resting indoors and outdoors in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. We sequenced a total of 48 genomes representing 4 phenotypes (human or cow fed, resting in or outdoors) and tested for a genetic basis for each phenotype. Genomic analysis followed up by application of a novel molecular karyotyping assay revealed a relationship between An. arabiensis that fed on cattle and the standard arrangement of the 3Ra inversion. This indicates that the host choice behavior of An. arabiensis has has a substantial genetic component. Validation with controlled host preference assays comparing individuals with the standard and inverted arrangement of 3Ra is still needed.",

The extent to which alternative splicing is active and functional in unicellular organisms is less understood. Here we exploit a single-molecule long-read sequencing technique and develop an open-source software program called SpliceHunter, to characterize the transcriptome in the meiosis of fission yeast. We reveal 17017 alternative splicing events in 19741 novel isoforms at different stages of meiosis, including antisense and read-through transcripts. Intron retention is the major type of alternative splicing, followed by \\\"alternate intron in exon\\\". 887 novel transcription units are detected; 60 of the predicted proteins show homology in other species and form theoretical stable structures. We compare the dynamics of novel isoforms based on the number of supporting full-length reads with those of annotated isoforms and explore the translational capacity and quality of novel isoforms. The evaluation of these factors indicates that the majority of novel isoforms are unlikely to be both condition-specific and translatable but the possibility of functional novel isoforms is not excluded. Moreover, the co-option of these unusual transcripts into newly born genes seems likely. Together, this study highlights the diversity and dynamics at the isoform level in the sexual development of fission yeast.",

Recently ZIKV invaded the Americas, where it poses a threat to human health, especially to pregnant women and their infants. Here we examine the risk that ZIKV will establish a sylvatic cycle in the Americas, focusing on Brazil. We review the natural history of sylvatic ZIKV and present a mathematical dynamic transmission model to assess the probability of establishment of a sylvatic ZIKV transmission cycle in non-human primates and/or other mammals and arboreal mosquito vectors in Brazil. Brazil is home to multiple species of primates and mosquitoes potentially capable of ZIKV transmission, though direct assessment of host competence (ability to mount viremia sufficient to infect a feeding mosquito) and vector competence (ability to become infected with ZIKV and disseminate and transmit upon subsequent feedings) of New World species is lacking. Modeling reveals a high probability of establishment of sylvatic ZIKV across a large range of biologically plausible parameters. Probability of establishment is dependent on host population sizes and birthrates and ZIKV force of infection, but a network of as few as 6,000 primates with 10,000 mosquitoes is capable of supporting establishment of a ZIKV sylvatic cycle. Research on the susceptibility of New World monkeys or other small mammals to ZIKV, on the vector competence of New World Aedes, Sabethes, and Haemagogus mosquitoes for ZIKV, and on the geographic range of these species is urgently needed. A sylvatic cycle of ZIKV would make future elimination efforts in the Americas practically impossible, and paints a dire situation for the epidemiology of ZIKV and ending the ongoing outbreak of congenital Zika syndrome.",

    "abstract": "It is clear that prior expectations shape perceptual decision-making, yet their contribution to the construction of subjective decision confidence remains largely unexplored. We recorded fMRI data while participants made perceptual decisions and confidence judgements, controlling for potential confounds of attention. Results show that subjective confidence increases as perceptual prior expectations increasingly support the decision, and that this relationship is associated with BOLD activity in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Specifically, rIFG is sensitive to the discrepancy between expectation and decision (mismatch), and, crucially, higher mismatch responses are associated with lower decision confidence. Connectivity analyses revealed the source of the expectancy information to be bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the source of sensory signals to be intracalcarine sulcus. Altogether, our results indicate that predictive information is integrated into subjective confidence in rIFG, and reveal an occipital-frontal network that constructs confidence from top-down and bottom-up signals. This interpretation was further supported by exploratory findings that the white matter density of intracalcarine sulcus and OFC negatively predicted their respective contributions to the construction of confidence. Our findings advance our understanding of the neural basis of subjective perceptual processes by revealing an occipito-frontal functional network that integrates prior beliefs into the construction of confidence.",

We present CoSMoMVPA, a lightweight MVPA (MVP analysis) toolbox implemented in the intersection of the Matlab and GNU Octave languages, that treats both fMRI and M/EEG data as first-class citizens.\\n\\nCoSMoMVPA supports all state-of-the-art MVP analysis techniques, including searchlight analyses, classification, correlations, representational similarity analysis, and the time generalization method. These can be used to address both data-driven and hypothesis-driven questions about neural organization and representations, both within and across: space, time, frequency bands, neuroimaging modalities, individuals, and species.\\n\\nIt uses a uniform data representation of fMRI data in the volume or on the surface, and of M/EEG data at the sensor and source level. Through various external toolboxes, it directly supports reading and writing a variety of fMRI and M/EEG neuroimaging formats, and, where applicable, can convert between them. As a result, it can be integrated readily in existing pipelines and used with existing preprocessed datasets.\\n\\nCoSMoMVPA overloads the traditional volumetric searchlight concept to support neighborhoods for M/EEG and surface-based fMRI data, which supports localization of multivariate effects of interest across space, time, and frequency dimensions.

A single phosphorylation motif may be split across charge states, alternative modifications (e.g. acetylation and oxidation), and multiple miss-cleavage sites which render the biological interpretation of MS data a challenge.

    "abstract": "The availability of large-scale population genomic sequence data has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the demographic histories of natural populations across a broad range of organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic inference by characterizing the performance of three popular methods through extensive simulation of datasets with varying numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three different demographic models relevant to a number of species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates of each of these models--often severely. Moreover, we find that selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size changes when none have occurred. We argue that the amount of recent positive selection required to skew inferences may often be acting in natural populations. These results suggest that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may have exaggerated the extent and frequency of population size changes.",

    "abstract": "Mixed models have become the tool of choice for genetic association studies; however, standard mixed model methods may be poorly calibrated or underpowered under family sampling bias and/or case-control ascertainment. Previously, we introduced a liability threshold based mixed model association statistic (LTMLM) to address case-control ascertainment in unrelated samples. Here, we consider family-biased case-control ascertainment, where cases and controls are ascertained non-randomly with respect to family relatedness. Previous work has shown that this type of ascertainment can severely bias heritability estimates; we show here that it also impacts mixed model association statistics. We introduce a family-based association statistic (LT-Fam) that is robust to this problem. Similar to LTMLM, LT-Fam is computed from posterior mean liabilities (PML) under a liability threshold model; however, LT-Fam uses published narrow-sense heritability estimates to avoid the problem of biased heritability estimation, enabling correct calibration. In simulations with family-biased case-control ascertainment, LT-Fam was correctly calibrated (average{chi} 2 = 1.00), whereas Armitage Trend Test (ATT) and standard mixed model association (MLM) were mis-calibrated (e.g. average{chi} 2 = 0.50-0.67 for MLM). LT-Fam also attained higher power in these simulations, with increases of up to 8% vs. ATT and 3% vs. MLM after correcting for mis-calibration. In 1,269 type 2 diabetes cases and 5,819 controls from the CARe cohort, downsampled to induce family-biased ascertainment, LT-Fam was correctly calibrated whereas ATT and MLM were again mis-calibrated (e.g. average{chi} 2 = 0.60-0.82 for MLM). Our results highlight the importance of modeling family sampling bias in case-control data sets with related samples.",

    "abstract": "Zfp423 encodes a 30-zinc finger transcription factor that intersects several canonical signaling pathways. Zfp423 mutations result in ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including agenesis of the cerebellar vermis in mice and Joubert syndrome (JBTS19) and nephronophthisis (NPHP14) in humans. Unlike most ciliopathy genes, Zfp423 encodes a nuclear protein and its developmental expression is complex, leading to alternative proposals for cellular mechanisms. Here we show that Zfp423 is expressed by cerebellar granule cell precursors, that loss of Zfp423 in these precursors leads to cell-intrinsic reduction in proliferation, loss of response to Shh, and primary cilia abnormalities that include diminished frequency of both Smoothened and IFT88 localization. Loss of Zfp423 alters expression of several genes encoding key cilium components, including increased expression of Tulp3. Tulp3 is a direct binding target of Zfp423 and reducing the overexpression of Tulp3 in Zfp423-deficient cells suppresses Smoothened translocation defects. These results define Zfp423 deficiency as a bona fide ciliopathy, acting upstream of Shh signaling, and indicate a mechanism intrinsic to granule cell precursors for the resulting cerebellar hypoplasia.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCiliopathies are a broad group of individually rare genetic disorders that share overlapping phenotypes and mutations in genes that make components of the primary cilium. Mutations in ZNF423 are an exception. Patients and mouse models show characteristic hypoplasia of the cerebellar midline (Joubert syndrome), but the gene encodes a nuclear transcription factor. The mouse gene, Zfp423, is expressed in a dynamic developmental pattern, leaving the cellular mechanism for this brain malformation unresolved. One report suggested reduced Purkinje cell expression of Shh, a key mitogen for cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) whose signal transduction occurs at the primary cilium, as the key event. We show that Zfp423 mutants expressed normal Shh levels, but that Zfp423-depleted GCPs were unable to respond. Primary cilia on Zfp423-mutant GCPs in situ typically had a wider base and longer extension. ZNF423-depletion in a human cell culture model resulted in defective translocation of Smoothened, a key event in Shh signaling, and of the intraflagellar transport protein IFT88. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR experiments identified known ciliopathy genes as potential conserved targets of ZNF423 and Zfp423. One of these, TULP3, was both up-regulated in ZNF423/Zfp423-deficient cells and directly bound by Zfp423 in granule cell precursors. Reversing the overexpression of TULP3 in ZNF423-depleted human cell culture model reversed the defect in Smoothened translocation.",

They allow researchers to uncover the targets of selection and how these contribute to the mode and tempo of adaptation. Here we report results from a pooled genome re-sequencing study to investigate the consequences of 39 generations of bidirectional selection in White Leghorn chickens on a humoral immune trait: antibody response to sheep red blood cells. We observed wide genome involvement in response to this selection regime, with over 200 candidate sweep regions characterised by spans of high genetic differentiation (FST). These sweep signatures, encompassing almost 20% of the chicken genome (208.8 Mb), are primarily the result from bidirectional selection on haplotypes present in the base population. These extensive genomic changes highlight both the extent of standing genetic variation at immune loci available at the onset of selection, as well as how the long-term selection response results from selection on a highly polygenic genetic architecture. Furthermore, we present three examples of strong candidate genes that may have contributed to the profound phenotypic response to selection.\\n\\nData AvailabilityPooled genome data generated for this study will become available via SRA upon acceptance of manuscript",

This weighted-mean approach is frequently used by vegetation ecologists to relate species attributes like plant functional traits or Ellenberg-like species indicator values to sample attributes like measured environmental variables, biotic properties, species richness or sample scores in ordination analysis.\\n\\nThe problem with the weighted-mean approach is that, in certain cases, it yields biased results in terms of both effect size and P-values, and this bias is contingent upon the beta diversity of the species composition data. The reason is that CWM values calculated from samples of communities sharing some species are not independent of each other. This influences the number of effective degrees of freedom, which is usually lower than the actual number of samples, and the difference further increases with decreasing beta diversity of the data set. The discrepancy between the number of effective degrees of freedom and the number of samples in analysis turns into biased effect sizes and an inflated Type I error rate in those cases where the significance of the relationship is tested by standard tests, a problem which is analogous to analysis of two spatially autocorrelated variables. Consequently, results of studies using rather homogeneous (although not necessarily small) compositional data sets may be overly optimistic, and effect sizes of studies based on data sets differing by their beta diversity are not directly comparable.\\n\\nHere, I introduce guidelines on how to decide in which situation the bias is actually a problem when interpreting results, recognizing that there are several types of species and sample attributes with different properties and that ecological hypotheses commonly tested by the weighted-mean approach fall into one of three broad categories. I also compare available analytical solutions accounting for the bias (modified permutation test and sequential permutation test using the fourth-corner statistic) and suggest rules for their use.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Preexisting methods for pseudotime ordering have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates compared and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.",

    "abstract": "Aptamers, short synthetic RNA/DNA molecules binding specific targets with high affinity and specificity, are utilized in an increasing spectrum of bio-medical applications. Aptamers are identified in vitro via the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol. SELEX selects binders through an iterative process that, starting from a pool of random ssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of selection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput sequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the field to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a billion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of identifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine binding. While currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial solutions to this question, none possess the generality or scalability required for HT-SELEX data, and they do not take advantage of important properties of the experimental procedure.\\n\\nWe present AptaTRACE, a novel approach for the identification of sequence-structure binding motifs in HT-SELEX derived aptamers. Our approach leverages the experimental design of the SELEX protocol and identifies sequence-structure motifs that show a signature of selection. Because of its unique approach, AptaTRACE can uncover motifs even when these are present in only a minuscule fraction of the pool. Due to these features, our method can help to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with the desired properties, thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive procedure. The performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates that AptaTRACE can detect sequence-structure motifs even in highly challenging data.",

Cluster methylation tends to be bimodal, being dominantly unmethylated or mostly methylated. For CpG clusters near promoters, low methylation is associated with transcriptional activity, while high methylation is associated with gene silencing. Alternative CpG methylation states are thought to be stable and heritable, conferring localized epigenetic memory that allows transient signals to create long-lived gene expression states. Positive feedback where methylated CpG sites recruit enzymes that methylate nearby CpGs, does not easily explain that as clusters increase in size or density they change from being primarily methylated to primarily unmethylated. Here, we show that an interaction between the methylation state of a cluster and its occupancy by nucleosomes provides a mechanism to reproduce epigenetic potential and the genome wide systematics of CpG islands.",

    "abstract": "The fatty acid composition of membrane glycerolipids is a major determinant of Staphylococcus aureus membrane biophysical properties that impacts key factors in cell physiology including susceptibility to membrane active antimicrobials, pathogenesis, and response to environmental stress. The fatty acids of S. aureus are considered to be a mixture of branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), which increase membrane fluidity, and straight-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that decrease it. The balance of BCFAs and SCFAs in strains USA300 and SH1000 was affected considerably by differences in the conventional laboratory medium in which the strains were grown with media such as Mueller-Hinton broth and Luria broth resulting in high BCFAs and low SCFAs, whereas growth in Tryptic Soy Broth and Brain-Heart Infusion broth led to reduction in BCFAs and an increase in SCFAs. Straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids (SCUFAs) were not detected. However, when the organism was grown ex vivo in serum, the fatty acid composition was radically different with SCUFAs, which increase membrane fluidity, making up a substantial proportion of the total (<25%) with SCFAs (>37%) and BCFAs (>36%) making up the rest. Staphyloxanthin, an additional major membrane lipid component unique to S. aureus, tended to be greater in content in cells with high BCFAs or SCUFAs. Cells with high staphyloxanthin content had a lower membrane fluidity that was attributed to increased production of staphyloxanthin. S. aureus saves energy and carbon by utilizing host fatty acids for part of its total fatty acids when growing in serum. The fatty acid composition of in vitro grown S. aureus is likely to be a poor reflection of the fatty acid composition and biophysical properties of the membrane when the organism is growing in an infection in view of the role of SCUFAs in staphylococcal membrane composition and virulence.\\n\\nFundingThis work was funded in part by grant 1R15AI099977 to Brian Wilkinson and Craig Gatto and grant 1R15GM61583 to Craig Gatto from the National Institutes of Health",

In this study, we developed the hybrid cybernetic modeling with flux balance analysis or HCM-FBA technique which uses flux balance solutions instead of elementary modes to dynamically model metabolism. We show HCM-FBA has comparable performance to HCM for a proof of concept metabolic network and for a reduced anaerobic E. coli network. Next, HCM-FBA was applied to a larger metabolic network of aerobic E. coli metabolism which was infeasible for HCM (29 FBA modes versus more than 153,000 elementary modes). Global sensitivity analysis further reduced the number of FBA modes required to describe the aerobic E. coli data, while maintaining model fit. Thus, HCM-FBA is a promising alternative to HCM for large networks where the generation of elementary modes is infeasible.",

A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, noncoding RNA, and small RNA. The most recent annotation update (TAIR10) released more than five years ago had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48,359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of noncoding RNA including small RNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and microRNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 738 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5051 non-coding genes, and 35846 small-RNA loci that formerly eluded annotation. Analysis on the splicing events and RNA-seq based expression profile revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43% of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes. This updated Arabidopsis genome annotation with a substantially increased resolution of gene models will not only further our understanding of the biological processes of this plant model but also of other species.",

    "abstract": "Self-reported tiredness and low energy, often called fatigue, is associated with poorer physical and mental health. Twin studies have indicated that this has a heritability between 6% and 50%. In the UK Biobank sample (N = 108 976) we carried out a genome-wide association study of responses to the question, \\\"Over the last two weeks, how often have you felt tired or had little energy?\\\" Univariate GCTA-GREML found that the proportion of variance explained by all common SNPs for this tiredness question was 8.4% (SE = 0.6%). GWAS identified one genome-wide significant hit (Affymetrix id 1:64178756_C_T; p = 1.36 x 10-11). LD score regression and polygenic profile analysis were used to test for pleiotropy between tiredness and up to 28 physical and mental health traits from GWAS consortia. Significant genetic correlations were identified between tiredness and BMI, HDL cholesterol, forced expiratory volume, grip strength, HbA1c, longevity, obesity, self-rated health, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist-hip ratio, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, neuroticism, schizophrenia, and verbal-numerical reasoning (absolute rg effect sizes between 0.11 and 0.78). Significant associations were identified between tiredness phenotypic scores and polygenic profile scores for BMI, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, coronary artery disease, HbA1c, height, obesity, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, and waist-hip ratio, childhood cognitive ability, neuroticism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia (standardised {beta}s between -0.016 and 0.03). These results suggest that tiredness is a partly-heritable, heterogeneous and complex phenomenon that is phenotypically and genetically associated with affective, cognitive, personality, and physiological processes.\\n\\n\\\"Hech, sirs!

    "abstract": "Sterols are essential components of eukaryotic cells whose biosynthesis and function in eukaryotes has been studied extensively. Sterols are also recognized as the diagenetic precursors of steranes preserved in sedimentary rocks where they can function as geological proxies for eukaryotic organisms and/or aerobic metabolisms and environments. However, production of these lipids is not restricted to the eukaryotic domain as a few bacterial species also synthesize sterols. Phylogenomic studies have identified genes encoding homologs of sterol biosynthesis proteins in the genomes of several additional species, indicating that sterol production may be more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously thought. Although the occurrence of sterol synthesis genes in a genome indicates the potential for sterol production, it provides neither conclusive evidence of sterol synthesis nor information about the composition and abundance of basic and modified sterols that are actually being produced. Here, we coupled bioinformatics with lipid analyses to investigate the scope of bacterial sterol production. We identified oxidosqualene cyclase (Osc), which catalyzes the initial cyclization of oxidosqualene to the basic sterol structure, in 34 bacterial genomes from 5 phyla (Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) and in 176 metagenomes. Our data indicate that bacterial sterol synthesis likely occurs in diverse organisms and environments and also provides evidence that there are as yet uncultured groups of bacterial sterol producers. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and eukaryotic Osc sequences revealed two potential lineages of the sterol pathway in bacteria indicating a complex evolutionary history of sterol synthesis in this domain. We characterized the lipids produced by Osc-containing bacteria and found that we could generally predict the ability to synthesize sterols. However, predicting the final modified sterol based on our current knowledge of bacterial sterol synthesis was difficult. Some bacteria produced demethylated and saturated sterol products even though they lacked homologs of the eukaryotic proteins required for these modifications emphasizing that several aspects of bacterial sterol synthesis are still completely unknown. It is possible that bacteria have evolved distinct proteins for catalyzing sterol modifications and this could have significant implications for our understanding of the evolutionary history of this ancient biosynthetic pathway.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of actin-associated protein palladin in myogenesis has been elucidated, however, palladin distribution in a functional myotube remains to be identified. Since actin is required for myofibrillogenesis, it is of great interest to enhance our understanding of the spatial arrangements of palladin during sarcomeric assembly. Surprisingly, palladin was found to be discretely organized in different stages of myofibrillogenesis. Palladin revealed stress-fiber-like structures at undifferentiated stages, subsequently displayed chaotic expression and strongly co-distributed with actin, -actinin, and myosin heavy chain of premyofibrils. At late stages, aggregates of palladin were spaced in a regular dot-like structure. On the other hand, palladin presents at I-Z-I bands of adult muscle. These observations suggest that palladin engages with sarcomeric proteins during the process of myoblast differentiation and that these interactions might occur in a temporally regulated fashion. In addition, transient overexpression of 140-kDa-palladin resulted in nonfilamentous actin arresting mature myotube formation. 200-kDa-palladin overexpression led to the early formation of Z-lines. Collectively, these findings suggest that palladin might serve a role in myofibrillogenesis by guiding and positioning sarcomeric proteins at the appropriate time and place. Our results highlight the involvement of palladin protein and the discrete functions of palladin isoforms in sarcomeric development in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Geobacter sulfurreducens uses at least two different pathways to transport electrons out of the inner membrane quinone pool before reducing acceptors beyond the outer membrane. When growing on electrodes poised at oxidizing potentials, the CbcL-dependent pathway operates at or below redox potentials of -0.10 V vs. the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE), while the ImcH-dependent pathway operates only above this value. Here, we provide evidence that G. sulfurreducens also requires different electron transfer proteins for reduction of a wide range of Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)- (oxyhydr)oxides, and must transition from a high- to low-potential pathway during reduction of commonly studied soluble and insoluble metal electron acceptors. Freshly precipitated Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides could not be reduced by mutants lacking the high potential pathway. Aging these minerals by autoclaving did not change their powder X-ray diffraction pattern, but restored reduction by mutants lacking the high-potential pathway. Mutants lacking the low-potential, CbcL-dependent pathway had higher growth yields with both soluble and insoluble Fe(III). Together, these data suggest that the ImcH-dependent pathway exists to harvest additional energy when conditions permit, and CbcL switches on to allow respiration closer to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. With evidence of multiple pathways within a single organism, the study of extracellular respiration should consider not only the crystal structure or solubility of a mineral electron acceptor, but rather the redox potential, as this variable determines the energetic reward affecting reduction rates, extents, and final microbial growth yields in the environment.",
