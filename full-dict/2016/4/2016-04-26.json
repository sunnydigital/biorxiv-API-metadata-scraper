    "abstract": "Integrons recombine gene arrays and favor the spread of antibiotic resistance. Their broader roles in bacterial adaptation remain mysterious, partly due to lack of computational tools. We made a program - IntegronFinder - to identify integrons with high accuracy and sensitivity. IntegronFinder is available as a standalone program and as a web application. It searches for attC sites using covariance models, for integron-integrases using HMM profiles, and for other features (promoters, attl site) using pattern matching. We searched for integrons, integron-integrases lacking attC sites, and clusters of attC sites lacking a neighboring integron-integrase in bacterial genomes. All these elements are especially frequent in genomes of intermediate size. They are missing in some key phyla, such as -Proteobacteria, which might reflect selection against cell lineages that acquire integrons. The similarity between attC sites is proportional to the number of cassettes in the integron, and is particularly low in clusters of attC sites lacking integron-integrases. The latter are unexpectedly abundant in genomes lacking integron-integrases or their remains, and have a large novel pool of cassettes lacking homologs in the databases. They might represent an evolutionary step between the acquisition of genes within integrons and their stabilization in the new genome.",

    "abstract": "Background.Background. Copy number variants (CNVs) are a type of polymorphism found to underlie phenotypic variation, both in humans and livestock. Most surveys of CNV in livestock have been conducted in the cattle genome, and often utilise only a single approach for the detection of copy number differences. Here we performed a study of CNV in sheep, using multiple methods to identify and characterise copy number changes. Comprehensive information from small pedigrees (trios) was collected using multiple platforms (array CGH, SNP chip and whole genome sequence data), with these data then analysed via multiple approaches to identify and verify CNVs.\\n\\nResults.In total, 3,488 autosomal CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified from 30 sheep. The average length of the identified CNVRs was 19kb (range of 1kb to 3.6Mb), with shorter CNVRs being more frequent than longer CNVRs. The total length of all CNVRs was 67.6Mbps, which equates to 2.7% of the sheep autosomes. For individuals this value ranged from 0.24 to 0.55%, and the majority of CNVRs were identified in single animals. Rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the genome, CNVRs tended to be clustered. Application of three independent approaches for CNVR detection facilitated a comparison of validation rates. CNVs identified on the Roche-NimbleGen 2.1M CGH array generally had low validation rates, while whole genome sequence data had the highest validation rate.\\n\\nConclusions.This study represents the first comprehensive survey of the distribution, prevalence and characteristics of CNVR in sheep. Multiple approaches were used to detect CNV regions and it appears that the best method for verifying CNVR on a large scale involves using a combination of detection methodologies. The characteristics of the 3,488 autosomal CNV regions identified in this study are comparable to other CNV regions reported in the literature and provide a valuable addition to the small subset of published sheep CNVs.",

    "abstract": "Molecular sequences in public databases are mostly annotated by the submitting authors without further validation. This procedure can generate erroneous taxonomic sequence labels. Mislabeled sequences are hard to identify, and they can induce downstream errors because new sequences are typically annotated using existing ones. Furthermore, taxonomic mislabelings in reference sequence databases can bias metagenetic studies which rely on the taxonomy. Despite significant efforts to improve the quality of taxonomic annotations, the curation rate is low because of the labour-intensive manual curation process.\\n\\nHere, we present SATIVA, a phylogeny-aware method to automatically identify taxonomically mislabeled sequences ( mislabels) using statistical models of evolution. We use the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) to detect and score sequences whose taxonomic annotation is not supported by the underlying phylogenetic signal, and automatically propose a corrected taxonomic classification for those. Using simulated data, we show that our method attains high accuracy for identification (96.9% sensitivity / 91.7% precision) as well as correction (94.9% sensitivity / 89.9% precision) of mislabels. Furthermore, an analysis of four widely used microbial 16S reference databases (Greengenes, LTP, RDP and SILVA) indicates that they currently contain between 0.2% and 2.5% mislabels. Finally, we use SATIVA to perform an in-depth evaluation of alternative taxonomies for Cyanobacteria.\\n\\nSATIVA is freely available at https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa.",

    "abstract": "The pacific islands of Micronesia have experienced several outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases over the past decade. In outbreaks on small islands, the susceptible population is usually well defined, and there is no co-circulation of pathogens. Because of this, analysing such outbreaks can be useful for understanding the transmission dynamics of the pathogens involved, and particularly so for yet understudied pathogens such as Zika virus. Here, we compared three outbreaks of dengue and Zika virus in two different island settings in Micronesia, the Yap Main Islands and Fais, using a mathematical model of transmission dynamics, making full use of commonalities in disease and setting between the outbreaks. We found that the estimated reproduction numbers for Zika and dengue were similar when considered in the same setting, but that, conversely, reproduction number for the same disease can vary considerably by setting. On the Yap Main Islands, we estimated a reproduction number of 8.0-16 (95% Credible Interval (CI)) for the dengue outbreak and 4.8-14 (95% CI) for the Zika outbreak, whereas for the dengue outbreak on Fais our estimate was 28-102 (95% CI). We further found that the proportion of cases of Zika reported was smaller (95% CI 1.4%-1.9%) than that of dengue (95% CI 47%-61%). We confirmed these results in extensive sensitivity analysis. They suggest that models for dengue transmission can be useful for estimating the predicted dynamics of Zika transmission, but care must be taken when extrapolating findings from one setting to another.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDengue and Zika are related viruses and are both transmitted by mosquitoes. Dengue is well described and affects people around the world. Zika, on the other hand has only recently caused outbreak in human populations, and it has been suggested that its behaviour might similar dengue. To investigate this, we compared three outbreaks of dengue and Zika in island populations of the pacific: two dengue outbreaks and one Zika outbreak. Island outbreaks are useful laboratories for understanding the spread of infections because they are usually short, well-identified episodes, whereas elsewhere it can be difficult to identify the properties of outbreaks when different viruses spread at the same time. In our investigation of the outbreaks in Micronesia we found that dengue and Zika virus did, indeed, behave similar in outbreaks they caused on the Yap Main Islands. A dengue outbreak on the smaller island of Fais, on the other hand, was different from the dengue outbreak on Yap in that transmission seems to have been more efficient. We conclude that dengue outbreaks are indeed a good model for Zika outbreaks when considered in the same setting, but that one must be careful when comparing outbreaks in different settings.",

Their data convincingly show that nuclear signaling and cell volume undergo \\\"robust perfect adaptation\\\" implying integral feedback must restore their steady state values. However they incorrectly map the integrator onto a minimal network that violates assumptions implicit in conventional block diagrams. Using known features of osmotic stress signaling and results presented by the authors, I argue that glycerol concentration - the integral of the rate of glycerol accumulation (synthesis minus leakage) - transforms metabolic energy into increased osmolarity that drives water influx and restoration of turgor pressure. Integral feedback control actuated through glycerol synthesis is logically positioned to provide perfect adaptation and robustness in hyperosmotic stress responses.",

    "abstract": "The Eurasian sympatry of Neandertals and anatomically modern humans - beginning at least 45,000 years ago and lasting for more than 5,000 years - has long sparked anthropological interest into the factors that potentially contributed to Neandertal extinction. Among many different hypotheses, the \\\"differential pathogen resistance\\\" extinction model posits that Neandertals were disproportionately affected by exposure to novel infectious diseases that were transmitted during the period of spatiotemporal sympatry with modern humans. Comparisons of new archaic hominin paleogenome sequences with modern human genomes have confirmed a history of genetic admixture - and thus direct contact - between humans and Neandertals. Analyses of these data have also shown that Neandertal nuclear genome genetic diversity was likely considerably lower than that of the Eurasian anatomically modern humans with whom they came into contact, perhaps leaving Neandertal innate immune systems relatively more susceptible to novel pathogens. In this study, we compared levels of genetic diversity in genes for which genetic variation is hypothesized to benefit pathogen defense among Neandertals and African, European, and Asian modern humans, using available exome sequencing data (six chromosomes per population). We observed that Neandertals had only 31-39% as many nonsynonymous (amino acid changing) polymorphisms across 73 innate immune system genes compared to modern human populations. We also found that Neandertal genetic diversity was relatively low in an unbiased set of balancing selection candidate genes for primates - genes with the highest 1% genetic diversity genome-wide in non-human apes. In contrast, Neandertals had similar to higher levels of genetic diversity than humans in 13 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. Thus, while Neandertals may have been relatively more susceptible to some novel pathogens and differential pathogen resistance could be considered as one potential contributing factor in their extinction, this model does have limitations.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species represent unique opportunities to evaluate the role of local adaptation during colonization of new environments. Among these species, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a threatening vector of several human viral diseases, including dengue and chikungunya, and raises concerns about the Zika fever. Its broad presence in both temperate and tropical environments has been considered the reflection of great \\\"ecological plasticity\\\". However, no study has been conducted to assess the role of adaptive evolution in the ecological success of Ae. albopictus at the molecular level. In the present study, we performed a genomic scan to search for potential signatures of selection leading to local adaptation in one-hundred-forty field-collected mosquitoes from native populations of Vietnam and temperate invasive populations of Europe. High-throughput genotyping of transposable element insertions led to the discovery of more than 120 000 polymorphic loci, which, in their great majority, revealed a virtual absence of structure between the bio-geographic areas. Nevertheless, 92 outlier loci showed a high level of differentiation between temperate and tropical populations. The majority of these loci segregates at high insertion frequencies among European populations, indicating that this pattern could have been caused by recent adaptive evolution events in temperate areas. An analysis of the overlapping and neighboring genes highlighted several candidates, including diapause, lipid and juvenile hormone pathways.",

We earlier reported it to improve life history traits and to suppress neurodegeneration as well as induced apoptosis in Drosophila.\\n\\nAim of the studyTo examine effects of dietary AR supplement on cell stress responses in Drosophila melanogaster.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsLarvae/flies, reared on normal food or on that supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) AR, were exposed to crowding, thermal or oxidative stress and examined for survival, stress tolerance and levels of lipid peroxides, SOD and HSPs.\\n\\nResultsWild type larvae/flies reared on AR supplemented food survived the various cell stresses much better than those reared on normal food. AR-fed mutant park13 or DJ-1{beta}Delta93 (Parkinsons disease model) larvae, however, showed only partial or no protection, respectively, against paraquat-induced oxidative stress, indicating essentiality of DJ-1{beta} for AR mediated oxidative stress tolerance. AR feeding reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation even in aged (35 day old) wild type flies while enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We show for the first time that while Hsp70 or Hsp83 expression under normal or stress conditions was not differentially affected by AR feeding, Hsp27 levels were elevated in AR fed wild type control as well as heat shocked larvae. Therefore, besides the known anti-oxidant activity of Phyllanthus emblica fruits, dietary AR also enhances cellular levels of Hsp27.\\n\\nConclusionIn the context of the reported \\\"anti-aging\\\" and \\\"healthy-aging\\\" effects of AR, the present in vivo study on a model organisms shows that AR feeding significantly improves tolerance to a variety of cell stresses through reduced ROS and lipid peroxidation and enhanced SOD activity and Hsp27. Such improved cellular defences following dietary AR provide better homeostasis and thereby improve the life-span and quality of organisms life.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/050476_figu1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (36K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4452a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18eb595org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@33533aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d4590_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Using scalp EEG, we examined how visual cortical alpha activity relates to working memory performance. Younger (20-30 years) and older (60-70 years) participants were presented with a visual alerting cue uninformative of the position or size of a lateralized working memory array. Older adults showed longer response times overall, and reduced accuracy when memory load was high. Older adults had less consistent cue-evoked phase resetting than younger adults, which predicted worse performance. Alpha phase prior to memory array presentation predicted response time, but the relationship between phase and response time was weaker in older adults. These results suggest that changes in alpha phase dynamics, especially prior to presentation of task-relevant stimuli, potentially contribute to age-related cognitive decline.",

We apply the typing resolution score to chart improvement in HLA typing within the Be The Match Registry of the United States from the initiation of DNA-based HLA typing to the current state of high-resolution typing using next-generation sequencing technologies. In addition, we present a publicly available online tool for evaluation of any given HLA typing.

    "abstract": "Models of the spread of disease in a population often make the simplifying assumption that the population is homogeneously mixed, or is divided into homogeneously mixed compartments. However, human populations have complex structures formed by social contacts, which can have a significant influence on the rate of epidemic spread. Contact network models capture this structure by explicitly representing each contact which could possibly lead to a transmission. We developed a method based on kernel approximate Bayesian computation (kernel-ABC) for estimating structural parameters of the contact network underlying an observed viral phylogeny. The method combines adaptive sequential Monte Carlo for ABC, Gillespie simulation for propagating epidemics though networks, and a kernel-based tree similarity score. We used the method to fit the Barabasi-Albert network model to simulated transmission trees, and also applied it to viral phylogenies estimated from five published HIV sequence datasets. On simulated data, we found that the preferential attachment power and the number of infected nodes in the network can often be accurately estimated. On the other hand, the mean degree of the network, as well as the total number of nodes, were not estimable with kernel-ABC. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the parameter estimates on real datasets, with point estimates for the preferential attachment power ranging from 0.06 to 1.05. These results underscore the importance of considering contact structures when performing phylodynamic inference. Our method offers the potential to quantitatively investigate the contact network structure underlying viral epidemics.",

Clinical validation was performed by multicenter blind testing of clinical and control samples. Sensitivity and specificity of the assay are above 99%. We have developed statements for test ordering, test acquisition form and practical recommendations for the results interpretation. The test has been successfully applied for the confirmatory diagnostics in a clinical laboratory during a year. Thus, the developed assay is a comprehensive ready-to-use CE-IVD solution for clinical diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Craving often precedes relapse into cocaine addiction. This explains why considerable research effort is being expended to try to develop anti-craving strategies for relapse prevention. Recently, we discovered using the classic reinstatement model of cocaine craving that the reinstating or priming effect of cocaine can be extinguished with repeated priming in rats - a phenomenon dubbed extinction of cocaine priming. Here we sought to measure the potential beneficial effect of this novel extinction strategy on subsequent relapse (i.e., return to the pre-extinction pattern of cocaine self-administration once the drug is made again available after extinction). Overall and contrary to our initial hope, extensive and complete extinction of cocaine priming had no major impact on relapse. This lack of effect occurred despite evidence for post-extinction loss of neuronal responses to cocaine priming in brain regions critically involved in cocaine-induced reinstatement (i.e., the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the core of the nucleus accumbens). An effect of extinction of cocaine priming on relapse was only observed when cocaine was available for self-administration under more demanding conditions. However, this effect was modest and short-lived. Finally, we succeeded to trace the origin of our failure to prevent relapse to a persistent, extinction-resistant form of operant behavior that is not directly induced by cocaine. This extinction-resistant behavior is commonly reported, though generally ignored as causally irrelevant, in many other reinstatement studies. We propose that this behavior should become both a novel marker for long-term vulnerability to relapse and a novel target for preclinical development of potential relapse prevention interventions.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the ontogeny of light-driven responses in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array, we recorded from hundreds to thousands of RGCs simultaneously at pan-retinal level, including dorsal and ventral locations. Responses to different contrasts not only revealed a complex developmental profile for ON, OFF and ON-OFF RGC types, but also unveiled differences between dorsal and ventral RGCs. At eye-opening, dorsal RGCs of all types were more responsive to light, perhaps indicating an environmental priority to nest viewing for pre-weaning pups. The developmental profile of ON and OFF RGCs exhibited antagonistic behavior, with the strongest ON responses shortly after eye-opening, followed by an increase in the strength of OFF responses later on. Further, we found that with maturation receptive field (RF) center sizes decrease, responses to light get stronger, and centers become more circular while seeing differences in all of them between RGC types. These findings show that retinal functionality is not spatially homogeneous, likely reflecting ecological requirements that favour the early development of dorsal retina, and reflecting different roles in vision in the mature animal.",

    "abstract": "Imitation is ubiquitous in positive social interactions. For adult and child observers, it also supports inferences about the participants in such interactions and their social relationships, but the origins of these inferences are obscure. Do infants attach social significance to this form of interaction? Here we test 4- to 5.5-month-old infants interpretation of imitation, asking if the imitative interactions they observe support inferences of social affiliation across 10 experimental conditions that varied the modality of the imitation (movement vs. sound), the roles of specific characters (imitators vs. targets), the number of characters in the displays (3 vs. 5), and the number of parties initiating affiliative test events (1 vs. 2). These experiments, together with one experiment conducted with 12-month-old infants, yielded three main findings. First, infants expect that characters who engaged in imitation will approach and affiliate with the characters whom they imitated. Second, infants show no evidence of expecting that characters who were targets of imitation will approach and affiliate with their imitators. Third, analyzing imitative interactions is difficult for young infants, whose expectations vary in strength depending on the number of characters to be tracked and the number of affiliative actors to be compared. These findings have implications for our understanding of social imitation, and they provide methods for advancing understanding of other aspects of early social cognitive development.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are highly potent to invade the portal venous system and subsequently develop into the portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). PVTT could induce intrahepatic metastasis, which is closely associated with poor prognosis. A comprehensive systematic characterization of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with HCC metastasis has not been reported. Here, we first assayed 60 clinical samples (matched primary tumor, adjacent normal tissue, and PVTT) from 20 HCC patients using total RNA sequencing. We identified and characterized 8,603 novel lncRNAs from 9.6 billion sequenced reads, indicating specific expression of these lncRNAs in our samples. On the other hand, the expression patterns of 3,212 known and novel recurrently deregulated lncRNAs (in >=20% of our patients) were well correlated with clinical data in a TCGA cohort and published liver cancer data. Some lncRNAs (e.g., RP11-166D19.1/MIR100HG) were shown to be useful as putative biomarkers for prognosis and metastasis. Moreover, matched array data from 60 samples showed that copy number variations (CNVs) and alterations in DNA methylation contributed to the observed recurrent deregulation of 716 lncRNAs. Subsequently, using a coding-noncoding co-expression network, we found that many recurrently deregulated lncRNAs were enriched in clusters of genes related to cell adhesion, immune response, and metabolic processes. Candidate lncRNAs related to metastasis, such as HAND2-AS1, were further validated using RNAi-based loss-of-function assays. The results of our integrative analysis provide a valuable resource regarding functional lncRNAs and novel biomarkers associated with HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Cymbalaria is a Mediterranean genus including ten species and six subspecies growing on rocky habitats. A very fragmented distribution, the different ecologic preferences of partially sympatric species and the presence of different ploidy levels, suggest the role of allopatric, sympatric ecological and polyploid speciation in its evolution. The aims of this study are to verify the monophyly and to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of Cymbalaria, to infer its biogeographic history by estimating the lineage divergence dates and the ancestral areas of distribution, and to discuss the role of different types of speciation. To address these issues, we constructed a complete phylogeny of the genus with ITS, 3ETS, ndhF and rpl32-trnL sequences. A time-calibrated phylogeny and an ancestral-area estimation were obtained from the nrDNA data. The evidence supported the genus Cymbalaria as monophyletic. It originated ca. 5 Ma and three lineages segregated rapidly, one with the single extant taxa Cymbalaria microcalyx subsp. microcalyx and the other two corresponding to western and central-eastern species, respectively. The main diversification events occurred after the onset of the Mediterranean climate and during Pleistocene oscillations. Founder-event and sympatric speciation were supported by the biogeographic analyses, and chromosome data combined with our phylogeny supported at least two polyploidization events. We observed that the consequences of physical barriers were different amongst the different species.\\n\\nSupplementary MaterialElectronic Supplement (Figure S1, Table S1) are available in the Supplementary Data section of the online version of this article (http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax).",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of lipooligosaccharides (LOS) in the pathogenicity of campylobacteriosis, little is known about the genetic and phenotypic diversity of LOS in C. coli. In this study, we investigated the distribution of LOS locus classes among a large collection of unrelated C. coli isolates sampled from several different host species. Furthermore, we paired C. coli genomic information and LOS chemical composition for the first time to identify mechanisms consistent with the generation of LOS phenotypic heterogeneity. After classifying three new LOS locus classes, only 85% of the 144 isolates tested were assigned to a class, suggesting higher genetic diversity than previously thought. This genetic diversity is at the basis of a completely unexplored LOS structure heterogeneity. Mass spectrometry analysis of the LOS of nine isolates, representing four different LOS classes, identified two features distinguishing C. coli LOS from C. jejunis. GlcN-GlcN disaccharides were present in the lipid A backbone in contrast to the GlcN3N-GlcN backbone observed in C. jejuni. Moreover, despite that many of the genes putatively involved in Qui3pNAcyl were absence in the genomes of various isolates, this rare sugar was found in the outer core of all C. coli. Therefore, regardless the high genetic diversity of LOS biosynthes is locus in C. coli, we identified species-specific phenotypic features of C. coli LOS which might explain differences between C. jejuni and C. coli in terms of population dynamics and host adaptation.\\n\\nDepositories (where applicable)The whole genome sequences of C. coli are publicly available on the RAST server (http://rast.nmpdr.org) with guest account (login and password  guest) under IDs: 195.91, 195.96-195.119, 195.124-195.126, 195.128-195.130, 195.133, 195.134, 6666666.94320",

    "abstract": "The large and ever increasing numbers of quantitative proteomics datasets constitute a currently underexploited resource for drawing biological insights on proteins and their functions. Multiple observations by different laboratories indicate that protein complexes often follow similar trends. However, proteomic data is often noisy and incomplete - members of a complex may correlate weakly or only in a fraction of all experiments, or may not be observed in all experiments. We have previously used the Random Forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm to distinguish functional chromosomal proteins from  hitchhikers in an analysis of mitotic chromosomes. Even though it is assumed that RFs need large training sets, in this technical note we show that RFs also are able to detect small protein complexes and relationships between them. We use artificial datasets to demonstrate the robustness of RFs to identify small groups even when working with mixes of noisy and apparently uninformative experiments. We then use our procedure to retrieve a number of chromosomal complexes from real quantitative proteomics datasets, comparing wild-type and multiple different knock-out mitotic chromosomes. The procedure also revealed other proteins that covary strongly with these complexes suggesting novel functional links. Integrating the RF analysis for several complexes revealed the known interdependency of kinetochore subcomplexes, as well as an unexpected dependency between the Constitutive-Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) and the condensin (SMC 2/4) complex. Serving as negative control, ribosomal proteins remained independent of kinetochore complexes. Together, these results show that this complex-oriented RF (nanoRF) can uncover subtle protein relationships and higher-order dependencies in integrated proteomics data.",

However, at these resolutions accurately positioning individual atoms remains challenging and may be error-prone. Manually refining thousands of amino acids - typical in a macromolecular assembly - is tedious and time-consuming. We present an automated method that can improve the atomic details in models manually built in near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM maps. Applying the method to three systems recently solved by cryo-EM, we are able to improve model geometry while maintaining or improving the fit-to-density. Backbone placement errors are automatically detected and corrected, and the refinement shows a large radius of convergence. The results demonstrate the method is amenable to structures with symmetry, of very large size, and containing RNA as well as covalently bound ligands. The method should streamline the cryo-EM structure determination process, providing accurate and unbiased atomic structure interpretation of such maps.",

Although ZIKV was first discovered in 1947, the exact mechanism of virus replication and pathogenesis still remains unknown. Recent outbreaks of Zika virus in the Americas clearly suggest a better adaptation of viral strains to human host. Understanding the conserved and adaptive features in the evolution of ZIKV genome will reveal the molecular mechanism of virus replication and host adaptation. Here, we show comprehensive analysis of protein evolution and changes in RNA secondary structures of ZIKV strains including the current 2015-16 outbreak. To identify the constraints on ZIKV evolution, selection pressure at individual codons, immune epitopes, co-evolving sites, and RNA structures were analyzed. The proteome of current 2015/16 epidemic ZIKV strains of Asian genotype is found to be genetically conserved due to genome-wide negative selection on codons, with limited positive selection. Predicted RNA structures at the 5 and 3 ends of ZIKV strains reveal substantial changes such as an additional stem loop which makes it similar to that of Yellow Fever Virus. Concisely, the targeted changes at both the amino acid and the RNA levels contribute to the better adaptation of ZIKV strains to human host with an enhanced neurotropism.",

    "abstract": "Sperm cells provide crucial, if usually diminutive, ingredients to successful sexual reproduction as the source of centrioles and half the diploid genome. Despite this essential conserved function, sperm competition and coevolution with female traits can drive spectacular change in size and shape of these motile cells. Here we characterize four repeated instances of convergent evolution of sperm gigantism in Caenorhabditis nematodes using phylogenetic comparative methods on 26 species. Species at the extreme end of the 50-fold range of sperm-cell volumes across the genus have sperm capable of comprising up to 5% of egg-cell volume, representing severe attenuation of the magnitude of anisogamy. Exploring potential genetic and developmental determinants of Caenorhabditis sperm size variation, we uncover significant differences in mean and variance of sperm size among genotypes, between sexes of androdioecious species, as well as within and between individuals of identical genotypes. We demonstrate that the developmental basis of sperm size variation, both within and between species, becomes established during an early stage of sperm development, i.e. at the formation of primary spermatocytes while subsequent meiotic divisions contribute little further sperm size variability. These findings provide first insights into the developmental determinants of inter-and intraspecific sperm size differences in Caenorhabditis. Together, our results provide a novel integrative view on the developmental and evolutionary origins of Caenorhabditis sperm size variation. We hypothesize that life history and/or ecological differences among species favoured the evolution of alternative sperm competition strategies toward either many smaller sperm or fewer larger sperm, with gigantic sperm potentially providing a means of paternal care via gametic provisioning or as a potent vehicle for sexual conflict over offspring development.",

    "abstract": "It is now well established that bacterial populations utilize cell-to-cell signaling (quorum-sensing, QS) to control the production of public goods and other co-operative behaviours. Evolutionary theory predicts that both the cost of signal production and the response to signals should incur fitness costs for producing cells. Although costs imposed by the downstream consequences of QS have been shown, it has not been demonstrated that the production of QS signal molecules (QSSMs) results in a decrease in fitness. We measured the fitness cost to cells of synthesising QSSMs by quantifying metabolite levels in the presence of QSSM synthases. We found that: (i) bacteria making QSSMs have a growth defect that exerts an evolutionary cost, (ii) production of QSSMs correlates with reduced intracellular concentrations of QSSM precursors, (iii) the production of heterologous QSSMs negatively impacts the production of a native QSSM that shares common substrates, and (iv) supplementation with exogenously added metabolites partially rescued growth defects imposed by QSSM synthesis. These data provide the first direct experimental evidence that the production of QS signals carries fitness costs to producer cells.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementBacterial cells within populations communicate with each other to control social behaviors by producing diffusible quorum sensing (QS) signal molecules. Evolutionary theory predicts that both the cost of signal production and the response to signals should incur fitness costs for producing cells. Here we provide the first empirical evidence that the production of QS signals incurs fitness costs to producing cells. Since QS plays a major role in bacterial pathogenicity, this finding will underpin novel antimicrobial strategies that are urgently needed to replace currently available antimicrobials that are becoming obsolete through the ever-rising incidence of resistance.",

    "abstract": "Phylodynamics typically rely on likelihood-based methods to infer epidemiological parameters from dated phylogenies. These methods are essentially based on simple epidemiological models because of the difficulty in expressing the likelihood function analytically. Computing this function numerically raises additional challenges, especially for large phylogenies. Here, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to circumvent these problems. ABC is a likelihood-free method of parameter inference, based on simulation and comparison between target data and simulated data, using summary statistics. We simulated target trees under several epidemiological scenarios in order to assess the accuracy of ABC methods for inferring epidemiological parameter such as the basic reproduction number (R0), the mean duration of infection, and the effective host population size. We designed many summary statistics to capture the information in a phylogeny and its corresponding lineage-through-time plot. We then used the simplest ABC method, called rejection, and its modern derivative complemented with adjustment of the posterior distribution by regression. The availability of machine learning techniques including variable selection, motivated us to compute many summary statistics on the phylogeny. We found that ABC-based inference reaches an accuracy comparable to that of likelihood-based methods for birth-death models and can even outperform existing methods for more refined models and large trees. By re-analysing data from the early stages of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we also found that ABC provides more realistic estimates than the likelihood-based methods, for some parameters. This work shows that the combination of ABC-based inference using many summary statistics and sophisticated machine learning methods able to perform variable selection is a promising approach to analyse large phylogenies and non-trivial models.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is considered a hallmark of malignant transformation. However, it is not clear whether the network of metabolic reactions expressed by cancers of different origin differ from each other nor from normal human tissues. In this study, we reconstructed functional and connected genome-scale metabolic models for 917 primary tumors based on the probability of expression for 3,765 reference metabolic genes in the sample. This network-centric approach revealed that tumor metabolic networks are largely similar in terms of accounted reactions, despite diversity in the expression of the associated genes. On average, each network contained 4,721 reactions, of which 74% were core reactions (present in >95% of all models). Whilst 99.3% of the core reactions were classified as housekeeping also in normal tissues, we identified reactions catalyzed by ARG2, RHAG, SLC6 and SLC16 family gene members, and PTGS1 and PTGS2 as core exclusively in cancer. The remaining 26% of the reactions were contextual reactions. Their inclusion was dependent in one case (GLS2) on the absence of TP53 mutations and in 94.6% of cases on differences in cancer types. This dependency largely resembled differences in expression patterns in the corresponding normal tissues, with some exceptions like the presence of the NANP-encoded reaction in tumors not from the female reproductive system or of the SLC5A9-encoded reaction in kidney-pancreatic-colorectal tumors. In conclusion, tumors expressed a metabolic network virtually overlapping the matched normal tissues, raising the possibility that metabolic reprogramming simply reflects cancer cell plasticity to adapt to varying conditions thanks to redundancy and complexity of the underlying metabolic networks. At the same time, the here uncovered exceptions represent a resource to identify selective liabilities of tumor metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Sensory cortices represent the world through the activity of diversely tuned cells. How the activity of single cells is coordinated within populations and across sensory hierarchies is largely unknown. Cortical oscillations may coordinate local and distributed neuronal groups. Using datasets from intracortical multi-electrode recordings and from large-scale electrocorticography (ECoG) grids, we investigated how visual features could be extracted from the local field potential (LFP) and how this compared with the information available from multi-unit activity (MUA). MUA recorded from macaque V1 contained comparable amounts of information as simultaneously recorded LFP power in two frequency bands, one in the alpha-beta band and the other in the gamma band. ECoG-LFP contained information in the same bands as microelectrode-LFP, even when identifying natural scenes. The fact that information was contained in the same bands in both intracortical and ECoG recordings suggests that oscillatory activity could play similar roles at both spatial scales.",
