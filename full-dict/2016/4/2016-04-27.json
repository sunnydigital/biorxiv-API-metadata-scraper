    "abstract": "Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation and is, therefore, central to evolutionary change. Previous work on Paramecium tetraurelia found an unusually low germline base-substitution mutation rate in this ciliate. Here, we tested the generality of this result among ciliates using Tetrahymena thermophila. We sequenced the genomes of 10 lines of T. thermophila that had each undergone approximately 1,000 generations of mutation accumulation (MA). We applied an existing mutation-calling pipeline and developed a new probabilistic mutation detection approach that directly models the design of an MA experiment and accommodates the noise introduced by mismapped reads. Our probabilistic mutation-calling method provides a straightforward way of estimating the number of sites at which a mutation could have been called if one was present, providing the denominator for our mutation rate calculations. From these methods, we find that T. thermophila has a germline base-substitution mutation rate of 7.61 x 10-12 per site, per cell division, which is consistent with the low base-substitution mutation rate in P. tetraurelia. Over the course of the evolution experiment, genomic exclusion lines derived from the MA lines experienced a fitness decline that cannot be accounted for by germline base-substitution mutations alone, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors must be involved. Because selection can only operate to reduce mutation rates based upon the \\\"visible\\\" mutational load, asexual reproduction with a transcriptionally silent germline may allow ciliates to evolve extremely low germline mutation rates.",

    "abstract": "Linkage and association studies have mapped thousands of genomic regions that contribute to phenotypic variation, but narrowing these regions to the underlying causal genes and variants has proven much more challenging. Resolution of genetic mapping is limited by the recombination rate. We developed a method that uses CRISPR to build mapping panels with targeted recombination events. We tested the method by generating a panel with recombination events spaced along a yeast chromosome arm, mapping trait variation, and then targeting a high density of recombination events to the region of interest. Using this approach, we fine-mapped manganese sensitivity to a single polymorphism in the transporter Pmr1. Targeting recombination events to regions of interest allows us to rapidly and systematically identify causal variants underlying trait differences.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid zones formed between recently diverged populations offer an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation and the process of speciation. Here, we use a combination of analytical theory and explicit forward simulations to show how selection against hybrid genotypes impacts patterns of introgression across genomic and geographic space. By understanding how lineages move across the hybrid zone, in a model without coalescence, we describe how clines form and how parental haplotypes are broken up during introgression. Clines form in about 1/s generations, where s is the strength of selection against hybrids, and linked clines persist over a physical scale of 1/T, where T is the age, in generations, of the hybrid zone. Locally disadvantageous alleles tend to exist as small families, whose lineages trace back to the side from which they originated at speed [Formula] dispersal distances per generation. The lengths of continuous tracts of ancestry provide an additional source of information: blocks of ancestry surrounding single-locus incompatibilities can be substantially longer than the genome-wide average block length at the same spatial location, an observation that might be used to characterize the age of hybrid zones and identify candidate targets of selection.",

During traversal of an environment composed of multiple interconnected paths, a subpopulation of subiculum neurons robustly encoded the animals current axis of travel. The firing of these axis-tuned neurons peaked bimodally at head orientations approximately 180 degrees apart. Track rotation experiments revealed that axis encoding carried the spatial reference frame of the larger environment as opposed to the track itself. However, axis-tuned activity of the same subpopulation was largely absent during unconstrained movement about a circular arena. Thus, during navigation in a path-rich environment, subpopulations of subiculum neurons encode the animals current axis of travel relative to environmental boundaries - providing a powerful mechanism for mapping of specific relationships between routes, route components, and the larger environment.",

We investigated morphological changes at the bio-hybrid interface and changes in RGC responses to electrical stimulation following prolonged in vitro coupling to CNT electrodes. We observed gradual remodelling of the inner retina to incorporate CNT assemblies. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrate a progressive increase in coupling between RGCs and the CNT electrodes over three days, characterized by a gradual decrease in stimulation thresholds and increase in cellular recruitment.

    "abstract": "Broad transcriptomic sequencing of eukaryotes has revealed the ubiquity of splicing of nuclear genes. While the vast majority of splicing events join segments of the same RNA transcript, various studies have found a few intriguing cases of trans-splicing of introns, in which splicing events within protein coding regions join segments of different RNA transcripts. The most structurally intricate case known involves the bursicon gene in mosquitos, in which an internal exon is encoded at a distinct locus, requiring multiple trans-splicing events form the mature mRNA. This arrangement is known to be ancestral to mosquitos, however the exact timing of the origin of trans-splicing and the history of the bursicon gene within mosquitos is unknown. Taking advantage of the recent availability of genomes from various Anopheles mosquitos and from relatives of mosquitos, I determined trans versus cis encoding of bursicon across Culicomorpha. I conclude that trans-splicing emerged in the last common ancestor of mosquitos, and that trans-splicing has been retained in all 19 studied Anopheles species. The retention of trans-splicing could indicate functional importance of this arrangement, or could alternatively reflect the rarity of mutations giving rise to viable allelic alternatives.",

Experimental evidences showed an intraneuronal accumulation of A{beta} peptides and an interference with mitochondrial functions. Nevertheless, the relevance of intracellular A{beta} peptides in the pathophysiology of AD remained controversial. Here, we found that the two major species of A{beta} peptides, in particular A{beta}42, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the preprotein import reactions essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. However, A{beta} peptides interacted only weakly with mitochondria and did not affect the inner membrane potential or the structure of the preprotein translocase complexes. A{beta} peptides significantly decreased the import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins through a extra-mitochondrial co-aggregation mechanism. Co-aggregation and import inhibition were significantly stronger in case of the longer peptide A{beta}42, correlating with its importance in AD pathology. Our results demonstrate that a direct interference of aggregation-prone A{beta} peptides with mitochondrial protein biogenesis represents a crucial aspect of the pathobiochemical mechanisms contributing to cellular damage in AD.",

    "abstract": "Although drug combinations have proven efficacious in a variety of diseases, the design of such regimens often involves extensive experimental screening due to the myriad choice of drugs and doses. To address these challenges, we utilize the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to evaluate whether drug synergy or antagonism is mediated through genetic interactions between their target genes. Specifically, we hypothesize that if the inhibition targets of one chemical compound are in close proximity to those of a second compound in a genetic interaction network, then the compound pair will exhibit synergy or antagonism. Graph metrics are employed to make precise the notion of proximity in a network. Knowledge of genetic interactions and small-molecule targets are compiled through literature sources and curated databases, with predictions validated according to experimentally determined gold standards. Finally, we test whether genetic interactions propagate through networks according to a \\\"guilt-by-association\\\" framework. Our results suggest that close proximity between the target genes of one drug and those of another drug does not strongly predict synergy or antagonism. In addition, we find that the extent to which the growth of a double gene mutant deviates from expectation is moderately anti-correlated with their distance in a genetic interaction network.",

Active auditory processes are known from several taxa, but their adaptive function has rarely been demonstrated. We show that tree crickets harness active processes to ensure that auditory tuning remains matched to conspecific song frequency, despite changing environmental conditions and signal characteristics. Adaptive tuning allows tree crickets to selectively detect potential mates or rivals over large distances and is likely to bestow a strong selective advantage by reducing mate-finding effort and facilitating intermale interactions.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of brain evolution is scarce, possibly due in part to the difficulty of describing how brain relates to fitness. Yet such modeling is needed to formalize verbal arguments and deepen our understanding of brain evolution. To address this issue, we combine elements of life history and metabolic theories to formulate a metabolically explicit mathematical model for brain life history evolution. We assume that some of the brains energetic expense is due to production (learning) and maintenance (memory) of skills (or cognitive abilities, knowledge, information, etc.). We also assume that individuals use skills to extract energy from the environment, and can allocate this energy to grow and maintain the body, including brain and reproductive tissues. Our model can be used to ask what fraction of growth energy should be allocated to the growth of brain and other tissues at each age under various biological settings as a result of natural selection. We apply the model to find uninvadable allocation strategies under a \\\"me-against-nature\\\" setting, namely when overcoming environmentally determined energy-extraction challenges does not involve any interactions with other individuals (possibly except caregivers), and using parameter values for modern humans. The uninvadable strategies yield predictions for brain and body mass throughout ontogeny, as well as for the ages at maturity, adulthood, and brain growth arrest. We find that (1) a me-against-nature setting is enough to generate adult brain and body mass of ancient human scale, (2) large brains are favored by intermediately challenging environments, moderately effective skills, and metabolically expensive memory, and (3) adult skill number is proportional to brain mass when metabolic costs of memory saturate the brain metabolic rate allocated to skills. Overall, our model is a step towards a quantitative theory of brain life history evolution yielding testable quantitative predictions as ecological, demographic, and social factors vary.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding what promotes the evolution of a given feature is often helped by mathematical modeling. However, mathematical modeling of brain evolution has remained scarce, possibly because of difficulties describing mathematically how the brain relates to reproductive success, which is the currency of evolution. Here we combine elements of two research fields that have previously been successful at detailing how a feature impacts reproductive success (life history theory) and at predicting the individuals body mass throughout its life without the need to describe in detail the inner workings of the body (metabolic theory). We apply the model to a setting where individuals must extract energy from the environment without interacting with other individuals except caregivers (\\\"me-against-nature\\\") and parameterize the model with data from humans. In this setting, the model can correctly predict a variety of human features, including large brain sizes. Our model can be used to obtain testable quantitative predictions in terms of brain mass throughout an individuals life from assumed hypotheses promoting brain evolution, such as harsh environments or plentiful social interactions.",

In the second experiment, we exploited the fact that the presence of an illusory contour enhances performance on a spatial localization task. Moreover, in the latter experiment we also used a different masking method to rule out the effect of stimulus duration. Our results suggest that participants do not perceive illusory contours when they are unaware of the inducing context.

Aims of our study were to trace the microevolutionary legacy of this tree species with the help of sequence-based multi-local phylogeography and to find the comparative placement of family Salvadoraceae within angiosperm clade malvids. A total 20 geographical isolates were collected from different regions of North India, covering a major part of its species range within the Indian Subcontinent. Sequence data from nuclear-encoded Internal Transcribed Spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and plastid-encoded trnL-F spacer region, were generated for this species for the first time in the world. ITS-based Bayesian phylogeographic analysis revealed the existence of four clades while trnL-F spacer based Bayesian analysis revealed one clade for this species distributed in the Indian subcontinent. Between these two loci, ITS revealed more distinct phylogeographic clades, indicating the phylogeographic utility of this locus for the systematics of Salvadoraceae. Phylogenetic analyzes based on trnL-F spacer suggested a synonymy of this species with Salvadora angustifolia. Maximum Likelihood gene tree based on ITS sequence data revealed that Salvadoraceae belongs to Sapindales rather than Brassicales. However, in the gene tree based on trnL-F spacer sequence, this family clustered within Brassicales. An evolutionary congruence of S. oleoides isolates across its range in North India is revealed in this study. Given the conflicting results on the relative placement of Salvadoraceae in Brassicales and Sapindales, the need for further phylogenetic analyses of malvids using supermatrix approach is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "A critical step in cellular trafficking pathways is the budding of membranes by protein coats, which recent experiments have demonstrated can be inhibited by elevated membrane tension. The robustness of processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) across a diverse range of organisms and mechanical environments suggests that the protein machinery in this process has evolved to take advantage of some set of physical design principles to ensure robust vesiculation against opposing forces like membrane tension. Using a theoretical model for membrane mechanics and membrane protein interaction, we have systematically investigated the influence of membrane rigidity, curvature induced by the protein coat, area covered by the protein coat, membrane tension and force from actin polymerization on bud formation. Under low tension, the membrane smoothly evolves from a flat to budded morphology as the coat area or spontaneous curvature increases, whereas the membrane remains essentially flat at high tensions. At intermediate, physiologically relevant, tensions, the membrane undergoes a snapthrough instability in which small changes in the coat area, spontaneous curvature or membrane tension cause the membrane to \\\"snap\\\" from an open, U-shape to a closed bud. This instability can be smoothed out by increasing the bending rigidity of the coat, allowing for successful budding at higher membrane tensions. Additionally, applied force from actin polymerization can bypass the instability by inducing a smooth transition from an open to a closed bud. Finally, a combination of increased coat rigidity and force from actin polymerization enables robust vesiculation even at high membrane tensions.\\n\\nSignificance statementPlasma membrane tension plays an important role in various biological processes. In particular, recent experimental studies have shown that membrane tension inhibits membrane budding processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). We have identified a mathematical relationship between the curvature-generating capability of the protein coat and membrane tension that can predict whether the coat alone is sufficient to produce closed buds. Additionally, we show that a combination of increased coat rigidity and applied force from actin polymerization can produce closed buds at high membrane tensions. These findings are general to any membrane budding process, suggesting that biology has evolved to take advantage of a set of physical design principles to ensure robust vesicle formation across a range of organisms and mechanical environments.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsJ.E.H., G.O., and P.R. designed research.

    "abstract": "Transient spine enlargement (3-5 min timescale) is an important event associated with the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Many of the molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine en{-}largement have been identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient spine expansion in response to calcium-influx due to NMDA receptor activation. We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in signaling net{-}works and their role is to control both the activation and inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume). Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion including CaMKII, RhoA, and Cdc42 and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical signaling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remod{-}eling events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics. We also generate experimentally testable predictions about the role of different components and parameters of the network on spine dynamics.",
