    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system utilizes multiple mechanisms linked to innate immune cell functions to respond appropriately to pathogens and commensals. Here we discover further aspects of this connectivity by demonstrating that naive T cells as they emerge from the thymus (recent thymic emigrants, RTEs) express complement receptors (CR1 and CR2), the bacterial pathogen recognition receptor TLR1 and an enzyme that deactivates bacterial lipopolysaccharide (AOAH) and following activation secrete the anti-microbial cytokine IL-8. CR2+ naive T cells also express a selection of genes associated with tissue migration, consistent with the hypothesis that following emigration from the thymus RTEs seed peripheral compartments where some pursue their anti-microbial potential by becoming IL-8-producing CR2+ memory cells while others undergo homeostatic expansion. CR2+ naive and memory cells are abundant in children but decrease with age, coinciding with the involution of the thymus. The ability of CR2, which is also a receptor for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), to identify recent thymic emigrants will facilitate assessment of thymic function during aging and aid investigations of multiple clinical areas including the occurrence of T cell lymphomas caused by EBV.",

    "abstract": "The mitotic spindle ensures the faithful segregation of chromosomes. To discover the nature of the crucial centrosome-to-chromosome connection during mitosis, we combined the first large-scale serial electron tomography of whole mitotic spindles in early C. elegans embryos with live-cell imaging. Using tomography, we reconstructed the positions of all microtubules in 3D, and identified their plus- and minus-ends. We classified them as kinetochore (KMTs), spindle (SMTs), or astral microtubules (AMTs) according to their positions, and quantified distinct properties of each class. While our light microscopy and mutant studies show that microtubules are nucleated from the centrosomes, we find only a few KMTs are directly connected to the centrosomes. Indeed, by quantitatively analysing several models of microtubule growth, we conclude that minus-ends of KMTs have selectively detached and depolymerized from the centrosome. In toto, our results show that the connection between centrosomes and chromosomes is mediated by an anchoring into the entire spindle network and that any direct connections through KMTs are few and likely very transient.",

    "abstract": "Genetic data are known to harbor information about human demographics, and genotyping data are commonly used for capturing ancestry information by leveraging genome-wide differences between populations. In contrast, it is not clear to what extent population structure is captured by whole-genome DNA methylation data. We demonstrate, using three large cohort 450K methylation array data sets, that ancestry information signal is mirrored in genome-wide DNA methylation data, and that it can be further isolated more effectively by leveraging the correlation structure of CpGs with cis-located SNPs. Based on these insights, we propose a method, EPISTRUCTURE, for the inference of ancestry from methylation data, without the need for genotype data. EPISTRUCTURE can be used to infer ancestry information of individuals based on their methylation data in the absence of corresponding genetic data. Although genetic data are often collected in epigenetic studies of large cohorts, these are typically not made publicly available, making the application of EPISTRUCTURE especially useful for anyone working on public data. Implementation of EPISTRUCTURE is available in GLINT, our recently released toolset for DNA methylation analysis at: http://glint-epigenetics.readthedocs.io.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes are non-membrane-bound compartments that nucleate microtubule arrays. They consist of nanometer-scale centrioles surrounded by a micron-scale, dynamic assembly of protein called the pericentriolar material (PCM). To study how PCM forms a spherical compartment that nucleates microtubules, we reconstituted PCM-dependent microtubule nucleation in vitro using recombinant C.elegans proteins. We found that macromolecular crowding drives phase separation of the key PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 into spherical droplets that morphologically and dynamically resemble in vivo PCM. These SPD-5 droplets recruited the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9 (XMAP215 homologue) and the microtubule-stabilizing protein TPXL-1 (TPX2 homologue). Together, these three proteins concentrated tubulin ~4- fold over background, which was sufficient to reconstitute nucleation of microtubule asters in vitro. Our results suggest that in vivo PCM is a selective phase that organizes microtubule arrays through localized concentration of tubulin by microtubule effector proteins.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPhase separation of C. elegans centrosome proteins drive the formation of micron-sized microtubule organizing centers.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer pathogenesis is known to be propagated by the differential expression of a group of proteins called the Kinesin Superfamily (KIFs), which are instrumental in the intracellular transport of chromosomes along microtubules during mitosis. During mitosis, KIFs are strictly regulated through temporal synthesis so that they are only present when needed. However, their misregulation may contribute to uncontrolled cell growth due to premature sister chromatid separation, highlighting their involvement in tumorigenesis. One particular KIF, KIF21A, was recently found to promote the survival of human breast cancer cells in vitro. However, how KIF21A influences other cancerous phenotypes is currently unknown. This study therefore aimed to consolidate the in vitro role of KIF21A in breast cancer metastasis, while also analysing KIF21A expression in human breast cancer tissue to determine its prognostic value. This was achieved by silencing KIF21A in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines via siRNA transfection. Migration, invasion, proliferation, and adhesion assays were then performed to measure the effects of KIF21A silencing on oncogenic behaviour. Immunohistochemistry was also conducted in 263 breast cancer tissue samples to compare KIF21A expression levels against various prognostic outcomes and clinicopathological parameters. KIF21A knockdown reduced cell migration (by 42.8% [MCF-7] and 69.7% [MDA-MB-231]) and invasion (by 72.5% [MCF-7] and 42.5% [MDA-MB-231]) in both cell lines, but had no effect on adhesion or proliferation, suggesting that KIF21A plays an important role in the early stages of breast cancer metastasis. Unexpectedly however, KIF21A was shown to negatively correlate with various pro-malignant clinicopathological parameters, including tumour size and histological grade, and high KIF21A expression predicted better breast cancer survival (hazard ratio = 0.45), suggesting that KIF21A is a tumour suppressor. The conflicting outcomes of in vitro and in vivo data may be due to the possible multi-functionality of KIF21A or study limitations, and means no definitive conclusions can be drawn about the role of KIF21A in breast cancer. This warrants further investigation, which may prove pivotal to the development of novel chemotherapeutic strategies to mediate KIF21As function and enhance prognostic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe recent widespread application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for microbial disease investigations has spurred the development of new bioinformatics tools, including a notable proliferation of phylogenomics pipelines designed for infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigation. Transitioning the use of WGS data out of the research lab and into the front lines of surveillance and outbreak response requires user-friendly, reproducible, and scalable pipelines that have been well validated.\\n\\nResultsSNVPhyl (Single Nucleotide Variant Phylogenomics) is a bioinformatics pipeline for identifying high-quality SNVs and constructing a whole genome phylogeny from a collection of WGS reads and a reference genome. Individual pipeline components are integrated into the Galaxy bioinformatics framework, enabling data analysis in a user-friendly, reproducible, and scalable environment. We show that SNVPhyl can detect SNVs with high sensitivity and specificity and identify and remove regions of high SNV density (indicative of recombination). SNVPhyl is able to correctly distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak isolates across a range of variant-calling settings, sequencing-coverage thresholds, or in the presence of contamination.\\n\\nAvailabilitySNVPhyl is available as a Galaxy workflow, Docker and virtual machine images, and a Unix-based command-line application.
