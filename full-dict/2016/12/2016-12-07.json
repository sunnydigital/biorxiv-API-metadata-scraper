    "abstract": "Characterizing inter-individual differences induced by clinical and social factors constitutes one of the most promising applications of neuroimaging. Paving the way for such applications, neuroimaging studies often report between-group differences in \\\"activations\\\" or correlations between such \\\"activations\\\" and individual traits. Here we raise cautionary warnings about some of those inter-individual analytic strategies. These warnings become critical when measures of \\\"activations\\\" are unstandardized coefficients of regressions between BOLD signal and individual behavior.\\n\\nFirst, using simple algebraic derivations, we show how inter-individual differences results can spuriously arise from neglecting the statistical relationships which link the ranges of individual BOLD activation and of recorded behavior. We also demonstrate how apparently contradictory results and interpretations may simply arise from the interaction of this scaling issue and the pre-processing of the behavioral variables. Second, using computational simulations, we illustrate how this issue percolates the booming field of model-based fMRI. Finally, we outline a set of recommendations, which might prove useful for researcher and reviewers confronted with questions involving inter-individual differences in neuroimaging.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCharacterizing inter-individual differences induced by clinical and societal factors constitutes one of the most promising applications of neuroimaging. Paving the way for such applications, an increasing fraction of neuroimaging studies reports between-group differences in \\\"activations\\\" or correlations between \\\"activations\\\" and individual traits. In this manuscript, we focus on the typical analytical strategies employed in studies investigating how differences in behavior between individuals or groups of individuals are translated to differences of activations in specific brain regions. We notably question whether they are suitable to support inferences and claims about the neural underpinnings of differential cognition. Our core results demonstrate that typical inter-individual results can spuriously arise by overlooking plausible statistical relationships that link the ranges of individual BOLD activation with the ranges of produced behavior. We argue that these results challenge current classical interpretations of inter-individual results. Highlighting the methodological and theoretical gaps regarding the analysis and interpretation of inter-individual differences is fundamental to fulfilling the promises of neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Images of iconic buildings, such as the CN Tower, instantly transport us to specific places, such as Toronto. Despite the substantial impact of architectural design on peoples visual experience of built environments, we know little about its neural representation in the human brain. In the present study, we have found patterns of neural activity associated with specific architectural styles in several high-level visual brain regions, but not in primary visual cortex (V1). This finding suggests that the neural correlates of the visual perception of architectural styles stem from style-specific complex visual structure beyond the simple features computed in V1. Surprisingly, the network of brain regions representing architectural styles included the fusiform face area (FFA) in addition to several scene-selective regions. Hierarchical clustering of error patterns further revealed that the FFA participated to a much larger extent in the neural encoding of architectural styles than entry-level scene categories. We conclude that the FFA is involved in fine-grained neural encoding of scenes at a subordinate-level, in our case, architectural styles of buildings. This study for the first time shows how the human visual system encodes visual aspects of architecture, one of the predominant and longest-lasting artefacts of human culture.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of systems neuroscience is to develop accurate quantitative models of how neural circuits process information. Prevalent models of light response in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) usually begin with linear filtering over space and time, which reduces the high-dimensional visual stimulus to a simpler and more tractable scalar function of time that in turn determines the model output. Although these pseudo-linear models can accurately replicate RGC responses to stochastic stimuli, it is unclear whether the strong linearity assumption captures the function of the retina in the natural environment. This paper tests how accurately one pseudo-linear model, the generalized linear model (GLM), explains the responses of primate RGCs to naturalistic visual stimuli. Light responses from macaque RGCs were obtained using large-scale multi-electrode recordings, and two major cell types, ON and OFF parasol, were examined. Visual stimuli consisted of images of natural environments with simulated saccadic and fixational eye movements. The GLM accurately reproduced RGC responses to white noise stimuli, as observed previously, but did not generalize to predict RGC responses to naturalistic stimuli. It also failed to capture RGC responses when fitted and tested with naturalistic stimuli alone. Fitted scalar nonlinearities before and after the linear filtering stage were insufficient to correct the failures. These findings suggest that retinal signaling under natural conditions cannot be captured by models that begin with linear filtering, and emphasize the importance of additional spatial nonlinearities, gain control, and/or peripheral effects in the first stage of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Life originated in Archaean oceans, almost 4 billion years ago, in the absence of oxygen and the presence of high dissolved iron concentrations. Early Earth oxidation is marked globally by extensive banded iron formations but the contributing processes and timing remain controversial. Very few aquatic habitats have been discovered that match key physico-chemical parameters of the early Archaean Ocean. All previous whole ecosystem Archaean analogue studies have been confined to rare, low sulfur, and permanently stratified lakes. Here we provide first evidence that millions of Boreal Shield lakes with natural anoxia offer the opportunity to constrain biogeochemical and microbiological aspects of early Archaean life. Specifically, we combined novel isotopic signatures and nucleic acid sequence data to examine processes in the anoxic zone of stratified boreal lakes that are naturally low in sulfur and rich in ferrous iron, hallmark characteristics predicted for the Archaean Ocean. Anoxygenic photosynthesis was prominent in total water column biogeochemistry, marked by distinctive patterns in natural abundance isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and iron. These processes are robust, returning reproducibly after water column re-oxygenation following lake turnover. Evidence of coupled iron oxidation, iron reduction, and methane oxidation affect current paradigms of both early Earth and modern aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system utilizes multiple mechanisms linked to innate immune cell functions to respond appropriately to pathogens and commensals. Here we discover further aspects of this connectivity by demonstrating that naive T cells as they emerge from the thymus (recent thymic emigrants, RTEs) express complement receptors (CR1 and CR2), the bacterial pathogen recognition receptor TLR1 and an enzyme that deactivates bacterial lipopolysaccharide (AOAH) and following activation secrete the anti-microbial cytokine IL-8. CR2+ naive T cells also express a selection of genes associated with tissue migration, consistent with the hypothesis that following emigration from the thymus RTEs seed peripheral compartments where some pursue their anti-microbial potential by becoming IL-8-producing CR2+ memory cells while others undergo homeostatic expansion. CR2+ naive and memory cells are abundant in children but decrease with age, coinciding with the involution of the thymus. The ability of CR2, which is also a receptor for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), to identify recent thymic emigrants will facilitate assessment of thymic function during aging and aid investigations of multiple clinical areas including the occurrence of T cell lymphomas caused by EBV.",

DC (a.k.a. global functional connectivity density) is calculated as the number of connections a region has with the rest of the brain (binary DC), or the sum of weights for those connections (weighted DC). lFCD was developed to be a surrogate measure of DC that is faster to calculate by restricting its computation to regions that are spatially adjacent. Although both of these measures are popular for investigating inter-individual variation in brain connectivity, efficient neuroimaging tools for computing them are scarce. The goal of this Brainhack project was to contribute optimized implementations of these algorithms to the widely used, open source, AFNI software package.",

We developed MetacodeR, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and plotting hierarchical data. To accomplish this, MetacodeR provides a function to parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon IDs, or sequence IDs. This parsed data can then be subset, sampled, and ordered using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function allows for the quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to color and size of tree nodes and edges. MetacodeR also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR. MetacodeR has been designed for data from metabarcoding research, but can easily be applied to any data that has a hierarchical component such as gene ontology, gene expression data, or geographic location data. Our package complements currently available tools for community analysis and is provided open source with extensive online user manuals.",

    "abstract": "The use of homing-based gene drive systems to modify or suppress wild populations of a given species has been proposed as a solution to a number of significant ecological and public health related problems, including the control of mosquito-borne diseases. The recent development of a CRISPR-Cas9-based homing system for the suppression of Anopheles gambiae, the main African malaria vector, is encouraging for this approach; however, with current designs, the slow emergence of homing-resistant alleles is expected to result in suppressed populations rapidly rebounding, as homing-resistant alleles have a significant fitness advantage over functional, population-suppressing homing alleles. To explore this concern, we develop a mathematical model to estimate tolerable rates of homing-resistant allele generation to suppress a wild population of a given size. Our results suggest that, to achieve meaningful population suppression, tolerable rates of resistance allele generation are orders of magnitude smaller than those observed for current designs for CRISPR-Cas9-based homing systems. To remedy this, we propose a homing system architecture in which guide RNAs (gRNAs) are multiplexed, increasing the effective homing rate and decreasing the effective resistant allele generation rate. Modeling results suggest that the size of the population that can be suppressed increases exponentially with the number of multiplexed gRNAs and that, with six multiplexed gRNAs, a mosquito species could potentially be suppressed on a continental scale. We also demonstrate successful multiplexing in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster using a ribozyme-gRNA-ribozyme (RGR) approach - a strategy that could readily be adapted to engineer stable, homing-based suppression drives in relevant organisms.",

    "abstract": "The past two decades have brought many important advances in our understanding of the hereditary susceptibility to cancer. Numerous studies have provided convincing evidence that identification of germline mutations associated with hereditary cancer syndromes can lead to reductions in morbidity and mortality through targeted risk management options. Additionally, advances in gene sequencing technology now permit the development of multigene hereditary cancer testing panels. Here, we describe the 2016 revision of the Counsyl Inherited Cancer Screen for detecting single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels), and copy number variants (CNVs) in 36 genes associated with an elevated risk for breast, ovarian, colorectal, gastric, endometrial, pancreatic, thyroid, prostate, melanoma, and neuroendocrine cancers. To determine test accuracy and reproducibility, we performed a rigorous analytical validation across 341 samples, including 118 cell lines and 223 patient samples. The screen achieved 100% test sensitivity across different mutation types, with high specificity and 100% concordance with conventional Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). We also demonstrated the screens high intra-run and inter-run reproducibility and robust performance on blood and saliva specimens. Furthermore, we showed that pathogenic Alu element insertions can be accurately detected by our test. Overall, the validation in our clinical laboratory demonstrated the analytical performance required for collecting and reporting genetic information related to risk of developing hereditary cancers.",

We have adapted a fast, orthogonal promoter system with a large dynamic range and a linear dose response, based on {beta}-estradiol-regulated function of the human estrogen receptor, for use in S. pombe. We show that this promoter system, termed Z3EV, turns on quickly, can reach a maximal induction of 20 fold, and exhibits a linear dose response over its entire induction range, with few off target effects. We demonstrate the utility of this system by regulating the mitotic inhibitor Wee1 to create a strain in which cell size is regulated by {beta}-estradiol concentration.

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is the largest single cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial community which protects from C. difficile colonization. Multiple antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility; many leading to distinct community structures stemming from variation in bacterial targets of action. These community structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difficile. Therefore we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments. Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated C. difficile highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difficile spore formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C. difficile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C. difficile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C. difficile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm integrating network architecture. This platform identified nutrients C. difficile used preferentially between pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the hypothesis that C. difficile inhabits alternative nutrient niches across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for nitrogen-containing carbon sources, particularly Stickland fermentation substrates and host-derived glycans.\\n\\nImportanceInfection by the bacterium Clostridium difficile causes an inflammatory diarrheal disease which can become life-threatening, and has grown to be the most prevalent nosocomial infection. Susceptibility to C. difficile infection is strongly associated with previous antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the gut microbiota and reduces its ability to prevent colonization. In this study we demonstrated that C. difficile altered pathogenesis between hosts pretreated with antibiotics from separate classes, and exploited different nutrient sources across these environments. Our metabolite score calculation also provides a platform to study nutrient requirements of pathogens during an infection. Our results suggest that C. difficile colonization resistance is mediated by multiple groups of bacteria competing for several subsets of nutrients and could explain why total reintroduction of competitors through fecal microbial transplant currently is the most effective treatment for recurrent CDI. This work could ultimately contribute to the identification of targeted, context-dependent measures that prevent or reduce C. difficile colonization including pre- and probiotic therapies.",

We have identified and characterized properties of regions bound by Hoxa1 on a genome-wide basis in differentiating mouse ES cells. Hoxa1 bound regions are enriched for clusters of consensus binding motifs for Hox, Pbx and Meis and many display co-occupancy of Pbx and Meis. Pbx and Meis are members of the TALE family and genome-wide analysis of multiple TALE members (Pbx, Meis, TGIF, Prep1 and Prep2) show that nearly all Hoxa1 targets display occupancy of one or more TALE members. The combinatorial binding patterns of TALE proteins defines distinct classes of Hoxa1 targets and indicates a role as cofactors in modulating the specificity of Hox proteins. We also discovered extensive auto- and cross-regulatory interactions among the Hoxa1 and TALE genes. This study provides new insight into a regulatory network involving combinatorial interactions between Hoxa1 and TALE proteins.",

    "abstract": "Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) generates a highly divergent pool of alleles even within species that have dispersed and expanded in size. On top of that codon position bias plays a relative role in prompting population wide sequence based variations. Codon positions are immensely studied as independent evolutionary genetic markers, however co-evolution of codon positions are still largely unexplored. Using 18,411 genome samples, we analyze nucleotide co-occurrences over mitochondrial DNA of human sub-populations covering most of the mtDNA diversity on the earth. Our codon based network motif investigation reveals that codon position is one of the critical factor to form higher order motifs. It is interesting to report a different evolution of Asian genomes than those of the rest which is divulged by motifs in non-coding regions. Most notably, we demonstrate that there are preferences of codon position co-evolution with respect to codon position sensitivity implying the selective role of evolutionary processes on fundamental formation of genetic code in terms of codon bias evolution. These network based findings not only recapitulates the established facts regarding the importance of each codon position in providing codon bias but also highlight their preferential role in resulting correlated mutations. Moreover, codon based nucleotide co-occurrence provides framework to investigate important evolutionary insights into human mitochondrial evolutionary genomics.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification can map different cognitive states to the brain tasks. One of the main challenges in MVP analysis is validating the generated results across subjects. However, analyzing multi-subject fMRI data requires accurate functional alignments between neuronal activities of different subjects, which can rapidly increase the performance and robustness of the final results. Hyperalignment (HA) is one of the most effective functional alignment methods, which can be mathematically formulated by the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods. Since HA mostly uses the unsupervised CCA techniques, its solution may not be optimized for MVP analysis. By incorporating the idea of Local Discriminant Analysis (LDA) into CCA, this paper proposes Local Discriminant Hyperalignment (LDHA) as a novel supervised HA method, which can provide better functional alignment for MVP analysis. Indeed, the locality is defined based on the stimuli categories in the train-set, where the correlation between all stimuli in the same category will be maximized and the correlation between distinct categories of stimuli approaches to near zero. Experimental studies on multi-subject MVP analysis confirm that the LDHA method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms.",

    "abstract": "A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine learning is whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain. Multi-Voxels Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this question. However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which include decreasing sparsity and noises in the extracted features and increasing the performance of prediction. In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper proposes Anatomical Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain. This framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction method and a new imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification. Further, it utilizes an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for multi-class prediction. APA can automatically detect active regions for each category of the visual stimuli. Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous datasets for applying advanced classification. Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundComputational biology provides widely used and powerful software tools for testing and making inferences about biological data. In the face of rapidly increasing volumes of data, heuristic methods that trade software speed for accuracy may be employed. We are have studied these trade-offs using the results of a large number of independent software benchmarks, and evaluated whether external factors are indicative of accurate software.\n\nMethodWe have extracted accuracy and speed ranks from independent benchmarks of different bioinformatic software tools, and evaluated whether the speed, author reputation, journal impact, recency and developer efforts are indicative of accuracy.\n\nResultsWe found that software speed, author reputation, journal impact, number of citations and age are all unreliable predictors of software accuracy. This is unfortunate because citations, author and journal reputation are frequently cited reasons for selecting software tools. However, GitHub-derived records and high version numbers show that the accurate bioinformatic software tools are generally the product of many improvements over time, often from multiple developers.\n\nDiscussionWe also find that the field of bioinformatics has a large excess of slow and inaccurate software tools, and this is consistent across many sub-disciplines. Meanwhile, there are few tools that are middle-of-road in terms of accuracy and speed trade-offs. We hypothesise that a form of publication-bias influences the publication and development of bioinformatic software. In other words, software that is intermediate in terms of both speed and accuracy may be difficult to publish - possibly due to author, editor and reviewer practices. This leaves an unfortunate hole in the literature as the ideal tools may fall into this gap. For example, high accuracy tools are not always useful if years of CPU time are required, while high speed is not useful if the results are also inaccurate.",

    "abstract": "The degree to which germline variation drives cancer development and shapes tumor phenotypes remains largely unexplored, possibly due to a lack of large scale publicly available germline data for a cancer cohort. Here we called germline variants on 9,618 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database representing 31 cancer types. We identified batch effects affecting loss of function (LOF) variant calls that can be traced back to differences in the way the sequence data were generated both within and across cancer types. Overall, LOF indel calls were more sensitive to technical artifacts than LOF Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) calls. In particular, whole genome amplification of DNA prior to sequencing led to an artificially increased burden of LOF indel calls, which confounded association analyses relating germline variants to tumor type despite stringent indel filtering strategies. Due to the inherent noise we chose to remove all 614 amplified DNA samples, including all acute myeloid leukemia and virtually all ovarian cancer samples, from the final dataset. This study demonstrates how insufficient quality control can lead to false positive germlinetumor type associations and draws attention to the need to be sensitive to problems associated with a lack of uniformity in data generation in TCGA data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCancer research to date has largely focused on genetic aberrations specific to tumor tissue. In contrast, the degree to which germline, or inherited, variation contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear, possibly due to a lack of accessible germline variant data. In this study we identify germline variants in 9,618 samples using raw germline exome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). There are substantial differences in the way exome sequence data was generated both across and within cancer types in TCGA. We observe that differences in sequence data generation introduced batch effects, or variation that is due to technical factors not true biological variation, in our variant data. Most notably, we observe that amplification of DNA prior to sequencing resulted in an excess of predicted damaging indel variants. We show how these batch effects can confound germline association analyses if not properly addressed. Our study highlights the difficulties of working with large public genomic datasets like TCGA where samples are collected over time and across data centers, and particularly cautions the use of amplified DNA samples for genetic association analyses.",

The history of the Sardinian population has also been the focus of much research, and in recent ancient DNA (aDNA) studies, Sardinia has provided unique insight into the peopling of Europe and the spread of agriculture. In this study, we analyze whole-genome sequences of 3,514 Sardinians to address hypotheses regarding the founding of Sardinia and its relation to the peopling of Europe, including examining fine-scale substructure, population size history, and signals of admixture. We find the population of the mountainous Gennargentu region shows elevated genetic isolation with higher levels of ancestry associated with mainland Neolithic farmers and depleted ancestry associated with more recent Bronze Age Steppe migrations on the mainland. Notably, the Gennargentu region also has elevated levels of pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry and increased affinity to Basque populations. Further, allele sharing with pre-Neolithic and Neolithic mainland populations is larger on the X chromosome compared to the autosome, providing evidence for a sex-biased demographic history in Sardinia. These results give new insight to the demography of ancestral Sardinians and help further the understanding of sharing of disease risk alleles between Sardinia and mainland populations.",

An important challenge is to identify how this Ras/ERK pathway alters cellular metabolism to drive growth. Here we report on stimulation of RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-mediated tRNA synthesis as a growth effector of Ras/ERK signalling in Drosophila. We find that activation of Ras/ERK signalling promotes tRNA synthesis both in vivo and in cultured Drosophila S2 cells. We also show that Pol III function is required for Ras/ERK signalling to drive proliferation in both epithelial and stem cells in Drosophila tissues. We find that the transcription factor Myc is required but not sufficient for Ras-mediated stimulation of tRNA synthesis. Instead we show that the main way that Ras promotes Pol III function and tRNA synthesis is by inhibiting the nuclear localization and function of the Pol III repressor Maf1. We propose that inhibition of Maf1 and stimulation of tRNA synthesis is one way by which Ras signalling enhances protein synthesis to promote cell and tissue growth.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPerceiving social intent throughvocal intonation is impaired in schizophrenia; thisdysprosodia partly arisingfrom impaired pitch perception.Individuals with amusia (tone-deafness) are insensitive to pitch change andalso demonstrate prosody deficits. Sensitivity to rhythm is reduced in amusia when tonal sequences contain pitch changes (polytonic), but is normal for monotonic sequences, suggesting perceptual impairment originates at a secondary processing stage where pitch- and time-relatedcues are yoked. Here, we sought to ascertain: 1) whether schizophreniapatients demonstrate rhythmic deficits, 2) whether suchdeficits are restricted to polytonic sequences, and 3) how pitch and rhythm perception relate to prosodic processing.\\n\\nMethodsSeventy-sixparticipants (33 schizophrenia) completed tasks assessing pitch and prosody perception, as well as monotonic and polytonic rhythmic perception.\\n\\nResultsIncreasing tone-deafness correlated with pitch-dependent rhythm detection impairments. Pitch and prosody correlated across all participants. Schizophreniapatients displayed basic time and pitch deficits. Correlations and path analyses indicated prosodic processing is an associatedfunction of pitch and pitch-dependent rhythm perception,with pure temporal processing playing an indirect role.In schizophrenia, deficits in monotonic and polytonic rhythmic perception did not contribute to prosodic processing dysfunction, and montonic rhythmic dysfunction and pitch perception did not covary.\\n\\nConclusionsExploring similarities between amusia and schizophrenia focused our characterization of prosodic processing as the function of sub-processes reflecting pitch and time perception,whichare prerequisite for prosodic processing. The uniqueness of dysprosodia in schizophrenia relative to other illnesses may be measured by idiosyncrasy in the pattern and magnitude of the sub-process task relationships.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Humans are social creatures, with desires to connect or belong, producing loneliness when isolated. Individuals with schizophrenia are often more isolated than healthy adults and demonstrate profound social communication impairments such as vocal affect perception (prosody). Loneliness, levels of desire for social connectedness (need to belong, NTB), and their relationship to perception of social communications have not been investigated in schizophrenia.\\n\\nMethod: In a sample of 69 individuals (36 SZ), we measured endorsements of loneliness and NTB, and evaluated their putative relationships to clinical symptoms and social communication abilities, as indexed by emotional prosody and pitch perception.\\n\\nResults: Loneliness endorsement was highly variable but particularly so in patients, whilst patients endorsed NTB at levels equivalent to healthy controls. In schizophrenia, pitch and prosody acuity were reduced, and prosody perception correlated with NTB. Loneliness, but not desire for social connectedness, correlated with negative symptoms.\\n\\nConclusion: Loneliness and negative symptoms likely exert bidirectional effects on each other. Loneliness and desire to form interpersonal attachments may be pivotal in shaping and stimulating social interactions and, subsequently, the ability to perceive social intent through prosody. Intact NTB levels in patients augurs well for cognitive remediation which, target vocal-communication processing to improve social skills.\\n\\nSignificant OutcomesO_LIPatients with schizophrenia endorsed higher levels of loneliness than controls, but ratings of desire for social connectedness were at normal levels.\\nC_LIO_LIPitch acuity and prosody perception were correlated, confirming the importance of basic sensory processing in recognizing prosodic emotions.\\nC_LIO_LISocio-cognitive perceptual ability (emotional prosody perception) correlated with increased desire for social connections, implying that they may still be motivated to find social interactions reinforcing.

We found that white light guides C. elegans foraging decisions away from harmful bacteria that secrete a blue pigment toxin. Absorption of amber light by this blue pigment toxin alters the color of light sensed by the worm, and thereby triggers an increase in avoidance. By combining narrow-band blue and amber light sources, we demonstrated that detection of the specific blue:amber ratio by the worm guides its foraging decision. These behavioral and psychophysical studies thus establish the existence of a color detection system that is distinct from those of other animals.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use is observationally associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia, however whether the relationship is causal is not known. To determine the nature of the association between cannabis use on risk of schizophrenia using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, we used ten genetic variants previously identified to associate with cannabis use in 32,330 individuals. Genetic variants were used in a MR analyses of the association of genetically determined cannabis on risk of schizophrenia in 34,241 cases and 45,604 controls from predominantly European descent. Estimates from MR were compared to a metaanalysis of observational studies reporting effect estimates for ever use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia or related disorders. Genetically determined use of cannabis was associated with increased risk of schizophrenia (OR of schizophrenia for users vs. non-users of cannabis: 1.37; 95%CI, 1.09 to 1.67; P-value=0.007). The corresponding estimate from observational analysis was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.10 to 2.00; P-value for heterogeneity = 0.88). The genetic instrument did not show evidence of pleiotropy on MR-Egger (Egger test, P-value=0.292) nor on multivariable MR accounting for tobacco exposure (OR of schizophrenia for users vs. nonusers of cannabis, adjusted for ever vs. never smoker: 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.83). Furthermore, the causal estimate remained robust to sensitivity analyses. These findings strongly support a causal association between genetically determined use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia. Such robust evidence may inform public health message about the risks of cannabis use, especially regarding its potential mental health consequences.",

    "abstract": "Parasites can be a major cause of natural selection on hosts, which consequently evolve a variety of strategies to avoid, eliminate, or tolerate infection. When ecologically similar host populations present disparate infection loads, this natural variation can reveal immunological strategies underlying adaptation to infection and population divergence. For instance, the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus persistently infects between 0% to 80% of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in lakes on Vancouver Island. To test whether these heterogeneous infection rates are due to evolved differences in immunity, we experimentally exposed lab-reared fish from high-and low-infection populations, which are not known to differ in natural exposure risk, to controlled doses of Schistocephalus. We observed heritable between-population differences in several immune traits: fish from the naturally uninfected population initiated a stronger granulocyte response to Schistocephalus infection, and their granulocytes constitutively generated threefold more reactive oxygen species (ROS). Despite these immunological differences, Schistocephalus was equally successful at establishing initial infections in both host populations. However, the low-infection fish dramatically suppressed tapeworm growth relative to high-infection fish, and parasite size was intermediate in F1 hybrid hosts. Our results show that stickleback recently evolved heritable variation in their capacity to suppress helminth growth. Comparative data from many from natural populations indicate that growth suppression is widespread but not universal and, when present, is associated with reduced infection prevalence. Host suppression of helminth somatic growth may be an important immune strategy that aids in parasite clearance, or in mitigating the fitness costs of persistent infection.\\n\\nSignificanceLarge parasites remain a persistent source of morbidity and mortality in humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife. Hosts are subject to strong natural selection to eliminate or tolerate these parasite infections. Here, we document the recent evolution of a striking form of resistance by a vertebrate host (threespine stickleback) against its cestode parasite (Schistocephalus solidus). After Pleistocene glacial retreat, marine stickleback colonized freshwater lakes, encountered Schistocephalus, and evolved varying levels of resistance to it. We show that a heavily-and a rarely-infected population of stickleback have similar resistance to Schistocephalus colonization, but rarely-infected fish suppress parasite growth by orders of magnitude. These populations represent ends of a natural continuum of cestode growth suppression, which is associated with reduced infection prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acute clinical stroke trials are challenging to communicate to patients and families considering participation. Response adaptive randomization (RAR) is a technique that alters the proportion of trial subjects receiving active treatment, based on the outcomes of previous subjects. We aimed to determine how well interactive videos would improve understanding of a simulated acute stroke trial scenario that incorporated a design with RAR. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of emergency department patients who were without stroke, altered mental status, or critical illness. Subjects viewed a hypothetical stroke and clinical trial scenario. They were randomized into one of four groups with either an RAR or fixed randomization clinical trial design and with either a standard consent video, or an interactive video. Results: We enrolled 720 participants. In the RAR group with interactive video, 128 out of 149 (85.9%) of the subjects were able to correctly identify the allocation method, compared to the 172 out of 285 (61.6%) in the RAR group with the uninterrupted video for an absolute increase of 25.6% (95% CI 17,33%). The RAR group with interactive video had a higher odds of correct identification of allocation method (O.R. 2.767, 95% CI [1.011,7.570] while controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, education, self-reported understanding of protocol, stroke awareness and agreement to participate in trial. Conclusions: The interactive video increased participant understanding of an RAR design in a simulated stroke scenario. Future research should focus on whether acute trial recruitment can be enhanced using similar techniques.",

    "abstract": "Organ size and pattern results from the integration of two positional information systems. One global, encoded by the Hox genes, links organ type with position along the main body axis. Within specific organs, local information is conveyed by signaling molecules that regulate organ growth and pattern. The mesothoracic (T2) wing and the metathoracic (T3) haltere of Drosophila represent a paradigmatic example of this coordination. The Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), expressed in the developing T3, selects haltere identity by, among other processes, modulating the production and signaling efficiency of Dpp, a BMP2-like molecule that acts as a major regulator of size and pattern. Still, the mechanisms of the Hox-signal integration even in this well-studied system, are incomplete. Here we have investigated this issue by studying the expression and function of the Six3 transcription factor optix during the development of the Drosophila wing and haltere development. We find that in both organs Dpp defines the expression domain of optix through repression, and that the specific position of this domain in wing and haltere seems to reflect the differential signaling profile among these organs. We show that optix expression in wing and haltere primordia is conserved beyond Drosophila in other higher diptera. Despite the similar expression pattern, optix plays different roles in wing and haltere. In the wing, optix is required for the growth of the most anterior/proximal region (the \\\"marginal cell\\\") and for the correct formation of sensory structures along the proximal anterior wing margin. In contrast, in the haltere optix is necessary for the suppression of sensory bristles without any noticeable effect on organ growth. Therefore, optix shows an organ-specific function. Beyond dipterans, optix expression in the anterior wing has been shown also in butterflies. We propose that the ancestral role of optix might have been structural in the anterior wing. Once expressed in the wing, optix expression had been re-deployed for wing spot formation in other parts of the wing of Heliconius butterflies.",

    "abstract": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a viral hemorrhagic fever with a high case-fatality rate in humans. EVD is caused by four members of the filoviral genus Ebolavirus, with Ebola virus (EBOV) being the most notorious one. Although bats are discussed as potential ebolavirus reservoirs, limited data actually support this hypothesis. Glycoprotein 2 (GP2) of reptarenaviruses, known to infect only boa constrictors and pythons, are similar in sequence and structure to ebolaviral glycoprotein 2 (GP2), suggesting that EBOV may be able to infect snake cells. We therefore serially passaged EBOV and a distantly related filovirus, Marburg virus (MARV), in the boa constrictor kidney cell line, JK, and characterized viral growth and mutational frequency by sequencing. We observed that EBOV efficiently infected and replicated in JK cells, but MARV did not. In contrast to most cell lines, EBOV infected JK cells did not result in obvious cytopathic effect (CPE). Genomic characterization of serial-passaged EBOV in JK cells revealed that genomic adaptation was not required for infection. Deep sequencing coverage (>10,000x) demonstrated the existence of only a single non-synonymous variant (EBOV glycoprotein precursor preGP T544I) of unknown significance within the viral population that exhibited a shift in frequency of at least 10% over six passages. Our data suggest that boid snake derived cells are competent for filovirus infection without appreciable genomic adaptation; that cellular filovirus infection without CPE may be more common than currently appreciated; and that there may be significant differences between the natural host spectra of ebolaviruses and marburgviruses.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEEbola virus (EBOV) causes a high case-fatality form of viral hemorrhagic fever. The natural reservoir of EBOV remains unknown. EBOV is distantly related to Marburg virus (MARV), which has been found in bats in the wild. The glycoprotein of a reptarenavirus known to infect boid snakes (pythons and boas) shows similarity in sequence and structure to these viruses, suggesting that EBOV and MARV may be able to infect and replicate in snake cells. We demonstrate that JK, a boa constrictor cell line, does not support MARV infection, but does support EBOV infection without causing overt cytopathic effect or the need for appreciable adaptation. These findings suggest different filoviruses may have a more diverse natural host spectra than previously thought.",

The data presented are drawn from a total of 29 publications including human cadaver studies, in vivo imaging studies of live humans, musculoskeletal modeling studies, and combinations of these methods. Where possible, parameter values were adjusted from the referenced data to present them with consistent definitions (normalization of measured fiber lengths to optimal sarcomere length, and calculation of PCSA as the ratio of fiber volume to fiber length). It is seen that within a specific muscle, optimal fiber lengths are fairly consistent between studies, pennation angles and PCSAs vary widely between studies, and data for unloaded tendon length are comparatively sparse. Few studies have reported fiber type fractions for a large number of muscles. Guidelines for implementing these parameter values in muscle modeling and musculoskeletal modeling are suggested.\\n\\nUpdate HistoryO_LIDecember 2, 2016: original submission\\nC_LIO_LIDecember 3, 2016: discussion on maximum isometric force and specific tension added\\nC_LIO_LIDecember 6, 2016: minor edits for typos, clarity, and missing references\\nC_LIO_LIDecember 7, 2016: Tirrell et al.

    "abstract": "The interpretation of genetic variants identified during clinical sequencing has come to rely heavily on reference population databases such as the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Genuinely pathogenic variants, particularly in genes associated with severe autosomal dominant conditions, are assumed to be absent or extremely rare in these databases. Clinical exome sequencing of a six-year-old female patient with seizures, global developmental delay, dysmorphic features and failure to thrive identified an ASXL1 variant that was previously reported as causative of Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS). Surprisingly, the variant was observed seven times in the ExAC database, presumably in individuals without BOS. Although the BOS phenotype matched the presentation of the patient, the presence of the variant in reference population databases introduced ambiguity in result interpretation. Interrogation of the literature revealed that acquired somatic mosaicism of ASXL1 variants (including known pathogenic variants) during hematopoietic clonal expansion may be concomitant with aging in healthy individuals. We examined all high quality ASXL1 predicted truncating variant calls in the ExAC database and determined the majority could be attributed to this phenomenon. Failure to consider somatic mosaicism may lead to the inaccurate assumption that conditions like Bohring-Opitz syndrome have reduced penetrance, or the misclassification of potentially pathogenic variants.",

    "abstract": "In plants, miR390 directs the production of tasiRNAs from TRANS-ACTING SIRNA 3 (TAS3) transcripts to regulate AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTOR (ARF) genes, transcription factors critical for auxin signaling; these tasiRNAs are known as tasiARFs. This pathway is highly conserved, with the TAS3 as the only one noncoding gene present almost ubiquitously in land plants. To understand the evolution of this miR390-TAS3-ARF pathway, we characterized homologs of these three genes from thousands of plant species, from bryophytes to angiosperms. Both miR390 and TAS3 are present and functional in liverworts, confirming their ancestral role to regulate ARFs in land plants. We found the lower-stem region of MIR390 genes, critical for accurate DCL1 (DICER-LIKE 1) processing, is conserved in sequence in seed plants. We propose a model for the transition of functional tasiRNA sequences in TAS3 genes occurred at the emergence of vascular plants, in which the two miR390 target sites of TAS3 genes showed distinct pairing patterns in different plant lineages. Based on the cleavability of miR390 target sites and the distance between target site and tasiARF we inferred a potential bidirectional processing mechanism exists for some TAS3 genes. We also demonstrated a tight mutual selection between tasiARF and its target genes, and characterized unusual aspects and diversity of regulatory components of this pathway. Taken together, these data illuminate the evolutionary path of the miR390-TAS3-ARF pathway in land plants, and demonstrate the significant variation that occurs in the production of phasiRNAs in plants, even in the functionally important and archetypal miR390-TAS3-ARF regulatory circuit.",
