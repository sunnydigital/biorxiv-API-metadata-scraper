    "abstract": "BackgroundOncology drugs are only effective in a small proportion of cancer patients. Our current ability to identify these responsive patients before treatment is still poor in most cases. Thus, there is a pressing need to discover response markers for marketed and research oncology drugs in order to improve patient survival, reduce healthcare costs and enhance success rates in clinical trials. Screening these drugs against a large panel of cancer cell lines has been employed to discover new genomic markers of in vitro drug response, which can now be further evaluated on more accurate tumour models. However, while the identification of discriminative markers among thousands of candidate drug-gene associations in the data is error-prone, an appraisal of the effectiveness of such detection task is currently lacking.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a new non-parametric method to measuring the discriminative power of a drug-gene association. This is enabled by the identification of an auxiliary threshold posing this task as a binary classification problem. Unlike parametric statistical tests, the adopted non-parametric test has the advantage of not making strong assumptions about the data distorting the identification of genomic markers. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark to further validate these markers in vitro using more recent data not used to identify the markers. The application of this new methodology has led to the identification of 128 new genomic markers distributed across 61% of the analysed drugs, including 5 drugs without previously known markers, which were missed by the MANOVA test initially applied to analyse data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer consortium.\\n\\nAbbreviation",

    "abstract": "Cells organize and regulate their metabolism via membrane-or protein-bound organelles. In this way, incompatible processes can be spatially separated and controlled. In prokaryotes, protein-based compartments are used to sequester harmful reactions and store useful compounds. These protein compartments play key roles in various metabolic and ecological processes ranging from iron homeostasis to carbon fixation. We identified more than 900 proteinaceous encapsulin nanocompartment systems in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Encapsulins can be found in 15 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla. Our analysis reveals 1 new capsid type and 9 previously unknown cargo proteins targeted to the interior of encapsulins. We experimentally characterize 3 newly identified encapsulin systems and illustrate their involvement in iron mineralization, oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, a process responsible for 30% of the N lost from the oceans. We propose that encapsulins represent a widespread strategy for toxic reaction sequestration in prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale analyses of cancer genomes are revealing patterns of mutations that suggest biologically significant ideas about many aspects of cancer, including carcinogenesis, classification, and preventive and therapeutic strategies. Among those patterns is \\\"mutual exclusivity\\\", a phenomenon observed when two or more mutations that are commonly observed in samples of a type of cancer are not found combined in individual tumors. We have been studying a striking example of mutual exclusivity: the absence of co-existing mutations in the KRAS and EGFR proto-oncogenes in human lung adenocarcinomas, despite the high individual frequencies of such mutations in this common type of cancer. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that toxic effects of the joint expression of KRAS and EGFR mutant oncogenes, rather than loss of any selective advantages conferred by a second oncogene that operates through the same signaling pathway, are responsible for the observed mutational pattern. We discuss the potential for understanding the physiological basis of such toxicity, for exploiting it therapeutically, and for extending the studies to other examples of mutual exclusivity.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs, including exosomes and microvesicles) are involved in intercellular communication in health and disease and affect processes including immune and antiviral responses. Ultracentrifuged serum is depleted of EVs and, when used in culture media, reduces growth and viability of some cell types. In this study, we examined the effects of serum EV depletion processes on HIV-1 replication in primary cells and cell lines, including two HIV-1 latency models. Increased HIV-1 production was observed in certain EV-depleted conditions, along with cell morphology changes and decreased cell viability. Add-back of ultracentrifuge pellets rescued baseline HIV-1 production. Primary cells appeared to be less sensitive to EV depletion. ACH-2 and U1 latency models produced more HIV-1 under EV-depleted conditions, while virus produced under processed serum conditions was more infectious. Finally, changes in cellular metabolism and gene expression were associated with EV-depleted culture. In conclusion, the EV environment of HIV-1 infected cells has a substantial effect on virus production and infectivity. EV-dependence of cell cultures should be examined carefully along with other experimental variables. However, EVs may not be the only particles depleted by ultracentrifugation or other processes. Effects of EVs may be accompanied by or confused with those of closely associated or physically similar particles.",

    "abstract": "In the present work we simulate the basic two-dimensional dynamics of swarming E. coli bacteria on the surface of a moderately soft agar plate. Individual bacteria are modelled by self-propelled ridged bodies (agents), which interact with each other only through inelastic collision and with the highly viscous environment through damping forces. The motion of single agents is modelled closely corresponding to the behaviour of swimming bacteria. The dynamics of the model were adjusted to reproduce the experimental measurements of swimming E. coli K-12. Accordingly, simulations with loosely packed agents ({rho}{approx}0) show typical run-and-tumble statistics. In contrast, simulations with densely packed agents ({rho}{approx}0.3-0.7) are dominated by interactions (collisions) between agents which lead to the emergence of swarming behaviour. In addition, we model the motion of single agents on the base of modified run-and-tumble dynamics, where the bacteria do not turn actively during the tumble. We show that simulations with densely packed modified agents lead as well the emergence of swarming behaviour, if rotational diffusion is considered.",

The AVM combines the Vertex Model for confluent epithelial tissues with active matter dynamics. This introduces a natural description of the cell motion and accounts for motion patterns observed on multiple scales. Furthermore, cell contacts are generated dynamically from positions of cell centres. This not only enables efficient numerical implementation, but provides a natural description of the T1 transition events responsible for local tissue rearrangements. The AVM also includes cell alignment, cell-specific mechanical properties, cell growth, division and apoptosis. In addition, the AVM introduces a flexible, dynamically changing boundary of the epithelial sheet allowing for studies of phenomena such as the fingering instability or wound healing. We illustrate these capabilities with a number of case studies.",

    "abstract": "Genomic integrity is critical for preservation of stem cell function and is, maintained through a robust DNA damage response (DDR) with systemized DNA DSB repair by either the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway or the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. To examine DDR during stem cell differentiation, human embryonic (hES) and induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells were exposed to DNA damaging agents and DNA damage signaling/repair measured. Differentiated cells displayed a higher frequency of residual DNA damage, chromosomal aberrations, cells with delayed {gamma}-H2AX foci disappearance and a reduced number of RAD51 foci. Factors impacting DNA DSB repair by HR formed reduced foci in differentiated cells. The reduction in repairosome foci formation after DNA damage was not due to changes in HR protein levels, which were unchanged by differentiation. Differentiated cells also displayed a higher frequency of stalled DNA replication forks and decreased firing of new replication origins from transient inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea treatment. In addition, we observed that differentiated cells exhibit a higher frequency of R-loops. A similar decline in DDR was observed as early stage mouse astrocytes differentiated into later stage astrocytes. Our studies thus suggest that DSB repair by homologous recombination is increasingly impaired during stem cell differentiation while the NHEJ pathway is minimally altered.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere are many steps in analyzing transcriptome data, from the acquisition of raw data to the selection of a subset of representative genes that explain a scientific hypothesis. The data produced may additionally be integrated with other biological databases, such as Protein-Protein Interactions and annotations. However, the results of these analyses remain fragmented, imposing difficulties, either for posterior inspection of results, or for meta-analysis by the incorporation of new related data. Integrating databases and tools into scientific workflows, orchestrating their execution, and managingthe resulting data and its respective metadata are challenging tasks. Running in-silico experiments to structure and compose the information as needed for analysis is a daunting task. Different programsmay need to be applied and different files are produced during the experiment cycle. In this context,the availability of a platform supporting experiment execution is paramount.\\n\\nResultsWe present GeNNet, an integrated transcriptome analysis platform that unifies scientific workflows with graph databases for selecting relevant genes according to the evaluated biological systems. GeNNet includes pre-loaded biological data, pre-processes raw microarray data and conducts a series of analyses including normalization, differential expression inference, clusterization and geneset enrichment analysis. To demonstrate the features of GeNNet, we performed case studies with data retrieved from GEO, particularly using a single-factor experiment. As a result, we obtained differentially expressed genes for which biological functions were analyzed. The results are integrated into GeNNet-DB, a database about genes, clusters, experiments and their properties and relationships.The resulting graph database is explored with queries that demonstrate the expressiveness of this data model for reasoning about gene regulatory networks.\\n\\nConclusionsGeNNet is the first platform to integrate the analytical process of transcriptome data with graph database. It provides a comprehensive set of tools that would otherwise be challenging for non-expert users to install and use. Developers as well can add new functionality to each component of GeNNet. The resulting data allows for testing previous hypotheses about an experiment as well as exploring new ones through the interactive graph database environment. It enables the analysis of different data on humans, rhesus, mice and rat coming from Affymetrix platforms.",

    "abstract": "Selected gene mutations are routinely used to guide the selection of cancer drugs for a given patient tumour. Large pharmacogenomic data sets were introduced to discover more of these single-gene markers of drug sensitivity. Very recently, machine learning regression has been used to investigate how well cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs is predicted depending on the type of molecular profile. The latter has revealed that gene expression data is the most predictive profile in the pan-cancer setting. However, no study to date has exploited GDSC data to systematically compare the performance of machine learning models based on multi-gene expression data against that of widely-used single-gene markers based on genomics data.\\n\\nHere we present this systematic comparison using Random Forest (RF) classifiers exploiting the expression levels of 13,321 genes and an average of 501 tested cell lines per drug. To account for time-dependent batch effects in IC50 measurements, we employ independent test sets generated with more recent GDSC data than that used to train the predictors and show that this is a more realistic validation than K-fold cross-validation. Across 127 GDSC drugs, our results show that the single-gene markers unveiled by the MANOVA analysis tend to achieve higher precision than these RF-based multi-gene models, at the cost of generally having a poor recall (i.e. correctly detecting only a small part of the cell lines sensitive to the drug). Regarding overall classification performance, about two thirds of the drugs are better predicted by multi-gene RF classifiers. Among the drugs with the most predictive of these models, we found pyrimethamine, sunitinib and 17-AAG.",

    "abstract": "Mutations provide the raw material of evolution, and thus our ability to study evolution depends fundamentally on whether we have precise measurements of mutational rates and patterns. Here we explore the rates and patterns of mutations using i) de novo mutations from Drosophila melanogaster mutation accumulation lines and ii) polymorphisms segregating at extremely low frequencies. The first, mutation accumulation (MA) lines, are the product of maintaining flies in tiny populations for many generations, therefore rendering natural selection ineffective and allowing new mutations to accrue in the genome. In addition to generating a novel dataset of sequenced MA lines, we perform a meta-analysis of all published MA studies in D. melanogaster, which allows more precise estimates of mutational patterns across the genome. In the second half of this work, we identify polymorphisms segregating at extremely low frequencies using several publicly available population genomic data sets from natural populations of D. melanogaster. Extremely rare polymorphisms are difficult to detect with high confidence due to the problem of distinguishing them from sequencing error, however a dataset of true rare polymorphisms would allow the quantification of mutational patterns. This is due to the fact that rare polymorphisms, much like de novo mutations, are on average younger and also relatively unaffected by the filter of natural selection. We identify a high quality set of ~70,000 rare polymorphisms, fully validated with resequencing, and use this dataset to measure mutational patterns in the genome. This includes identifying a high rate of multi-nucleotide mutation events at both short (~5bp) and long (~1kb) genomic distances, showing that mutation drives GC content lower in already GC-poor regions, and finding that the context-dependency of the mutation spectrum predicts long-term evolutionary patterns at four-fold synonymous sites. We also show that de novo mutations from independent mutation accumulation experiments display similar patterns of single nucleotide mutation, and match well the patterns of mutation found in natural populations.",

Here, we focus on islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) mediated loss of insulin secreting cells in diabetics. Newly developed methods enable structure-function inquiry to focus on intracellular oligomers composed of hundreds of IAPP. The key insights are that porating oligomers are internally dynamic, grow in discrete steps and are not canonical amyloid. Moreover, two class of pores coexist; an IAPP-specific ligand establishes that only one is cytotoxic. Toxic rescue occurs by stabilizing non-toxic poration without displacing IAPP from mitochondria.
