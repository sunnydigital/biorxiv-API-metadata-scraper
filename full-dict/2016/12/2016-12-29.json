    "abstract": "Type 1 paracaspases originated in the Ediacaran geological period before the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians (Planulozoa). Cnidarians have several paralog type 1 paracaspases, type 2 paracaspases, and a homolog of Bcl10. Notably in bilaterians, lineages like nematodes and insects lack Bcl10 whereas other lineages such as vertebrates, hemichordates, annelids and mollusks have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-coiled-coil (CC) domain homologs of CARMA/CARD9 revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient co-evolution of the entire CARD-CC/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be the original user of the CBM complex. We also established that the downstream signaling proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 are functionally conserved in Cnidaria. There also seems to be a correlation where invertebrates with CARD-CC and Bcl10 have type 1 paracaspases which are more similar to the paracaspases found in vertebrates. A proposed evolutionary scenario includes at least two ancestral type 1 paracaspase paralogs in the planulozoan last common ancestor, where at least one paralog usually is dependent on CARD-CC/Bcl10 for its function. Functional analyses of invertebrate type 1 paracaspases and Bcl10 homologs support this scenario and indicate an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. Results from cnidarians, nematodes and mice also suggest an ancient neuronal role for the type 1 paracaspases.",

However, the influence of our experimental manipulations on psychological processes must be inferred from their effects on behavior. Today, quantifying behavior has become the bottleneck for large-scale, high-throughput, experiments. The method presented here addresses this issue by using deep learning algorithms for video-based animal tracking. Here we describe a reliable automatic method for tracking head position and orientation from simple video recordings of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This method for measuring marmoset behavior allows for the estimation of gaze within foveal error, and can easily be adapted to a wide variety of similar tasks in biomedical research.

    "abstract": "Despite many recent advances in systems biology and a marked increase in the availability of high-throughput biological data, the productivity of research and development in the pharmaceutical industry is on the decline. This is primarily due to clinical trial failure rates reaching up to 95% in oncology and other disease areas. We have developed a comprehensive analytical and computational pipeline utilizing deep learning techniques and novel systems biology analytical tools to predict the outcomes of phase I/II clinical trials. The pipeline predicts the side effects of a drug using deep neural networks and estimates drug-induced pathway activation. It then uses the predicted side effect probabilities and pathway activation scores as an input to train a classifier which predicts clinical trial outcomes. This classifier was trained on 577 transcriptomic datasets and has achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 0.83. When compared to a direct gene-based classifier, our multi-stage approach dramatically improves the accuracy of the predictions. The classifier was applied to a set of compounds currently present in the pipelines of several major pharmaceutical companies to highlight potential risks in their portfolios and estimate the fraction of clinical trials that were likely to fail in phase I and II.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide proximity ligation based assays such as Hi-C have revealed that eukaryotic genomes are organized into structural units called topologically associating domains (TADs). From a visual examination of the chromosomal contact map, however, it is clear that the organization of the domains is not simple or obvious. Instead, TADs exhibit various length scales and, in many cases, a nested arrangement. Here, by exploiting the resemblance between TADs in a chromosomal contact map and densely connected modules in a network, we formulate TAD identification as an optimization problem and propose an algorithm, MrTADFinder, to identify TADs from intra-chromosomal contact maps. MrTADFinder is based on the network-science concept of modularity. A key component of it is deriving an appropriate background model for contacts in a random chain, by numerically solving a set of matrix equations. The background model preserves the observed coverage of each genomic bin as well as the distance dependence of the contact frequency for any pair of bins exhibited by the empirical map. Also, by introducing a tunable resolution parameter, MrTADFinder provides a self-consistent approach for identifying TADs at different length scales, hence the acronym \\\"Mr\\\" standing for Multiple Resolutions. We then apply MrTADFinder to various Hi-C datasets. The identified domains are marked by boundary signatures in chromatin marks and transcription factor (TF) that are consistent with earlier work. Moreover, by calling TADs at different length scales, we observe that boundary signatures change with resolution, with different chromatin features having different characteristic length scales. Furthermore, we report an enrichment of HOT regions near TAD boundaries and investigate the role of different TFs in determining boundaries at various resolutions. To further explore the interplay between TADs and epigenetic marks, we examine how somatic mutations are distributed across boundaries (as tumor mutational burden is known to be coupled to chromatin structure), finding a clear stepwise pattern. Overall, MrTADFinder provides a novel computational framework to explore the multi-scale structures in Hi-C contact maps.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe accommodation of the roughly 2m of DNA in the nuclei of mammalian cells results in an intricate structure, in which the topologically associating domains (TADs) formed by densely interacting genomic regions emerge as a fundamental structural unit. Identification of TADs is essential for understanding the role of 3D genome organization in gene regulation. By viewing the chromosomal contact map as a network, TADs correspond to the densely connected regions in the network. Motivated by this mapping, we propose a novel method, MrTADFinder, to identify TADs based on the concept of modularity in network science. Using MrTADFinder, we identify domains at various resolutions, and further explore the interplay between domains and other chromatin features like transcription factors binding and histone modifications at different resolutions. Overall, MrTADFinder provides a new computational framework to investigate the multiple length scales that are built inside the organization of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Bio-image informatics is the systematic application of image analysis algorithms to large image datasets to provide an objective method for accurately and consistently scoring image data. Within this field, pattern recognition (PR) is a form of supervised machine learning where the computer identifies relevant patterns in groups (classes) of images after being trained on examples. Rather than segmentation, image-specific algorithms or adjustable parameter sets, PR relies on extracting a common set of image descriptors (features) from the entire image to determine similarities and differences between image classes.\\n\\nGross morphology can be the only available description of biological systems prior to their molecular characterization, but these descriptions can be subjective and qualitative. In principle, generalized PR can provide an objective and quantitative characterization of gross morphology, thus providing a means of computationally defining morphological biomarkers. In this study, we investigated the potential of a pattern recognition approach to a problem traditionally addressed using genetic or biochemical biomarkers. Often these molecular biomarkers are unavailable for investigating biological processes that are not well characterized, such as the initial steps of stem cell differentiation.\\n\\nHere we use a general contrast technique combined with generalized PR software to detect subtle differences in cellular morphology present in early differentiation events in murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) induced to differentiate by the overexpression of selected transcription factors. Without the use of reporters, or a priori knowledge of the relevant morphological characteristics, we identified the earliest differentiation event (3 days), reproducibly distinguished eight morphological trajectories, and correlated morphological trajectories of 40 mESC clones with previous micro-array data. Interestingly, the six transcription factors that caused the greatest morphological divergence from an ESC-like state were previously shown by expression profiling to have the greatest influence on the expression of downstream genes.",

    "abstract": "The inward current flowing inside the post-synaptic terminal of a neuron modulates transiently the membrane voltage potential. Most of the excitatory connections are made on dendritic spines characterized by a large variability in their geometry.How the voltage in a spine is modulated by geometry remains elusive due in part to the absence of direct measurements. To understand the spine voltage-current relation, we develop here a model for the voltage and we use it to extract electrical properties from live cell imaging data. We first deconvolve the genetically encoded voltage sensor expressed in hippocampal neurons and then use electro-diffusion theory, to compute the electric field and the ionic flows induced in a dendritic spine.The ionic flow is driven by the electric field coupled to the charge densities that interact through the non-cylindrical spine geometry. We determine the I-V relation and conclude that the spine effective resistance is mostly determined by the neck geometry. This modulation of synaptic inputs by the spine neck is significantly larger than what was expected from traditional cable models. Thus modulating the postsynaptic current can be achieved by changing the number of receptors or by altering the spine geometry which independently affects the transformation of current into voltage.\\n\\nSignificance statementDendritic spines are geometrical structures receiving most of the excitatory transmission, yet how they modulate voltage from the synaptic current is not clear due to their submicron small size and specific non-cylindrical geometry. We study here the conversion of the synaptic current into voltage modulated by the spine geometry. Our approach is based on the electro-diffusion theory and we show that the spine neck is the main resistance filter, while the voltage is maintained constant in the head. Finally, we extract the effective resistance using a deconvolution of the genetically encoded voltage indicators expressed in hippocampal neurons. The present approach allows studying the electrical properties of many other structures such as glial small protrusions, cilia, and many others.",

Consequently, their estimates were confounded by the width and scatter of receptive fields of V1 neurons. Here, we circumvent these limits by instead using the inherent cortical spatial organization of ocular dominance columns (ODCs) to determine the PSF for both Gradient Echo (GE) and Spin Echo (SE) BOLD imaging at 7 Tesla. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling on a probabilistic generative model of imaging ODCs, we quantified the PSFs that best predict the spatial structure and magnitude of differential ODCs responses. Prior distributions for the ODC model parameters were determined by analyzing published data of cytochrome oxidase patterns from post-mortem histology of human V1 and of neurophysio-logical ocular dominance indices. The most probable PSF full-widths at halfmaximum were 0.82 mm (SE) and 1.02 mm (GE). Our results provide a quantitative basis for the spatial specificity of BOLD fMRI at ultra-high fields, which can be used for planning and interpretation of high-resolution differential fMRI of fine-scale cortical organizations.",

    "abstract": "Modern digital pathology departments have grown to produce whole-slide image data at petabyte scale, an unprecedented treasure chest for medical machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, most digital slides are not annotated at the image level, hindering large-scale application of supervised learning. Manual labeling is prohibitive, requiring pathologists with decades of training and outstanding clinical service responsibilities. This problem is further aggravated by the United States Food and Drug Administrations ruling that primary diagnosis must come from a glass slide rather than a digital image. We present the first end-to-end framework to overcome this problem, gathering annotations in a nonintrusive manner during a pathologists routine clinical work: (i) microscope-specific 3D-printed commodity camera mounts are used to video record the glass-slide-based clinical diagnosis process; (ii) after routine scanning of the whole slide, the video frames are registered to the digital slide; (iii) motion and observation time are estimated to generate a spatial and temporal saliency map of the whole slide. Demonstrating the utility of these annotations, we train a convolutional neural network that detects diagnosis-relevant salient regions, then report accuracy of 85.15% in bladder and 91.40% in prostate, with 75.00% accuracy when training on prostate but predicting in bladder, despite different pathologists examining the different tissues.

Identifying how these morphogenetic movements are directed and implemented is essential for understanding morphogenesis. Topographical and scalar differences in adhesion and contractility within and between cells are essential, yet, the role that membrane remodeling may play remains less clear. To clarify how surface turnover and dynamics may modulate tissue arrangements we studied epiboly in the zebrafish. During epiboly the blastoderm expands as a result of an asymmetry of mechanical tension along the embryo surface. In this scenario, we found that the membrane removal by macropinocytosis of the external yolk cell syncytial layer (E-YSL) ahead of the blastoderm is key for epiboly progression In early zebrafish embryos, the activity of the GTPase Rab5ab was essential for endocytosis, and interference in its expression exclusively in the yolk cell resulted in the reduction of yolk cell actomyosin contractility, the disruption of cortical and internal yolk flows, a disequilibrium in force balance and as a result epiboly impairment. We conclude that regulated membrane remodeling is crucial for directing cell and tissue mechanics and coordinating morphogenetic movements during epiboly.",

When applied to yeast and human nuclei, CUT&RUN yielded precise transcription factor profiles while avoiding cross-linking and solubilization issues. CUT&RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT&RUN mapped directional long range contacts at high resolution.

    "abstract": "The effects of k-space sampling and signal decay on the effective spatial resolution of MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) are commonly assessed by means of the magnitude point-spread function (PSF), defined as the absolute values (magnitudes) of the complex MR imaging PSF. It is commonly assumed that this magnitude PSF signifies blurring, which can be quantified by its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Here we show that the magnitude PSF fails to accurately represent the true effects of k-space sampling and signal decay.\\n\\nFirstly, a substantial part of the width of the magnitude PSF is due to MRI sampling per se. This part is independent of any signal decay and its effect depends on the spatial frequency composition of the imaged object. Therefore, it cannot always be expected to introduce blurring. Secondly, MRI reconstruction is typically followed by taking the absolute values (magnitude image) of the reconstructed complex image. This introduces a non-linear stage into the process of image formation. The complex imaging PSF does not fully describe this process, since it does not reflect the stage of taking the magnitude image. Its corresponding magnitude PSF fails to correctly describe this process, since convolving the original pattern with the magnitude PSF is different from the true process of taking the absolute following a convolution with the complex imaging PSF. Lastly, signal decay can have not only a blurring, but also a high-pass filtering effect. This cannot be reflected by the strictly positive width of the magnitude PSF.\\n\\nAs an alternative, we propose to first approximate the MRI process linearly. We then model the linear approximation by decomposing it into a signal decay-independent MR sampling part and an approximation of the signal decay effect. We approximate the latter as a convolution with a Gaussian PSF or, if the effect is that of high-pass filtering, as reversing the effect of a convolution with a Gaussian PSF. We show that for typical high-resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla, signal decay in Spin-Echo has a moderate blurring effect (FWHM = 0.89 voxels, corresponds to 0.44 mm for 0.5 mm wide voxels). In contrast, Gradient-Echo acts as a moderate high-pass filter that can be interpreted as reversing a Gaussian blurring with FWHM = 0.59 voxels (0.30 mm for 0.5 mm wide voxels). Our improved approximations and findings hold not only for Gradient-Echo and Spin-Echo fMRI but also for GRASE and VASO fMRI. Our findings support the correct planning, interpretation, and modeling of high-resolution fMRI.",

    "abstract": "Microbial remediation of oil polluted habitats remains one of the foremost methods for restoration of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated environments. The development of effective bioremediation strategies however, require an extensive understanding of the resident microbiome of these habitats. Recent developments such as high-throughput sequencing has greatly facilitated the advancement of microbial ecological studies in oil polluted habitats. However, effective interpretation of biological characteristics from these large datasets remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we have implemented recently developed bioinformatic tools for analyzing 65 publicly available 16S rRNA datasets from 12 diverse hydrocarbon polluted habitats to decipher metagenomic characteristics of bacterial communities of the same. We have comprehensively described phylogenetic and functional compositions of these habitats and additionally inferred a multitude of metagenomic features including 255 taxa and 414 functional modules which can be used as biomarkers for effective distinction between the 12 oil polluted sites. We have identified essential metabolic signatures and also showed that significantly over-represented taxa often contribute to either or both, hydrocarbon degradation and additional important functions. Our findings reveal significant differences between hydrocarbon contaminated sites and establishes the importance of endemic factors in addition to petroleum hydrocarbons as driving factors for sculpting hydrocarbon contaminated bacteriomes.",

    "abstract": "With recent advancements in measurement technologies, many multi-way and tensor datasets have started to emerge. Exploiting the natural tensor structure in the data has been shown to be advantageous for both explorative and predictive studies in several application areas of bioinformatics and computational biology. Therefore, there has subsequently arisen a need for robust and flexible tools for effectively analyzing tensor data sets. We present the R package tensorBF, which is the first R package providing Bayesian factorization of a tensor. Our package implements a generative model that automatically identifies the number of factors needed to explain the tensor, overcoming a key limitation of traditional tensor factorizations. We also recommend best practices when using tensor factorizations for both, explorative and predictive analysis with an example application on drug response dataset. The package also implements tools related to the normalization of data, informative noise priors and visualization. Availability: The package is available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=tensorBF.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease whose neuropathological signature is a selective loss of medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Despite this selective neuropathology, the mutant protein (huntingtin) is found in virtually every cell so far studied, and, consequently, phenotypes are observed in a wide range of organ systems both inside and outside the central nervous system. We, and others, have suggested that peripheral dysfunction could contribute to the rate of progression of striatal phenotypes of HD. To test this hypothesis, we lowered levels of huntingtin by treating mice with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting the murine Huntingtin gene. To study the relationship between peripheral huntingtin levels and striatal HD phenotypes, we utilized a knock-in model of the human HD mutation (the B6.HttQ111/+ mouse). We treated mice with ASOs from 2-10 months of age, a time period over which significant HD-relevant signs progressively develop in the brains of HttQ111+ mice. Peripheral treatment with ASOs led to persistent reduction of huntingtin protein in peripheral organs, including liver, brown and white adipose tissues. This reduction was not associated with alterations in the severity of HD-relevant signs in the striatum of HttQ111/+ mice at the end of the study, including transcriptional dysregulation, the accumulation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions, and behavioral changes such as subtle hypoactivity and reduced exploratory drive. These results suggest that the amount of peripheral reduction achieved in the current study does not significantly impact the progression of HD-relevant signs in the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Studying the effect of temperature on fertility is particularly important in the light of ongoing climate change. We need to know if organisms can adapt to higher temperatures and, if so, what are the evolutionary mechanisms behind such adaptation. Such studies have been hampered by the lack different populations of sufficient sizes with which to relate the phenotype of temperature tolerance to the underlying genotypes. Here, we examined temperature adaptation in populations of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, in which individual strains are able to successfully reproduce at 30{degrees}C. Analysis of the frequency of heat tolerant strains in different temperature zones on La Reunion supports that this trait is subject to natural selection. Reconstruction of ancestral states along the phylogeny of highly differentiated P. pacificus clades suggests that heat tolerance evolved multiple times independently. This is further supported by genome wide association studies showing that heat tolerance is a polygenic trait and that different loci are used by individual P. pacificus clades to develop heat tolerance. More precisely, analysis of allele frequencies indicated that most genetic markers that are associated with heat tolerance are only polymorphic in individual clades. While in some P. pacificus clades, parallel evolution of heat tolerance can be explained by ancestral polymorphism or by gene flow across clades, we observe at least one clearly distinct and independent scenario where heat tolerance emerged by de novo mutation. Thus, temperature tolerance evolved at least two times independently in the evolutionary history of this species. Our data suggest that studies of wild populations of P. pacificus will reveal distinct cellular mechanisms driving temperature adaptation.",
