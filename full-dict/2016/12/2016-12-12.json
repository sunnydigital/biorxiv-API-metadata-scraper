    "abstract": "Type 1 paracaspases originated in the Ediacaran geological period before the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians (Planulozoa). Cnidarians have several paralog type 1 paracaspases, type 2 paracaspases, and a homolog of Bcl10. Notably in bilaterians, lineages like nematodes and insects lack Bcl10 whereas other lineages such as vertebrates, hemichordates, annelids and mollusks have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-coiled-coil (CC) domain homologs of CARMA/CARD9 revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient co-evolution of the entire CARD-CC/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be the original user of the CBM complex. We also established that the downstream signaling proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 are functionally conserved in Cnidaria. There also seems to be a correlation where invertebrates with CARD-CC and Bcl10 have type 1 paracaspases which are more similar to the paracaspases found in vertebrates. A proposed evolutionary scenario includes at least two ancestral type 1 paracaspase paralogs in the planulozoan last common ancestor, where at least one paralog usually is dependent on CARD-CC/Bcl10 for its function. Functional analyses of invertebrate type 1 paracaspases and Bcl10 homologs support this scenario and indicate an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. Results from cnidarians, nematodes and mice also suggest an ancient neuronal role for the type 1 paracaspases.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species represent unique opportunities to evaluate the role of local adaptation during colonization of new environments. Among these species, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a threatening vector of several human viral diseases, including dengue and chikungunya, and raises concerns about the Zika fever. Its broad presence in both temperate and tropical environments has been considered the reflection of great \\\"ecological plasticity\\\". However, no study has been conducted to assess the role of adaptive evolution in the ecological success of Ae. albopictus at the molecular level. In the present study, we performed a genomic scan to search for potential signatures of selection leading to local adaptation in one-hundred-forty field-collected mosquitoes from native populations of Vietnam and temperate invasive populations of Europe. High-throughput genotyping of transposable element insertions led to the discovery of more than 120 000 polymorphic loci, which, in their great majority, revealed a virtual absence of structure between the bio-geographic areas. Nevertheless, 92 outlier loci showed a high level of differentiation between temperate and tropical populations. The majority of these loci segregates at high insertion frequencies among European populations, indicating that this pattern could have been caused by recent adaptive evolution events in temperate areas. An analysis of the overlapping and neighboring genes highlighted several candidates, including diapause, lipid and juvenile hormone pathways.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian chromosomes are organized in structural and functional domains of 0.1-10 Mb, which are characterized by high self-association frequencies in the nuclear space and different contact probabilities with nuclear sub-compartments. They exhibit distinct chromatin modification patterns, gene expression levels and replication timing. Recently, nucleolus-associated chromosomal domains (NADs) have been discovered, yet their precise genomic organization and dynamics are still largely unknown. Here, we use nucleolus genomics and single-cell experiments to address these questions in human embryonic fibroblasts during replicative senescence. Genome-wide mapping reveals 1,646 NADs in proliferating cells, which cover about 38% of the annotated human genome. They are mainly heterochromatic and correlate with late replicating loci. Using Hi-C data analysis, we show that interactions of NADs dominate interphase chromosome contacts in the 10-50 Mb distance range. Interestingly, only minute changes in nucleolar association are observed upon senescence. These spatial rearrangements in subdomains smaller than 100 kb are accompanied with local transcriptional changes. In contrast, large centromeric and pericentromeric satellite repeat clusters extensively dissociate from nucleoli in senescent cells. We use gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to map the epigenetic regulatory network that governs these changes. The GSEA results together with cellular chromatin analyses suggest that histone H3K9 trimethylation is involved in regulating the nucleolus association of chromatin. Collectively, this study identifies connections between the nucleolus, 3D genome structure, and cellular aging at the level of interphase chromosome organization.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system utilizes multiple mechanisms linked to innate immune cell functions to respond appropriately to pathogens and commensals. Here we discover further aspects of this connectivity by demonstrating that naive T cells as they emerge from the thymus (recent thymic emigrants, RTEs) express complement receptors (CR1 and CR2), the bacterial pathogen recognition receptor TLR1 and an enzyme that deactivates bacterial lipopolysaccharide (AOAH) and following activation secrete the anti-microbial cytokine IL-8. CR2+ naive T cells also express a selection of genes associated with tissue migration, consistent with the hypothesis that following emigration from the thymus RTEs seed peripheral compartments where some pursue their anti-microbial potential by becoming IL-8-producing CR2+ memory cells while others undergo homeostatic expansion. CR2+ naive and memory cells are abundant in children but decrease with age, coinciding with the involution of the thymus. The ability of CR2, which is also a receptor for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), to identify recent thymic emigrants will facilitate assessment of thymic function during aging and aid investigations of multiple clinical areas including the occurrence of T cell lymphomas caused by EBV.",

    "abstract": "The decoding of a sensory or motor variable from neural activity benefits from a known ground truth against which decoding performance can be compared. In contrast, the decoding of covert, cognitive neural activity, such as occurs in memory recall or planning, typically cannot be compared to a known ground truth. As a result, it is unclear how decoders of such internally generated activity should be configured in practice. We suggest that if the true code for covert activity is unknown, decoders should be optimized for generalization performance using cross-validation. Using ensemble recording data from hippocampal place cells, we show that this cross-validation approach results in different decoding error, different optimal decoding parameters, and different distributions of error across the decoded variable space. In addition, we show that a minor modification to the commonly used Bayesian decoding procedure, which enables the use of spike density functions, results in substantially lower decoding errors. These results have implications for the interpretation of covert neural activity, and suggest easy-to-implement changes to commonly used procedures across domains, with applications to hippocampal place cells in particular.",

We estimate that the first introduction of ZIKV to Brazil likely occurred between August 2013 and April 2014 (90% credible interval). We provide simulated epidemic profiles of incident ZIKV infections for several countries in the Americas through February 2017. The ZIKV epidemic is characterized by slow growth and high spatial and seasonal heterogeneity, attributable to the dynamics of the mosquito vector and to the characteristics and mobility of the human populations. We project the expected timing and number of pregnancies infected with ZIKV during the first trimester, and provide estimates of microcephaly cases assuming different levels of risk as reported in empirical retrospective studies. Our approach represents an early modeling effort aimed at projecting the potential magnitude and timing of the ZIKV epidemic that might be refined as new and more accurate data from the region become available.",

    "abstract": "1Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective intervention for patients suffering from recurrent Clostridium difficile, a common hospital-acquired infection. FMTs success as a therapy for C. difficile has inspired interest in performing clinical trials that experiment with FMT as a therapy for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and Parkinsons disease. Results from clinical trials that use FMT to treat inflammatory bowel disease suggest that, for at least one condition beyond C. difficile, most FMT donors produce stool that is not efficacious. The optimal strategies for identifying and using efficacious donors have not been investigated. We therefore examined the optimal Bayesian response-adaptive strategy for allocating patients to donors and formulated a computationally-tractable myopic heuristic. This heuristic computes the probability that a donor is efficacious by updating prior expectations about the efficacy of FMT, the placebo rate, and the fraction of donors that produce efficacious stool. In simulations designed to mimic a recent FMT clinical trial, for which traditional power calculations predict ~100% statistical power, we found that accounting for differences in donor stool efficacy reduced the predicted statistical power to ~9%. For these simulations, using the heuristic Bayesian allocation strategy more than quadrupled the statistical power to ~39%. We use the results of similar simulations to make recommendations about the number of patients, number of donors, and choice of clinical endpoint that clinical trials should use to optimize their ability to detect if FMT is effective for treating a condition.",

    "abstract": "Folded states of single domain globular proteins, the workhorses in cells, are compact with high packing density. It is known that the radius of gyration, Rg, of both the folded and unfolded (created by adding denaturants) states increase as N{nu} where N is the number of amino acids in the protein. The values of the celebrated Flory exponent{nu} are, respectively, [Formula], and {approx} 0.6 in the folded and unfolded states, which coincide with those found in homopolymers in poor and good solvents, respectively. However, the extent of compaction of the unfolded state of a protein under low denaturant concentration, conditions favoring the formation of the folded state, is unknown. This problem which goes to the heart of how proteins fold, with implications for the evolution of foldable sequences, is unsolved. We develop a theory based on polymer physics concepts that uses the contact map of proteins as input to quantitatively assess collapsibility of proteins. The model, which includes only two-body excluded volume interactions and attractive interactions reflecting the contact map, has only expanded and compact states. Surprisingly, we find that although protein collapsibility is universal, the propensity to be compact depends on the protein architecture. Application of the theory to over two thousand proteins shows that the extent of collapsibility depends not only on N but also on the contact map reflecting the native fold structure. A major prediction of the theory is that {beta}-sheet proteins are far more collapsible than structures dominated by -helices. The theory and the accompanying simulations, validating the theoretical predictions, fully resolve the apparent controversy between conclusions reached using different experimental probes assessing the extent of compaction of a couple proteins. As a by product, we show that the theory correctly predicts the scaling of the collapse temperature of homopolymers as a function of the number of monomers. By calculating the criterion for collapsibility as a function of protein length we provide quantitative insights into the reasons why single domain proteins are small and the physical reasons for the origin of multi-domain proteins. We also show that non-coding RNA molecules, whose collapsibility is similar to proteins with {beta}-sheet structures, must undergo collapse prior to folding, adding support to \\\"Compactness Selection Hypothesis\\\" proposed in the context of RNA compaction.",

Pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation at promoters is crucial to recruit the transcriptional machinery.

Here we characterized TFIID and SAGA's composition during mouse development. Our data indicate that TAF10 is required for TFIID and SAGA assembly. To analyse TAF10-dependent gene regulation during development, we conditionally deleted Taf10 in the mesoderm. Our results provide evidence for a time window during which Taf10 loss in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) does not prevent cyclic gene transcription or PSM patterning while lateral plate differentiation is profoundly altered. During this period, global steady state mRNA levels are not significantly affected in the PSM although the expression of a subset of specific genes is dysregulated. Together, our data demonstrate a differential sensibility of mesodermal tissues to the lack of TAF10. This supports a differential requirement for TAF10 by the general transcriptional machinery during different developmental processes.",

However the long-term stability of the influence of contextual factors in the mature cortex remains poorly understood. To investigate this we used 2-photon calcium imaging to track the influence of surround suppression and locomotion on individual neurons over 14 days. We found that highly active excitatory neurons and PV+ interneurons exhibited relatively stable modulation by visual context. Similarly most neurons exhibited a stable yet distinct degree modulation by locomotion. In contrast less active excitatory neurons exhibited plasticity in visual context influence resulting in increased suppression. These findings suggest that the mature visual cortex possesses stable subnetworks of neurons, differentiated by cell-type and activity level, which have distinctive and stable interactions with sensory and behavioural context, as well as other less active and more labile neurons which are sensitive to visual experience.",

    "abstract": "The problem of \\\"missing heritability\\\" in genome-wide analyses of complex diseases is thought to be attributable to some combination of: rare variants of moderate to large effect, common variants of very small effect, and epigenetic, epistatic, or shared environmental effects. Rare variants do not affect large numbers of people by definition, but identified genes and pathways frequently lead to important insights into pathogenesis, and become targets of chemoprevention or therapy. Family studies remain an efficient way to identify rare variants with sizable effects on disease risk. We present a genome-wide study of breast cancer in 22 large high-risk families including 154 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Appropriate marker spacing was achieved by simulation studies of founder haplotypes to reduce the chance that linkage disequilibrium produced spurious linkage peaks. For each family, we generated 100 simulations of null linkage genome-wide to estimate the probability that individual results were due to chance. We identified a total of 12 putative susceptibility regions with per-family genome-wide probability < 0.05. These regions were located on 10 chromosomes; 10 of the 22 families showed linkage at these locations; two or more families showed linkage to 6 regions on 5 chromosomes (4q, 5q, 6p, 14q, 18p, and 18q). These results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity among families in genomic regions and thus variants predisposing to breast cancer. Moreover, they suggest that uncommon high- or medium-risk genetic variants remain to be found, and that family designs can be an efficient way to identify them.",

We have characterised three orthologues of BslA from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus pumilus as well as a paralogue from B. subtilis called YweA. We find that the three orthologous proteins can substitute for BslA in B. subtilis and confer a degree of protection, whereas YweA cannot. The degree to which the proteins functionally substitute for native BslA correlates with their in vitro biophysical properties.

    "abstract": "MotivationCurrent bioinformatics methods to detect changes in gene isoform usage in distinct phenotypes compare the relative expected isoform usage in phenotypes. These statistics model differences in isoform usage in normal tissues, which have stable regulation of gene splicing. Pathological conditions, such as cancer, can have broken regulation of splicing that increases the heterogeneity of the expression of splice variants. Inferring events with such differential heterogeneity in gene isoform usage requires new statistical approaches.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce Splice Expression Variability Analysis (SEVA) to model increased heterogeneity of splice variant usage between conditions (e.g., tumor and normal samples). SEVA uses a rank-based multivariate statistic that compares the variability of junction expression profiles within one condition to the variability within another. Simulated data show that SEVA is unique in modeling heterogeneity of gene isoform usage, and benchmark SEVAs performance against EBSeq, DiffSplice, and rMATS that model differential isoform usage instead of heterogeneity. We confirm the accuracy of SEVAin identifying known splice variants in head and neck cancer and perform cross-study validation of novel splice variants. A novel comparison of splice variant heterogeneity between subtypes of head and neck cancer demonstrated unanticipated similarity between the heterogeneity of gene isoform usage in HPV-positive and HPV-negative subtypes and anticipated increased heterogeneity among HPV-negative samples with mutations in genes that regulate the splice variant machinery.\\n\\nConclusionThese results show that SEVA accurately models differential heterogeneity of gene isoform usage from RNA-seq data.\\n\\nAvailabilitySEVA is implemented in the R/Bioconductor package GSReg.\\n\\nContactbahman@jhu.edu, favorov@sensi.org, ejfertig@jhmi.edu",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces bacteria make numerous secondary metabolites, including half of all known antibiotics. Understanding the global regulation of secondary metabolism is important because most Streptomyces natural products are not made under laboratory conditions and unlocking  cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) is a major focus for natural product discovery. Production is coordinated with sporulation but the regulators that coordinate development with antibiotic biosynthesis are largely unknown. Here we characterise a highly conserved actinobacterial response regulator called MtrA in antibiotic-producing Streptomyces species. We show that MtrA is an essential global regulator of secondary metabolism that directly activates antibiotic production in in S. coelicolor and S. venezuelae. MtrA also controls key developmental genes required for DNA replication and cell division and we propose that MtrA is the missing link that coordinates secondary metabolism with development in Streptomyces species.",

    "abstract": "In humans perturbations of centriole number are associated with tumorigenesis and microcephaly, therefore appropriate regulation of centriole duplication is critical. The C. elegans homolog of Plk4, ZYG-1, is required for centriole duplication, but our understanding of how ZYG-1 levels are regulated remains incomplete. We have identified the two PP1 orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators I-2szy-2 and SDS-22 as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels. We find that down-regulation of PP1 activity either directly, or by mutation of szy-2 or sds-22 can rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. Suppression is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels, and our data indicate that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism. While moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication to a zyg-1 mutant, strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification via the production of more than one daughter centriole. Our results thus define a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe centrosomes are responsible for organizing the mitotic spindle a microtubule-based structure that centers, then segregates, the chromosomes during cell division. When a cell divides it normally possesses two centrosomes, allowing it to build a bipolar spindle and accurately segregate the chromosomes to two daughter cells. Appropriate control of centrosome number is therefore crucial to maintaining genome stability. Centrosome number is largely controlled by their regulated duplication. In particular, the protein Plk4, which is essential for duplication, must be strictly limited as an overabundance leads to excess centrosome duplication. We have identified protein phosphatase 1 as a critical regulator of the C. elegans Plk4 homolog (known as ZYG-1). When protein phosphatase 1 is down-regulated, ZYG-1 levels increase leading to centrosome amplification. Thus our work identifies a novel mechanism that limits centrosome duplication.",

CTCF and cohesin control domain location by folding domains into loop structures, which are thought to be highly stable. Combining genomic, biochemical and single-molecule imaging approaches, we show that although CTCF and cohesin can physically interact, CTCF binds chromatin much more dynamically than cohesin (~1 min vs. ~22 min residence time). Moreover, after unbinding, CTCF quickly rebinds another cognate site unlike cohesin (~1 min vs. ~33 min). Thus, CTCF and cohesin form a rapidly exchanging \\\"dynamic complex\\\" rather than a typical stable complex. Since CTCF and cohesin are required for loop domain formation, our results suggest that chromatin loops constantly break and reform throughout the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "In this work we introduce a stochastic model to describe directional changes in the movement of swimming bacteria. We use the probability density function (PDF) of turn angles, measured on tumbling E. coli wild-type, to build a Langevin equation for the deflection of the bacterial body swimming in isotropic media. We solved analytically this equation by means of the Green function method and show that three parameters are sufficient to describe the movement: a characteristic time, the steady-state solution and a control parameter. We conclude that the tumble motion, which is manifested as abrupt turns, is primarily caused by the rotational boost generated by the flagellar motor and complementarily by the rotational diffusion introduced by noise. We show that, in the tumble motion, the deflection is a non-stationary stochastic processes during times where the tumble occurs. By tuning the control parameter our model is able to explain small turns of the bacteria around their centers of mass along the run. We show that the deflection during the run is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which for typical run times is stationary. We conclude that, along the run, the rotational boosts do not exist or are neglectable and that only the rotational diffusion remains. Thus we have a single model to explain the turns of the bacterium during the run or tumble movements, through a control parameter that can be tuned through a critical value that can explain the transition between the two turn behaviours. This model is also able to explain very satisfactory all available statistical experimental data, such as PDFs and average values of turning angles and times, of both run and tumble motions.",

However, most methods to detect allelic imbalance assume diploid genomes. This assumption severely limits their applicability to cancer samples with frequent DNA copy number changes. Here we present a Bayesian statistical approach called BaalChIP to correct for the effect of background allele frequency on the observed ChIP-seq read counts. BaalChIP allows the joint analysis of multiple ChIP-seq samples across a single variant and outperforms competing approaches in simulations. Using 548 ENCODE ChIP-seq and 6 targeted FAIRE-seq samples we show that BaalChIP effectively corrects allele-specific analysis for copy number variation and increases the power to detect putative cis-acting regulatory variants in cancer genomes.",

We found that CNVs are post-transcriptionally attenuated in 23-33% of proteins with an enrichment for protein complexes. Complex subunits are highly co-regulated and some act as rate-limiting steps of complex assembly, indirectly controlling the abundance of other complex members. We identified 48 such regulatory interactions and experimentally validated AP3B1 and GTF2E2 as controlling subunits. Lastly, we found that a gene-signature of protein attenuation is associated with increased resistance to chaperone and proteasome inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Telomere shortening has emerged as an important biomarker of aging. Longitudinal studies consistently find that, although telomere length shortens over time on average, there is a subset of individuals for whom telomere length is observed to increase. This apparent lengthening could either be a genuine biological phenomenon, or simply due to measurement and sampling error. Simons, Stulp and Nakagawa [Biogerontology 15: 99-103, 2014] recently proposed a statistical test for detecting when the amount of apparent lengthening in a dataset exceeds that which should be expected due to error, and thus indicating that genuine elongation may be operative in some individuals. The test is however based on a restrictive assumption, namely that each individuals true rate of telomere change is constant over time. It is not currently known whether this assumption is true. Here we show, using simulated datasets, that with perfect measurement and large sample size, the test has high power to detect true lengthening as long as the true rate of shortening is either constant, or moderately stable, over time. If the true rate of lengthening varies randomly from year to year, the test systematically returns type-II errors. We also consider the impact of measurement error. Using estimates of the magnitude of annual attrition and of measurement error derived from the human telomere literature, we show that power of the test is likely to be low in several empirically-realistic scenarios, even in large samples. Thus, whilst a significant result of the proposed test is likely to indicate that true lengthening is present in a data set, type-II errors are a likely outcome, either if measurement error is substantial, and/or the true rate of attrition varies substantially over time within individuals.",

    "abstract": "Gq is a heterotrimeric G protein that is widely expressed in neurons and regulates neuronal activity. To identify pathways regulating neuronal Gq signaling we performed a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for suppressors of activated Gq. One of the suppressors is an allele of sek-1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in the p38 MAPK pathway. Here we show that sek-1 mutants have a slow locomotion rate and that sek-1 acts in acetylcholine neurons to modulate both locomotion rate and Gq signaling. Furthermore, we find that sek-1 acts in mature neurons to modulate locomotion. Using genetic and behavioral approaches we demonstrate that other components of the p38 MAPK pathway also play a positive role in modulating locomotion and Gq signaling. Finally, we find that mutants in the SEK-1 p38 MAPK pathway partially suppress an activated mutant of the sodium leak channel NCA-1/NALCN, a downstream target of Gq signaling. Our results suggest that the SEK-1 p38 pathway may modulate the output of Gq signaling through NCA-1.",

    "abstract": "The Unix \\\"make\\\" program is widely used in bioinformatics pipelines, but suffers from problems that limit its application to large analysis datasets. These include reliance on file modification times to determine whether a target is stale, lack of support for parallel execution on clusters, and restricted flexibility to extend the underlying logic program. We present BioMake, a make-like utility that is compatible with most features of GNU Make and adds support for popular cluster-based job-queue engines, MD5 signatures as an alternative to timestamps, and logic programming extensions in Prolog.

    "abstract": "As part of the process of preparing sequencing libraries that include unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) such as many single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) libraries, a diverse template must be amplified. During amplification, spurious chimeric molecules can be formed between molecules originating in different cells. While several computational and experimental strategies have been suggested to mitigate the impact of chimeric molecules, suitable approaches for scRNA-seq experiments do not exist. We demonstrate that chimeras become increasingly problematic as samples are sequenced deeply and propose both supervised and unsupervised computational solutions. These solutions are validated in the context of a deeply sequenced species mixing experiment, and, orthogonally, using replicate PCR amplifications of the same scRNA-seq library.

    "abstract": "MiRNA biogenesis is highly regulated at the post-transcriptional level; however, the role of sequence and secondary RNA structure in this process has not been extensively studied. A single G to A substitution present in the terminal loop of pri-mir-30c-1 in breast cancer patients had been previously described to result in increased levels of mature miRNA. Here, we report that this genetic variant directly affects Drosha-mediated processing of pri-mir-30c-1 in vitro and in cultured cells. Structural analysis of this variant revealed an altered RNA structure that facilitates the interaction with SRSF3, an SR protein family member that promotes pri-miRNA processing. Our results are compatible with a model whereby a genetic variant in pri-mir-30c-1 leads to a secondary RNA structure rearrangement that facilitates binding of SRSF3 resulting in increased levels of miR-30c. These data highlights that primary sequence determinants and RNA structure are key regulators of miRNA biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The abusive use of antimicrobials have caused resistance in the microorganisms. Therefore, inovations in research of modern microbiology developed the photodynamic inactivation that is non-toxic and do not promote microbian resistance since it has multiples action sites. When a photoactive molecule is activated by light, it becomes more toxic for the microorganism than for the human cells, increasing the phototoxic effect against such cells. We tested the incorporation of the photosensitizer crystal violet by Aspergillus flavus and its viability in different periods of time of incubation (6 and 18 hours), concentrations of crystal violet (4M, 10M e 15 M) and different conditions (resting and agitation). We also tested the photoinactivation of Aspergillus flavus containing crystal violet. The incorporation rate does not depend on the concentration of CV neither on the condition of incubation. It depends exclusively on the medium, since it presented higher values in lack ingredients medium. The assays of viability of fungi after exposure to crystal violet show that there is fungic growth when samples are maintained in the dark. However, when the culture were submitted to excitation via laser, there was a decrease in the biomass growth, which indicates that there was photodynamic inactivation of the fungi.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex controls the passage of molecules via hydrophobic phenylalanine-glycine (FG) domains on nucleoporins. Such FG-domains consist of repeating units of FxFG, FG, or GLFG sequences, which can be interspersed with highly charged amino acid sequences. Despite the high density of charge exhibited in certain FG-domains, if and how charge influences FG-domain self-assembly and selective binding of nuclear transport receptors is largely unexplored. Studying how individual charged amino acids contribute to nuclear pore selectivity is challenging with modern in vivo and in vitro techniques due to the complexity of nucleoporin sequences. Here, we present a rationally designed approach to deconstruct essential components of nucleoporins down to 14 amino acid sequences. With these nucleoporin-based peptides, we systematically dissect how charge type and placement of charge influences self-assembly and selective binding of FG-containing gels. Specifically, we find that charge type determines which hydrophobic substrates FG sequences recognize while spatial localization of charge tunes hydrophobic self-assembly and receptor selectivity of FG sequences.",
