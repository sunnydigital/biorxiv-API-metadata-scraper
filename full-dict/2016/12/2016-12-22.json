    "abstract": "A critical step in cellular trafficking pathways is the budding of membranes by protein coats, which recent experiments have demonstrated can be inhibited by elevated membrane tension. The robustness of processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) across a diverse range of organisms and mechanical environments suggests that the protein machinery in this process has evolved to take advantage of some set of physical design principles to ensure robust vesiculation against opposing forces like membrane tension. Using a theoretical model for membrane mechanics and membrane protein interaction, we have systematically investigated the influence of membrane rigidity, curvature induced by the protein coat, area covered by the protein coat, membrane tension and force from actin polymerization on bud formation. Under low tension, the membrane smoothly evolves from a flat to budded morphology as the coat area or spontaneous curvature increases, whereas the membrane remains essentially flat at high tensions. At intermediate, physiologically relevant, tensions, the membrane undergoes a snapthrough instability in which small changes in the coat area, spontaneous curvature or membrane tension cause the membrane to \\\"snap\\\" from an open, U-shape to a closed bud. This instability can be smoothed out by increasing the bending rigidity of the coat, allowing for successful budding at higher membrane tensions. Additionally, applied force from actin polymerization can bypass the instability by inducing a smooth transition from an open to a closed bud. Finally, a combination of increased coat rigidity and force from actin polymerization enables robust vesiculation even at high membrane tensions.\\n\\nSignificance statementPlasma membrane tension plays an important role in various biological processes. In particular, recent experimental studies have shown that membrane tension inhibits membrane budding processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). We have identified a mathematical relationship between the curvature-generating capability of the protein coat and membrane tension that can predict whether the coat alone is sufficient to produce closed buds. Additionally, we show that a combination of increased coat rigidity and applied force from actin polymerization can produce closed buds at high membrane tensions. These findings are general to any membrane budding process, suggesting that biology has evolved to take advantage of a set of physical design principles to ensure robust vesicle formation across a range of organisms and mechanical environments.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsJ.E.H., G.O., and P.R. designed research.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate if pharmacy students participation in personal pharmacogenetic (Pgx) testing enhances their knowledge and attitude towards precision medicine (PM).\\n\\nMethodsFirst-year pharmacy students were offered personalized pharmacogenetic testing as a supplement to a required curricular pharmacogenomics course. Ninety-eight of 122 (80%) students completed pre- and post-course surveys assessing knowledge and attitudes regarding PM; 73 students also volunteered for personal pharmacogenetic testing of the following drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1) and pharmacodynamics-relevant proteins (interleukin (IL)-28B & human lymphocyte antigen HLAB*5701).\\n\\nResultsAmong the 122 students, we found that incorporating pharmacogenetic testing improved mean knowledge and attitude by 1.0 and 0.3 Likert points, respectively. We observed statistically significant improvements in 100% of knowledge and 70% of attitude-related statements for students who decided to undergo personal pharmacogenetic testing. Students who were enrolled in the course but did not partake in personalized pharmacogenetic testing had similar gains in knowledge and attitude.\\n\\nConclusionThis study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of educating future pharmacists by incorporating pharmacogenetic testing into professional school curricula. Students who opt not to participate in genotyping may still benefit by learning vicariously through the shared learning environment created by genotyped students.",

    "abstract": "Recent epidemics of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya have heightened the need to understand the seasonal and geographic range of transmission by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. We use mechanistic transmission models to derive predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we show that these predictions are well matched by human case data. Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show that transmission occurs between 18-34{degrees}C with maximal transmission occurring in a range from 26-29{degrees}C. Controlling for population size and two socioeconomic factors, temperature-dependent transmission based on our mechanistic model is an important predictor of human transmission occurrence and incidence. Risk maps indicate that tropical and subtropical regions are suitable for extended seasonal or year-round transmission, but transmission in temperate areas is limited to at most three months per year even if vectors are present. Such brief transmission windows limit the likelihood of major epidemics following disease introduction in temperate zones.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding the drivers of recent Zika, dengue, and chikungunya epidemics is a major public health priority. Temperature may play an important role because it affects mosquito transmission, affecting mosquito development, survival, reproduction, and biting rates as well as the rate at which they acquire and transmit viruses. Here, we measure the impact of temperature on transmission by two of the most common mosquito vector species for these viruses, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We integrate data from several laboratory experiments into a mathematical model of temperature-dependent transmission, and find that transmission peaks at 26-29{degrees}C and can occur between 18-34{degrees}C. Statistically comparing model predictions with recent observed human cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika across the Americas suggests an important role for temperature, and supports model predictions. Using the model, we predict that most of the tropics and subtropics are suitable for transmission in many or all months of the year, but that temperate areas like most of the United States are only suitable for transmission for a few months during the summer (even if the mosquito vector is present).",

    "abstract": "Parallel divergence patterns across replicated species pairs occurring in similar environmental contrasts may arise through distinct evolutionary scenarios. Deciphering whether such parallelism actually reflects repeated parallel divergence driven by divergent selection or a single divergence event with subsequent gene flow needs to be ascertained. Reconstructing historical gene flow is therefore of fundamental interest to understand how demography and selection jointly shaped genomic divergence during speciation. Here, we use an extended modeling framework to explore the multiple facets of speciation-with-gene-flow with demo-genetic divergence models that capture both temporal and genomic variation in effective population size and migration rate. We investigate the divergence history of five sympatric Lake Whitefish limnetic (dwarf) and benthic (normal) species pairs characterized by variable degrees of ecological divergence and reproductive isolation. Genome-wide SNPs were used to document the extent of genetic differentiation in each species pair, and 26 divergence models were fitted and compared to the unfolded joint allele frequency spectrum of each pair. We found evidence that a recent (circa 3000-4000 generations) asymmetrical secondary contact between expanding post-glacial populations has accompanied Whitefish diversification. Our results suggest that heterogeneous genomic differentiation patterns have emerged through the combined effects of linked selection generating variable rates of lineage sorting across the genome during geographical isolation, and heterogeneous introgression eroding divergence at different rates across the genome upon secondary contact. This study thus provides a new retrospective insight into the historical demographic and selective processes that shaped a continuum of divergence associated with ecological speciation.",

    "abstract": "Strategies for containing an emerging infectious disease outbreak must be non-pharmaceutical when drugs or vaccines for the pathogen do not yet exist or are unavailable. The success of these non-pharmaceutical strategies will depend not only on the effectiveness of quarantine or other isolation measures but also on the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case study diseases with diverse natural histories including Ebola, Influenza A, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policy-makers on how best to use non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain emerging outbreaks and prioritize research during an outbreak of a novel pathogen.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEQuarantine and symptom monitoring of contacts with suspected exposure to an infectious disease are key interventions for the control of emerging epidemics; however, there does not yet exist a quantitative framework for comparing the control performance of each. Here, we use a mathematical model of seven case study diseases to show how the choice of intervention is influenced by the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. We use this information to identify the most important characteristics of the disease and setting that need to be characterized for an emerging pathogen in order to make an informed decision between quarantine and symptom monitoring.",

Here we studied the dynamics of forest patch sizes at a global level, examining signals of a critical transition from an unfragmented to a fragmented state, using the MODIS vegetation continuous field. We defined wide regions of connected forest across continents and big islands, and combined five criteria, including the distribution of patch sizes and the fluctuations of the largest patch over the last sixteen years, to evaluate the closeness of each region to a fragmentation threshold. Regions with the highest deforestation rates--South America, Southeast Asia, Africa--all met these criteria and may thus be near a critical fragmentation threshold. This implies that if current forest loss rates are maintained, wide continental areas could suddenly fragment, triggering extensive species loss and degradation of ecosystems services.",

Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies DNA sequencing platforms generate long reads that can produce more complete genome assemblies, but the sequencing is more expensive and error prone. There is significant interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies to generate more accurate \\\"hybrid\\\" assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads using the de novo assembler SPAdes and then simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler utilises a novel semi-global aligner, which is used to align long reads to the assembly graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when long read depth and accuracy are low.

Testing this hypothesis for sensory structures performing non-linear computations on high dimensional stimuli is still an open challenge. Here we develop a method to characterize the sensitivity of the retinal network to perturbations of a stimulus. Using closed-loop experiments, we explore selectively the space of possible perturbations around a given stimulus. We then show that the response of the retinal population to these small perturbations can be described by a local linear model. Using this model, we computed the sensitivity of the neural response to arbitrary temporal perturbations of the stimulus, and found a peak in the sensitivity as a function of the frequency of the perturbations. Based on a minimal theory of sensory processing, we argue that this peak is set to maximize information transmission. Our approach is relevant to testing the efficient coding hypothesis locally in any context where no reliable encoding model is known.",

The mouse Y chromosome is unique among mammalian Y chromosomes characterized to date in that it is large, gene-rich and euchromatic. Yet little is known about its diversity in natural populations. Here we take advantage of published whole-genome sequencing data to survey the diversity of sequence and copy number of sex-linked genes in three subspecies of house mice. Copy number of genes on the repetitive long arm of both sex chromosomes is highly variable, but sequence diversity in non-repetitive regions is decreased relative to expectations based on autosomes. We use simulations and theory to show that this reduction in sex-linked diversity is incompatible with neutral demographic processes alone, but is consistent with recent positive selection on genes active during spermatogenesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the mouse sex chromosomes are engaged in ongoing intragenomic conflict.",

    "abstract": "The sustainability of malaria control in Africa is threatened by rising levels of insecticide resistance, and new tools to prevent malaria transmission are urgently needed. To gain a better understanding of the mosquito populations that transmit malaria, we sequenced the genomes of 765 wild specimens of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii sampled from 15 locations across Africa. The data reveal high levels of genetic diversity, with over 50 million single nucleotide polymorphisms across the 230 Mbp genome. We observe complex patterns of population structure and marked variations in local population size, some of which may be due at least in part to malaria control interventions. Insecticide resistance genes show strong signatures of recent selection associated with multiple independent mutations spreading over large geographical distances and between species. The genetic variability of natural populations substantially reduces the target space for novel gene-drive strategies for mosquito control. This large dataset provides a foundation for tracking the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance and developing new vector control tools.",

FKBP7 was upregulated in human prostate cancers and correlated with the recurrence in patients receiving Docetaxel. FKBP7 silencing showed that FKBP7 is required to maintain the growth of chemoresistant cell lines and of chemoresistant tumors in mice. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that FKBP7 interacts with the eIF4G component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex to mediate survival of chemoresistant cells.

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the role of the oxytocin system in social cognition and behavior. Peripheral oxytocin concentrations are regularly used to approximate central concentrations in psychiatric research. This methodological approach has obvious appeal given the invasiveness of cerebrospinal fluid collection. However, the validity of this approach and potential moderators of the association between central and peripheral levels are unclear. Thus, we conducted a pre-registered systematic search and meta-analysis of correlations between central and peripheral oxytocin concentrations. A search of databases yielded 17 eligible studies for effect size synthesis and moderator analysis, resulting in a total sample size of 516 participants and subjects. Overall, a positive association between central and peripheral oxytocin concentrations was revealed [r=0.29, 95% CI (0.15, 0.42), p<0.0001], along with a moderate-to-high level of heterogeneity across effect sizes [Q=88.14, p<0.0001], and no evidence of publication bias (p=0.45). This association was significantly moderated by experimental context [Qb(4), p=0.0016]. The strongest association was observed after intranasal oxytocin administration (r=0.67, p<.0001), a correlation that was significantly greater (p=.0002) than the equivalent association under baseline conditions (r=0.08, p=.31). These results support the use of peripheral levels of oxytocin as a marker of central levels, but only after exogenous oxytocin administration. Despite the popularity of using peripheral OT levels to approximate central levels during baseline conditions, this approach is not supported by the present results.",

We recently reconstituted minimal actin cortices (MACs) (Vogel et al, 2013b) and here advanced our assay to investigate effects of rearranging actin filaments on the lateral membrane organization by introducing various phase-separated lipid mono-and bilayers to the MACs. The addition of actin filaments reorganized membrane domains. We found that the process reached a steady state where line tension and lateral crowding balanced. Moreover, the phase boundary allowed myosin driven actin filament rearrangements to actively move individual lipid domains, often accompanied by their shape change, fusion or splitting. Our findings illustrate how actin cortex remodeling in cells may control dynamic rearrangements of lipids and other molecules inside domains without directly binding to actin filaments.",

Here we use a natural yet controlled system to track the effects of natural selection by the genetic signatures it leaves in evolving populations. By following the emergence of intra-species diversity in an Escherichia coli strain, we unravel a recurrent case of violation of Dollos law, which proposes that evolution is unidirectional and irreversible. We demonstrate de novo acquisition of a primordial lost phenotype via compensatory mutation and also genetic reversion, the latter leaving no trace of the past. We show that this reverse evolution generates two coexisting phenotypes, resource generalist and specialist, whose abundance can be controlled by diet supplementation. While specialists abundance is low, they avoid competition with the gut microbiota, whereas generalist abundance is dependent on microbiota composition.

This trial-by-trial neural variability is relatively large in the pre-stimulus period and considerably smaller (quenched) following stimulus presentation. Previous studies have suggested that the magnitude of neural variability affects behavior such that perceptual performance is better on trials and in individuals where variability quenching is larger. To what degree are neural variability magnitudes of individual subjects flexible or static? Here, we used EEG recordings from adult humans to demonstrate that neural variability magnitudes in visual cortex are remarkably consistent across different tasks and recording sessions. While magnitudes of neural variability differed dramatically across individual subjects, they were surprisingly stable across four tasks with different stimuli, temporal structures, and attentional/cognitive demands as well as across experimental sessions separated by one year. These experiments reveal that, in adults, neural variability magnitudes are mostly solidified individual characteristics that change little with task or time, and are likely to predispose individual subjects to exhibit distinct behavioral capabilities.\\n\\nSignificance statementBrain activity varies dramatically from one moment to the next. Recent research has revealed that humans exhibit different magnitudes of trial-by-trial neural variability, which explain differences in their perceptual performance. How stable are neural variability magnitudes over time and across tasks? Here, subjects performed four different experiments in two experimental sessions separated by one year. The results revealed that neural variability magnitudes were remarkably consistent over time and across tasks, suggesting that the magnitude of neural variability is a solidified neural characteristic that may predispose individual subjects to exhibit different behavioral capabilities.",

In this study we test if visual processing of self-faces is different from other faces, using psychophysics and eye-tracking. Specifically, the association between the psychophysical properties of self-face representation and visual processing strategies involved in self-face recognition was tested. Thirty-three adults performed a self-face recognition task from a series of self-other face morphs with simultaneous eye-tracking. Participants were found to look at lower part of the face for longer duration for self-face compared to other-face. Participants with a reduced overlap between self and other face representations, as indexed by a steeper slope of the psychometric response curve for self-face recognition, spent a greater proportion of time looking at the upper regions of faces identified as self. Additionally, the association of autism-related traits with self-face processing metrics was tested, since autism has previously been associated with atypical self-processing, particularly in the psychological domain. Autistic traits were associated with reduced looking time to both self and other faces. However, no self-face specific association was noted with autistic traits, suggesting that autism-related features may be related to self-processing in a domain specific manner.",

Multivariate analyses revealed two genetic clusters that separated males and females instead of showing the expected pattern of genetic differentiation among ecologically divergent (inshore vs. offshore in lobster) or geographically distant (east vs. west in Arctic Char) sampling locations. We created several subsamples artificially varying the sex ratio in the inshore/offshore and east/west groups, and then demonstrated that significant genetic differentiation could be observed despite panmixia for lobster, and that Fst values were overestimated for Arctic Char. This pattern was due to 12 and 94 sex-linked markers driving differentiation for lobster and Arctic Char, respectively. Removing sex-linked markers led to nonsignificant genetic structure (lobster) and a more accurate estimation of Fst (Arctic Char). We further characterized the putative functions of sex-linked markers. Given that only 9.6% of all marine/diadromous population genomic studies to date reported sex information, we urge researchers to collect and consider individual sex information. In summary, we argue that sex information is useful to (i) control sex ratio in sampling, (ii) overcome \\\"sex-ratio bias\\\" that can lead to spurious genetic differentiation signals and (iii) fill knowledge gaps regarding sex determining systems.",

    "abstract": "Pooling neural imaging data across subjects requires aligning recordings from different subjects. In magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, sensors across subjects are poorly correlated both because of differences in the exact location of the sensors, and structural and functional differences in the brains. It is possible to achieve alignment by assuming that the same regions of different brains correspond across subjects. However, this relies on both the assumption that brain anatomy and function are well correlated, and the strong assumptions that go into solving the underdetermined inverse problem given the high dimensional source space. In this paper, we investigated an alternative method that bypasses source-localization. Instead, it analyzes the sensor recordings themselves and aligns their temporal signatures across subjects. We used a multivariate approach, multi-set canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA), to transform individual subject data to a low dimensional common representational space. We evaluated the robustness of this approach over a synthetic dataset, by examining the effect of different factors that add to the noise and individual differences in the data. On a MEG dataset, we demonstrated that M-CCA performs better than a method that assumes perfect sensor correspondence and a method that applies source localization. Lastly, we described how the standard M-CCA algorithm could be further improved with a regularization term that incorporates spatial sensor information.",

Centromeric proteins are conserved among eukaryotes; however, centromeric DNA sequences are highly variable. We combined forward and reverse genetic approaches with chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify centromeres of the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Diatom centromere sequences contain low GC content regions and an abundance of long contiguous AT windows, but lack repeats or other conserved sequence features. Native and foreign sequences of similar GC content can maintain episomes and recruit the diatom centromeric histone protein CENP-A, suggesting non-native sequences can also function as diatom centromeres. Thus, simple sequence requirements enable DNA from foreign sources to incorporate into the nuclear genome repertoire as stable extra-chromosomal episomes, revealing a potential mechanism for bacterial and foreign eukaryotic DNA acquisition.",

Since the N-termini of proteins often contain regulatory and targeting information developing a robust method for start site identification is crucial. Ribosome profiling reads show distinct patterns of read length distributions around translation initiation sites. These patterns are typically lost in standard ribosome profiling analysis pipelines, when reads from footprints are adjusted to determine the specific codon being translated. Using these unique signatures we build a model capable of predicting translation initiation sites and demonstrate its high accuracy using N-terminal proteomics. Applying this to prokaryotic samples, we re-annotate translation initiation sites and provide evidence of N-terminal truncations and elongations of annotated coding sequences. These re-annotations are supported by the presence of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, structural and sequence based features and N-terminal peptides. Finally, our model identifies 61 novel genes previously undiscovered in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Many increasingly prevalent diseases share a common risk factor: age. However, little is known about pharmaceutical interventions against ageing, despite many genes and pathways shown to be important in the ageing process and numerous studies demonstrating that genetic interventions can lead to a healthier ageing phenotype. An important challenge is to assess the potential to repurpose existing drugs for initial testing on model organisms, where such experiments are possible. To this end, we present a new approach to rank drug-like compounds with known mammalian targets according to their likelihood to modulate ageing in the invertebrates C. elegans and Drosophila. Our approach combines information on genetic effects on ageing, orthology relationships and sequence conservation, 3D protein structures, drug binding and bioavailability. Overall, we rank 743 different drug-like compounds for their likelihood to modulate ageing. We provide various lines of evidence for the successful enrichment of our ranking for compounds modulating ageing, despite sparse public data suitable for validation. The top ranked compounds are thus prime candidates for in vivo testing of their effects on lifespan in C. elegans or Drosophila. As such, these compounds are promising as research tools and ultimately a step towards identifying drugs for a healthier human ageing.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle-regulated expression of histone genes is vital for coordination of DNA replication with chromatin assembly. In yeast, histone genes are regulated by transcriptional activation in S phase and transcriptional repression in other phases of the cell cycle, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a role for histone H2B monoubiquitylation (H2Bub1), a histone mark that is linked to RNA polymerase II transcription elongation, in the activation of replication-dependent histone genes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Loss of H2Bub1 is also associated with a delay in S phase progression and reduced expression of the replication initiation factor Cdc18 (ortholog of Cdc6). We provide evidence that H2Bub1 impacts histone gene transcription and acts through a mechanism that involves the 3UTR. Consistent with our previous finding that H2Bub1 is functionally opposed to the elongation factor Cdk9, we also find that the effects of H2Bub1 on histone genes are suppressed by reduction in the activity of Cdk9. Our data suggest that H2Bub1 promotes cell growth by activating cell cycle-regulated genes.",

    "abstract": "Trees represent the largest terrestrial carbon sink and a renewable source of ligno-cellulose. There is significant scope for yield and quality improvement in these largely undomesticated species, and efforts to engineer new, elite varieties will benefit from an improved understanding of the transcriptional network underlying cambial growth and wood formation. We generated high-spatial-resolution RNA Sequencing data spanning the secondary phloem, vascular cambium and wood forming tissues. The transcriptome comprised 28,294 expressed, previously annotated genes, 78 novel protein-coding genes and 567 long intergenic non-coding RNAs. Most paralogs originating from the Salicaceae whole genome duplication were found to have diverged expression, with the notable exception of those with high expression during secondary cell wall deposition. Co-expression network analysis revealed that the regulation of the transcriptome underlying cambial growth and wood formation comprises numerous modules forming a continuum of active processes across the tissues. The high spatial resolution enabled identification of novel roles for characterised genes involved in xylan and cellulose biosynthesis, regulators of xylem vessel and fiber differentiation and lignification. The associated web resource (AspWood, http://aspwood.popgenie.org) integrates the data within a set of interactive tools for exploring the expression profiles and co-expression network.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are crucial for signal transduction in a variety of pathways, including Hedgehog and Wnt. Disruption of primary cilia formation (ciliogenesis) is linked to numerous developmental disorders (known as ciliopathies) and diseases, including cancer. The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) component UBR5 was previously identified as a putative modulator of ciliogenesis in a functional genomics screen. UBR5 is an E3 Ubiquitin ligase that is frequently deregulated in tumours, but its biological role in cancer is largely uncharacterised, partly due to a lack of understanding of interacting proteins and pathways. We validated the effect of UBR5 depletion on primary cilia formation using a robust model of ciliogenesis, and identified CSPP1, a centrosomal and ciliary protein required for cilia formation, as a UBR5-interacting protein. We show that UBR5 ubiquitylates CSPP1, and that UBR5 is required for cytoplasmic organization of CSPP1-comprising centriolar satellites in centrosomal periphery. Hence, we have established a key role for UBR5 in ciliogenesis that may have important implications in understanding cancer pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The identification of connexel-wise associations, which involves examining functional connectivities between pairwise voxels across the whole brain, is both statistically and computationally challenging. Although such a connexel-wise methodology has recently been adopted by brain-wide association studies (BWAS) to identify connectivity changes in several mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism and depression [Cheng et al., 2015a,b, 2016], the multiple correction and power analysis methods designed specifically for connexel-wise analysis are still lacking. Therefore, we herein report the development of a rigorous statistical framework for connexel-wise significance testing based on the Gaussian random field theory. It includes controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) of multiple hypothesis testings using topological inference methods, and calculating power and sample size for a connexel-wise study. Our theoretical framework can control the false-positive rate accurately, as validated empirically using two resting-state fMRI datasets. Compared with Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR), it can reduce false-positive rate and increase statistical power by appropriately utilizing the spatial information of fMRI data. Importantly, our method considerably reduces the computational complexity of a permutation-or simulation-based approach, thus, it can efficiently tackle large datasets with ultra-high resolution images. The utility of our method is shown in a case-control study. Our approach can identify altered functional connectivities in a major depression disorder dataset, whereas existing methods failed.
