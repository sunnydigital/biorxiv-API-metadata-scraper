    "abstract": "A novel strategy for controlling the spread of arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya is to transform mosquito populations with virus-suppressing Wolbaehia. In general, Wolbachia transinfected into mosquitoes induce fitness costs through lower viability or fecundity. These maternally inherited bacteria also produce a frequency-dependent advantage for infected females by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which kills the embryos produced by uninfected females mated to infected males. These competing effects, a frequency-dependent advantage and frequency-independent costs, produce bistable Wolbachia frequency dynamics. Above a threshold frequency, denoted p, CI drives fitness-decreasing Wolbachia transinfections through local populations; but below p, infection frequencies tend to decline to zero. If p is not too high, CI also drives spatial spread once infections become established over sufficiently large areas. We illustrate how simple models provide testable predictions concerning the spatial and temporal dynamics of Wolbachia introductions, focusing on rate of spatial spread, the shape of spreading waves, and the conditions for initiating spread from local introductions. First, we consider the robustness of diffusion-based predictions to incorporating two important features of wMel-Aedes aegypti biology that may be inconsistent with the diffusion approximations, namely fast local dynamics induced by complete CI (i.e., all embryos produced from incompatible crosses die) and long-tailed, non-Gaussian dispersal. With complete CI, our numerical analyses show that long-tailed dispersal changes wave-width predictions only slightly; but it can significantly reduce wave speed relative to the diffusion prediction; it also allows smaller local introductions to initiate spatial spread. Second, we use approximations for[p] and dispersal distances to predict the outcome of 2013 releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti in Cairns, Australia, Third, we describe new data from Aedes aegypti populations near Cairns, Australia that demonstrate long-distance dispersal and provide an approximate lower bound on p for wMel in northeastern Australia. Finally, we apply our analyses to produce operational guidelines for efficient transformation of vector populations over large areas. We demonstrate that even very slow spatial spread, on the order of 10-20 m/month (as predicted), can produce area-wide population transformation within a few years following initial releases covering about 20-30% of the target area.",

Given the successes of human GWAS in understanding disease aetiology and identifying potential drug targets, microbial GWAS is likely to further advance our understanding of infectious diseases. By building on the success of GWAS, microbial GWAS have the potential to rapidly provide important insights into pressing global health problems, such as antibiotic resistance and disease transmission.

    "abstract": "Humans can meaningfully report their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.",

    "abstract": "In a companion paper, we carried out a high-throughput screen to identify genes that suppressed cell-to-cell variability in signaling in yeast. Two genes affected cytoplasmic microtubules that can connect the nucleus to a signaling site on the membrane. Here, we show that microtubule perturbations that affected polymerization and depolymerization, membrane attachment, and force generation increased variability. For some perturbations, \\\"outlier\\\" cells drove the increased variability. Bypass experiments that activated the PRS ectopically at downstream points indicated that microtubule-dependent processes might stabilize the membrane-recruited scaffold protein Ste5. The variability caused by microtubule perturbations required the MAP kinase Fus3. Microtubule perturbations hindered stable scaffold formation and decreased the accuracy of a polarity-dependent fate choice. Our experiments suggest that membrane-attached microtubules stabilize signaling by scaffold-bound Fus3, and are consistent with a model in which signaling irregularities from changes in microtubule function are amplified by cross-stimulatory feedbacks among PRS proteins. The fact that microtubule perturbations also cause aberrant fate and polarity decisions during embryonic development and cancer initiation suggests that similar variation-reducing processes might also operate in metazoans.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of antibiotic resistance presents a practical and theoretical challenge: the design of strategies that limit the risk of evolved resistance while effectively treating current patients. Sequentially cycling antibiotics has been proposed as a way to slow the evolution of resistance by reducing the extent of adaptation to a given drug, and clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in some settings. Empirical fitness landscapes in theory allow the sequence of drugs to be refined to maximize tradeoffs between drugs and thereby slow adaptation even further. Using the measured growth rates of 16 genotypes of Escherichia coli in the presence of {beta}-lactam antibiotics, we test an adaptive strategy, based on a Markov chain transition matrix, to select drug sequences that continuously minimize resistance. Cycling is never selected over the long term. Instead, monotherapy with the antibiotic that permits the least growth in its landscapes absorbing state is rapidly selected from different starting conditions. Analysis of a synthetic fitness landscape shows that cycling drugs that induce sensitivity to one other could, in theory, outperform monotherapy. These results underscore the importance of considering the specific topologies of fitness landscape in determining whether to cycle drugs and suggest a general computational approach to identify high performing, practical strategies to manage resistance.",

    "abstract": "The decision-making process is exposed to modulatory factors, and, according to the expected value (EV) concept the two most influential factors are magnitude of prospective behavioural outcome and probability of receiving this outcome. The discrepancy between received and predicted outcomes is reflected by the reward prediction error (RPE), which is believed to play a crucial role in learning in dynamic environment. Feedback related negativity (FRN), a frontocentral negative component registered in EEG during feedback presentation, has been suggested as a neural signature of RPE. In modern neurobiological models of decision-making the primary sensory input is assumed to be constant over the time and independent of the evaluation of the option associated to it. In this study we investigated whether the electrophysiological changes in auditory cues perception is modulated by the strengths of reinforcement signal, represented in the EEG as FRN.\\n\\nWe quantified the changes in sensory processing through a classical passive oddball paradigm before and after performance a neuroeconomic monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Outcome magnitude and probability were encoded in the physical characteristics of auditory incentive cues. We evaluated the association between individual biomarkers of reinforcement signal (FRN) and the degree of perceptual learning, reflected by changes in auditory ERP components (mismatch negativity and P3a). We observed a significant correlation of MMN and valence - dFRN, reflecting differential processing of gains and omission of gains. Changes in P3a were correlated to probability - dFRN, including information on salience of the outcome, in addition to its valence.\\n\\nMID task performance evokes plastic changes associated with more fine-grained discrimination of auditory anticipatory cues and enhanced involuntary attention switch towards these cues. Observed signatures of neuro-plasticity of the auditory cortex may play an important role in learning and decision-making processes through facilitation of perceptual discrimination of valuable external stimuli. Thus, the sensory processing of options and the evaluation of options are not independent as implicitly assumed by the modern neuroeconomics models of decision-making.",

We show that toxic exposure in one generation of hosts leads to selection of resistant bacteria, which in turn, increases the toxic tolerance of the hosts offspring. Prolonged exposure to toxin over many host generations promotes additional form of emergent adaptation due to selection of hosts based on detox capabilities of their bacterial community as a whole (as opposed to properties of individual bacteria).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings show that interactions between pure Darwinian selections of host and its bacteria can give rise to emergent adaptive capabilities, including Lamarckian-like adaptation of the host-microbiome system.",

However, it is important to determine when and how it is appropriate to use this resource. We used Scotland as a case study to validate the use of data from Flickr as an indicator of NbR on a national scale and at several regional spatial and temporal resolutions. We compared Flickr photographs to visitor statistics in the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) and determined whether temporal variability in photo counts could be explained by known annual estimates of CNP visitor numbers. We then used a unique recent national survey of nature recreation in Scotland to determine whether the spatial distribution of Flickr photos could be explained by known spatial variability in nature use. Following this validation work, we used Flickr data to identify hotspots of wildlife watching in Scotland and investigated how they changed between 2005 and 2015.We found that spatial and temporal patterns in Flickr count are explained by measures of visitation obtained through surveys and that this relationship is reliable down to a 10 Km scale resolution. Our findings have implications for planning and management of NbR as they suggest that photographs uploaded on Flickr reflect patterns of NbR at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant for ecosystem management.",

We find the complete PRDM9 ortholog across distantly related vertebrates but, despite this broad conservation, infer a minimum of six partial and three complete losses. Strikingly, taxa carrying the complete ortholog of PRDM9 are precisely those with rapid evolution of its predicted binding affinity, suggesting that all domains are necessary for directing recombination. Indeed, as we show, swordtail fish carrying only a partial but conserved ortholog share recombination properties with PRDM9 knock-outs.",

    "abstract": "Noncoding markers have a particular appeal as tools for phylogenomic analysis because, at least in vertebrates, they appear less subject to strong variation in GC content among lineages. Thus far, ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and introns have been the most widely used noncoding markers. Here we analyze and study the evolutionary properties of a new type of noncoding marker, conserved non-exonic elements (CNEEs), which consists of noncoding elements that are estimated to evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species. Although they often include UCEs, CNEEs are distinct from UCEs because they are not ultraconserved, and, most importantly, the core region alone is analyzed, rather than both the core and its flanking regions. Using a data set of 16 birds plus an alligator outgroup, and ~3600 - ~3800 loci per marker type, we found that although CNEEs were less variable than UCEs or introns and in some cases exhibited a slower approach to branch resolution as determined by phylogenomic subsampling, the quality of CNEE alignments was superior to those of the other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species. Phylogenetic resolution using coalescent approaches was comparable among the three marker types, with most nodes being fully and congruently resolved. Comparison of phylogenetic results across the three marker types indicated that one branch, the sister group to the passerine+falcon clade, was resolved differently and with moderate (> 70%) bootstrap support between CNEEs and UCEs or introns. Overall, CNEEs appear to be promising as phylogenomic markers, yielding phylogenetic resolution as high as for UCEs and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments and with patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis.",

The ability to detect ancient natural selection in the human genome could provide insights into the molecular basis for these human-specific traits. Here, we introduce a method for detecting ancient selective sweeps by scanning for extended genomic regions where our closest extinct relatives, Neandertals and Denisovans, fall outside of the present-day human variation. Regions that are unusually long indicate the presence of lineages that reached fixation in the human population faster than expected under neutral evolution. Using simulations we show that the method is able to detect ancient events of positive selection and that it can differentiate those from background selection. Applying our method to the 1000 Genomes dataset, we find evidence for ancient selective sweeps favoring regulatory changes and present a list of genomic regions that are predicted to underlie positively selected human specific traits.",

Within most major clades, body size distributions follow a right-skewed pattern where most species are relatively small while a few are orders of magnitude larger than the median size. Using a novel database of 742 extant and extinct primate species sizes over the past 66 million years, we find that primates exhibit the opposite pattern: a left-skewed distribution. We investigate the long-term evolution of this distribution, first showing that the initial size radiation is consistent with plesiadapiformes (an extinct group with an uncertain ancestral relationship to primates) being ancestral to modern primates. We calculate the strength of Copes Rule, showing an initial tendency for descendants to increase in size relative to ancestors until the trend reverses 40 million years ago. We explore when the primate size distribution becomes left-skewed and study correlations between body size patterns and climactic trends, showing that across Old and New World radiations the body size distribution initially exhibits a right-skewed pattern. Left-skewness emerged early in Old World primates in a manner consistent with a previously unidentified possible maximum body size, which may be mechanistically related to primates encephalization and complex social groups.",

    "abstract": "We describe the construction and initial characterization of genomic resources (a set of recombinant DNA libraries, representing in total over 90,000 independent plasmid clones), originating from the genome of a hamster adapted hookworm, Ancylostoma ceylanicum. First, with the improved methodology, we generated sets of SL1 (5 -linker - GGTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG), and captured cDNAs from two different hookworm developmental stages: pre-infective L3 and parasitic adults. Second, we constructed a small insert (2-10kb) genomic library. Third, we generated a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome library (30-60kb). To evaluate the quality of our libraries we characterized sequence tags on randomly chosen clones and with first pass screening we generated almost a hundred novel hookworm sequence tags. The sequence tags detected two broad classes of genes: i. conserved nematode genes and ii. putative hookworm-specific proteins. Importantly, some of the identified genes encode proteins of general interest including potential targets for hookworm control. Additionally, we identified a syntenic region in the mitochondrial genome, where the gene order is shared between the free-living nematode C. elegans and A. ceylanicum. Our results validate the use of recombinant DNA resources for comparative genomics of nematodes, including the free-living genetic model organism C. elegans and closely related parasitic species. We discuss the potential and relevance of Ancylostoma ceylanicum data and resources generated by the recombinant DNA approach.",

    "abstract": "A recent discovery have demonstrated that herbivore induced plant volatile compounds from apple tree infested with leafrollers were highly attractive to con-specific adult male and female leafrollers. However, this work has been conducted in New Zealand and Canada testing only low doses of kairomone. This study has been conducted in US to assess the attractiveness of higher doses of the six apple volatiles provisory identified in apple trees infested by tortricid larvaeto the leafroller, Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott. These volatiles included, {beta}-caryophyllene, germacrene D, benzyl alcohol, phenylacetonitrile, (E)-nerolidol, and indole. No volatiles were attractive to P. pyrusana when used alone. However, traps baited with phenylacetonitrile plus acetic acid caught both sexes of P. pyrusana. Traps baited with the other volatiles plus acetic acid caught zero to only incidental numbers of moths, [&le;] 1.0. Adding phenylacetonitrile to traps baited with pear ester, ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate plus acetic acid significantly reduced catches of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). However, adding phenylacetonitrile to traps baited with codling moth sex pheromone, pear ester, and acetic acid did not similarly reduce moth catches of C. pomonella. Interestingly, traps baited with phenylacetonitrile plus acetic acid caught significantly more P. pyrusana than traps baited with a commercial sex pheromone lure. The evaporation rate of the acetic acid co-lure was an important factor affecting catches of P. pyrusana with phenylacetonitrile, and studies are needed to optimize the emission rates of both lure components. Further studies are warranted to develop phenylacetonitrile and possibly other aromatic plant volatiles as bisexual lures for the range of tortricid pests attacking horticultural crops.",

    "abstract": "Draining 31 states and roughly 3 million km2, the Mississippi River (MSR) and its tributaries constitute an essential resource to millions of people for clean drinking water, transportation, agriculture, and industry. Since the turn of the 20th century, MSR water quality has continually rated poorly due to human activity. Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, OTUs, and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL. Within MSR microbial assemblages we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate. This study offers the most comprehensive view of MSR microbiota to date, provides important groundwork for higher resolution microbial studies of river perturbation, and identifies potential microbial indicators of river health related to eutrophication.",

    "abstract": "Functionally distinct regions of the brain are thought to possess a characteristic connectional fingerprint - a profile of incoming and outgoing connections that defines the function of that area. This observation has motivated efforts to subdivide cortical and subcortical areas using their patterns of connectivity. However, it remains unclear whether these connectomically-defined subregions of the brain can be distinguished at the molecular level. Here, we combine high-resolution diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with comprehensive transcriptomic data to show that connectomically-defined subregions of the striatum carry distinct transcriptional signatures. Using data-driven clustering of diffusion tractography, seeded from the striatum, in 100 healthy individuals, we identify a tripartite organization of the caudate and putamen that comprises ventral, dorsal, and caudal subregions. We then use microarray data of gene expression levels in 19 343 genes, taken from 98 tissue samples distributed throughout the striatum, to accurately discriminate the three connectomically-defined subregions with 80-90% classification accuracy using linear support vector machines. This classification accuracy was robust at the group and individual level. Genes contributing strongly to the classification were enriched for gene ontology categories including dopamine signaling, glutamate secretion, response to amphetamine, and metabolic pathways, and were implicated in risk for disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinsons disease. Our findings highlight a close link between regional variations in transcriptional activity and interregional connectivity in the brain, and suggest that there may be a strong genomic signature of connectomically-defined subregions of the brain.",
