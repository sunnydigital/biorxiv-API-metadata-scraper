    "abstract": "For the heterologous gene expression systems, the codon bias has to be optimized according to the host for efficient expression. Although DNA viruses show a correlation on codon bias with their hosts, HIV genes show low correlation for both nucleotide composition and codon usage bias with its human host which limits the efficient expression of HIV genes. Despite this variation, HIV is efficient at infecting hosts and multiplying in large number. In this study, first, the degree of codon adaptation is calculated as codon adaptation index (CAI) and compared with the expected threshold value (eCAI) determined from the sequences with the same nucleotide composition as that of the HIV-1 genome. Then, information theoretic analysis of nine genes of HIV-1 based on codon statistics of the HIV-1 genome, individual genes and codon usage of human genes is done. Comparison of codon adaptation indices with their respective threshold values shows that the CAI lies very close to the threshold values. Despite not being well adapted to the codon usage bias of human hosts, it was found that the Shannon entropies of the nine genes based on overall codon statistics of HIV-1 genome are very similar to the entropies calculated from codon usage of human genes. Similarly, for the HIV-1 genome sequence analyzed, the codon statistics of the third reading frame has the highest bias representing minimum entropy and hence the maximum information.",

    "abstract": "Long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can silence genes of matching sequence upon ingestion in many invertebrates and is therefore being developed as a pesticide. Such feeding RNA interference (RNAi) is best understood in the worm C. elegans, where it is thought that derivatives of ingested dsRNA, including short dsRNAs, move between cells and cause systemic silencing. Movement of short dsRNAs has been inferred using tissue-specific rescue of the long dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 by expressing it from repetitive transgenes. We found that the use of repetitive transgenes for the tissue-specific rescue of a gene could inhibit RNAi within that tissue and could result in misexpression of the gene in other tissues. Both inhibition and misexpression were not detectable when a single-copy transgene was used for tissue-specific rescue. In animals with single-copy rescue of RDE-4, RNAi was restricted to the tissue with RDE-4 expression. Thus, unlike previous observations using repetitive transgenes, these results suggest that binding of long dsRNA by RDE-4 in each silenced cell is required for systemic RNAi. Taken together with the requirement for long dsRNA to trigger RNAi in insects, these results suggest that the entry of long dsRNA is a necessary first step for feeding RNAi in animal cells.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell time-lapse microscopy have revealed non-genetic heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations of cellular phenotypes. While different phenotypic traits such as abundance of growth-related proteins in single cells may have differential effects on the reproductive success of cells, rigorous experimental quantification of this process has remained elusive due to the complexity of single cell physiology within the context of a proliferating population. We introduce and apply a practical empirical method to quantify the fitness landscapes of arbitrary phenotypic traits, using genealogical data in the form of population lineage trees which can include phenotypic data of various kinds. Our inference methodology for fitness landscapes determines how reproductivity is correlated to cellular phenotypes, and provides a natural generalization of bulk growth rate measures for single-cell histories. Using this technique, we quantify the strength of selection acting on different cellular phenotypic traits within populations, which allows us to determine whether a change in population growth is caused by individual cells response, selection within a population, or by a mixture of these two processes. By applying these methods to single-cell time-lapse data of growing bacterial populations that express a resistance-conferring protein under antibiotic stress, we show how the distributions, fitness landscapes, and selection strength of single-cell phenotypes are affected by the drug. Our work provides a unified and practical framework for quantitative measurements of fitness landscapes and selection strength for any statistical quantities definable on lineages, and thus elucidates the adaptive significance of phenotypic states in time series data. The method is applicable in diverse fields, from single cell biology to stem cell differentiation and viral evolution.",

    "abstract": "Parasites with complex life cycles have developed numerous phenotypic strategies, closely associated with developmental events, to enable the exploitation of different ecological niches and facilitate transmission between hosts. How these environmental shifts are regulated from a metabolic and physiological standpoint, however, still remain to be fully elucidated. We examined the transcriptomic response of Schistocephalus solidus, a trophically-transmitted parasite with a complex life cycle, over the course of its development in an intermediate host, the threespine stickleback, and the final avian host. Results from our differential gene expression analysis show major reprogramming events among developmental stages. The final host stage is characterized by a strong activation of reproductive pathways and redox homeostasis. The attainment of infectivity in the fish intermediate host - which precedes sexual maturation in the final host and is associated with host behaviour changes - is marked by transcription of genes involved in neural pathways and sensory perception. Our results suggest that un-annotated and S. solidus-specific genes could play a determinant role in host-parasite molecular interactions required to complete the parasites life cycle. Our results permit future comparative analyses to help disentangle species-specific patterns of infection from conserved mechanisms, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the molecular control and evolution of complex life cycles.",

    "abstract": "High-order epistasis has been observed in many genotype-phenotype maps. These multi-way interactions between mutations may be useful for dissecting complex traits and could have profound implications for evolution. Alternatively, they could be a statistical artifact. High-order epistasis models assume the effects of mutations should add, when they could in fact multiply or combine in some other nonlinear way. A mismatch in the \\\"scale\\\" of the epistasis model and the scale of the underlying map would lead to spurious epistasis. In this paper, we develop an approach to estimate the nonlinear scales of arbitrary genotype-phenotype maps. We can then linearize these maps and extract high-order epistasis. We investigated seven experimental genotype-phenotype maps for which high-order epistasis had been reported previously. We find that five of the seven maps exhibited nonlinear scales. Interestingly, even after accounting for nonlinearity, we found statistically significant high-order epistasis in all seven maps. The contributions of high-order epistasis to the total variation ranged from 2.2% to 31.0%, with an average across maps of 12.7%. Our results provide strong evidence for extensive high-order epistasis, even after nonlinear scale is taken into account. Further, we describe a simple method to estimate and account for nonlinearity in genotype-phenotype maps.",

The ADAGE method, which performs unsupervised integration with neural networks, can effectively identify biological patterns, but because ADAGE models, like many neural networks, are over-parameterized, different ADAGE models perform equally well. To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa compendium containing experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB. While we expected PhoB activity in limiting phosphate conditions, our analyses found PhoB activity in other media with moderate phosphate and predicted that a second stimulus provided by the sensor kinase, KinB, is required for PhoB activation in this setting. We validated this relationship using both targeted and unbiased genetic approaches. eADAGE, which captures stable biological patterns, enables cross-experiment comparisons that can highlight measured but undiscovered relationships.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system provides unprecedented genome editing capabilities. However, off-target effects lead to sub-optimal usage and additionally are a bottleneck in development of therapeutic uses. Herein, we introduce the first machine learning-based approach to this problem, yielding a state-of-the-art predictive model for CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects which outperforms all other guide design services. Our approach, Elevation, consists of two inter-related machine learning models--one for scoring individual guide-target pairs and another which aggregates guide-target scores into a single, overall guide summary score. Through systematic investigation, we demonstrate that Elevation performs substantially better than competing approaches on both of these tasks. Additionally, we are the first to systematically evaluate approaches on the guide summary score problem; we show that the most widely-used method (and one re-implemented by several other servers) performs no better than random at times, whereas Elevation consistently outperformed it, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In our analyses, we also introduce a method to balance errors on truly active guides with those which are truly inactive, encapsulating a range of practical use cases, thereby showing that Elevation is consistently superior across the entire range. We thus contribute a new evaluation metric for benchmarking off-target modeling. Finally, because of the large computational demands of our tasks, we have developed a cloud-based service for end-to-end guide design which incorporates our previously reported on-target model, Azimuth, as well as our new off-target model, Elevation.",

The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis.

However, interpreting these recordings is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is largely stymied by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which are typically larger than the signals of interest. We develop a novel computational framework to estimate and subtract away this contaminating artifact, enabling the large-scale analysis of responses of possibly hundreds of cells to tailored stimulation. Importantly, we suggest that this technology may also be helpful for the development of future high-resolution neural prosthetic devices (e.g., retinal prostheses).",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate endurance capacity is a phenotype with considerable genetic heterogeneity. RNA-Seq technologies are an ideal tool to investigate the involved genes and processes, but several challenges exist when the phenotype of interest has a complex genetic background. Difficulties manifest at the level of results interpretation because commonly used statistical methods are designed to identify strongly associated genes. If an observed phenotype can be achieved though multiple distinct genetic mechanisms then typical gene-centric methods come with the attached risk that signal may be lost or misconstrued.\\n\\nGene set analysis (GSA) methods are now widely accepted as a means to address some of the shortcomings of gene-by-gene analysis methods. We carry out both gene level and gene set level analyses on Xenopus tropicalis to identify the genetic factors that contribute to endurance heterogeneity. A typical workflow might consider gene level and pathway level analyses, but in this work we propose an additional focus at the intermediate level of functional modules. We generate functional modules for GSA testing in order to be explicit in how ontology information is used with respect to the functional genomics of Xenopus. Additionally, we make use of multiple assemblies to corroborate implicated genes and processes.\\n\\nWe identified 42 core genes, 10 functional modules, and 14 pathways based on gene expression differences between endurant and non-endurant frogs. The majority of the genes and processes are readily associated with muscle contraction or catabolism. A substantial number of these genes are involved in lipid metabolic processes, suggesting an important role in frog endurance heterogeneity. Unsurprisingly, many of the gene expression differences between endurant and non-endurant frogs can be distilled down to the capacity to utilize substrate for energy, but at the individual level frogs appear to make use of diverse machinery to achieve these differences.",

Full-length uPAR is released from the cell surface, but the mechanism and functional significance of uPAR release remain obscure. Here we show that transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase GDE3 is a GPI-specific phospholipase C that cleaves and releases uPAR with consequent loss of the proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities of uPAR. In breast cancer cells, high GDE3 expression depletes endogenous uPAR resulting in a less transformed phenotype, correlating with higher survival probability in patients. Our results establish GDE3 as a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network and, more generally, highlight GPI-anchor hydrolysis as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to alter cell behavior.",

Databases collecting drug targets and gene annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric disorders. We used GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group and a repositioning model for schizophrenia by testing the enrichment of antipsychotics. As sample size increases, schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 162 Bonferroni-significant druggable genes, and 128 FDR-significant biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS results.",

In both states, the ArfA C-terminus occupies the mRNA tunnel downstream of the A site. One state contains a compact inactive RF2 conformation, hitherto unobserved in 70S termination complexes. Ordering of the ArfA N-terminus in the second state rearranges RF2 into an extended conformation that docks the catalytic GGQ motif into the peptidyl-transferase center.

    "abstract": "Nus factors are broadly conserved across bacterial species, and are often essential for viability. A complex of five Nus factors (NusB, NusE, NusA, NusG and SuhB) is considered to be a dedicated regulator of ribosomal RNA folding, and has been shown to prevent Rho-dependent transcription termination. We have established the first cellular function for the Nus factor complex beyond regulation of ribosomal assembly: repression of the Nus factor-encoding gene, suhB. This repression occurs by translation inhibition followed by Rho-dependent transcription termination. Thus, the Nus factor complex can prevent or promote Rho activity depending on the gene context. Extensive conservation of NusB/E binding sites upstream of nus factor genes suggests that Nus factor autoregulation occurs in many species. Putative NusB/E binding sites are also found upstream of many other genes in diverse species, and we demonstrate Nus factor regulation of one such gene in Citrobacter koseri. We conclude that Nus factors have an evolutionarily widespread regulatory function beyond ribosomal RNA, and that they are often autoregulatory.",

    "abstract": "Subthreshold (membrane potential) resonance and phasonance (preferred amplitude and zero-phase responses to oscillatory inputs) in single neurons arise from the interaction between positive and negative feedback effects provided by relatively fast amplifying currents and slower resonant currents. In 2D neuronal systems, amplifying currents are required to be slaved to voltage (instantaneously fast) for these phenomena to occur. In higher dimensional systems, additional currents operating at various effective time scales may modulate and annihilate existing resonances and generate antiresonance (minimum amplitude response) and antiphasonance (zero-phase response with phase monotonic properties opposite to phasonance). We use mathematical modeling, numerical simulations and dynamical systems tools to investigate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena in 3D linear models, which are obtained as the linearization of biophysical (conductance-based) models. We characterize the parameter regimes for which the system exhibits the various types of behavior mentioned above in the rather general case in which the underlying 2D system exhibits resonance. We consider two cases: (i) the interplay of two resonant gating variables, and (ii) the interplay of one resonant and one amplifying gating variables. Increasing levels of an amplifying current cause (i) a response amplification if the amplifying current is faster than the resonant current, (ii) resonance and phasonance attenuation and annihilation if the amplifying and resonant currents have identical dynamics, and (iii) antiresonance and antiphasonance if the amplifying current is slower than the resonant current. We investigate the underlying mechanisms by extending the envelope-plane diagram approach developed in previous work (for 2D systems) to three dimensions to include the additional gating variable, and constructing the corresponding envelope curves in these envelope-space diagrams. We find that antiresonance and antiphasonance emerge as the result of an asymptotic boundary layer problem in the frequency domain created by the different balances between the intrinsic time constants of the cell and the input frequency f as it changes. For large enough values of f the envelope curves are quasi-2D and the impedance profile decrease with the input frequency. In contrast, for f << 1 the dynamics is quasi-1D and the impedance profile increases above the limiting value in the other regime. Antiresonance is created because the continuity of the solution requires the impedance profile to connect the portions belonging to the two regimes. If in doing so the phase profile crosses the zero value, then antiphasonance is also generated.",

In order to gain insight on the evolution of senescence, we looked at its presence in developing axolotls (urodele amphibians) and in zebrafish (teleost fish), which are both anamniotes. Our data indicate that cellular senescence is present in various developing structures in axolotls (pronephros, olfactory nerve fascicles, lateral organs, gums) and in zebrafish (epithelium of the yolk sac and in the lower part of the gut). Senescence was particularly associated with transient structures (pronephros in axolotls & yolk sac in zebrafish) suggesting that it plays a role in the elimination of these tissues. Our data supports the notion that cellular senescence evolved early in vertebrate evolution to influence embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Progress in modern neuroscience critically depends on our ability to observe the activity of large neuronal populations with cellular spatial and high temporal resolution. However, two bottlenecks constrain efforts towards fast imaging of large populations. First, the resulting large video data is challenging to analyze. Second, there is an explicit tradeoff between imaging speed, signal-to-noise, and field of view: with current recording technology we cannot image very large neuronal populations with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution.\\n\\nHere we describe multi-scale approaches for alleviating both of these bottlenecks. First, we show that spatial and temporal decimation techniques provide order-of-magnitude speedups in spatiotemporally demixing calcium video data into estimates of single-cell neural activity. Second, once the shapes of individual neurons have been identified (e.g., after an initial phase of conventional imaging with standard temporal and spatial resolution), we find that the spatial/temporal resolution tradeoff shifts dramatically: after demixing we can accurately recover neural activity from data that has been spatially decimated by an order of magnitude. This offers a cheap method for compressing this large video data, and also implies that it is possible to either speed up imaging significantly, or to \\\"zoom out\\\" by a corresponding factor to image order-of-magnitude larger neuronal populations with minimal loss in accuracy or temporal resolution.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe voxel rate of imaging systems ultimately sets the limit on the speed of data acquisition. These limits often mean that only a small fraction of the activity of large neuronal populations can be observed at high spatio-temporal resolution. For imaging of very large populations with single cell resolution, temporal resolution is typically sacrificed. Here we propose a multi-scale approach to achieve single cell precision using fast imaging at reduced spatial resolution. In the first phase the spatial location and shape of each neuron is obtained at standard spatial resolution; in the second phase imaging is performed at much lower spatial resolution. We show that we can apply a demixing algorithm to accurately recover each neurons activity from the low-resolution data by exploiting the high-resolution cellular maps estimated in the first imaging phase. Thus by decreasing the spatial resolution in the second phase, we can compress the video data significantly, and potentially acquire images over an order-of-magnitude larger area, or image at significantly higher temporal resolution, with minimal loss in accuracy of the recovered neuronal activity. We evaluate this approach on real data from light-sheet and 2-photon calcium imaging.",

    "abstract": "Most animals employ telomerase, which consists of a catalytic subunit known as the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and an RNA template, to maintain telomere ends. Given the importance of TERT and the apparent importance of telomere biology in core metazoan life history traits like ageing and the control of somatic cell proliferation, we hypothesised that TERT would have patterns of sequence and regulatory evolution reflecting adaptations to diverse evolutionary and life histories across the Animal Kingdom. To test this, we performed a complete investigation of the evolutionary history of TERT across animals. We show that although TERT is almost ubiquitous across Metazoa, it has undergone substantial sequence evolution in canonical motifs. Beyond the known canonical motifs, we also identify and compare regions that are highly variable between lineages, but for which conservation exists within phyla. Recent data have highlighted the importance of alternate splice forms of TERT in non-canonical functions in some animals. Although animals may share some conserved introns, we find that the selection of exons for alternative splicing appears to be highly variable, and regulation by alternative splicing appears to be a very dynamic feature of TERT evolution. We show that even within a closely related group of triclad flatworms, where alternative splicing of TERT was previously correlated with reproductive strategy, we observe highly diverse alternative splicing patterns. Our work establishes that the evolutionary history and structural evolution of TERT involves previously unappreciated levels of change, supporting the view that this core eukaryotic protein has adapted to the requirements of diverse animal life histories.",

    "abstract": "In birds the construction of germline chimeras by grafting exogenous primordial germ cells (PGCs) during embryonic development is feasible since they migrate to the gonads through the blood. Up to date, the efficiencies are highly variable, in part dependent on the destruction of endogenous PGCs in the recipient embryo. We show an almost complete ablation of the endogenous PGCs in stage X embryos using a baby rabbit serum (BRS), with previous cellular signaling by specific antibodies (SSEA1). The application of the treatments, either on epiblast or subgerminaly, produced the reduction of the PGCs in the embryos in a dose dependent manner. No malformations or damages were detected in the treated embryos. However, subgerminal injection of this cocktail produced a massive cellular destruction in all embryos. Therefore, sequential application is a selective and effective method to produce receptor embryos. Nevertheless, it can also be highly destructive if the mixture is applied locally, this could be useful in the treatment of malignancies.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTAn immunosurgery procedure is described that yields an almost complete ablation of primordial germ cells in early developing chick embryos, thus increasing the expected rates of chimerism when foreign PGCs are grafted onto these embryos",

    "abstract": "Inference of demography and mutation rates is of major interest but difficult because genetic data is only informative about the population mutation rate, the product of the effective population size times the mutation rate, and not about these quantities individually. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by combining genetic data with pedigree information. To successfully use pedigree data, however, important aspects of real populations such as the presence of two sexes, unbalanced sex ratios and overlapping generations have to be taken into account. We present here an extension of the classic Wright-Fisher model accounting for these effects and show that the coalescent process under this model reduces to the classic Kingman coalescent with specific scaling parameters. We further derive the probability of a pedigree under that model and show how pedigree data can thus be used to infer demographic parameters. Finally, we present a computationally efficient inference approach combining pedigree information and genetic data summarized by the site frequency spectrum (SFS) that allows for the joint inference of the mutation rate, sex-specific population sizes and the fraction of overlapping generations. Using simulations we then show that these parameters can be accurately inferred from pedigrees spanning just a few generations, as are available for many species. We finally discuss future possible extensions of the model and inference framework necessary for applications to wild and domesticated species, namely the account for more complex demographies and the uncertainty in assigning pedigree individuals to specific generations.",

However current systems biology datasets have focused in the laboratory reference strain H37Rv. By using large expression datasets testing the role of almost two hundred transcription factors, we have constructed computational models to grab the expression dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv genes. However, we have found that many of those transcription factors are deleted or likely dysfunctional across strains of the MTBC. In accordance, we failed to predict expression changes in strains with a different genetic background when compared with experimental data.

    "abstract": "Observable patterns of cultural variation are consistently intertwined with demic movements, cultural diffusion, and adaptation to different ecological contexts (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981; Boyd and Richerson 1985). The quantitative study of gene-culture co-evolution has focused in particular on the mechanisms responsible for change in frequency and attributes of cultural traits, on the spread of cultural information through demic and cultural diffusion, and on detecting relationships between genetic and cultural lineages. Here, for the first time, we make use of worldwide whole-genome sequences (Pagani et al. 2016) to assess the impact of demic diffusion on cultural diversity, focusing on the variability observed in folktale traditions (N=596) (Uther 2004) in Eurasia and Africa. We show that at small geographic scales (<=5000 km) there is a strong correlation between folktale and genomic distance when the effect of geography is corrected, while geographic distance has no independent effect on the distribution of folkloric narratives at the same spatial scale. This points to demic processes (i.e. population movement and replacement) as the main driver of folktale transmission at limited geographic ranges. The role of population movements becomes more apparent when regions characterized by episodes of directional expansions, such as the Neolithization of West Eurasia, are examined. Furthermore, we identify 89 individual tales which are likely to be predominantly transmitted through demic diffusion, and locate putative focal areas for a subset of them.",

The model is analyzed from a Bayesian perspective and has the benefit of automatically down-weighting time points close to motion spikes in a data-driven manner. We develop a highly efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows for Bayesian variable selection among the regressors to model both the mean (i.e., the design matrix) and variance. This makes it possible to include a broad range of explanatory variables in both the mean and variance (e.g., time trends, activation stimuli, head motion parameters and their temporal derivatives), and to compute the posterior probability of inclusion from the MCMC output. Variable selection is also applied to the lags in the autoregressive noise process, making it possible to infer the lag order from the data simultaneously with all other model parameters. We use both simulated data and real fMRI data from OpenfMRI to illustrate the importance of proper modeling of heteroscedasticity in fMRI data analysis. Our results show that the GLMH tends to detect more brain activity, compared to its homoscedastic counterpart, by allowing the variance to change over time depending on the degree of head motion.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetics can be used to elucidate the movement of genes between populations of organisms, using phylogeographic methods. This has been widely done to quantify pathogen movement between different host populations, the migration history of humans, and the geographic spread of languages or the gene flow between species using the location or state of samples alongside sequence data. Phylogenies therefore offer insights into migration processes not available from classic epidemiological or occurrence data alone. Phylogeographic methods have however several known shortcomings. In particular, one of the most widely used methods treats migration the same as mutation, and therefore does not incorporate information about population demography. This may lead to severe biases in estimated migration rates for datasets where sampling is biased across populations. The structured coalescent on the other hand allows us to coherently model the migration and coalescent process, but current implementations struggle with complex datasets due to the need to infer ancestral migration histories. Thus, approximations to the structured coalescent, which integrate over all ancestral migration histories, have been developed. However, the validity and robustness of these approximations remain unclear. We present an exact numerical solution to the structured coalescent that does not require the inference of migration histories. While this solution is computationally unfeasible for large datasets, it clarifies the assumptions of previously developed approximate methods and allows us to provide an improved approximation to the structured coalescent. We have implemented these methods in BEAST2, and we show how these methods compare under different scenarios.",

However, we lack a sufficient understanding of which microbial populations successfully colonize the recipient gut, and the widely used approaches to study the microbial ecology of FMT experiments fail to provide enough resolution to identify populations that are likely responsible for FMT-derived benefits. Here we used shotgun metagenomics to reconstruct 97 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from fecal samples of a single donor and followed their distribution in two FMT recipients to identify microbial populations with different colonization properties. Our analysis of the occurrence and distribution patterns post-FMT revealed that 22% of the MAGs transferred from the donor to both recipients and remained abundant in their guts for at least eight weeks. Most MAGs that successfully colonized the recipient gut belonged to the order Bacteroidales. The vast majority of those that lacked evidence of colonization belonged to the order Clostridiales and colonization success was negatively correlated with the number of genes related to sporulation. Although our dataset showed a link between taxonomy and the ability of a MAG to colonize the recipient gut, we also identified MAGs with different colonization properties that belong to the same taxon, highlighting the importance of genome-resolved approaches to explore the functional basis of colonization and to identify targets for cultivation, hypothesis generation, and testing in model systems for mechanistic insights.",

SRS has, however, limited ability to evaluate tandem repeats, regions with high [GC] or [AT] content, highly polymorphic regions, highly paralogous regions, and large-scale structural variants. Long-read sequencing (LRS) has complementary strengths and offers a means to discover overlooked genetic variation in patients undiagnosed by SRS. To evaluate LRS, we selected a patient who presented with multiple neoplasia and cardiac myxomata suggestive of Carney complex for whom targeted clinical gene testing and whole genome SRS were negative. Low coverage whole genome LRS was performed on the PacBio Sequel system and structural variants were called, yielding 6,971 deletions and 6,821 insertions > 50bp. Filtering for variants that are absent in an unrelated control and that overlap a coding exon of a disease gene identified three deletions and three insertions. One of these, a heterozygous 2,184 bp deletion, overlaps the first coding exon of PRKAR1A, which is implicated in autosomal dominant Carney complex. This variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and was classified as pathogenic using standard criteria for the interpretation of sequence variants. This first successful application of whole genome LRS to identify a pathogenic variant suggests that LRS has significant potential to identify disease-causing structural variation. We recommend larger studies to evaluate the diagnostic yield of LRS, and the development of a comprehensive catalog of common human structural variation to support future studies.",

Where possible, parameter values were adjusted from the referenced data to present them with consistent definitions (normalization of measured fiber lengths to optimal sarcomere length, and calculation of PCSA as the ratio of fiber volume to fiber length). It is seen that within a specific muscle, optimal fiber lengths are fairly consistent between studies, pennation angles and PCSAs vary widely between studies, and data for unloaded tendon length are comparatively sparse.

    "abstract": "The severity and outcome of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We compared changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomic over-splitting of extinct or endangered taxa, due to an incomplete knowledge of both skeletal morphological variability and the geographical ranges of past populations, continues to confuse the link between isolated extant populations and their ancestors. This is particularly problematic with the genus Equus. To more reliably determine the evolution and phylogeographic history of the endangered Asiatic wild ass, we studied the genetic diversity and inter-relationships of both extinct and extant populations over the last 100,000 years, including samples throughout its previous range from Western Europe to Southwest and East Asia. Using 229 bp of the mitochondrial hypervariable region, an approach which allowed the inclusion of information from extremely poorly preserved ancient samples, we classify all non-African wild asses into nine clades that show a clear phylogeographic structure revealing their phylogenetic history. This study places the extinct European wild ass, E. hydruntinus, the phylogeny of which has been debated since the end of the 19th century, into its phylogenetic context within the Asiatic wild asses and reveals recent gene flow events between populations currently regarded as separate species. The phylogeographic organization of clades resulting from these efforts can be used not only to improve future taxonomic determination of a poorly characterized group of equids, but also to identify historic ranges, interbreeding events between various populations, and the impact of ancient climatic changes. In addition, appropriately placing extant relict populations into a broader phylogeographic and genetic context can better inform ongoing conservation strategies for this highly endangered species.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or non-adaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses, and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends upon whether plastic responses are adaptive or non-adaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change, or whether simpler non-evolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Climate changes that occurred during the Late Pleistocene have profound effects on the distribution of many plant and animal species and influenced the formation of contemporary faunas and floras of Europe. The course and mechanisms of responses of species to the past climate changes are now being intensively studied by the use of direct radiocarbon dating and genetic analyses of fossil remains. Here, we review the advances in understanding these processes by the example of four mammal species: woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), cave bear (Ursus spelaeus s. l.), saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) and collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx ssp.). The cases discussed here as well as others show that the migrations, range shifts and local extinctions were the main responses to climate changes and that the dynamics of these climate driven processes were much more profound than it was previously thought. Each species reacted by its individual manner, which depended on its biology and adaptation abilities to the changing environment and climate conditions. The most severe changes in European ecosystems that affected the largest number of species took place around 33-31 ka BP, during the Last Glacial Maximum 22-19 ka BP and the Late Glacial warming 15-13 ka BP.",

    "abstract": "Range shift is the primary short-term response of species to rapid climate change but it is hampered by natural or anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. Fragmented habitats expose different critical areas of a species niche to heterogeneous environmental changes resulting in uncoupled effects. Modelling species distribution under complex real-life scenarios and incorporating such uncoupled effects has not been achieved yet. Here we identify the most vulnerable areas and the potential cold refugia of a top-predator with fragmented niche range in the Southern ocean by integrating genomic, ecological and behavioural data with atmospheric and oceanographic models. Our integrative approach constitutes an indispensable example for predicting the effect of global warming on species relying on spatially and ecologically distinct areas to complete their life-cycle (e.g., migratory animals, marine pelagic organisms, central-place foragers) and, in general, on species constrained in fragmented landscapes due to continuously-growing anthropogenic pressure.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq experiments are usually carried out in three or fewer replicates. In order to work well with so few samples, Differential Gene Expression (DGE) tools typically assume the form of the underlying distribution of gene expression. A recent highly replicated study revealed that RNA-seq gene expression measurements in yeast are best represented as being drawn from an underlying negative binomial distribution. In this paper, the statistical properties of gene expression in the higher eukaryote Arabidopsis thaliana are shown to be essentially identical to those from yeast despite the large increase in the size and complexity of the transcriptome: Gene expression measurements from this model plant species are consistent with being drawn from an underlying negative binomial or log-normal distribution and the false positive rate performance of nine widely used DGE tools is not strongly affected by the additional size and complexity of the A. thaliana transcriptome. For RNA-seq data, we therefore recommend the use of DGE tools that are based on the negative binomial distribution.",

Recently, Solomon and Kingsford proposed the Sequence Bloom Tree data structure and demonstrated how it can be used to accurately identify SRA samples that have a transcript of interest potentially expressed. In this paper, we propose an improvement called the AllSome Sequence Bloom Tree. Results show that our new data structure significantly improves performance, reducing the tree construction time by 52.7% and query time by 39 - 85%, with a price of up to 3x memory consumption during queries. Notably, it can query a batch of 198,074 queries in under 8 hours (compared to around two days previously) and a whole set of k-mers from a sequencing experiment (about 27 mil k-mers) in under 11 minutes.",

    "abstract": "Over 90% of genetic variants associated with complex human traits map to non-coding regions, but little is understood about how they modulate gene regulation in health and disease. One possible mechanism is that genetic variants affect the activity of one or more cis-regulatory elements leading to gene expression variation in specific cell types. To identify such cases, we analyzed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq profiles from activated CD4+ T cells of up to 105 healthy donors. We found that regions of accessible chromatin (ATAC-peaks) are co-accessible at kilobase and megabase resolution, in patterns consistent with the 3D organization of chromosomes measured by in situ Hi-C in T cells. 15% of genetic variants located within ATAC-peaks affected the accessibility of the corresponding peak through disrupting binding sites for transcription factors important for T cell differentiation and activation. These ATAC quantitative trait nucleotides (ATAC-QTNs) have the largest effects on co-accessible peaks, are associated with gene expression from the same aliquot of cells, are rarely affecting core binding motifs, and are enriched for autoimmune disease variants. Our results provide insights into how natural genetic variants modulate cis- regulatory elements, in isolation or in concert, to influence gene expression in primary immune cells that play a key role in many human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Enormous databases of short-read RNA-seq sequencing experiments such as the NIH Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) are now available. These databases could answer many questions about the condition-specific expression or population variation, and this resource is only going to grow over time. However, these collections remain difficult to use due to the inability to search for a particular expressed sequence. While some progress has been made on this problem, it is still not feasible to search collections of hundreds of terabytes of short-read sequencing experiments. We introduce an indexing scheme called Split Sequence Bloom Tree (SSBT) to support sequence-based querying of terabyte-scale collections of thousands of short-read sequencing experiments. SSBT is an improvement over the SBT [1] data structure for the same task. We apply SSBT to the problem of finding conditions under which query transcripts are expressed. Our experiments are conducted on a set of 2,652 publicly available RNA-seq experiments contained in the NIH for the breast, blood, and brain tissues. We demonstrate that this SSBT index can be queried for a 1000 nt sequence in under 4 minutes using a single thread and can be stored in just 39 GB, a five-fold improvement in search and storage costs compared to SBT. We further report that SSBT can be further optimized by pre-loading the entire index to accomplish the same search in 30 seconds.",
