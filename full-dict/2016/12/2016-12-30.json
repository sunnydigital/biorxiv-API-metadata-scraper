    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as an important tool for various genome engineering applications. A current obstacle to high throughput applications of CRISPR/Cas9 is the imprecise prediction of highly active single guide. RNAs (sgRNAs). We previously implemented the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce tissue-specific mutations in the tunicate Ciona. In the present study, we designed and tested 83 single guide RNA (sgRNA) vectors targeting 23 genes expressed in the cardiopharyngeal progenitors and surrounding tissues of Ciona embryo. Using high-throughput sequencing of mutagenized alleles, we identified guide sequences that correlate with sgRNA mutagenesis activity and used this information for the rational design of all possible sgRNAs targeting the Ciona transcriptome. We also describe a one-step cloning-free protocol for the assembly of sgRNA expression cassettes. These cassettes can be directly electroporated as unpurified PCR products into Ciona embryos for sgRNA expression in vivo, resulting in high frequency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in somatic cells of electroporated embryos.\\n\\nWe found a strong correlation between the frequency of an Ebf loss-of-function phenotype and the mutagenesis efficacies of individual Ebf-targeting sgRNAs tested using this method. We anticipate that our approach can be scaled up to systematically design and deliver highly efficient sgRNAs for the tissue-specific investigation of gene functions in Ciona.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinases are critical drug targets for treating a large variety of human diseases. Type-I and type-II kinase inhibitors frequently exhibit off-target toxicity or lead to mutation acquired resistance. Two highly specific allosteric type-III MEK-targeted drugs, Trametinib and Cobimetinib, offer a new approach. Thus, understanding the binding mechanism of existing type-III kinase inhibitors will provide insights for designing new type-III kinase inhibitors. In this work we have systematically studied the binding mode of MEK-targeted type-III inhibitors using structural systems pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulation. Our studies provide detailed sequence, structure, interaction-fingerprint, pharmacophore and binding-site information on the binding characteristics of MEK type-III kinase inhibitors. We propose that the helix-folding activation loop is a hallmark allosteric binding site for type-III inhibitors. Subsequently we screened and predicted allosteric binding sites across the human kinome, suggesting other kinases as potential targets suitable for type-III inhibitors. Our findings will provide new insights into the design of potent and selective kinases inhibitors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman protein kinases represent a large protein family relevant to many diseases, especially cancers, and have become important drug targets. However, developing the desired selective kinase-targeted inhibitors remain challenging. Kinase allosteric inhibitors provide that opportunity, but, to date, few have been designed other than MEK inhibitors. To more efficiently develop kinase allosteric inhibitors, we systematically studied the binding mode of the MEK type-III allosteric kinase inhibitors using structural system pharmacology and molecular dynamics approaches. New insights into the binding mode and mechanism of type-III inhibitors were revealed that may facilitate the design of new prospective type-III kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Better understanding and prediction of tree growth is important because of the many ecosystem services provided by forests and the uncertainty surrounding how forests will respond to anthropogenic climate change. With the ultimate goal of improving models of forest dynamics, here we construct a statistical model that combines complementary data sources - tree-ring and forest inventory data. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to gain inference on the effects of many factors on tree growth - individual tree size, climate, biophysical conditions, stand-level competitive environment, tree-level canopy status, and forest management treatments - using both diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree-ring data. The model consists of two multiple regression models, one each for the two data sources, linked via a constant of proportionality between coefficients that are found in parallel in the two regressions. The model was applied to a dataset developed at a single, well-studied site in the Jemez Mountains of north-central New Mexico, U. S. A. Inferences from the model included positive effects of seasonal precipitation, wetness index, and height ratio, and negative effects of seasonal temperature, southerly aspect and radiation, and plot basal area. Climatic effects inferred by the model compared well to results from a dendroclimatic analysis. Combining the two data sources did not lead to higher predictive accuracy (using the leave-one-out information criterion, LOOIC), either when there was a large number of increment cores (129) or under a reduced data scenario of 15 increment cores. However, there was a clear advantage, in terms of parameter estimates, to the use of both data sources under the reduced data scenario: DBH remeasurement data for ~500 trees substantially reduced uncertainty about non-climate fixed effects on radial increments. We discuss the kinds of research questions that might be addressed when the high-resolution information on climate effects contained in tree rings are combined with the rich metadata on tree- and stand-level conditions found in forest inventories, including carbon accounting and projection of tree growth and forest dynamics under future climate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Plastid sequences are a cornerstone in plant systematic studies and key aspects of their evolution, such as uniparental inheritance and absent recombination, are often treated as axioms. While exceptions to these assumptions can profoundly influence evolutionary inference, detecting them can require extensive sampling, abundant sequence data, and detailed testing. Using advancements in high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the whole plastomes of 65 accessions of Picea, a genus of ~35 coniferous forest tree species, to test for deviations from canonical plastome evolution. Using complementary hypothesis and data-driven tests, we found evidence for chimeric plastomes generated by interspecific hybridization and recombination in the clade comprising Norway spruce (P. abies) and ten other species. Support for interspecific recombination remained after controlling for sequence saturation, positive selection, and potential alignment artifacts. These results reconcile previous conflicting plastid-based phylogenies and strengthen the mounting evidence of reticulate evolution in Picea. Given the relatively high frequency of hybridization and biparental plastid inheritance in plants, we suggest interspecific plastome recombination may be more widespread than currently appreciated and could underlie reported cases of discordant plastid phylogenies.",

    "abstract": "One common hypothesis to explain the impacts of tandem duplications is that whole gene duplications commonly produce additive changes in gene expression due to copy number changes. Here, we use genome wide RNA-seq data from a population sample of Drosophila yakuba to test this  gene dosage hypothesis. We observe little evidence of expression changes in response to whole transcript duplication capturing 5' and 3' UTRs. Among whole gene duplications, we observe evidence that dosage sharing across copies is likely to be common. The lack of expression changes after whole gene duplication suggests that the majority of genes are subject to tight regulatory control and therefore not sensitive to changes in gene copy number. Rather, we observe changes in expression level due to both shuffling of regulatory elements and the creation of chimeric structures via tandem duplication. Additionally, we observe 30 de novo gene structures arising from tandem duplications, 23 of which form with expression in the testes. Thus, the value of tandem duplications is likely to be more intricate than simple changes in gene dosage. The common regulatory effects from chimeric gene formation after tandem duplication may explain their contribution to genome evolution.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe enclosed work shows that whole gene duplications rarely affect gene expression, in contrast to widely held views that the adaptive value of duplicate genes is related to additive changes in gene expression due to gene copy number. We further explain how tandem duplications that create shuffled gene structures can force upregulation of gene sequences, de novo gene creation, and multifold changes in transcript levels.\\n\\nThese results show that tandem duplications can produce new genes that are a source of immediate novelty associated with more extreme expression changes than previously suggested by theory. Further, these gene expression changes are a potential source of both beneficial and pathogenic mutations, immediately relevant to clinical and medical genetics in humans and other metazoans.",

We investigated the underlying network mechanisms by quantifying local speech representations and directed connectivity in MEG data obtained while human participants listened to speech of varying acoustic SNR and visual context. During high acoustic SNR speech encoding by entrained brain activity was strong in temporal and inferior frontal cortex, while during low SNR strong entrainment emerged in premotor and superior frontal cortex. These changes in local encoding were accompanied by changes in directed connectivity along the ventral stream and the auditory-premotor axis. Importantly, the behavioural benefit arising from seeing the speaker's face was not predicted by changes in local encoding but rather by enhanced functional connectivity between temporal and inferior frontal cortex. Our results demonstrate a role of auditory-motor interactions in visual speech representations and suggest that functional connectivity along the ventral pathway facilitates speech comprehension in multisensory environments.",

Equally important is the detection of acoustic cues that give structure and context to the information we hear, such as sentence boundaries. How the brain organizes this information processing is unknown. Here, using data-driven computational methods on an extensive set of high-density intracranial recordings, we reveal a large-scale partitioning of the entire human speech cortex into two spatially distinct regions that detect important cues for parsing natural speech. These caudal (Zone 1) and rostral (Zone 2) regions work in parallel to detect onsets and prosodic information, respectively, within naturally spoken sentences. In contrast, local processing within each region supports phonetic feature encoding. These findings demonstrate a fundamental organizational property of the human auditory cortex that has been previously unrecognized.",

We define the regulatory plexus of each gene as its cell-type-specific three-dimensional gene-regulatory neighborhood, inferred using Hi-C chromosomal interactions and chromatin state annotations. Using 16 matched tumor-normal prostate transcriptomes, we predict tumor-upregulated genes, and find enriched plexus mutations in distal regulatory regions normally repressed in prostate, suggesting out-of-context de-repression. Using 55 matched tumor-normal prostate genomes, we predict 15 driver genes by convergence of dispersed, low-frequency mutations into high-frequency dysregulation events along prostate-specific plexi, while controlling for mutational heterogeneity across regions, chromatin states, and patients. These putative drivers play roles in growth signaling, immune evasion, mitochondrial function, and vascularization, suggesting higher-order pathway-level convergence.

The new version of gro is between one and two orders of magnitude faster than the original version. It is able to grow microbial colonies with up to 105 cells in less than 20 minutes. A new library, CellEngine, accelerates the resolution of spatial physical interactions between growing and dividing cells by implementing a new shoving algorithm. A genetic library, CellPro, based on Probabilistic Timed Automata, simulates gene expression dynamics using simplified and easy to compute digital proteins. We also propose a more convenient language specification layer, ProSpec, based on the idea that proteins drive cell behavior. CellNutrient, another library, implements Monod-based growth and nutrient uptake functionalities. The intercellular signaling management was improved and extended in a library called CellSignals. Finally, bacterial conjugation, another local cell-cell communication process, was added to the simulator.

The nucleoid-associated protein H-NS is a key global regulator in Gram-negative bacteria, and is believed to be a crucial player in bacterial chromatin organization via its DNA bridging activity. H-NS activity in vivo is modulated by physico-chemical factors (osmolarity, pH, temperature) and interaction partners. Mechanistically it is unclear how functional modulation of H-NS by such factors is achieved. Here, we show that a diverse spectrum of H-NS modulators alter the ability of H-NS to bridge DNA. Changes in monovalent and divalent ion concentrations drive an abrupt switch between a bridging and non-bridging DNA binding mode. Similarly, synergistic and antagonistic co-regulators modulate the DNA bridging efficiency.

    "abstract": "Conscious and attended perception is commonly thought to elicit fronto-parietal activity. However, supportive evidence comes largely from studies which involve detecting a target and reporting its visibility. This approach confounds conscious perception with goal completion of either the perceptual task of detection or the metacognitive task of introspective reporting. In contrast, in real life such perceptions are a means of achieving goals and rarely a goal in themselves, and almost never involve explicit metacognitive reports. It therefore remains unclear if fronto-parietal activity is indeed a correlate of conscious perception or is the result of confounds related to goal completion. Here we show that conscious and attended perception when delinked from goals does not increase fronto-parietal activity, and when inconsequential for the goal may even deactivate these regions. In experiments 1 and 2 participants attended to a highly visible stream of letters to detect the occasional targets in their midst. The non-target letters, in spite of being visible and attended to, deactivated fronto-parietal regions. In experiment 3 we looked at the activity elicited by a loud auditory cue that had to be kept in memory for up to 9 s and used to select the correct rule for completing the goal. Even such a salient, attended and remembered event did not elicit prefrontal activity. Across these experiments conscious and attended perception only activated the relevant sensory regions while goal completion events activated fronto-parietal regions.\\n\\nSignificance statementConsciousness and attended perception has been seen to correlate with fronto-parietal activity. This informs key theories of consciousness and attention, e.g. widespread availability of incoming information or its higher level representation causes perceptual awareness, or that top down attention during perception broadcasts incoming sensations into frontal and parietal regions. However such experiments unwittingly conflate attended and conscious perception with some form of goal completion, whereas such perception in our daily life mostly serves as a means of goal completion and not a goal in itself. Here we show that such perception when delinked from goal completion does not activate fronto-parietal regions, and may even deactivate these regions if the percept is inconsequential for goal completion.",

    "abstract": "The NALCN/NCA ion channel is a cation channel related to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. NALCN has been reported to be a sodium leak channel with a conserved role in establishing neuronal resting membrane potential, but its precise cellular role and regulation are unclear. The Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs of NALCN, NCA-1 and NCA-2, act in premotor interneurons to regulate motor circuit activity that sustains locomotion. Recently we found that NCA-1 and NCA-2 are activated by a signal transduction pathway acting downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq and the small GTPase Rho. Through a forward genetic screen, here we identify the GPCR kinase GRK-2 as a new player affecting signaling through the Gq-Rho-NCA pathway. Using structure-function analysis, we find that the GPCR phosphorylation and membrane association domains of GRK-2 are required for its function. Genetic epistasis experiments suggest that GRK-2 acts on the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3 to inhibit Go signaling and positively modulate NCA-1 and NCA-2 activity. Through cell-specific rescuing experiments, we find that GRK-2 and DOP-3 act in premotor interneurons to modulate NCA channel function. Finally, we demonstrate that dopamine, through DOP-3, negatively regulates NCA activity. Thus, this study identifies a pathway by which dopamine modulates the activity of the NCA channels.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts in the brain by binding seven transmembrane receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Neuronal G proteins often function by modulating ion channels that control membrane excitability. Here we identify a molecular cascade downstream of dopamine in the nematode C. elegans that involves activation of the dopamine receptor DOP-3, activation of the G protein GOA-1, and inactivation of the NCA-1 and NCA-2 ion channels. We also identify a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK-2) that inactivates the dopamine receptor DOP-3, thus leading to inactivation of GOA-1 and activation of the NCA channels. Thus, this study connects dopamine signaling to activity of the NCA channels through G protein signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Viral vectors and electroporation (EP)-mediated gene transfers are efficient means of inducing somatic mosaicism in mice, but they lack the exquisite control over transgene copy number, gene zygosity, and genomic-locus specificity that genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) provide. Here, we develop and demonstrate a simple and generalizable in vivo method, mosaic analysis by dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (MADR). MADR allows for stable labeling of mutant cells express transgenic elements from a precisely-defined chromosomal locus. To test our method, we generated reporter-labeled lineages from stem and progenitor cells in a well-defined Rosa26mTmG mouse. We demonstrate the power and versatility of MADR by creating novel glioma models with mixed, reporter-defined zygosity or with \\\"personalized\\\" driver mutations from pediatric glioma--each manipulation altering the profile of resulting tumors. Thus, MADR provides a high-throughput genetic platform for the dissection of development and disease, and this rapid method can be applied to the thousands of existing gene-trap mice.",

    "abstract": "Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a central role in health and disease. One function of these signaling molecules is to serve as precursors for short chain fatty acylation, a class of metabolically-derived posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that are established by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and lysine deacetylases (KDACs). Via this mechanism, short chain fatty acylation serves as an integrated reporter of metabolism as well as KAT and KDAC activity, and has the potential to illuminate the role of these processes in disease. However, few methods to study short chain fatty acylation exist. Here we report a bioorthogonal pro-metabolite strategy for profiling short chain fatty acylation in living cells. Inspired by the dietary component tributyrin, we synthesized a panel of ester-caged bioorthogonal short chain fatty acids. Cellular evaluation of these agents led to the discovery of an azido-ester that is metabolized to its cognate acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and affords robust protein labeling profiles. We comprehensively characterize the metabolic dependence, toxicity, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity of these bioorthogonal pro-metabolites, and apply an optimized probe to identify novel candidate protein targets of short chain fatty acids in cells. Our studies showcase the utility of bioorthogonal pro-metabolites for unbiased profiling of cellular protein acylation, and suggest new approaches for studying the signaling functions of SCFAs in differentiation and disease.",

    "abstract": "The positioning of the DNA replication machinery (replisome) has been the subject of several studies. Two conflicting models for replisome localization have been proposed: In the Factory Model, sister replisomes remain spatially colocalized as the replicating DNA is translocated through a stationary replication factory. In the Track Model, sister replisomes translocate independently along a stationary DNA track and the replisomes are spatially separated for the majority of the cell cycle. Here, we used time-lapse imaging to observe and quantify the position of fluorescently labeled processivity-clamp (DnaN) complexes throughout the cell cycle in two highly-divergent bacterial model organisms: Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Because DnaN is a core component of the replication machinery, its localization patterns should be an appropriate proxy for replisome positioning in general. We present automated statistical analysis of DnaN positioning in large populations, which is essential due to the high degree of cell-to-cell variation. We find that both bacteria show remarkably similar DnaN positioning, where any potential separation of the two replication forks remains below the diffraction limit throughout the majority of the replication cycle. Additionally, the localization pattern of several other core replisome components is consistent with that of DnaN. These data altogether indicate that the two replication forks remain spatially colocalized and mostly function in close proximity throughout the replication cycle.The conservation of the observed localization patterns in these highly divergent species suggests that the subcellular positioning of the replisome is a functionally critical feature of DNA replication.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCell proliferation depends on efficient replication of the genome. Bacteria typically have a single origin of replication on a circular chromosome. After replication initiation, two replisomes assemble at the origin and each copy one of the two arms of the chromosome until they reach the terminus. There have been conflicting reports about the subcellular positioning and putative co-localization of the two replication forks during this process. It has remained controversial whether the two replisomes remain relatively close to each other with the DNA being pulled through, or separate as they translocate along the DNA like a track. Existing studies have relied heavily on snapshot images and these experiments cannot unambiguously distinguish between these two models: i.e. two resolvable forks versus two pairs of co-localized forks. The ability of replication to re-initiate before cell division in bacterial cells further complicates the interpretation of these types of imaging studies. In this paper, we use a combination of snapshot imaging, time-lapse imaging, and quantitative analysis to measure the fraction of time forks are co-localized during each cell cycle. We find that the forks are co-localized for the majority ( 80%) of the replication cycle in two highly-divergent model organisms: B. subtilis and E. coli. Our observations are consistent with proximal localization of the two forks, but also some transient separations of sister forks during replication. The conserved behavior of sub-cellular positioning of the replisomes in these two highly divergent species implies a potential functional relevance of this feature.",

    "abstract": "To ensure the proper transmission of the genetic information, DNA molecules must be faithfully duplicated and segregated. These processes involve dynamic modifications of chromosomes internal structure to promote their individualization, as well as their global repositioning into daughter cells (Guacci et al., 1994; Kleckner et al., 2014; Mizuguchi et al., 2014). In eukaryotes, these events are regulated by conserved architectural proteins, such as structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC i.e. cohesin and condensin) complexes (Aragon et al., 2013a; Uhlmann, 2016). Although the roles of these factors have been actively investigated, the genome-wide chromosomal architecture and dynamics both at small and large-scales during cell division remains elusive. Here we report a comprehensive Hi-C (Dekker et al., 2002; Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009) analysis of the dynamic changes of chromosomes structure over the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. We uncover specific SMC-dependent structural transitions between the different phases of the mitotic cycle. During replication, cohesion establishment promotes the increase of long-range intra-chromosomal contacts. This process correlates with the individualization of chromosomes, which culminates at metaphase. Mitotic chromosomes are then abruptly reorganized in anaphase by the mechanical forces exerted by the mitotic spindle on the centromere cluster. The formation of a condensin-dependent loop, that bridges centromere cluster with the cenproximal flanking region of the rDNA, suggests that these forces may directly facilitate nucleolus segregation. This work provides a comprehensive overview of chromosome dynamics during the cell cycle of a unicellular eukaryote that recapitulates and unveils new features of highly conserved stages of the cell division.",
