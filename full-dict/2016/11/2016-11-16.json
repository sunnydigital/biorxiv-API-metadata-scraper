    "abstract": "Neuromodulators shape neural circuit dynamics. Combining electron microscopy, genetics, transcriptome profiling, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we discovered a peptidergic neuron that modulates C. elegans motor circuit dynamics. The Six/SO-family homeobox transcription factor UNC-39 governs lineage-specific neurogenesis to give rise to a neuron RID. RID bears the anatomic hallmarks of a specialized endocrine neuron: it harbors near-exclusive dense core vesicles that cluster periodically along the axon, and expresses multiple neuropeptides, including the FMRF-amide-related FLP-14. RID activity increases during forward movement. Ablating RID reduces the sustainability of forward movement, a phenotype partially recapitulated by removing FLP-14. Optogenetic depolarization of RID prolongs forward movement, an effect reduced in the absence of FLP-14. Together, these results establish the role of a neuroendocrine cell RID in sustaining a specific behavioral state in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Ecological networks, or food webs, describe the feeding relationships between interacting species within an ecosystem. Understanding how the complexity of these networks influences their response to changing top-down control is a central challenge in ecology. Here, we provide a model-based investigation of trophic cascades - an oft-studied ecological phenomenon that occurs when changes in the biomass of top predators indirectly effect changes in the biomass of primary producers - in complex food webs that are representative of the structure of real ecosystems. Our results reveal that strong cascades occur primarily in low richness and weakly connected food webs, a result in agreement with some prior predictions. The primary mechanism underlying weak or absent cascades was a strong compensatory response; in most webs predators induced large population level cascades that were masked by changes in the opposite direction by other species in the same trophic guild. Thus, the search for a general theory of trophic cascades in food webs should focus on uncovering features of real ecosystems that promote biomass compensation within functional guilds or trophic levels.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNetworks are popular and powerful tools to describe and model biological processes. Many computational methods have been developed to infer biological networks from literature, high-throughput experiments, and combinations of both. Additionally, a wide range of tools has been developed to map experimental data onto reference biological networks, in order to extract meaningful modules. Many of these methods assess results significance against null distributions of randomized networks. However, these standard unconstrained randomizations do not preserve the functional characterization of the nodes in the reference networks (i.e. their degrees and connection signs), hence including potential biases in the assessment.\\n\\nResultsBuilding on our previous work about rewiring bipartite networks, we propose a method for rewiring any type of unweighted networks. In particular we formally demonstrate that the problem of rewiring a signed and directed network preserving its functional connectivity (F-rewiring) reduces to the problem of rewiring two induced bipartite networks. Additionally, we reformulate the lower bound to the iterations number of the switching-algorithm to make it suitable for the F-rewiring of networks of any size. Finally, we present BiRewire 3, an open-source Bioconductor software enabling the F-rewiring of any type of unweighted network. We illustrate its application to a case study about the identification of modules from gene expression data mapped on protein interaction networks, and a second one focused on building logic models from more complex signed-directed reference signaling networks and phosphoproteomic data.\\n\\nConclusionsBiRewire3 it is freely available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/BiRewire/, and it should have a broad application as it allows an efficient and analytically derived statistical assessment of results from any network biology tool.",

    "abstract": "Like many behaviors, Caenorhabditis elegans egg laying alternates between inactive and active states. To understand how the underlying neural circuit turns the behavior on and off, we optically recorded circuit activity in behaving animals while manipulating circuit function using mutations, optogenetics, and drugs. In the active state, the circuit shows rhythmic activity phased with the body bends of locomotion. The serotonergic HSN command neurons initiate the active state, but accumulation of unlaid eggs also promotes the active state independent of the HSNs. The cholinergic VC motor neurons slow locomotion during egg-laying muscle contraction and egg release. The uv1 neuroendocrine cells mechanically sense passage of eggs through the vulva and release tyramine to inhibit egg laying, in part via the LGC-55 tyramine-gated Cl- channel on the HSNs. Our results identify discrete signals that entrain or detach the circuit from the locomotion central pattern generator to produce active and inactive states.",

    "abstract": "1. In this study we propose an extension of the N-mixture family of models that targets an improvement of the statistical properties of rare species abundance estimators when sample sizes are low, yet typical size for tropical studies. The proposed method harnesses information from other species in an ecological community to correct each species estimator. We provide guidance to determine the sample size required to estimate accurately the abundance of rare tropical species when attempting to estimate the abundance of single species.\\n\\n2. We evaluate the proposed methods using an assumption of 50-m radius plots and perform simulations comprising a broad range of sample sizes, true abundances and detectability values and a complex data generating process. The extension of the N-mixture model is achieved by assuming that the detection probabilities of a set of species are all drawn at random from a beta distribution in a multi-species fashion. This hierarchical model avoids having to specify a single detection probability parameter per species in the targeted community. Parameter estimation is done via Maximum Likelihood.\\n\\n3. We compared our multi-species approach with previously proposed multi-species N-mixture models, which we show are biased when the true densities of species in the community are less than seven individuals per 100-ha. The beta N-mixture model proposed here outperforms the traditional Multi-species N-mixture model by allowing the estimation of organisms at lower densities and controlling the bias in the estimation.\\n\\n4. We illustrate how our methodology can be used to suggest sample sizes required to estimate the abundance of organisms, when these are either rare, common or abundant. When the interest is full communities, we show how the multi-species approaches, and in particular our beta model and estimation methodology, can be used as a practical solution to estimate organism densities from rapid inventory datasets. The statistical inferences done with our model via Maximum Likelihood can also be used to group species in a community according to their detectabilities.",

    "abstract": "Nectar-dwelling yeast and bacteria are common inhabitants of flowers and evidently involved in pollination. The limited number of floral plant-pollinator models studied to date reveal inconsistent conclusions on microbial effects, but coincide with respect to high microbial specificity: while bacteria reduce visitation frequencies of pollinators, nectar-borne specialist yeasts (in contrast to allochthonous or transient species) impose none or even a beneficial effect on flower visitation. However, these findings are in conflict with the strong impact of these predominantly fermenting organisms on the nectar environment. In order to cope with the ultimate dependency of nectar-dwellers on repeated transportation by foragers as a result of early floral senescence, the modifications of nectar associated with specialist growth have been interpreted as adaptations that suit foragers preferences. But, the development of foraging preferences to either axenic flowers or flowers colonized by specialist microorganisms would lead to a dead-end for nectar-dwellers, as the probability of inoculation into new suitable habitats would be reduced.\\n\\nBased on a critical survey of the available literature and an additional pollinator experiment where we find that the allochthonous species Cryptococcus victoriae negatively affects attraction and rewarding of floral visitors, while the specialist yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii does not, we propose the hypothesis that nectar-borne yeasts may have evolved to blend into their environment avoiding detection by pollinators, following the ecological concept of crypsis. Although, neither chemical nor olfactory crypsis has been reported for nectar-borne microorganisms, the attention to this mechanism in yeast dispersal needs to be directed in future studies.",

    "abstract": "The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) maintains genomic integrity by preventing progression of mitotic cell division until all chromosomes are stably attached to spindle microtubules. The SAC critically relies on the paralogs Bub1 and BubR1/Mad3, which integrate kinetochore-spindle attachment status with generation of the anaphase inhibitory complex MCC. We previously reported on the widespread occurrences of independent gene duplications of an ancestral  MadBub gene in eukaryotic evolution and the striking parallel subfunctionalization that lead to loss of kinase function in BubR1/Mad3-like paralogs. We now present an elaborate subfunctionalization analysis that includes all known motifs in Bub1 and BubR1, and show that ancestral features are consistently retained in the same functional paralog: GLEBS/CDI/CDII/kinase in the Bub1-like and KEN1/KEN2/D-Box in the BubR1/Mad3-like. The recently described ABBA motif can be found in either or both paralogs. We however discovered two additional ABBA motifs that flank KEN2. This cassette of ABBA1-KEN2-ABBA2 forms a strictly conserved module in all ancestral and BubR1/Mad3-like proteins, suggestive of a specific and crucial SAC function. Indeed, deletion of the ABBA motifs in human BUBR1 abrogates the SAC and affects APC/C-Cdc20 interactions. Our detailed comparative genomics analyses thus enabled discovery of a conserved cassette of motifs essential for the SAC and shows how this approach can be used to uncover hitherto unrecognized functional protein features.",

To better understand the molecular patterns associated with induction of C4 photosynthesis the genus Flaveria that contains C3 and C4 species was used. A base to tip maturation gradient of leaf anatomy was defined, and RNA sequencing was undertaken along this gradient for two C3 and two C4 Flaveria species. Key C4 traits including vein density, mesophyll and bundle sheath cross-sectional area, chloroplast ultrastructure, and abundance of transcripts encoding proteins of C4 photosynthesis were quantified. Candidate genes underlying each of these C4 characteristics were identified. Principal Components Analysis indicated that leaf maturation and then photosynthetic pathway were responsible for the greatest amount of variation in transcript abundance. Photosynthesis genes were over-represented for a prolonged period in the C4 species. Through comparison with publically available datasets we identify a small number of transcriptional regulators that have been up-regulated in diverse C4 species. The analysis identifies similar patterns of expression in independent C4 lineages and so indicates that the complex C4 pathway is associated with parallel as well as convergent evolution.\\n\\nHighlightWe identify transcription factors that show conserved patterns of expression in multiple 29 C4 species, both within the Flaveria genus, but also in more distantly related C4 plants.",

    "abstract": "Electrotaxis or galvanotaxis refers to the migration pattern of cells induced in response to electrical potential. Although it has been extensively studied in mammalian cells, electrotaxis has not been explored in detail in bacterial cells; information regarding the impact of current on pathogenic bacteria is severely lacking. Therefore, we designed a series of single and multi-cue experiments to assess the impact of varying currents on bacterial motility dynamics in pathogenic multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli using a microfluidic platform. Motility plays key roles in bacterial migration and the colonization of surfaces during the formation of biofilms, which are inherently recalcitrant to removal and resistant to traditional disinfection strategies (e.g. antibiotics). Use of the microfluidic platform allows for exposure to current, which can be supplied at a range that is biocidal to bacteria, yet physiologically safe in humans (single cue). This system also allows for multi-cue experiments where acetic acid, a relatively safe compound with anti-fouling/antimicrobial properties, can be combined with current to enhance disinfection. These strategies may offer substantial therapeutic benefits, specifically for the treatment of biofilm infections, such as those found in the wound environment. Furthermore, microfluidic systems have been successfully used to model the unique microfluidic dynamics present in the wound environment, suggesting that these investigations could be extended to more complex biological systems. Our results showed that the application of current in combination with acetic acid has profound inhibitory effects on MDR strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli, even with brief applications. Specifically, E. coli motility dynamics and cell survival were significantly impaired starting at a concentration of 125 A DC and 0.31% acetic acid, while P. aeruginosa was impaired at 70 A and 0.31% acetic acid. As these strains are relevant wound pathogens, it is likely that this strategy would be effective against similar strains in vivo and could represent a new approach to hasten wound healing.",

Methods for haplotyping single individuals use the phasing information available in Next Generation sequencing reads, by matching overlapping sNPs while penalizing post hoc nucleotide corrections made. Haplotyping diploids is relatively easy, but the complexity of the problem increases drastically for polyploid genomes, which are found in both model organisms and in economically relevant plant and animal species. While a number of tools are available for haplotyping polyploids, the effects of the genomic makeup and the sequencing strategy followed on the accuracy of these methods have hitherto not been thoroughly evaluated.\\n\\nWe developed the simulation pipeline haplosim to evaluate the performance of haplotype estimation algorithms for polyploids: HapCompass, HapTree and SDhaP, in settings varying in sequencing approach, ploidy levels and genomic diversity, using tetraploid potato as the model. Our results show that sequencing depth is the major determinant of haplotype estimation quality, that 1kb PacBio CCS reads and Illumina reads with large insert-sizes are competitive, and that all methods fail to produce good haplotypes when ploidy levels increase. Comparing the three methods, HapTree produces the most accurate estimates, but also consumes the most resources. There is clearly room for improvement in polyploid haplotyping algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In many natural systems, the physical structure of the landscape dictates the flow of resources. Despite mounting evidence that communities dynamics can be indirectly coupled by reciprocal among-ecosystem resource flows, our understanding of how directional resource flows might indirectly link biological communities is limited. We here propose that differences in community structure upstream should lead to different downstream dynamics, even in the absence of dispersal. We report an experimental test of the effect of upstream community structure on downstream community dynamics in a simplified but highly controlled setting, using protist microcosms. We implemented directional flows of resources, without dispersal, from a standard resource pool into upstream communities of contrasting interaction structure and then to further downstream communities of either one or two trophic levels. Our results demonstrate that different types of species interactions in upstream habitats may lead to different population sizes and levels of biomass in these upstream habitats. This, in turn, leads to varying levels of detritus transfer (dead biomass) to the downstream communities, thus influencing their population densities and trophic interactions in predictable ways. Our results suggest that the structure of species interactions in directionally structured ecosystems can be a key mediator of alterations to downstream habitats. Alterations to upstream habitats can thus cascade down to downstream communities, even without dispersal.",

    "abstract": "The considerable genome size variation in Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown largely to be due to copy number variation (CNV) in 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Surprisingly, attempts to map this variation by means of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) failed to identify either of the two likely sources, namely the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). Instead, GWAS implicated a trans-acting locus, as if rRNA CNV was a phenotype rather than a genotype. To explain these results, we investigated the inheritance and stability of rRNA gene copy number using the variety of genetic resources available in A. thaliana -- F2 crosses, recombinant inbred lines, the multiparent advanced generation inter-cross population, and mutation accumulation lines. Our results clearly show that rRNA gene CNV can be mapped to the NORs themselves, with both loci contributing equally to the variation. However, NOR size is unstably inherited, and dramatic copy number changes are visible already within tens of generations, which explains why it is not possible to map the NORs using GWAS. We did not find any evidence of trans-acting loci in crosses, which is also expected since changes due to such loci would take very many generations to manifest themselves. rRNA gene copy number is thus an interesting example of \\\"missing heritability\\\" -- a trait that is heritable in pedigrees, but not in the general population.",

    "abstract": "The formation of the allotetraploid hybrid lineage (4nAT) encompasses both distant hybridization and polyploidization processes. The allotetraploid offspring have two sets of sub-genomes inherited from both parental species and therefore it is important to explore its genetic structure. Herein, we construct a bacterial artificial chromosome library of allotetraploids, and then sequence and analyze the full-length sequences of 19 bacterial artificial chromosomes. Sixty-eight DNA chimeras are identified, which are divided into four models according to the distribution of the genomic DNA derived from the parents. Among the 68 genetic chimeras, 44 (64.71%) are linked to tandem repeats (TRs) and 23 (33.82%) are linked to transposable elements (TEs). The chimeras linked to TRs are related to slipped-strand mispairing and double-strand break repair while the chimeras linked to TEs are benefit from the intervention of recombinases. In addition, TRs and TEs are linked not only with the recombinations, but also with the insertions/deletions of DNA segments. We conclude that DNA chimeras accompanied by TRs and TEs coordinate a balance between the sub-genomes derived from the parents which reduces the genomic shock effects and favors the evolutionary and adaptive capacity of the allotetraploidization. It is the first report on the relationship between formation of the DNA chimeras and TRs and TEs in the polyploid animals.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear fitting algorithms have illuminated the role of weather in human diseases, by allowing for robust tests of mechanistic transmission models, but a lack of data has prevented applications to animal diseases. This is important because classical models that neglect weather predict that there will be a host density threshold, below which epidemic intensity will be slight, but models that include weather predict that this threshold will often be obliterated by weather variability. To test the applicability of thresholds to animal diseases, we estimated infection rates of the fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga in the gypsy moth, by collecting larvae during epidemics at a range of host densities and weather conditions, and we estimated the pathogen's force of infection, by exposing experimental larvae to the pathogen for 24 h periods in the field. By fitting a range of models to our data, we show that epidemics of this pathogen are best explained by a model that allows for positive effects of both host density and cool, moist weather on transmission, such that weather-only and density-dependence-only models provide vastly poorer explanations for the data. Despite the effects of weather, the combined model shows that the effects of density in E. maimaiga are strong enough to ensure that the density threshold will have important effects on the probability of epidemics. Our work shows that weather and density-dependent transmission can interact in non-intuitive ways, and provides an illustration of the usefulness of nonlinear fitting for understanding animal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Eco-evolutionary theory argues that population cycles in consumer-resource interactions are partly driven by natural selection, such that changes in densities and changes in trait values are mutually reinforcing. Evidence that this theory explains cycles in nature, however, is almost nonexistent. Experimental tests of model predictions are almost always impossible because of the long time scales over which cycles occur, but for most organisms, even tests of model assumptions are logistically impractical. For insect baculoviruses in contrast, tests of model assumptions are straightforward, and baculoviruses often drive outbreaks of forest-defoliating insects, as in the gypsy moth that we study here. We therefore used field experiments with the gypsy moth baculovirus to test two key assumptions of eco-evolutionary models of host-pathogen population cycles, that reduced host infection risk is heritable and costly. Our experiments confirm the two assumptions, and inserting parameters estimated from our data into the models gives cycles closely resembling gypsy moth outbreak cycles in North America, whereas standard models predict unrealistic stable equilibria. Our work shows that eco-evolutionary models are useful for explaining outbreaks of forest insect defoliators, while widespread observations of intense selection imposed by natural enemies on defoliators, and frequent laboratory observations of heritable and costly resistance in defoliators, suggest that eco-evolutionary dynamics may play a general role in defoliator outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Identification of genomic regions that are identical by descent (IBD) has proven useful for human genetic studies where analyses have led to the discovery of familial relatedness and fine-mapping of disease critical regions. Unfortunately however, IBD analyses have been underutilized inanalysis of other organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as havingmany highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.",

However, research into visual neural activity has focused almost exclusively on onset-driven responses that cannot account for sustained perception. We used intracranial recordings in humans to determine the degree to which the presence of a visual stimulus is persistently encoded by neural activity. The correspondence between stimulus duration and response duration was strongest in early visual cortex and gradually diminished along the visual hierarchy, such that is was weakest in inferior-temporal category-selective regions. A similar posterior-anterior gradient was found within inferior temporal face-selective regions, with posterior but not anterior sites showing persistent face-selective activity. The results suggest that regions that appear uniform in terms of their category selectivity are dissociated by how they temporally represent a stimulus in support of real-time experience, and delineate a large-scale organizing principle of the ventral visual stream.",

Here we explore how mutations in the essential enzyme Adenylate Kinase (Adk) of E. coli affect multiple phases of population growth. We introduce a biophysical fitness landscape for these phases, showing how they depend on molecular and cellular properties of Adk. We find that Adk catalytic capacity in the cell (product of activity and abundance) is the major determinant of mutational fitness effects. We show that bacterial lag times are at a well-defined optimum with respect to Adks catalytic capacity, while exponential growth rates are only weakly affected by variation in Adk. Direct pairwise competitions between strains show how environmental conditions modulate the outcome of a competition where growth rates and lag times have a tradeoff, altogether shedding light on the multidimensional nature of fitness and its importance in the evolutionary optimization of enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Genetic switches exhibit multistability, form the basis of epigenetic memory, and are found in natural decision making systems, such as cell fate determination in developmental pathways. Synthetic genetic switches can be used for recording the presence of different environmental signals, for changing phenotype using synthetic inputs and as building blocks for higher-level sequential logic circuits. Understanding how multistable switches can be constructed and how they function within larger biological systems is therefore key to synthetic biology. Here we present a new computational tool, called StabilityFinder, that takes advantage of sequential Monte Carlo methods to identify regions of parameter space capable of producing multistable behaviour, while handling uncertainty in biochemical rate constants and initial conditions. The algorithm works by clustering trajectories in phase space, and iteratively minimizing a distance metric. Here we examine a collection of models of genetic switches, ranging from the deterministic Gardner toggle switch to stochastic models containing different positive feedback connections. We uncover the design principles behind making bistable, tristable and quadristable switches, and find that rate of gene expression is a key parameter. We demonstrate the ability of the framework to examine more complex systems and examine the design principles of a three gene switch. Our framework allows us to relax the assumptions that are often used in genetic switch models and we show that more complex abstractions are still capable of multistable behaviour. Our results suggest many ways in which genetic switches can be enhanced and offer designs for the construction of novel switches. Our analysis also highlights subtle changes in correlation of experimentally tunable parameters that can lead to bifurcations in deterministic and stochastic systems. Overall we demonstrate that StabilityFinder will be a valuable tool in the future design and construction of novel gene networks.",

    "abstract": "Population enhancement through the release of cultured organisms can be an important tool for marine restoration. However, there has been considerable debate about whether releases effectively contribute to conservation and harvest objectives, and whether cultured organisms impact the fitness of wild populations. Pacific salmonid hatcheries on the West Coast of North America represent one of the largest enhancement programs in the world. Molecular-based pedigree studies on one or two generations have contributed to our understanding of the fitness of hatchery-reared individuals relative to wild individuals, and tend to show that hatchery fish have lower reproductive success. However, interpreting the significance of these results can be challenging because the long-term genetic and ecological effects of releases on supplemented populations are unknown. Further, pedigree studies have been opportunistic, rather than hypothesis driven, and have not provided information on \\\"best case\\\" management scenarios. Here, we present a comparative, experimental approach based on genome-wide surveys of changes in diversity in two hatchery lines founded from the same population. We demonstrate that gene flow with wild individuals can reduce divergence from the wild source population over four generations. We also report evidence for consistent genetic changes in a closed hatchery population that can be explained by both genetic drift and domestication selection. The results of this study suggest that genetic risks can be minimized over at least four generations with appropriate actions, and provide empirical support for a decision-making framework that is relevant to the management of hatchery populations.",

In studies on the epidemiology of dengue, the infestation by Aedes aegypti peridomiciliary and the population density are the main determinants for viral spread. However, in Rio Grande do Norte state (RN), the counties that have confirmed cases of microcephaly overlapped the river basins regions surrounded by agriculture and livestock. In addition, the prevalence of microcephaly at the end of the first year of the epidemic was higher in small towns than in larger ones, elements that seem to contradict what is known about the epidemic by other arboviruses. Methods: 234 cases of microcephaly were analyzed from three states and 144 counties. Results: An exponential trend of higher prevalence of microcephaly in the smaller cities (r2=0,7121) was found.The correlation coefficients (R) between the Prevalence of microcephaly and the variables that measured the density of animals in the territory ranged from moderate to strong. Discussion: Concerning microcephaly, studies in progress point to the possibility of association between the Zika Virus and the BVDV, a virus known to produce birth defects in farm animals but perceived as innocuous in humans. Conclusions: The overlap of cases of microcephaly in river basins, their higher prevalence in smaller cities, the strength of the correlation coefficient, render necessary new etiological and pathophysiological studies.\\n\\n4.

Although the resulting estimates had high predictive quality, numerous artifacts emerged during estimation. The first arose in situations where the model was unable to express the observed data for many lines, which ended up sharing the same parameter value. In the second (2254 lines), the model reproduced the data but there were often many parameter sets that did so equally well (equifinality).

    "abstract": "Chromosome number is a key feature of the higher-order organization of the genome, and changes in chromosome number play a fundamental role in evolution. Dysploid gains and losses in chromosome number, as well as polyploidization events, may drive reproductive isolation and lineage diversification. The recent development of probabilistic models of chromosome number evolution in the groundbreaking work by Mayrose et al. (2010, ChromEvol) have enabled the inference of ancestral chromosome numbers over molecular phylogenies and generated new interest in studying the role of chromosome changes in evolution. However, the ChromEvol approach assumes all changes occur anagenetically (along branches), and does not model events that are specifically cladogenetic. Cladogenetic changes may be expected if chromosome changes result in reproductive isolation. Here we present a new class of models of chromosome number evolution (called ChromoSSE) that incorporate both anagenetic and cladogenetic change. The ChromoSSE models allow us to determine the mode of chromosome number evolution; is chromosome evolution occurring primarily within lineages, primarily at lineage splitting, or in clade-specific combinations of both? Furthermore, we can estimate the location and timing of possible chromosome speciation events over the phylogeny. We implemented ChromoSSE in a Bayesian statistical framework, specifically in the software RevBayes, to accommodate uncertainty in parameter estimates while leveraging the full power of likelihood based methods. We tested ChromoSSEs accuracy with simulations and re-examined chromosomal evolution in Aristolochia, Carex section Spirostachyae, Helianthus, Mimulus sensu lato (s.l.), and Primula section Aleuritia, finding evidence for clade-specific combinations of anagenetic and cladogenetic dysploid and polyploid modes of chromosome evolution.",
