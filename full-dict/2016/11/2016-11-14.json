    "abstract": "There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeuroscience is held back by the fact that it is hard to evaluate if a conclusion is correct; the complexity of the systems under study and their experimental inaccessability make the assessment of algorithmic and data analytic technqiues challenging at best. We thus argue for testing approaches using known artifacts, where the correct interpretation is known. Here we present a microprocessor platform as one such test case. We find that many approaches in neuroscience, when used na*vely, fall short of producing a meaningful understanding.",

    "abstract": "The Anopheles gambiae complex contains a number of highly anthropophilic mosquito species that have acquired exceptional ability to thrive in complex human habitats. Thus, examining the evolutionary history of this Afrotropical mosquito may yield vital information on the selective processes that occurred during the adaptation to human-dominated environments. We performed reduced representation sequencing on 941 mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex collected across four ecogeographic zones in Cameroon. We find evidence for genetic and geographic subdivision within An. coluzzii and An. gambiae sensu stricto - the two most significant malaria vectors in the region. Importantly, in both species, rural and urban populations are genetically differentiated. Genome scans reveal pervasive signatures of selection centered on genes involved in xenobiotic resistance. Notably, a selective sweep containing detoxification enzymes is prominent in urban mosquitoes that exploit polluted breeding sites. Overall, our study suggests that recent anthropogenic environmental modifications and widespread use of insecticides are driving population differentiation and local adaptation in vectors with potentially significant consequences for malaria epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Malaria vectors are exposed to intense selective pressures due to large-scale intervention programs that are underway in most African countries. One of the current priorities is therefore to clearly assess the adaptive potential of Anopheline populations, which is critical to understand and anticipate the response mosquitoes can elicit against such adaptive challenges. The development of genomic resources that will empower robust examinations of evolutionary changes in all vectors including currently understudied species is an inevitable step toward this goal. Here we constructed double-digest Restriction Associated DNA (ddRAD) libraries and generated 6461 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that we used to explore the population structure and demographic history of wild-caught Anopheles moucheti from Cameroon. The genome-wide distribution of allelic frequencies among samples best fitted that of an old population at equilibrium, characterized by a weak genetic structure and extensive genetic diversity, presumably due to a large long term effective population size. Estimates of FST and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) across SNPs reveal a very low genetic differentiation throughout the genome and the absence of segregating LD blocks among populations, suggesting an overall lack of local adaptation. Our study provides the first investigation of the genetic structure and diversity in An. moucheti at the genomic scale. We conclude that, despite a weak genetic structure, this species has the potential to challenge current vector control measures and other rapid anthropogenic and environmental changes thanks to its great genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience, especially in the fields of learning and decision-making, is witnessing the blossoming of computational model-based analyses. Several methodological and review papers have indicated how and why candidate models should be compared by trading off their ability to predict the data as a function of their complexity. However, the importance of simulating candidate models has been so far largely overlooked, which entails several drawbacks and leads to invalid conclusions. Here we argue that the analysis of model simulations is often necessary to support the specific claims about behavioral function that most of model-based studies make. We defend this argument both informally by providing a large-scale (N>300) review of recent studies, and formally by showing how model simulations are necessary to interpret model comparison results. Finally, we propose guidelines for future work, which combine model comparison and simulation.",

Our \\\"Cold Genome\\\" hypothesis postulates that speciation and TEs activity are strongly related in mammals. In order to test this hypothesis, we created two new parameters: the Density of Insertion (DI) and the Relative Rate of Speciation (RRS). The DI is the ratio between the number of TE insertions in a genome and its size, whereas the RRS is a conditional parameter designed to identify potential speciation bursts. Thus, by analyzing TEs insertions in mammals, we defined the genomes as \\\"hot\\\" (low DI) and \\\"cold\\\" (high DI). Then, comparing TEs activity among 16 intra-order pairs of mammalian species, 4 superorders of Eutheria and 29 taxonomical families of the whole Mammalia class, we showed that taxa with positive RRS correlate with \\\"hot\\\" genomes, whereas taxa with negative RRS correlate with \\\"cold\\\" genomes.

We have performed twelve controlled growth trials of an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to assess how the genetic architecture of plant height is influenced by developmental queues, water availability and planting density. The nondestructive nature of plant height measurements has enabled us to monitor vertical growth throughout the plant life cycle in both field and controlled environments. We find that plant height is reduced under water limitation and high density planting and affected by growth environment (field vs. growth chamber). The results support a model where plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait and that the major genetic loci that influence plant height function independent of growth environment. The identity and contribution of loci that influence height changes dynamically throughout development and the reduction of growth observed in water limited environments is a consequence of delayed progression through the genetic program which establishes plant height in Setaria. In this population, alleles inherited from the weedy S. viridis parent act to increase plant height early, whereas a larger number of small effect alleles inherited from the domesticated S. italica parent collectively act to increase plant height later in development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe availability of dense genotypes and whole-genome sequence variants from various sources offers the opportunity to compile large data sets consisting of tens of thousands of animals with genotypes for millions of polymorphic sites that may enhance the power of genomic analyses. The imputation of missing genotypes ensures that all individuals have genotypes for a shared set of variants.\\n\\nResultsWe evaluated the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to whole-genome sequence variants in 249 Fleckvieh and 450 Holstein cattle using Minimac and FImpute. The sequence variants of a subset of the animals were reduced to the variants that were included in the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array and subsequently inferred in silico using either within- or multi-breed reference populations. The accuracy of imputation varied considerably across chromosomes and dropped at regions where the bovine genome contains segmental duplications. Depending on the imputation strategy, the correlation between imputed and true genotypes ranged from 0.898 to 0.952. The accuracy of imputation was higher with Minimac than FImpute particularly for rare alleles. Considering a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of imputation, particularly when FImpute was used to infer genotypes. When the sequence variants were imputed using Minimac, the true genotypes were more correlated to predicted allele dosages than best-guess genotypes. The computing costs to impute 23,256,743 sequence variants in 6958 animals were 10-fold higher with Minimac than FImpute. Association studies with imputed sequence variants revealed seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for milk fat percentage. Two known causal mutations in the DGAT1 and GHR genes were the most significantly associated variants at two QTL on chromosomes 14 and 20 when Minimac was used to infer genotypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe population-based imputation of millions of sequence variants in large cohorts provides accurate genotypes and is computationally feasible. Using a reference population that includes individuals from many breeds increases the accuracy of imputation particularly at low-frequency variants. Considering allele dosages rather than best-guess genotypes as explanatory variables is advantageous for association studies with imputed sequence variants.",

Accurate estimation of these parameters is crucial because much recent work has sought to link them to genotypes. The original goal of this study was to fit the anthesis date component of the CERES-Maize model to 5266 genetic lines grown at 11 site-years and genetically map the resulting parameter estimates. Although the resulting estimates had high predictive quality, numerous artifacts emerged during estimation. The first arose in situations where the model was unable to express the observed data for many lines, which ended up sharing the same parameter value. In the second (2254 lines), the model reproduced the data but there were often many parameter sets that did so equally well (equifinality). These artifacts made genetic mapping impossible, thus, revealing cautionary insights regarding a major current paradigm for linking process based models to genetics.",

By comparing several relevant evolutionary metrics, such as the distribution of fixed selection coefficients and the probability of reversion, we find that the two algorithms behave equivalently in many respects. However, the accelerated algorithm yields less variance in fixed selection coefficients.

It is also known that animals subjected to chronic centrifugation show a reduction in body fat. Experiments with mutant mice found that this loss of fat appears to be mediated by a vestibulo-hypothalamic pathway. Vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), also known as galvanic vestibular stimulation, involves non-invasively stimulating the vestibular system by applying a small electrical current between two electrodes placed over the mastoid processes.

    "abstract": "Wide-field optical imaging techniques constitute powerful tools to sample and study mesoscale neuronal activity. The sampled data constitutes a sequence of image frames in which one can perceive the flow of brain activity starting and terminating at source and sink locations respectively. The most common data analyses include qualitative assessment to identify sources and sinks of activity as well as their trajectories. The quantitative analyses is mostly based on computing the temporal variation of the intensity of pixels while a few studies have also reported estimates of wave motion using optical-flow techniques from computer vision. A comprehensive toolbox for the quantitative analyses of mesoscale brain activity data however is still missing. We present a graphical-user-interface based Matlab(R) toolbox for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of mesoscale brain activity using optical-flow analyses. The toolbox includes the implementation of three optical-flow methods namely Horn-Schunck, Combined Local-Global, and Temporospatial algorithms for estimating velocity vector fields of perceived flow in mesoscale brain activity. From the velocity vector fields we determine the locations of sources and sinks as well as the trajectories and temporal velocities of activity flow. Using our toolbox, we compare the efficacy of the three optical-flow methods for determining spatiotemporal dynamics by using simulated data. We also demonstrate the application of optical-flow methods onto sensory-evoked calcium and voltage imaging data. Our results indicate that the combined local-global method we employ, yields results that correlate with the manual assessment. The automated approach permits rapid and effective quantification of mesoscale brain dynamics and may facilitate the study of brain function in response to new experiences or pathology.\\n\\nConflicts of Interestnone\\n\\nAuthor contribution statementMHM, MM, NV, and SI designed the study.

    "abstract": "Ribosomes can stall during translation elongation in bacteria and eukaryotes. To identify mechanisms by which ribosome stalling affects expression of the encoded protein, we develop an inverse approach that combines computational modeling with systematic perturbations of translation initiation rate, the number of stall sites, and the distance between stall sites on a reporter mRNA. By applying this approach to ribosome stalls caused by amino acid starvation in the bacterium Escherichia coli, we find that our measurements are quantitatively inconsistent with two widely used kinetic models for stalled ribosomes: ribosome traffic jams that block initiation, and abortive (premature) termination of stalled ribosomes. To account for this discrepancy, we consider a model in which collision from a trailing ribosome causes abortive termination of the stalled ribosome. This collision-stimulated abortive termination model provides a better fit to measured protein synthesis rates from our reporter library, and is consistent with observed ribosome densities near stall sites. Analysis of this model further predicts that ribosome collisions can selectively stimulate abortive termination of stalled ribosomes without fine-tuning of kinetic rate parameters. Thus ribosome collisions may serve as a robust timer for translational quality control pathways to recognize stalled ribosomes.",

This implies that an initial selection of mass is given by a dependence of mass specific metabolism on mass in replicators that are close to a lower size limit. A maximum dependence that is sublinear is shown to select for virus-like replicators with no intrinsic metabolism, no cell, and practically no mass. A maximum superlinear dependence is instead selecting for prokaryote-like self-replicating cells with asexual reproduction and incomplete metabolic pathways. These self-replicating cells have selection for increased net energy, and this generates a gradual unfolding of a population dynamic feed-back selection from interactive competition. The incomplete feed-back is shown to select for larger unicells with more developed metabolic pathways, and the completely developed feed-back to select for multicellular animals with sexual reproduction.\\n\\nThis model unifies natural selection from viruses to multicellular animals, and it provides a parsimonious explanation where allometries and major life history transitions evolve from the natural selection of metabolism and mass.",

    "abstract": "Prochlorococcus is a globally abundant marine cyanobacterium with many adaptations that reduce cellular nutrient requirements, facilitating growth in its nutrient-poor environment. One such genomic adaptation is the preferential utilization of amino acids containing fewer N-atoms, which minimizes cellular nitrogen requirements. We predicted that transcriptional regulation might be used to further reduce cellular N budgets during transient N limitation. To explore this, we compared transcription start sites (TSSs) in Prochlorococcus MED4 under N-deprived and N-replete conditions. Of 64 genes with primary and internal TSSs in both conditions, N-deprived cells initiated transcription downstream of primary TSSs more frequently than N-replete cells. Additionally, 117 genes with only an internal TSS demonstrated increased internal transcription under N-deprivation. These shortened transcripts encode predicted proteins with ~5-20% less N content compared to full-length transcripts. We hypothesized that low translation rates, which afford greater control over protein abundances, would be beneficial to relatively slow-growing organisms like Prochlorococcus. Consistent with this idea, we found that Prochlorococcus exhibits greater usage of glycine-glycine motifs, which cause translational pausing, when compared to faster growing microbes. Our findings indicate that structural changes occur within the Prochlorococcus MED4 transcriptome during N-deprivation, potentially altering the size and structure of proteins expressed under nutrient limitation.",

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an oval-shaped, symmetrically dividing human pathogen lacking the canonical systems for division site control (nucleoid occlusion and the Min-system). Recently, the early division protein MapZ was identified and implicated in pneumococcal division site selection. We show that MapZ is important for proper division plane selection; thus the question remains what drives pneumococcal division site selection. By mapping the cell cycle in detail, we show that directly after replication both chromosomal origin regions localize to the future cell division sites, prior to FtsZ. Perturbing the longitudinal chromosomal organization by mutating the condensin SMC, by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated chromosome cutting or by poisoning DNA decatenation resulted in mistiming of MapZ and FtsZ positioning and subsequent cell elongation. Together, we demonstrate an intimate relationship between DNA replication, chromosome segregation and division site selection in the pneumococcus, providing a simple way to ensure equally sized daughter cells without the necessity for additional protein factors.",

The di-nucleotide methyl-CG (mCG) is the canonical MeCP2 DNA recognition sequence, but additional targets including non-methylated sequences have been reported. Here we use brain-specific depletion of DNA methyltransferase to show that DNA methylation is the primary determinant of MeCP2 binding in mouse brain. In vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that MeCP2 binding to non-CG methylated sites in brain is largely confined to the tri-nucleotide sequence mCAC. Structural modeling suggests that mCG and mCAC may be interchangeable as minimal structural perturbation of MeCP2 accompanies binding. MeCP2 binding to chromosomal DNA in mouse brain is proportional to mCG + mCAC density and defines domains within which transcription is sensitive to MeCP2 occupancy. The results suggest that MeCP2 interprets patterns of mCAC and mCG in the brain to negatively modulate transcription of genes critical for neuronal function.",

I also gave explanations to two long debated questions: 1) both genome GC content and CDS purine content are correlated with the thermophilicity in archaea, but not in bacteria; 2) the purine rich pattern of CDS in most species is mainly a consequence of coding requirement, but not mRNA interaction dynamics.

    "abstract": "The geometrical tree structures of axonal and dendritic processes play important roles in determining the architecture and capabilities of neuronal circuitry. Morphological features based on this tree structure have played a central role in classifying neurons for over a century. Yet geometrical trees are not automatically adapted to the basic mathematical tool used widely in data analysis, namely vector spaces and linear algebra, since tree geometries cannot be naturally added and subtracted. Current methods for analysis reduce trees to feature vectors in more or less ad hoc ways. A more natural mathematical object suited to characterizing neuronal tree geometries, is a metric space, where only distances between objects need be defined. In recent years, there have been significant developments in the fields of computational topology and geometry that promise to be useful for the analysis of neuronal geometries. In this paper, we adapt these tools to the problem of characterizing and analyzing neuronal morphology.\\n\\nAs more and more neuroanatomical data are made available through efforts such as NeuroMorpho.org and FlyCircuit.org, the need to develop computational tools to facilitate automatic knowledge discovery from such large datasets becomes more urgent. One fundamental question is how best to compare neuron structures, for instance to organize and classify large collection of neurons. We aim to develop a flexible yet powerful framework to support comparison and classification of large collection of neuron structures efficiently. Specifically we propose to use a topological persistence-based feature vectorization framework. Existing methods to vectorize a neuron (i.e, convert a neuron to a feature vector so as to support efficient comparison and/or searching) typically rely on statistics or summaries of morphometric information, such as the average or maximum local torque angle or partition asymmetry. These simple summaries have limited power in encoding global tree structures. Leveraging recent development in topological data analysis, we vectorize each neuron structure into a simple yet informative summary via the use of topological persistence. In particular, each type of information of interest can be represented as a descriptor function defined on the neuron tree, which is then mapped to a simple persistence-signature. Our framework can encode both local and global tree structure, as well as other information of interest (electrophysiological or dynamical measures), by considering multiple descriptor functions on the neuron. The resulting persistence-based signature is potentially more informative than simple statistical summaries (such as average/mean/max) of morphometric quantities - Indeed, we show that using a certain descriptor function will give a persistence-based signature containing strictly more information than the classical Sholl analysis. At the same time, our framework retains the efficiency associated with treating neurons as points in a simple Euclidean feature space, which would be important for constructing efficient searching or indexing structures over them. We present preliminary experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our persistence-based neuronal feature vectorization framework.",

We identified 181 yeast genes that are absent from the reference genome and demonstrated their expression and role in important functions such as drug resistance. We then simultaneously measured the growth rates of over 4500 lab strains each deficient of a nonessential gene and 81 natural strains across multiple environments using unique DNA barcode present in each strain. We combined the genome-wide reverse genetic information with genome-wide association analysis to determine potential genomic regions of importance to environmental adaptations, and for a subset experimentally validated their role by reciprocal hemizygosity tests.

We found that direct measurement of protein synthesis by pSILAC correlated well with the indirect measurement of protein synthesis by ribosome profiling under conditions of robust translation. By developing a statistical model integrating longitudinal proteomic and mRNA-seq measurements, we found that proteomics could directly detect global alterations in translational rate as a function of therapy-induced stress after prolonged bortezomib exposure.

Our measurements show that diabetic patients had RBCs of reduced cell sphericity and elevated intracellular haemoglobin concentration and content compared to healthy (non-diabetic) subjects. Furthermore, membrane deformability of diabetic RBCs is significantly lower than that of healthy, non-diabetic RBCs. Interestingly, non-diabetic RBCs exhibit strong correlations between the elevated glycated haemoglobin in RBC cytoplasm and decreased cell deformability, whereas diabetic RBCs do not show correlations. Our observations strongly support the idea that slow and irreversible glycation of haemoglobin and membrane proteins of RBCs by hyperglycaemia significantly compromises RBC deformability in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitously occuring non-specific lipid-transfer proteins (nsLTPs) in plants are implicated in key processes like biotic and abiotic stress, seed development and lipid transport. Additionally, they constitute a panallergen multigene family present in both food and pollen. Presently there are 49 nsLTP entries in the WHO/IUIS allergen database (http://allergen.org/). Analysis of full-length allergens identified only two major classes (nsLTP1,n=32 and nsLTP2,n=2), although nsLTPs are classified into many other groups. nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 are differentiated by their sequences, molecular weights, pattern of the conserved disulphide bonds and volume of the hydrophobic cavity. The conserved R44 is present in all full length nsLTP1 allergens (only Par j 2 from Parietaria judaica has K44), while D43 is present in all but Par j 1/2 from P. judaica (residue numbering based on PDBid:2ALGA). Although, the importance of these residues is well-established in nsLTP1, the corresponding residues in nsLTP2 remain unknown. A structural motif comprising of two cysteines with a disulphide bond (C3-C50), R44 and D43 identified a congruent motif (C3/C35/R47/D42) in a nsLTP2 protein from rice (PDBid:1L6HA), using the CLASP methodology. This also provides a quantitative method to assess the cross-reactivity potential of different proteins through congruence of an epitope and its neighbouring residues. Future work will involve obtaining the PDB structure of an nsLTP2 allergen and Par j 1/2 nsLTP1 sequences with a missing D43, determine whether nsLTP from other groups beside nsLTP1/2 are allergens, and determine nsLTP allergens from other plants commonly responsible for causing allergic reactions (chickpea, walnut, etc.) based on a genome wide identification of genes with conserved allergen features and their in vitro characterization.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiology is entering the era of  Big Data. Multiple probes, each with hundreds to thousands of individual electrodes, are now capable of simultaneously recording from many brain regions. The major challenge confronting these new technologies is transforming the raw data into physiologically meaningful signals, i.e. single unit spikes. Sorting the spike events of individual neurons from a spatiotemporally dense sampling of the extracellular electric field is a problem that has attracted much attention [22, 23], but is still far from solved. Current methods still rely on human input and thus become unfeasible as the size of the data sets grow exponentially.\\n\\nHere we introduce the t-student stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) dimensionality reduction method [27] as a visualization tool in the spike sorting process. T-sne embeds the n-dimensional extracellular spikes (n = number of features by which each spike is decomposed) into a low (usually two) dimensional space. We show that such embeddings, even starting from different feature spaces, form obvious clusters of spikes that can be easily visualized and manually delineated with a high degree of precision. We propose that these clusters represent single units and test this assertion by applying our algorithm on labeled data sets both from hybrid [23] and paired juxtacellular/extracellular recordings [15]. We have released a graphical user interface (gui) written in python as a tool for the manual clustering of the t-sne embedded spikes and as a tool for an informed overview and fast manual curration of results from other clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the generated visualizations offer evidence in favor of the use of probes with higher density and smaller electrodes. They also graphically demonstrate the diverse nature of the sorting problem when spikes are recorded with different methods and arise from regions with different background spiking statistics.",

    "abstract": "Random-effects models are a popular tool for analysing total narrow-sense heritability for simple quantitative phenotypes on the basis of large-scale SNP data. Recently, there have been disputes over the validity of conclusions that may be drawn from such analysis. We derive some of the fundamental statistical properties of heritability estimates arising from these models, showing that the bias will generally be small. We show that that the score function may be manipulated into a form that facilitates intelligible interpretations of the results. We use this score function to explore the behavior of the model when certain key assumptions of the model are not satisfied -- shared environment, measurement error, and genetic effects that are confined to a small subset of sites -- as well as to elucidate the meaning of negative heritability estimates that may arise.\\n\\nThe variance and bias depend crucially on the variance of certain functionals of the singular values of the genotype matrix. A useful baseline is the singular value distribution associated with genotypes that are completely independent -- that is, with no linkage and no relatedness -- for a given number of individuals and sites. We calculate the corresponding variance and bias for this setting.\\n\\nMSC 2010 subject classifications: Primary 92D10; secondary 62P10; 62F10; 60B20.",

    "abstract": "Both the weighted and unweighted Unifrac distances have been very successfully employed to assess if two communities differ, but do not give any information about how two communities differ. We take advantage of recent observations that the Unifrac metric is equivalent to the so-called earth movers distance (also known as the Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric) to develop an algorithm that not only computes the Unifrac distance in linear time and space, but also simultaneously finds which operational taxonomic units are responsible for the observed differences between samples. This allows the algorithm, called EMDUnifrac, to determine why given samples are different, not just if they are different, and with no added computational burden. EMDUnifrac can be utilized on any distribution on a tree, and so is particularly suitable to analyzing both operational taxonomic units derived from amplicon sequencing, as well as community profiles resulting from classifying whole genome shotgun metagenomes.

    "abstract": "Plasmids are autonomous extra-chromosomal elements in bacterial cells that can carry genes that are important for bacterial survival. To benchmark algorithms for automated plasmid sequence reconstruction from short read sequencing data, we selected 42 publicly available complete bacterial genome sequences which were assembled by a combination of long- and short-read data. The selected bacterial genome sequence projects span 12 genera, containing 148 plasmids. We predicted plasmids from short-read data with four different programs (PlasmidSPAdes, Recycler, cBar and PlasmidFinder) and compared the outcome to the reference sequences.\\n\\nPlasmidSPAdes reconstructs plasmids based on coverage differences in the assembly graph. It reconstructed most of the reference plasmids (recall = 0.82) but approximately a quarter of the predicted plasmid contigs were false positives (precision = 0.76). PlasmidSPAdes merged 83 % of the predictions from genomes with multiple plasmids in a single bin. Recycler searches the assembly graph for sub-graphs corresponding to circular sequences and correctly predicted small plasmids but failed with long plasmids (recall = 0.12, precision = 0.30). cBar, which applies pentamer frequency composition analysis to detect plasmid-derived contigs, showed an overall recall and precision of 0.78 and 0.64. However, cBar only categorizes contigs as plasmid-derived and does not bin the different plasmids correctly within a bacterial isolate. PlasmidFinder, which searches for matches in a replicon database, had the highest precision (1.0) but was restricted by the contents of its database and the contig length obtained from de novo assembly (recall = 0.36).\\n\\nSurprisingly, PlasmidSPAdes and Recycler detected single isolated components corresponding to putative novel small plasmids (<10 kbp) which were also predicted as plasmids by cBar.\\n\\nThis study shows that it is possible to automatically predict plasmid sequences, but only for small plasmids. The reconstruction of large plasmids (>50 kbp) containing repeated sequences remains challenging and limits the high-throughput analysis of WGS data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryShort read sequencing of the DNA of bacteria is often used to understand characteristics such as antibiotic resistance. However the assembly of short read sequencing data with the goal of reconstructing a complete genome is often fragmented and leaves gaps. Therefore independently replicating DNA fragments called plasmids cannot easily be identified from an assembly. Lately a number of programs have been developed to enable the automated prediction of the sequences of plasmids. Here we tested these programs by comparing their outcomes with complete genome sequences. None of the tested programs were able to fully and unambiguously predict distinct plasmid sequences. All programs performed best with the prediction of plasmids smaller than 50 kbp. Larger plasmids were only correctly predicted if they were present as a single contig in the assembly. While predictions by PlasmidSPAdes and cBar contained most of the plasmids, they were merged with or indistinguishable from other plasmids and sometimes chromosome sequences. PlasmidFinder missed most plasmids but all its predictions were correct. Without manual steps or long-read sequencing information, plasmid reconstruction from short read sequencing data remains challenging.",

    "abstract": "In humans, as in other mammals, synonymous codon usage (SCU) varies widely among genes. In particular, genes involved in cell differentiation or in proliferation display a distinct codon usage, suggesting that SCU is adaptively constrained to optimize translation efficiency in distinct cellular states. However, in mammals, SCU is known to correlate with large-scale fluctuations of GC-content along chromosomes, caused by meiotic recombination, via the non-adaptive process of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). To disentangle and to quantify the different factors driving SCU in humans, we analyzed the relationships between functional categories, base composition, recombination, and gene expression. We first demonstrate that SCU is predominantly driven by large-scale variation in GC-content and is not linked to constraints on tRNA abundance, which excludes an effect of translational selection. In agreement with the gBGC model, we show that differences in SCU among functional categories are explained by variation in intragenic recombination rate, which, in turn, is strongly negatively correlated to gene expression levels during meiosis. Our results indicate that variation in SCU among functional categories (including variation associated to differentiation or proliferation)- result from differences in levels of meiotic transcription, which interferes with the formation of crossovers and thereby affects gBGC intensity within genes. Overall, the gBGC model explains 81.3% of the variance in SCU among genes. We argue that the strong heterogeneity of SCU induced by gBGC in mammalian genomes precludes any optimization of the tRNA pool to the demand in codon usage.",

    "abstract": "We describe MARS (Motif Assessment and Ranking Suite), a web-based suite of tools used to evaluate and rank PWM-based motifs. The increased number of learned motif models that are spread across databases and in different PWM formats, leading to a choice dilemma among the users, is our motivation. This increase has been driven by the difficulty of modelling transcription factor binding sites and the advance in high-throughput sequencing technologies at a continually reducing cost. Therefore, several experimental techniques have been developed resulting in diverse motif-finding algorithms and databases. We collate a wide variety of available motifs into a benchmark database, including the corresponding experimental ChIP-seq and PBM data obtained from ENCODE and UniPROBE databases, respectively. The implemented tools include: a data-independent consistency-based motif assessment and ranking (CB-MAR), which is based on the idea that  correct motifs are more similar to each other while incorrect motifs will differ from each other; and a scoring and classification-based algorithms, which rank binding models by their ability to discriminate sequences known to contain binding sites from those without. The CB-MAR and scoring techniques have a 0.86 and 0.73 median rank correlation using ChIP-seq and PBM respectively. Best motifs selected by CB-MAR achieve a mean AUC of 0.75, comparable to those ranked by held out data at 0.76 - this is based on ChIP-seq motif discovery using five algorithms on 110 transcription factors. We have demonstrated the benefit of this web server in motif choice and ranking, as well as in motif discovery. It can be accessed at http://www.bioinf.ict.ru.ac.za/.",
