    "abstract": "The ready availability of vast amounts of genomic sequence data has created the need to rethink comparative genomics algorithms using \\\"big data\\\" approaches. Neptune is an efficient system for rapidly locating differentially abundant genomic content in bacterial populations using an exact k-mer matching strategy, while accommodating k-mer mismatches. Neptunes loci discovery process identifies sequences that are sufficiently common to a group of target sequences and sufficiently absent from non-targets using probabilistic models. Neptune uses parallel computing to efficiently identify and extract these loci from draft genome assemblies without requiring multiple sequence alignments or other computationally expensive comparative sequence analyses. Tests on simulated and real data sets showed that Neptune rapidly identifies regions that are both sensitive and specific. We demonstrate that this system can identify trait-specific loci from different bacterial lineages. Neptune is broadly applicable for comparative bacterial analyses, yet will particularly benefit pathogenomic applications, owing to efficient and sensitive discovery of differentially abundant genomic loci.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease characterized by cartilage degeneration and joint remodeling. The underlying molecular changes underpinning disease progression are incompletely understood, but can be characterized using recent advances in genomics technologies, as the relevant tissue is readily accessible at joint replacement surgery. Here we investigate genes and pathways that mark OA progression, combining genome-wide DNA methylation, RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics in isolated primary chondrocytes from matched intact and degraded articular cartilage samples across twelve patients with OA undergoing knee replacement surgery.\\n\\nResultsWe identify 49 genes differentially regulated between intact and degraded cartilage at multiple omics levels, 16 of which have not previously been implicated in OA progression. Using independent replication datasets, we replicate statistically significant signals and show that the direction of change is consistent for over 90% of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated CpG probes. Three genes are differentially regulated across all 3 omics levels: AQP1, COL1A1 and CLEC3B, and all three have evidence implicating them in OA through animal or cellular model studies. Integrated pathway analysis implicates the involvement of extracellular matrix degradation, collagen catabolism and angiogenesis in disease progression. All data from these experiments are freely available as a resource for the scientific community.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work provides a first integrated view of the molecular landscape of human primary chondrocytes and identifies key molecular players in OA progression that replicate across independent datasets, with evidence for translational potential.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity during cognitive tasks exhibits complex dynamics that flexibly encode task-relevant variables. Chaotic recurrent networks, which spontaneously generate rich dynamics, have been proposed as a model of cortical computation during cognitive tasks. However, existing methods for training these networks are either biologically implausible, and/or require a continuous, real-time error signal to guide learning. Here we show that a biologically plausible learning rule can train such recurrent networks, guided solely by delayed, phasic rewards at the end of each trial. Networks endowed with this learning rule can successfully learn nontrivial tasks requiring flexible (context-dependent) associations, memory maintenance, nonlinear mixed selectivities, and coordination among multiple outputs. The resulting networks replicate complex dynamics previously observed in animal cortex, such as dynamic encoding of task features and selective integration of sensory inputs. We conclude that recurrent neural networks offer a plausible model of cortical dynamics during both learning and performance of flexible behavior.",

But what traits allow for, or even facilitate, adaptation to the strong selection humans impose on natural systems? Using a combination of lab and greenhouse studies of 32 natural populations of the common agricultural weed, Ipomoea purpurea, we show that herbicide resistant populations self-fertilize more than susceptible populations. We likewise show that anther-stigma distance, a floral trait associated with self-fertilization in this species, exhibits a non-linear relationship with resistance such that the most and least resistant populations exhibit lower anther-stigma separation compared to populations with moderate levels of resistance. Overall, our results extend the general finding that plant mating can be impacted by human-mediated agents of selection to that of the extreme selection of the agricultural system.

    "abstract": "Gompertz empirical law of mortality is often used in practical research to parametrize survival fraction as a function of age with the help of just two quantities: the Initial Mortality Rate (IMR) and the Gompertz exponent, inversely proportional to the Mortality Rate Doubling Time (MRDT). The IMR is often found to be inversely related to the Gompertz exponent, which is the dependence commonly referred to as Strehler-Mildvan (SM) correlation. In this paper, we address fundamental uncertainties of the Gompertz parameters inference from experimental Kaplan-Meier plots and show, that a least squares fit often leads to an ill-defined non-linear optimization problem, which is extremely sensitive to sampling errors and the smallest systematic demographic variations. Therefore, an analysis of consequent repeats of the same experiments in the same biological conditions yields the whole degenerate manifold of possible Gompertz parameters. We find that whenever the average lifespan of species greatly exceeds MRDT, small random variations in the survival records produce large deviations in the identified Gompertz parameters along the line, corresponding to the set of all possible IMR and MRDT values, roughly compatible with the properly determined value of average lifespan in experiment. The best fit parameters in this case turn out to be related by a form of SM correlation. Therefore, we have to conclude that the combined property, such as the average lifespan in the group, rather than IMR and MRDT values separately, may often only be reliably determined via experiments, even in a perfectly homogeneous animal cohort due to its finite size and/or low age-sampling frequency, typical for modern high-throughput settings. We support our findings with careful analysis of experimental survival records obtained in cohorts of C. elegans of different sizes, in control groups and under the influence of experimental therapies or environmental conditions. We argue that since, SM correlation may show up as a consequence of the fitting degeneracy, its appearance is not limited to homogeneous cohorts. In fact, the problem persists even beyond the simple Gompertz mortality law. We show that the same degeneracy occurs exactly in the same way, if a more advanced Gompertz-Makeham aging model is employed to improve the modeling. We explain how SM type of relation between the demographic parameters may still be observed even in extremely large cohorts with immense statistical power, such as in human census datasets, provided that systematic historical changes are weak in nature and lead to a gradual change in the mean lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Integrating network theory approaches over longitudinal genome-wide gene expression data is a robust approach to understand the molecular underpinnings of a dynamic biological process. Here, we performed a network-based investigation of longitudinal gene expression changes during sporulation of a yeast strain, SK1. Using global network attributes, viz. clustering coefficient, degree distribution of a node, degree-degree mixing of the connected nodes and disassortativity, we observed dynamic changes in these parameters indicating a highly connected network with inter-module crosstalk. Analysis of local attributes, such as clustering coefficient, hierarchy, betweenness centrality and Granovetters weak ties showed that there was an inherent hierarchy under regulatory control that was determined by specific nodes. Biological annotation of these nodes indicated the role of specifically linked pairs of genes in meiosis. These genes act as crucial regulators of sporulation in the highly sporulating SK1 strain. An independent analysis of these network properties in a less efficient sporulating strain helped to understand the heterogeneity of network profiles. We show that comparison of network properties has the potential to identify candidate nodes contributing to the phenotypic diversity of developmental processes in natural populations. Therefore, studying these network parameters as described in this work for dynamic developmental processes, such as sporulation in yeast and eventually in disease progression in humans, can help in identifying candidate factors which are potential regulators of differences between normal and perturbed processes and can be causal targets for intervention.",

We have used a common model framework for gene expression where both motif structures have an activating input and repressing regulator, with the same set of parameters to enable comparison of the responses. We studied the global sensitivity of the system properties such as steady-state gain, overshoot, peak time, and peak duration, to parameters. We find that, in all motifs, overshoot correlated negatively whereas peak duration varied concavely, with peak time. Differences in other system properties were found to be mainly dependent on the the nature of the regulator, than the motif structure. Protein mediated motifs showed a higher degree of adaptation; feedforward motifs exhibited perfect adaptation. RNA mediated motifs had a mild regulatory effect; they also exhibited lower peaking tendency and mean overshoot. Protein mediated feedforward motifs showed higher overshoot and lower peak time compared to corresponding feedback motifs.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that synthetic gene expression is highly sensitive to how comprising genetic elements (promoter structure, spacing regions between promoter and coding sequences, ribosome binding sites, etc.) are spatially configured. An important topic that has received far less attention is how the physical layout of entire genes within a synthetic gene network affects their individual expression levels. In this paper we show, both quantitatively and qualitatively, that compositional context can significantly alter expression levels in synthetic gene networks. We also show that these compositional context effects are pervasive both at the transcriptional and translational level. Further, we demonstrate that key characteristics of gene induction, such as ultra-sensitivity and dynamic range, are heavily dependent on compositional context. We postulate that supercoiling can be used to explain these interference effects and validate this hypothesis through modeling and a series of in vitro supercoiling relaxation experiments. On the whole, these results suggest that compositional context introduces feedback in synthetic gene networks. As an illustrative example, we show that a design strategy incorporating compositional context effects can improve threshold detection and memory properties of the toggle switch.",

    "abstract": "The main application of ChIP-seq technology is the detection of genomic regions that bind to a protein of interest. A large part of functional genomics public catalogs are based on ChIP-seq data. These catalogs rely on peak calling algorithms that infer protein-binding sites by detecting genomic regions associated with more mapped reads (coverage) than expected by chance as a result of the experimental protocol's lack of perfect specificity. We find that GC-content bias accounts for substantial variability in the observed coverage for ChIP-Seq experiments and that this variability leads to false-positive peak calls. More concerning is that GC-effect varies across experiments, with the effect strong enough to result in a substantial number of peaks called differently when different laboratories perform experiments on the same cell-line. However, accounting for GC-content in ChIP-Seq is challenging because the binding sites of interest tend to be more common in high GC-content regions, which confounds real biological signal with the unwanted variability. To account for this challenge we introduce a statistical approach that accounts for GC-effects on both non-specific noise and signal induced by the binding site. The method can be used to account for this bias in binding quantification as well to improve existing peak calling algorithms. We use this approach to show a reduction in false positive peaks as well as improved consistency across laboratories.",

Prior studies demonstrate focal, neocortical epilepsy is associated with dysfunction, several hours before seizures. How does the epileptic network perpetuate dysfunction during baseline periods? To address this question, we developed an unsupervised machine learning technique to disentangle patterns of functional interactions between brain regions, or subgraphs, from dynamic functional networks constructed from approximately 100 hours of intracranial recordings in each of 22 neocortical epilepsy patients. Using this approach, we found: (i) subgraphs from ictal (seizure) and interictal (baseline) epochs are topologically similar, (ii) interictal subgraph topology and dynamics can predict brain regions that generate seizures, and (iii) subgraphs undergo slower and more coordinated fluctuations during ictal epochs compared to interictal epochs. Our observations suggest that the epileptic network drives dysfunction by controlling dynamics of functional interactions between brain regions that generate seizures and those that underlie normal function.",

However, whether or not the prediction error valence also affects counterfactual learning, that is, learning from forgone outcomes, is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the performance of two cohorts of participants on reinforcement learning tasks using a computational model that was adapted to test if prediction error valance influences learning. Concerning factual learning, we replicated previous findings of a valence-induced bias, whereby participants learned preferentially from positive, relative to negative, prediction errors. In contrast, for counterfactual learning, we found the opposite valence-induced bias: negative prediction errors were preferentially taken into account relative to positive ones. When considering valence-induced bias in the context of both factual and counterfactual learning, it appears that people tend to preferentially take into account information that confirms their current choice. By documenting these valence-induced learning biases, our findings demonstrate the presence of a confirmation bias in human reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "A number of image recognition systems have been specifically formulated for the individual recognition of large animals. These programs are versatile and can easily be adapted for the identification of smaller individuals such as insects. The Interactive Individual Identification System, I3S Classic, initially produced for the identification of individual whale sharks was employed to distinguish between different species of mosquitoes and bees, utilising the distinctive vein pattern present on insect wings. I3S Classic proved to be highly effective and accurate in identifying different species and sexes of mosquitoes and bees, with 80% to100% accuracy for the majority of the species tested. The sibling species Apis mellifera and Apis mellifera carnica were both identified with100% accuracy. Bombus terrestris terrestris and Bombus terrestris audax; were also identified and separated with high degrees of accuracy (90% to 100% respectively for the fore wings and 100% for the hind wings). When both Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and Anopheles arabiensis were present in the database, they were identified with 94% and 100% accuracy respectively, allowing for a morphological and non-molecular method of sorting between these members of the sibling complex. Flat, not folded and entire, rather than broken, wing specimens were required for accurate identification. Only one wing image of each sex was required in the database to retrieve high levels of accurate results in the majority of species tested. The study describes how I3S was used to identify different insect species and draws comparisons with the use of the CO1 algorithm. As with CO1, I3S Classic proved to be suitable software which could reliably be used to aid the accurate identification of insect species. It is emphasised that image recognition for insect species should always be used in conjunction with other identifying characters in addition to the wings, as is the norm when identifying species using traditional taxonomic keys.",

    "abstract": "Most statistical and mechanistic models used to predict mosquito borne disease transmission incorporate climate drivers of disease transmission by utilizing environmental data collected at scales that are potentially coarser than what mosquito vectors actually experience. Temperature and relative humidity can vary greatly between indoor and outdoor environments, and can be influenced strongly by variation in landscape features. In the Aedes albopictus system, we conducted a proof-of-concept study in the vicinity of the University of Georgia to explore the effects of fine-scale microclimate variation on mosquito life history and vectorial capacity (VC). We placed Ae. albopictus larvae in artificial pots distributed across three replicate sites within three different land uses - urban, suburban, and rural, which were characterized by high, intermediate, and low proportions of impervious surfaces. Data loggers were placed into each larval environment and in nearby vegetation to record daily variation in water and ambient temperature and relative humidity. The number of adults emerging from each pot and their body size and sex were recorded daily. We found mosquito microclimate to significantly vary across the season as well as with land use. Urban sites were in general warmer and less humid than suburban and rural sites, translating into decreased larval survival, smaller body sizes, and lower per capita growth rates of mosquitoes on urban sites. Dengue transmission potential was predicted to be higher in the summer than the fall. Additionally, the effects of land use on dengue transmission potential varied by season. Warm summers resulted in a higher predicted VC on the cooler, rural sites, while warmer, urban sites had a higher predicted VC during the cooler fall season.",

    "abstract": "Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) accounts for 30% of lung cancers, with over 400,000 deaths per year worldwide. Although evidence suggests that chronic lung injury drives carcinogenesis, a comprehensive understanding of this process remains elusive. Here, I used a comparative microarray analysis to identify gene expression differences shared between airway injury and squamous lung cancer. Of the 667 genes that exhibited differential expression following murine polidocanol and SO2 injury, 40.6% were additionally dysregulated in human SqCC. Among these, 150 genes were consistently upregulated and 54 downregulated relative to all controls. Examples included genes associated with increased cell cycling, aberrant cytokinesis and DNA repair, and enhanced tumour cell invasion and metastases. For 88.2% of identified genes, altered expression was associated with increased SqCC progression and patient mortality. These results establish a novel gene expression signature linking airway injury and lung cancer pathogenesis.",

Here we characterize a ubiquitin-activated peptidase called DA1 that limits the duration of cell proliferation during organ growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. The peptidase is activated by two RING E3 ligases, BB and DA2, which are subsequently cleaved by the activated peptidase and destabilized. In the case of BB, cleavage leads to destabilization by the RING E3 ligase PRT1 of the N-end rule pathway. DA1 peptidase activity also cleaves the de-ubiquitylase UBP15, which promotes cell proliferation, and the transcription factors TCP15 and TCP22, which promote cell proliferation proliferation and repress endoreduplication. We propose that DA1 peptidase activity regulates the duration of cell proliferation and the transition to endoreduplication and differentiation during organ formation in plants by coordinating the destabilization of regulatory proteins.",

Here we show we show that our long-term memories can guide attention proactively and dynamically based on learned temporal associations. Across two experiments we found that detection and discrimination of targets appearing within previously learned contexts are enhanced when the timing of target appearance matches the learned temporal contingency. Neural markers of temporal preparation revealed that the learned temporal associations trigger specific temporal predictions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBone and joint infections (BJI) are severe infections that require a tailored and protracted antibiotic treatment. The diagnostic of BJI relies on the culture of surgical specimens, yet some bacteria would not grow because of extreme oxygen sensitivity or fastidious growth. Hence, metagenomic sequencing could potentially address those limitations. In this study, we assessed the performances of metagenomic sequencing of BJI samples for the identification of pathogens and the prediction of antibiotic susceptibility.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 179 samples were considered. The DNA was extracted with a kit aiming to decrease the amount of human DNA (Molzym), and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 in 2x250 paired-end reads. The taxonomy was obtained by MetaPhlAn2, the bacterial reads assembled with MetaSPAdes and the antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) identified using a database made of Resfinder+ARDs from functional metagenomic studies.\\n\\nResultsWe could sequence the DNA from 24 out of 179 samples. For monomicrobial samples (n=8), the presence of the pathogen was confirmed by metagenomics in all cases. For polymicrobial samples (n=16), 32/55 bacteria (58.2%) were found at the species level (41/55 [74.5%] at the genus level). Conversely, a total of 273 bacteria not found in culture were identified, 182 being possible pathogens undetected in culture and 91 contaminants. A correct antibiotic susceptibility could be inferred in 94.1% cases for monomicrobial samples and in 76.5% cases in polymicrobial samples.\\n\\nConclusionsWhen sufficient amounts of DNA can be extracted from samples, we found that clinical metagenomics is a potential tool to support conventional culture.",

Previously, the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio was identified as a direct effector of Gq that acts in parallel to the canonical Gq effector phospholipase C. Here we examine how Trio and Rho act to stimulate neuronal activity downstream of Gq in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Through two forward genetic screens, we identify the cation channels NCA-1 and NCA-2, orthologs of mammalian NALCN, as downstream targets of the Gq/Rho pathway. By performing genetic epistasis analysis using dominant activating mutations and recessive loss-of-function mutations in the members of this pathway, we show that NCA-1 and NCA-2 act downstream of Gq in a linear pathway. Through cell-specific rescue experiments, we show that function of these channels in head acetylcholine neurons is sufficient for normal locomotion in C. elegans. Our results suggest that NCA-1 and NCA-2 are physiologically relevant targets of neuronal Gq-Rho signaling in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe NCBIs Sequence Read Archive (SRA) promises great biological insight if one could analyze the data in the aggregate; however, the data remain largely underutilized, in part, due to the poor structure of the metadata associated with each sample. The rules governing submissions to the SRA do not dictate a standardized set of terms that should be used to describe the biological samples from which the sequencing data are derived. As a result, the metadata include many synonyms, spelling variants, and references to outside sources of information. Furthermore, manual annotation of the data remains intractable due to the large number of samples in the archive. For these reasons, it has been difficult to perform large-scale analyses that study the relationships between biomolecular processes and phenotype across diverse diseases, tissues, and cell types present in the SRA.\\n\\nResultsWe present MetaSRA, a database of normalized SRA sample-specific metadata following a schema inspired by the metadata organization of the ENCODE project. This schema involves mapping samples to terms in biomedical ontologies, labeling each sample with a sample-type category, and extracting real-valued properties. We automated these tasks via a novel computational pipeline.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe MetaSRA database is available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/metasra.

    "abstract": "Natural selection has the potential to act on all phenotypes, including genomic mutation rate. Classic evolutionary theory predicts that in asexual populations, mutator alleles, which cause high mutation rates, can fix due to linkage with beneficial mutations. This phenomenon has been demonstrated experimentally and may explain the frequency of mutators found in bacterial pathogens. In contrast, in sexual populations, recombination decouples mutator alleles from beneficial mutations, preventing mutator fixation. In the facultatively sexual yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, segregating alleles of MLH1 and PMS1 have been shown to be incompatible, causing a high mutation rate when combined. These alleles had never been found together naturally, but were recently discovered in a cluster of clinical isolates. Here we report that the incompatible mutator allele combination only marginally elevates mutation rate in these clinical strains. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses provide no evidence of a historically elevated mutation rate. We conclude that the effect of the mutator alleles is dampened by background genetic modifiers. Thus, the relationship between mutation rate and microbial pathogenicity may be more complex than once thought. Our findings provide rare observational evidence that supports evolutionary theory suggesting that sexual organisms are unlikely to harbor alleles that increase their genomic mutation rate.",

Maintaining information provenance and providing data curation and quality control help overcome common concerns and barriers to the effective sharing of scientific data. To address these problems in and the unique challenges of multicellular systems, we assembled a panel composed of investigators from several disciplines to create the MultiCellular Data Standard (MultiCellDS) with a use-case driven development process. The standard includes (1) digital cell lines, which are analogous to traditional biological cell lines, to record metadata, cellular microenvironment, and cellular phenotype variables of a biological cell line, (2) digital snapshots to consistently record simulation, experimental, and clinical data for multicellular systems, and (3) collections that can logically group digital cell lines and snapshots. We have created a MultiCellular DataBase (MultiCellDB) to store digital snapshots and the 200+ digital cell lines we have generated. MultiCellDS, by having a fixed standard, enables discoverability, extensibility, maintainability, searchability, and sustainability of data, creating biological applicability and clinical utility that permits us to identify upcoming challenges to uplift biology and strategies and therapies for improving human health.",

    "abstract": "Tissue classification plays a crucial role in the investigation of normal neural development, brain-behavior relationships, and the disease mechanisms of many psychiatric and neurological illnesses. Ensuring the accuracy of tissue classification is important for quality research and, in particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct various errors inherent to all currently available segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data, an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software package in any data organization structure. Example configurations for three large, open-source datasets are presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics, regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and complexity of study.",

Arginine and lysine respectively have the guanidinium group and the [isin]-amino group as the ionizable side chain groups with different pKa values of about 12.5 and 10.5. The trends of their distribution seem similar in the range of about pIs < 10.0 and diverge in the range of about pIs[&ge;]10.0 in most complete proteomes of 387 species from the three domains of life. The complete proteome of Reticulomyxa filose is the one of only in 287 eukaryotic complete proteomes that has a predominance of the trend of lysine over that of arginine in high pI proteins. The unbalanced distribution of the amino aicds(Arg, Lys) in high pI proteins of complete proteomes may originally come from different pKa values of arginine and lysine and be developed by the influences of an average lysine level of a proteome and evolution. Because of this unbalanced distribution, the pattern of arginine and lysine distribution in high pI proteins of some complete proteomes can form a particular proteomic structure as evolutionary signature that may be shaped by massive natural selection in molecular level from hundreds to ten thousands of proteins in the complete proteomes of many animals and green plants.",

    "abstract": "Proteins seldom function in isolation and thus protein-protein interactions are critical in understanding the molecular basis of diseases and health (1, 2). There are several well established techniques that are used to investigate protein-protein interactions(3). Most of the methods require some form of genetic modification of the target protein and thus always adds extra steps. However, Proximity Ligation Assay(4-6) (PLA) aka Duolink(R) is one such method that requires no genetic modification of the target protein and probes protein-protein interactions in fixed live cells and tissues. Briefly, PLA requires the use of primary antibodies specific to the proteins of interest. Once the sample (fixed cells or tissues) is incubated with species specific primary antibodies, secondary antibodies that are conjugated with oligonucleotides (also known as PLUS and MINUS probes respectively) and connecter oligonucleotides are added. This complex is ligated if the two PLUS and MINUS probes are within 40nm of each other. The resulting nucleic acid is amplified using rolling circle amplification and then probed with appropriate fluorescent probes. If the two proteins are interacting, one could visualize the interaction as a single red foci (for example Far Red Detection) using fluorescent microscopy. Here, we used PLA to probe protein-protein interactions between Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and seven in absentia homolog -1 (Siah-1) - an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We first use PLA to show that GAPDH and Siah-1 proteins exist endogenously in the cytosol of multiple mammalian cell lines. Our data suggest the use of DU145 and T98G cell lines to show translocation of the GAPDH-Siah- 1 complex. Next, we used common nitrosylation agents(7, 8) (S-nitrosoglutathione-GSNO and S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-pencillamine-SNAP) in different concentrations and observed that GAPDH and Siah-1 interact presumably due to the nitrosylation of the former, which is consistent with previous studies(9, 10). Interestingly, no interactions were observed between the two proteins in the absence of GSNO or SNAP indicating that nitrosylation might be critical for GAPDH-Siah1 interactions. Our results suggest that GAPDH-Siah-1 interactions originate in the cytosol and migrate to the nucleus under the conditions tested. We quantify the PLA signal using Duolink(R) Image Tool and observe a clear enhancement of GAPDH-Siah-1 PLA signal upon treating the cells with GSNO or SNAP. Next, we used R-(-)-Deprenyl (deprenyl), a known inhibitor of GAPDH4, and show that it abrogates GAPDH-Siah-1 PLA complex under the conditions tested. Finally, our data suggest that PLA can detect and quantify the GAPDH-Siah1 complex; a well-known protein-protein interaction implicated in neurodegeneration(9-11) and thus could be a method of choice for similar applications.",
