    "abstract": "Animal lifespan can be extended by dietary restriction (DR), but at a cost to fitness. This phenomenon depends on essential amino acids (EAAs) and TOR signalling, but roles of specific tissues and downstream transcriptional regulators are poorly characterised. Manipulating relevant transcription factors (TFs) specifically in lifespan-limiting tissues may ameliorate ageing without costs of DR. Here we identify TFs which regulate the DR phenotype in Drosophila, analysing organs as an interacting system and reducing its transcriptional complexity by two orders of magnitude. Evolutionarily conserved GATA TFs are predicted to regulate the overlapping effects of DR and TOR on organs, and genetic analyses confirmed that these TFs interact with diet to determine lifespan. Importantly, Srp knockdown insulated fly lifespan from the pernicious effects of EAAs, but tissue-specific knockdown reduced the corrolary costs. These results provide the first indication that benefits of EAAs for early-life fitness can be decoupled from longevity by tissue-specific transcriptional reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Cassava is a major staple food for about 800 million people in the tropics and subGtropical regions of the world. Production of cassava is significantly hampered by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), which is caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). The disease is suppressing cassava yields in eastern Africa at an alarming rate. Previous studies have documented that CBSV is more devastating than UCBSV because it more readily infects both susceptible and tolerant cassava cultivars, resulting in greater yield losses. Using whole genome sequences from NGS data, we produced the first coalescentGbased species tree estimate for CBSV and UCBSV. This species framework led to the finding that CBSV has a faster rate of evolution when compared with UCBSV. Furthermore, we have discovered that in CBSV, nonsynonymous substitutions are more predominant than synonymous substitution and occur across the entire genome. All comparative analyses between CBSV and UCBSV presented here suggest that CBSV may be outsmarting the cassava immune system, thus making it more devastating and harder to control.",

Their functional cooperation is reflected in their ability to heterodimerise on adjacent cis regulatory elements, the composite Sox/Oct motif. Given that Oct4 and Sox2 regulate many developmental genes, a quantitative analysis of their synergistic action on different Sox/Oct motifs would yield valuable insights into the mechanisms of early embryonic development. In this study, we measured binding affinities of Oct4 and Sox2 to different Sox/Oct motifs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We found that the synergistic binding interaction is driven mainly by the level of Sox2 in the case of the Fgf4s Sox/Oct motif. Taking into account that Sox2 expression levels fluctuate more than Oct4, our finding could explain how Sox2 controls the segregation of the cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) into the epiblast (EPI) and the primitive endoderm (PE) populations within the developing rodent blastocyst.",

    "abstract": "Nearly 50 years after Hardins \\\"tragedy of the commons\\\" we have not yet found predictive tools to guide us towards sustainable management of common-pool resources (CPR). We often have a good understanding of the qualitative relationships between the principal actors in socioecological systems (SESs), but classical quantitative approaches require a tremendous amount of data to understand the drivers of SESs sustainability. Here we show that qualitative modelling approaches can provide important governance insights for SESs that are understood but not quantified.\\n\\nWe used Loop Analysis to test the outcomes of different management regimes on a simple nature-based tourism SES described by economic, social and environmental variables. We tested the sustainability of different management scenarios on this system and we identified the necessary conditions to achieve it.\\n\\nWe found that management regimes where property rights and responsibilities are shared between different stakeholders are more likely to be successful. However, the system is generally highly unstable and it is important to tune each strategy to each particular situation.\\n\\nThe conditions for sustainability found across the different systems tested were: a low reinvestment rate of tourist revenues into new infrastructures and a low growth rate of the environment. Management strategies based on maximum sustainable yield, which keep the environment far from its carrying capacity, have less chance to be sustainable.\\n\\nQualitative models of SESs are powerful diagnostic tools; they can help identifying variables that play an important role in determining socioecological sustainability in data-poor circumstances and guide the design of efficient data collection programmes. Our results highlight the importance of careful planning when designing management strategies for nature-based tourism. The application of one-size-fits-all solutions to every situation is likely to lead to the failure of the commons; however tourism-based SESs can be sustainable if management strategies are tuned to each particular case.",

    "abstract": "Localization and local translation of oskar mRNA at the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte directs abdominal patterning and germline formation in the embryo. The process requires recruitment and precise regulation of motor proteins to form transport-competent mRNPs. We show that the posterior-targeting kinesin-1 is loaded upon nuclear export of oskar mRNPs, prior to their dynein-dependent transport from the nurse cells into the oocyte. We demonstrate that kinesin-1 recruitment requires the DmTropomyosin1-I/C isoform, an atypical RNA-binding tropomyosin that binds directly to dimerizing oskar 3UTRs. Finally, we show that a small but dynamically changing subset of oskar mRNPs gets loaded with inactive kinesin-1 and that the motor is activated during mid-oogenesis by the functionalized spliced oskar RNA localization element. This inefficient, dynamic recruitment of Khc decoupled from cargo-dependent motor activation constitutes an optmized, coordinated mechanism of mRNP transport, by minimizing interference with other cargo-transport processes and between the cargo associated dynein and kinesin-1.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that low and high firing neurons display different plasticity and dynamics. Here, we assess how neuronal firing changes across brain states in both the hippocampus and frontal cortices of rats. To do so, we rank-ordered rat hippocampal CA1 and frontal cortical units by their firing rates and implemented corrections to account for regression-to-the-mean. We observed remarkably consistent effects across these regions. In both regions firing rates increased during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but with relatively larger increases in high-firing versus low-firing cells accompanied by increased interneuron spiking, indicative of competitive interactions. In contrast, upon non-REM (NREM) sleep, inhibitory firing decreased, and low-firing rate neurons showed larger increases in firing compared to high-firing neurons. These state changes resulted in narrowing of firing rate distributions during each NREM episode with subsequent dispersion of distributions during REM. Following these undulations in variance over the course of sleep, the net effect of sleep was a decrease in firing-rates across all cells, which had a stronger relative effect on lower-firing neurons. Our results suggest greater plasticity in low-firing neurons and indicate that NREM sleep plays a uniquely normalizing role in sleep, while REM sleep disperses firing rates through competitive interactions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMiyawaki and colleagues analyze firing patterns separately in the hippocampus and the neocortex within and across sleep. They find that in both regions REM sleep activity is dominated by high-firing neurons and increased inhibition, resulting in a wider distribution of firing rates. On the other hand, NREM sleep produces lower inhibition, and results in a more homogenous distribution of firing rates. These findings provide insights into the effects and functions of different sleep stages on cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have allowed for greater investigation into microbial regulation of mercury toxicity in the environment. In wetlands in particular, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence methylmercury (MeHg) production both through chemical interactions and through substrate effects on microbiomes. We conducted microcosm experiments in two disparate wetland environments (oligotrophic unvegetated and high-C vegetated sediments) to examine the impacts of plant leachate and inorganic mercury loadings (20 mg/L HgCl2) on microbiomes, DOM cycling, and MeHg production in the St. Louis River Estuary. Our research reveals the greater relative capacity for mercury methylation in vegetated over unvegetated sediments. Further, our work shows how mercury cycling in oligotrophic unvegetated sediments may be susceptible to DOM inputs in the St. Louis River Estuary: microcosms receiving leachate produced substantially more MeHg than unamended microcosms. We also demonstrate (1) changes in microbiome structure towards Clostridia, (2) metagenomic shifts toward fermentation, and (3) degradation of complex DOM; all of which coincide with elevated net MeHg production in unvegetated microcosms receiving leachate. Finally, we examine microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as known potential methylators and identify important organisms for future research in the Great Lakes region. Together, our work shows the influence of wetland vegetation in controlling MeHg production in the Great Lakes region and provides evidence that this may be due to both enhanced microbial activity as well as differences in microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Aim: Although there is a vast body of literature on the causes of variation in species composition in ecological communities, less effort has been invested in understanding how interactions between these species vary. Since interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we investigate whether species interactions vary more in response to different climate variables, than individual species do. Location: Eurasia. Time period: 2000s. Major taxa: Animalia. Methods: We used a measure of Local Contribution to Beta-Diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host-parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition, and based on potential and realized biotic interactions (here, host-parasite interactions). Results: We show that species interactions vary more, across space, than species do. In particular, we show that species interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distributions or dissimilarity. Main conclusions: Species interactions capture some degree of variation which is not apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in different ways as a reponse to different environments, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss the implications of this finding for the amount of information that should be considered when measuring community dissimilarity.",

However, most of the studies focused on the correlation analysis to define the functional connectivity for BOLD fluctuations between brain regions, which resulted in the limited understanding to the network properties of altered wirings in the schizophrenic brain. Here I characterized the distinctiveness of BOLD connectivity pattern in the schizophrenic brain relative to healthy brain with various similarity measures in the time-frequency domain, while participants are performing the working memory task in the MRI scanner. To assess the distinctiveness of the connectivity pattern, discrimination performances of the pattern classifier machines trained by each similarity measurement were compared. As a result, the classifier machine trained by cross-spectral coherence pattern in low frequency fluctuation (LFF, 0.01-0.08 Hz band) made better performance than the machine trained by correlation-based connectivity pattern. Interestingly, the classifier machine trained by time-lagging patterns in cross-correlation function of LFF produced higher classifying sensitivity than the machines trained by other measures. These results indicate that there are unobserved but considerable features in the functional connectivity pattern of schizophrenic brain which traditional emphasis on correlation analysis does not capture.",

To study how biomarker research has progressed over the years, we performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate (a) the most studied peripheral molecular markers in major psychiatric disorders, (b) the main features of studies in which they are proposed as biomarkers and (c) whether their patterns of variation are similar across disorders. Out of the six molecules most commonly present as keywords in articles studying plasmatic markers of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, five (BDNF, TNF-alpha, IL-6, C-reactive protein and cortisol) were the same across the three diagnoses. An analysis of the literature on these molecules showed that, while 65% of studies were cross-sectional and 66% compared biomarker levels between patients and controls in specific disorders, only 10% presented an objective measure of diagnostic or prognostic efficacy. Meta-analyses showed that variation in the levels of these molecules was robust across studies, but also similar among disorders, suggesting them to reflect transdiagnostic systemic consequences of psychiatric illness rather than diagnostic markers. Based on this, we discuss how current publication practices have led to research fragmentation across diagnoses, and what steps can be taken in order to increase clinical translation in the field.",

    "abstract": "We use an oligonucleotide library of over 10000 variants together with a synthetic biology approach to identify an insulation mechanism encoded within a subset of {sigma}54 promoters. Insulation manifests itself as dramatically reduced protein expression for a downstream gene that may be expressed by transcriptional read-through. The insulation we observe is strongly associated with the presence of short CT-rich motifs (3-5 bp), positioned within 25 bp upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif of the silenced gene. We hypothesize that insulation is effected by binding of the RBS to the upstream CT-rich motif. We provide evidence to support this hypothesis using mutations to the CT-rich motif and gene expression measurements on multiple sequence variants. Modelling is also consistent with this hypothesis. We show that the strength of the silencing, effected by insulation, depends on the location and number of CT-rich motifs encoded within the promoters. Finally, we show that in E.coli these insulator sequences are preferentially encoded within {sigma}54 promoters as compared to other promoter types, suggesting a regulatory role for these sequences in natural contexts. Our findings suggest that context-related regulatory effects may often be due to sequence-specific interactions encoded sparsely by short motifs that are not easily detected by lower throughput studies. Such short sequence-specific phenomena can be uncovered with a focused OL design that filters out the sequence noise, as exemplified herein.",

    "abstract": "Semi-automated genome annotation methods such as Segway enable understanding of chromatin activity. Here we present chromatin state annotations of 164 human cell types using 1,615 genomics data sets. To produce these annotations, we developed a fully-automated annotation strategy in which we train separate unsupervised annotation models on each cell type and use a machine learning classifier to automate the state interpretation step. Using these annotations, we developed a measure of the importance of each genomic position called the \\\"conservation-associated activity score,\\\" which we use to aggregate information across cell types into a multi-cell type view. The aggregated conservation-associated activity score provides a measure of importance directly attributable to a specific activity in a specific set of cell types. In contrast to evolutionary conservation, this measure is not biased to detect only elements shared with related species. Using the conservation-associated activity score, we combined all our annotations into a single, cell type-agnostic encyclopedia that catalogs all human transcriptional and regulatory elements, enabling easy and intuitive interpretation of the effect of genome variants on phenotype, such as in disease-associated, evolutionarily conserved or positively selected loci. These resources, including cell type-specific annotations, encyclopedia, and a visualization server, are available at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/encyclopedia.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenome annotation algorithms are an effective class of tools for understanding the function of the genome. These algorithms take as input a set of genome-wide measurements about the activity at each base pair in a given tissue, such as where a given protein is binding or how accessible the DNA is to being read by a protein. The genome is then partitioned and each segment is assigned a label such that positions with the same label exhibit similar patterns in the input data. Such annotations are widely used for many applications, such as to understand the mechanism of impact of a given genetic variant. Here we present, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive set of genome annotations created so far, encompassing 164 human cell types and including 1,615 genomics data sets. These comprehensive annotations are made possible by a strategy that automates the previous interpretation step. Furthermore, we present several methodological innovations that make these genome annotations more useful.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to accurately infer transmission patterns of infectious diseases is critical to monitor both their spread and the efficacy of public health policies. The use of phylogenetic methods for the reconstruction of viral ancestral relationships has garnered increasing interest, particularly in the characterization of HIV epidemics and sub-epidemics. In the case of this virus, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) contains a wide breadth of genomic data that have been widely used as a means of applying such methods. However, current approaches for quantifying the epidemiological dynamics of diseases are computationally intensive, and fail to scale well with this magnitude of data. To address this issue, we re-implement an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). By means of simulations, we demonstrate that our implementation is capable of inferring key epidemiological parameters of the Swiss HIV epidemic accurately, and that sampling intensity has no significant effect on the accuracy of our estimates. Applied to a subset of HIV sequences from the SHCS, we show that we can distinguish sub-epidemics that are circulating in culturally distinct Swiss regions. Given these findings, we propose that ABC-SMC samplers will allow us to evaluate the impact of new public health policies, such as the implementation of a needle exchange program in the case of HIV, based on genetic data sampled before and after the implementation of a new policy.",

    "abstract": "While influenza virus diversity and antigenic drift have been well characterized on a global scale, the factors that influence the virus rapid evolution within and between human hosts are less clear. Given the modest effectiveness of seasonal vaccination, vaccine-induced antibody responses could serve as a potent selective pressure for novel influenza variants at the individual or community level. We used next generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and to define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. Importantly, this study design allowed us to isolate the impact of vaccination while still studying natural infection. We used pre-season hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition titers to quantify vaccine-induced immunity directly and to assess its impact on intrahost populations. We identified 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over 3 seasons and 5119 person-years. We obtained whole genome sequence data for 119 samples and used a stringent and empirically validated analysis pipeline to identify intrahost single nucleotide variants at [&ge;]1% frequency. Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season HAI and NAI titer, respectively. In our study population, we found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Contrary to what has been suggested in experimental systems, our data indicate that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales.",

This is the first structure of a type IVB secretion system, and also the first structure of any T4SS in situ. While the Dot/Icm system shares almost no sequence homology with type IVA secretion systems (T4ASSs), its overall structure shows remarkable similarities to two previously imaged T4ASSs, suggesting shared aspects of mechanism. However, compared to one of these, the negative-stain reconstruction of the purified T4ASS from the R388 plasmid, it is approximately twice as long and wide and exhibits several additional large densities, reflecting type-specific elaborations and potentially better structural preservation in situ.",

    "abstract": "A number of open questions in human evolutionary genetics would become tractable if we were able to directly measure evolutionary fitness. As a step towards this goal, we developed a method to examine whether individual genetic variants, or sets of genetic variants, currently influence viability. The approach consists in testing whether the frequency of an allele varies across ages, accounting for variation in ancestry. We applied it to the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort and to the parents of participants in the UK Biobank. Across the genome, we find only a few common variants with large effects on age-specific mortality: tagging the APOE {varepsilon}4 allele and near CHRNA3. These results suggest that when large, even late onset effects are kept at low frequency by purifying selection. Testing viability effects of sets of genetic variants that jointly influence one of 42 traits, we detect a number of strong signals. In participants of the UK Biobank study of British ancestry, we find that variants that delay puberty timing are enriched in longer-lived parents (P~6x10-6 for fathers and P~2x10-3 for mothers), consistent with epidemiological studies. Similarly, in mothers, variants associated with later age at first birth are associated with a longer lifespan (P~1x10-3). Signals are also observed for variants influencing cholesterol levels, risk of coronary artery disease, body mass index, as well as risk of asthma. These signals exhibit consistent effects in the GERA cohort and among participants of the UK Biobank of non-British ancestry. Moreover, we see marked differences between males and females, most notably at the CHRNA3 locus, and variants associated with risk of coronary artery disease and cholesterol levels. Beyond our findings, the analysis serves as a proof of principle for how upcoming biomedical datasets can be used to learn about selection effects in contemporary humans.",

    "abstract": "Recurring epidemics of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) bleeding canker disease are caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), whose emergence coincided with domestication of its host. The most recent pandemic has had a deleterious effect on kiwifruit production worldwide. In order to strengthen understanding of population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary dynamics of Psa, we sampled 746 Pseudomonas isolates from cultivated and wild kiwifruit across six provinces in China, of which 87 were Psa. Of 234 Pseudomonas isolated from wild Actinidia spp. none were identified as Psa. Genome sequencing of fifty isolates and the inclusion of an additional thirty from previous studies show that China is the origin of the recently emerged pandemic lineage. However China harbours only a fraction of global Psa diversity, with greatest diversity found in Korea and Japan. Distinct transmission events were responsible for introduction of the pandemic lineage of Psa into New Zealand, Chile and Europe. Two independent transmission events occurred between China and Korea, and two Japanese isolates from 2014 cluster with New Zealand Psa. Despite high similarity at the level of the core genome and negligible impact of within-lineage recombination, there has been substantial gene gain and loss even within the single clade from which the global pandemic arose.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBleeding canker disease of kiwifruit caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) has come to prominence in the last three decades. Emergence has coincided with domestication of the host plant and provides a rare opportunity to understand ecological and genetic factors affecting the evolutionary origins of Psa. Here, based on genomic analysis of an extensive set of strains sampled from China and augmented by isolates from a global sample, we show, contrary to earlier predictions, that China is not the native home of the pathogen, but is nonetheless the source of the recent global pandemic. Our data identify specific transmission events, substantial genetic diversity and point to non-agricultural plants in either Japan or Korea as home to the source population.",

    "abstract": "Brain dynamics are thought to unfold on a network determined by the pattern of axonal connections linking pairs of neuronal populations; the so-called connectome. Prior work has indicated that structural brain connectivity constrains pairwise correlations in brain dynamics (also called functional connectivity), but it is not known whether inter-regional axonal connectivity is related to the intrinsic dynamics of individual brain areas. Here we investigate this relationship using a weighted, directed mesoscale mouse connectome from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data measured in 184 brain regions in eighteen anesthetized mice. For each brain region, we measured degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient from weighted and unweighted, and directed and undirected versions of the connectome. We then characterized the univariate rs-fMRI dynamics at each brain region by computing 6 930 time-series properties using the time-series analysis toolbox, hctsa. After correcting for regional volume variations, strong and robust correlations between structural connectivity properties and rs-fMRI dynamics were found only when edge weights were accounted for, and were associated with variations in the autocorrelation properties of the rs-fMRI signal. The strongest relationships were found for weighted in-degree, which was positively correlated to the autocorrelation of fMRI time series at time lag{tau} = 34s (partial Spearman correlation{rho} = 0.58), as well as a range of related measures such as relative high frequency power (f > 0.4 Hz:{rho} = -0.43). Our results indicate that the topology of inter-regional axonal connections of the mouse brain is closely related to intrinsic, spontaneous dynamics such that regions with a greater aggregate strength of incoming projections display longer timescales of activity fluctuations.",

To demonstrate the role of PRDX6 in neurogenesis, we compared neurogenesis ability and studied the molecular mechanisms.

Moreover, the expression of wdfy1 was dramatically decreased in PRDX6-Tg mice, also, we observed that wdfy1 siRNA decreases the differentiation ability of primary neural stem cells to astrocyte and neuronal cells as well as PC12 cells. However, knockdown of PRDX6 recovered neurogenesis in the brain of PRDX6-Tg mice as well as PC-12 cells. We also showed that TLR4 was dramatically reduced in PRDX6 Tg mice as well as PC-12 cells and PRDX6 overexpression reduced neurogenesis was rescued after treatment of TLR4 siRNA. We further found that reduced TLR4 expression and neurogenesis was reversed in the neuron from PRDX6-Tg mice as well as PC12 cells by introduction of wdfy1 plasmid. Moreover, TLR4 siRNA reduced neurogenesis and wdfy1 expression. This study indicated that PRDX6 inhibits neurogenesis of neural precursor cells through TLR4 dependent downregulation of wdfy1.",

Here we used a combination of computational modeling and large-scale analysis of in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging data from somatosensory cortex of wild-type and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice, a model of Fragile X syndrome, to test the E/I imbalance model. Our main findings were: 1) the E/I imbalance model was not rich enough to capture the alterations in neural activity statistics in Fmr1 KO mice; 2) in a computational model we found greatly varying magnitudes and directions of effects of synaptic and cellular properties on network activity; 3) evidence for opposite changes in circuit properties of Fmr1 KO mice at different stages of development; 4) a reduction in the entropy of circuit activity in young Fmr1 KO mice compared to wild-type, but an opposite increase in adult Fmr1 KO mice.

We investigated the role of Agrp neurons in substrate utilization in mice. Activation of Agrp neurons was sufficient to rapidly increase RER and carbohydrate utilization, while decreasing fat utilization. These metabolic changes were linearly correlated with carbohydrates ingested, but not protein or fat ingestion. However, even in the absence of ingestive behaviors, activation of Agrp neurons led to changes in substrate utilization in well-fed mice. These effects were coupled to metabolic shifts towards lipogenesis. Inhibition of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) blunted the effects of Agrp neurons on substrate utilization. Finally, Agrp neurons controlled peripheral metabolism, but not food intake, via {beta}3-adrenergic receptor signaling in fat tissues. These results reveal a novel component of Agrp neuron-mediate metabolism regulation that involves sympathetic activity on fat compartments to shift metabolism towards lipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Automated geometric morphometric methods are promising tools for shape analysis in comparative biology: they improve researchers abilities to quantify biological variation extensively (by permitting more specimens to be analyzed) and intensively (by characterizing shapes with greater fidelity). Although use of these methods has increased, automated methods have some notable limitations: pairwise correspondences are frequently inaccurate or lack transitivity (i.e., they are not defined with reference to the full sample). In this study, we reassess the accuracy of two previously published automated methods, cPDist [1] and auto3Dgm [2], and evaluate several modifications to these methods. We show that a substantial fraction of alignments and pairwise maps between specimens of highly dissimilar geometries were inaccurate in the study of Boyer et al. [1], despite a taxonomically sensitive variance structure of continuous Procrustes distances. We also show these inaccuracies can be remedied by utilizing a globally informed methodology within a collection of shapes, instead of only comparing shapes in a pairwise manner (c.f. [2]). Unfortunately, while global information generally enhances maps between dissimilar objects, it can degrade the quality of correspondences between similar objects due to the accumulation of numerical error. We explore a number of approaches to mitigate this degradation, quantify the performance of these approaches, and compare the generated pairwise maps (as well as the shape space characterized by these maps) to a \\\"ground truth\\\" obtained from landmarks manually collected by geometric morphometricians. Novel methods both improve the quality of the pairwise correspondences relative to cPDist, and achieve a taxonomic distinctiveness comparable to auto3Dgm.",

    "abstract": "Under normal cellular conditions, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is kept at a low levels in part due to ubiquitination by MDM2, a process initiated by binding of MDM2 to the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of p53. Although many experimental and simulation studies suggest that disordered domains such as p53 TAD bind their targets nonspecifically before folding to a tightly-associated conformation, the molecular details are unclear. Toward a detailed prediction of binding mechanism, pathways and rates, we have performed large-scale unbiased all-atom simulations of p53-MDM2 binding. Markov State Models (MSMs) constructed from the trajectory data predict p53 TAD peptide binding pathways and on-rates in good agreement with experiment. The MSM reveals that two key bound intermediates, each with a non-native arrangement of hydrophobic residues in the MDM2 binding cleft, control the overall on-rate. Using microscopic rate information from the MSM, we parameterize a simple four-state kinetic model to (1) determine that induced-fit pathways dominate the binding flux over a large range of concentrations, and (2) predict how modulation of residual p53 helicity affects binding, in good agreement with experiment. These results suggest new ways in which microscopic models of bound-state ensembles can be used to understand biological function on a macroscopic scale.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMany cell signaling pathways involve protein-protein interactions in which an intrinsically disordered peptide folds upon binding its target. Determining the molecular mechanisms that control these binding rates is important for understanding how such systems are regulated. In this paper, we show how extensive all-atom simulations combined with kinetic network models provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of how tumor suppressor protein p53 binds to MDM2, an important target of new cancer therapeutics. A simple four-state model parameterized from the simulations shows a binding-then-folding mechanism, and recapitulates experiments in which residual helicity boosts binding. This work goes beyond previous simulations of small-molecule binding, to achieve pathways and binding rates for a large peptide, in good agreement with experiment.",

    "abstract": "The variable responses of sensory neurons tend to be weakly correlated (spike-count correlation, rsc). This is widely thought to reflect noise in shared afferents, in which case rsc can limit the reliability of sensory coding. However, it could also be due to feedback from higher-order brain regions. Currently, the relative contribution of these sources is unknown. We addressed this by recording from populations of V1 neurons in macaques performing different discrimination tasks involving the same visual input. We found that the structure of rsc(the way rsc varied with neuronal stimulus preference) changed systematically with task instruction. Therefore, even at the earliest stage in the cortical visual hierarchy, rsc structure during task performance primarily reflects feedback dynamics. Consequently, previous proposals for how rsc constrains sensory processing need not apply. Furthermore, we show that correlations between the activity of single neurons and choice depend on feedback engaged by the task.",

    "abstract": "Although many viral particles can enter a single cell, the number of viral genomes per cell that establish infection is limited. However, mechanisms underlying this restriction were not explored in depth. For herpesviruses, one of the possible mechanisms suggested is chromatinization and silencing of the incoming genomes. To test this hypothesis, we followed infection with three herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) fluorescence-expressing recombinants in the presence or absence of histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACis). Unexpectedly, a lower number of viral genomes initiated expression in the presence of these inhibitors. This phenomenon was observed using several HDACi: Trichostatin A (TSA), Suberohydroxamic Acid (SBX), Valporic Acid (VPA) and Suberoylanilide Hydoxamic Acid (SAHA). We found that HDACi presence did not change the progeny outcome from the infected cells but did alter the kinetic of the infection. Different cell types (HFF, Vero and U2OS), which vary in their capability to activate intrinsic and innate immunity, show a cell specific basal average number of viral genomes establishing infection. Importantly, in all cell types, treatment with TSA reduced the number of viral genomes. ND10 nuclear bodies are known to interact with the incoming herpes genomes and repress viral replication. The viral immediate early protein, ICP0, is known to disassemble the ND10 bodies and to induce degradation of some of the host proteins in these domains. HDACi treated cells expressed higher levels of some of the host ND10 proteins (PML and ATRX), which may down regulate the number of viral genomes initiating expression per cell. Corroborating this hypothesis, infection with three HSV-1 recombinants carrying a deletion in the gene coding for ICP0, show a reduction in the number of genomes being expressed in U2OS cells. We suggest that alterations in the levels of host proteins involved in intrinsic antiviral defense may result in differences in the number of genomes that initiate expression.",

Consequently, synonymous codon usage is biased in most species, even when base composition is relatively homogeneous. The causes of these variations are still under debate, with three main forces being possibly involved: mutational bias, selection and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). So far, both selection and gBGC have been detected in some species but how their relative strength varies among and within species remains unclear. Population genetics approaches allow to jointly estimating the intensity of selection, gBGC and mutational bias. We extended a recently developed method and applied it to a large population genomic datasets based on transcriptome sequencing of 11 angiosperm species spread across the phylogeny. We found that base composition is far from mutation-drift equilibrium in most genomes and that gBGC is a widespread and stronger process than selection. gBGC could strongly contribute to base composition variation among plant species, implying that it should be taken into account in plant genome analyses, especially for GC-rich ones.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic associations with bacteria have facilitated important evolutionary transitions in insects and resulted in long-term obligate interactions. Recent evidence suggests that these associations are not always evolutionarily stable and that symbiont replacement and/or supplementation of an obligate symbiosis by an additional bacterium has occurred during the history of many insect groups. Yet, the factors favoring one symbiont over another in this evolutionary dynamic are not well understood; progress has been hindered by our incomplete understanding of the distribution of symbionts across phylogenetic and ecological contexts. While many aphids are engaged into an obligate symbiosis with a single Gammaproteobacterium, Buchnera aphidicola, in species of the Lachninae subfamily, this relationship has evolved into a \\\"menage a trois\\\", in which Buchnera is complemented by a cosymbiont, usually Serratia symbiotica. Using deep sequencing of 16S rRNA bacterial genes from 128 species of Cinara (the most diverse Lachninae genus), we reveal a highly dynamic dual symbiotic system in this aphid lineage. Most species host both Serratia and Buchnera but, in several clades, endosymbionts related to Sodalis, Erwinia or an unnamed member of the Enterobacteriaceae have replaced Serratia. Endosymbiont genome sequences from four aphid species+confirm that these coresident symbionts fulfill essential metabolic functions not ensured by Buchnera. We further demonstrate through comparative phylogenetic analyses that co-symbiont replacement is not associated with the adaptation of aphids to new ecological conditions. We propose that symbiont succession was driven by factors intrinsic to the phenomenon of endosymbiosis, such as rapid genome deterioration or competitive interactions between bacteria with similar metabolic capabilities.",

Individuals from ten mutation accumulation lines over five generations were deep genome sequenced to count de novo mutations (DNMs) that were not present in a pool of F1 individuals, representing parental genotypes. We identified 51 new single site mutations of which 25 were insertions or deletions and 26 single point mutations. This shift in the mutational spectrum compared to other organisms was explained by the high A/T content of the species. We estimated a haploid mutation rate of 2.1 x 10-9 (95% confidence interval: 1.4 x 10-9 - 3.1 x 10-9) which is in the range of recent estimates for other insects and supports the drift barrier hypothesis.

Metabolic exchanges and co-dependencies have long been suggested to have a pivotal role in determining community structure. Metabolic interactions with bacteria have been key drivers in the evolution of sap-feeding insects, enabling complementation of their deprived nutrition. The sap-feeding whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) harbors an obligatory symbiotic bacterium, as well as varying combinations of facultative symbionts. We took advantage of the well-defined bacterial community in B. tabaci as a case study for a comprehensive and systematic survey of metabolic interactions within the bacterial community and their associations with documented frequency of bacterial combinations. We first reconstructed the metabolic networks of five common B. tabaci symbionts (Portiera, Rickettsia, Hamiltonella, Cardinium and Wolbachia), and then used network analysis approaches to predict: (1) species-specific metabolic capacities in a simulated bacteriocyte-like environment; (2) metabolic capacities of the corresponding species combinations, and (3) dependencies of each species on different media components.\\n\\nThe automatic-based predictions for metabolic capacities of the symbionts in the host environment were in general agreement with previously reported genome analyses, each focused on the single-species level. The analysis suggested several previously un-reported routes for complementary interactions. Highly abundant symbiont combinations were found to have the potential to produce a diverse set of complementary metabolites, in comparison to un-detected combinations. No clear association was detected between metabolic codependencies and co-occurrence patterns. The findings indicate a potential key role for metabolic exchanges as key determinants shaping community structure in this system.",

    "abstract": "Object surfaces contain a variety of visual features that help us to recognize them. To understand how this information is represented and processed in the brain, we prepared a set of images from natural object surfaces that maintained surface features but lacked contours. We examined spiking responses of neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys, which is a crucial structure needed for visual object recognition. About half of IT neurons responded to surface images with sharp selectivity, indicating that a significant fraction of these neurons contribute to object surface representation in a sparse manner. Responses of IT neurons were susceptible to image manipulations, including color removal, removal of luminance contrasts, and spatial structure degradation. This shows that multiple features are required for IT responses to surface images. Comparing neuronal response properties among IT, visual area 4 (V4), and primary visual cortex (V1) revealed properties of IT neurons that differed from those in the other visual processing regions. Additionally, some neuronal response properties were similar between IT and V4, but differed from those in V1, indicating that responses of IT neurons to surface images are constructed by hierarchical processing throughout the ventral visual pathway.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeleterious alleles have long been proposed to play an important role in patterning phenotypic variation and are central to commonly held ideas explaining the hybrid vigor observed in the offspring by crossing two inbred parents. We test these ideas using evolutionary measures of sequence conservation to ask whether incorporating information about putatively deleterious alleles can inform genomic selection (GS) models and improve phenotypic prediction. We measured a number of agronomic traits in both the inbred parents and hybrids of an elite maize partial diallel population and re-sequenced the parents of the population. Inbred elite maize lines vary for more than 350,000 putatively deleterious sites, but show a lower burden of such sites than a comparable set of traditional landraces. Our modeling reveals widespread evidence for incomplete dominance at these loci, and supports theoretical models that more damaging variants are usually more recessive. We identify haplotype blocks using an identity-by-decent (IBD) analysis and perform genomic prediction analyses in which we weigh blocks on the basis of segregating putatively deleterious variants. Cross-validation results show that incorporating sequence conservation in genomic selection improves prediction accuracy for grain yield and other fitness-related traits as well as heterosis for those traits. Our results provide empirical support for an important role for incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in explaining heterosis and demonstrate the utility of incorporating functional annotation in phenotypic prediction and plant breeding.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA key long-term goal of biology is understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. Although most new mutations are likely disadvantageous, their prevalence and importance in explaining patterns of phenotypic variation is controversial and not well understood. In this study we combine whole genome-sequencing and field evaluation of a maize mapping population to investigate the contribution of deleterious mutations to phenotype. We show that a priori prediction of deleterious alleles correlates well with effect sizes for grain yield and that variants predicted to be more damaging are on average more recessive. We develop a simple model allowing for variation in the heterozygous effects of deleterious mutations and demonstrate its improved ability to predict both phenotypes and hybrid vigor. Our results help reconcile alternative explanations for hybrid vigor and highlight the use of leveraging evolutionary history to facilitate breeding for crop improvement.",

Using whole-genome projected SNPs, we tested for joint association using GWAS, resampling GWAS and two regional approaches; Regional Heritability Mapping (RHM) (1, 2) and a novel method, Boosted Regional Heritability Mapping (BRHM). Direct overlap in significant regions detected between populations and flowering candidate genes was limited, but whole-genome cross-population predictive abilities were [&le;]0.78. Poor predictive ability correlated with increased population differentiation (r = 0.41), unless the parents were broadly sampled from across the North American temperate-tropical germplasm gradient; uncorrected GWAS results from populations with broadly sampled parents were well predicted by temperate-tropical FSTs in machine learning. Machine learning between GWAS results also suggested shared architecture between the American panels and, more distantly, the European panels, but not the Chinese panel. Machine learning approaches can reconcile non-linear relationships, but the combined predictive ability of all of the populations did not significantly enhance prediction of physiological candidates. While the North American-European temperate adaption is well studied, this study suggest independent temperate adaptation evolved in the Chinese panel, most likely in China after 1500, a finding supported by differential gene ontology term enrichment between populations.",

We demonstrate that a model circuit comprising topographically organized and strongly recurrent neural networks can autonomously generate irregular motor behaviors. Simultaneous recordings of neurons in singing finches reveal that neural correlations increase across the circuit driving song variability, in agreement with the model predictions.

Nevertheless, this assumption does not fully explain complex brain functions. Here we show how nervous activity, other than logic circuits, could instead depend on topological transformations and symmetry constraints occurring at the micro-level of the cortical microcolumn, i.e., the embryological, anatomical and functional basic unit of the brain. Tubular microcolumns can be flattened in guise of a fullerene-like two-dimensional lattices, equipped with about 80 nodes, standing for pyramidal neurons, where neural computations take place. We show how the countless possible combinations of activated neurons embedded in the lattice resemble a barcode. Different assemblies of firing neurons might stand for diverse codes, each one responsible for a single mental activity. A two-dimensional fullerene-like lattice not just simulates the real microcolumns microcircuitry, but also allows us to build artificial networks equipped with robustness, plasticity and fastness, because they are grounded on simple topological changes corresponding to pyramidal neurons activation.",

Here, we perform a genome-wide comparison of all eight Oryza AA- genome species, and identify 3,911 intact LTR retrotransposons classified into 790 families. The top 44 most abundant LTR retrotransposon families show patterns of rapid and distinct diversification since the species split over the last ~4.8 Myr. Phylogenetic and read depth analyses of 11 representative retrotransposon families further provide a comprehensive evolutionary landscape of these changes. Compared with Ty1-copia, independent bursts of Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon expansions have occurred with the three largest showing signatures of lineage-specific evolution. The estimated insertion times of 2,213 complete retrotransposons from the top 23 most abundant families reveal divergent life-histories marked by speedy accumulation, decline and extinction that differed radically between species.

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying compound-protein interactions in silico can deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action and significantly facilitate the drug discovery and development process. Traditional similarity-based computational models for compound-protein interaction prediction rarely exploit the latent features from current available large-scale unlabelled compound and protein data, and often limit their usage on relatively small-scale datasets. We propose a new scheme that combines feature embedding (a technique of representation learning) with deep learning for predicting compound-protein interactions. Our method automatically learns the low-dimensional implicit but expressive features for compounds and proteins from the massive amount of unlabelled data. Combining effective feature embedding with powerful deep learning techniques, our method provides a general computational pipeline for accurate compound-protein interaction prediction, even when the interaction knowledge of compounds and proteins is entirely unknown. Evaluations on current large-scale databases of the measured compound-protein affinities, such as ChEMBL and BindingDB, as well as known drug-target interactions from DrugBank have demonstrated the superior prediction performance of our method, and suggested that it can offer a useful tool for drug development and drug repositioning.",

    "abstract": "Whole exome sequencing (WES) is widely utilized both in translational cancer genomics studies and in the setting of precision medicine. Stratification of individual's ethnicity is fundamental for the correct interpretation of personal genomic variation impact. We implemented EthSEQ to provide reliable and rapid ethnicity annotation from whole exome sequencing individual's data and validated it on 1,000 Genome Project and TCGA data demonstrating high precision (>99%). EthSEQ can be integrated into any WES based processing pipeline and exploits multi-core capabilities. Source code, manual and other data is available at http://demichelislab.unitn.it/EthSEQ.",

    "abstract": "The disparity between the chronological age of an individual and their brain-age measured based on biological information has the potential to offer clinically-relevant biomarkers of neurological syndromes that emerge late in the lifespan. While prior brain-age prediction studies have relied exclusively on either structural or functional brain data, here we investigate how multimodal brainimaging data improves age prediction. Using cortical anatomy and whole-brain functional connectivity on a large adult lifespan sample (N = 2354, age 19-82), we found that multimodal data improves brain-based age prediction, resulting in a mean absolute prediction error of 4.29 years. Furthermore, we found that the discrepancy between predicted age and chronological age captures cognitive impairment. Importantly, the brain-age measure was robust to confounding effects: head motion did not drive brain-based age prediction and our models generalized reasonably to an independent dataset acquired at a different site (N = 475). Generalization performance was increased by training models on a larger and more heterogeneous dataset. The robustness of multimodal brain-age prediction to confounds, generalizability across sites, and sensitivity to clinically-relevant impairments, suggests promising future application to the early prediction of neurocognitive disorders.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIBrain-based age prediction is improved with multimodal neuroimaging data.\\nC_LIO_LIParticipants with cognitive impairment show increased brain aging.\\nC_LIO_LIAge prediction models are robust to motion and generalize to independent datasets from other sites.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Fiber tractography based on non-invasive diffusion imaging is at the heart of connectivity studies of the human brain. To date, the approach has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies. Based on a simulated human brain dataset with ground truth white matter tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. While most state-of-the-art algorithms reconstructed 90% of ground truth bundles to at least some extent, on average they produced four times more invalid than valid bundles. About half of the invalid bundles occurred systematically in the majority of submissions. Our results demonstrate fundamental ambiguities inherent to tract reconstruction methods based on diffusion orientation information, with critical consequences for the approach of diffusion tractography in particular and human connectivity studies in general.",
