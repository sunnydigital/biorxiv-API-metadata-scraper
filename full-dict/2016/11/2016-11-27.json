    "abstract": "Genetic susceptibility to Intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) often arises from mutations in the same genes, suggesting that they share common mechanisms. We studied genes with de novo mutations in the three disorders and genes implicated by SCZ genome-wide association study (GWAS). Using biological annotations and brain gene expression, we show that mutation class explains enrichment patterns more than specific disorder. Genes with loss of function mutations and genes with missense mutations were enriched with different pathways, shared with genes intolerant to mutations. Specific gene expression patterns were found for each disorder. ID genes were preferentially expressed in fetal cortex, ASD genes also in fetal cerebellum and striatum, and genes associated with SCZ were most significantly enriched in adolescent cortex. Our study suggests that convergence across neuropsychiatric disorders stems from vulnerable pathways to genetic variations, but spatiotemporal activity of genes contributes to specific phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Recent successes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) make it possible to address important questions about the genetic architecture of complex traits, such as allele frequency and effect size. One lesser-known aspect of complex traits is the extent of allelic heterogeneity (AH) arising from multiple causal variants at a locus. We developed a computational method to infer the probability of AH and applied it to three GWAS and four expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets. We identified a total of 4152 loci with strong evidence of AH. The proportion of all loci with identified AH is 4-23% in eQTLs, 35% in GWAS of High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and 23% in schizophrenia. For eQTLs, we observed a strong correlation between sample size and the proportion of loci with AH (R2=0.85, P = 2.2e-16), indicating that statistical power prevents identification of AH in other loci. Understanding the extent of AH may guide the development of new methods for fine mapping and association mapping of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdentification of genes whose basal mRNA expression predicts the sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic treatments can play an important role in individualized cancer medicine. It enables detailed characterization of the mechanism of action of drugs. Furthermore, screening the expression of these genes in the tumor tissue may suggest the best course of chemotherapy or a combination of drugs to overcome drug resistance.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a computational method called ProGENI to identify genes most associated with the variation of drug response across different individuals, based on gene expression data. In contrast to existing methods, ProGENI also utilizes prior knowledge of protein-protein and genetic interactions, using random walk techniques. Analysis of two relatively new and large datasets including gene expression data on hundreds of cell lines and their cytotoxic responses to a large compendium of drugs reveals a significant improvement in prediction of drug sensitivity using genes identified by ProGENI compared to other methods. Our siRNA knockdown experiments on ProGENI-identified genes confirmed the role of many new genes in sensitivity to three chemotherapy drugs: cisplatin, docetaxel and doxorubicin. Based on such experiments and extensive literature survey, we demonstrate that about 73% our top predicted genes modulate drug response in selected cancer cell lines. In addition, global analysis of genes associated with groups of drugs uncovered pathways of cytotoxic response shared by each group.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that knowledge-guided prioritization of genes using ProGENI gives new insight into mechanisms of drug resistance and identifies genes that may be targeted to overcome this phenomenon.",

These methods convert chromatin interactions reflecting topological chromatin structures into digital information (counts of pair-wise interactions). Here, we describe an updated protocol for Hi-C (Hi-C 2.0) that integrates recent improvements into a single protocol for efficient and high-resolution capture of chromatin interactions. This protocol combines chromatin digestion and frequently cutting enzymes to obtain kilobase (Kb) resolution. It also includes steps to reduce random ligation and the generation of uninformative molecules, such as unligated ends, to improve the amount of valid intra-chromosomal read pairs. This protocol allows for obtaining information on conformational structures such as compartment and TADs, as well as high-resolution conformational features such as DNA loops.",

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that a large fraction of genomic sequence variations within and between species are neutral or nearly so1. Whether the same is true for phenotypic variations is a central question in biology2-7. On the one hand, numerous phenotypic adaptations have been documented2,8,9 and even Kimura, the champion of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, believed in widespread adaptive phenotypic evolution1. On the other hand, phenotypic studies are strongly biased toward traits that are likely to be adaptive9, contrasting genomic studies that are typically unbiased. It is thus desirable to test the neutral hypothesis of phenotypic evolution using traits irrespective of their potential involvement in adaptation. Here we present such a test for 210 morphological traits measured in multiple strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and two related species. Our test is based on the premise that, under neutrality, the rate of phenotypic evolution declines as the trait becomes more important to fitness, analogous to the neutral paradigm that functional genes evolve more slowly than functionless pseudogenes10. Neutrality is rejected in favor of adaptation if important traits evolve faster than less important ones, parallel to the demonstration of molecular adaptation when a functional gene evolves faster than pseudogenes. After controlling for the mutational size, we find faster evolution of more important morphological traits within and between species. By contrast, an analysis of 3466 yeast gene expression traits fails to reject neutrality. Thus, yeast morphological evolution is largely adaptive, but the same may not apply to other classes of phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Social rituals, like male-male aggression in Drosophila, are often stereotyped and the component behavioral patterns modular. The likelihood of transition from one behavioral pattern to another is malleable by experience and confers flexibility to the behavioral repertoire. Experience-dependent modification of innate aggressive behavior in flies alters fighting strategies during fights and establishes dominant-subordinate relationships. Dominance hierarchies resulting from agonistic encounters are consolidated to longer lasting social status-dependent behavioral modifications resulting in a robust loser effect.\\n\\nWe show that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dynamics regulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, Rut and the cAMP phosphodiesterase, Dnc but not the Amn gene product, in specific neuronal groups of the mushroom body and central complex, mediate behavioral plasticity necessary to establish dominant- subordinate relationships. rut and dnc mutant flies are unable to alter fighting strategies and establish dominance relationships during agonistic interactions. This real-time flexibility during a fight is independent of changes in aggression levels. Longer-term consolidation of social status in the form of a loser effect, however, requires additional Amn-dependent inputs to cAMP signaling and involves a circuit-level association between the /{beta} and {gamma} neurons of the mushroom body.\\n\\nOur findings implicate cAMP signaling in mediating plasticity of behavioral patterns in aggressive behavior and in the generation of a temporally stable memory trace that manifests as a loser effect.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTPhasic recruitment of different cAMP signaling modalities in specific neuronal groups lead to the formation of temporally distinct components of learning and memory in fly aggression.",

    "abstract": "There is intense interest surrounding the use of gene editing nucleases in gene drive systems to control agricultural insect pests and insect vectors of infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue and Zika virus. While gene drive systems offer immense promise for the beneficial modification of deleterious insect populations, their unique mechanism of action also raises novel safety concerns and regulatory issues. A recent US National Academies of Science report provides a list of potential regulatory issues associated with implementation of homologous recombination (HR)-mediated gene drive systems, based on the premise that all such systems would exhibit similar biological behaviors. Here we examine how HR-mediated gene drive systems based on different gene editing nuclease platforms could be affected by mutations that occur during host cell transcription, genome replication, and, in conjunction with gene editing nuclease activity, during HR-mediated gene drive. Our analysis suggests that the same feature that makes RNA-guided nucleases such attractive research tools--their ease of reprogramming by alterations to their guide RNA components--might also contribute to increased rates of retargeting that could influence the long term behavior of RNA-guided gene drive systems. Predictability of behavior over time is an issue that should be addressed by in-depth risk assessment before field testing of organisms incorporating nuclease-mediated gene drives.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these measurements is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is greatly complicated by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which can exhibit complex and nonlinear waveforms, and overlap temporarily with evoked spikes. Here we develop a scalable algorithm based on a structured Gaussian Process model to estimate the artifact and identify evoked spikes. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis. This technology may be helpful in the design of future high-resolution sensory prostheses based on tailored stimulation (e.g., retinal prostheses), and for closed-loop neural stimulation at a much larger scale than currently possible.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySimultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these recordings is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is largely stymied by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which are typically larger than the signals of interest. We develop a novel computational framework to estimate and subtract away this contaminating artifact, enabling the large-scale analysis of responses of possibly hundreds of cells to tailored stimulation.

    "abstract": "0Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with other machine learning techniques. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict if a customer would like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. We also explore how the K nearest neighbour approach can be used with both positive and negative information, in which case the goal of the algorithm is to fill missing entries from a matrix (imputation). By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized to ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that TF-DNA binding is mediated in part by properties of the local DNA shape: the width of the minor groove, the relative orientations of adjacent base pairs, etc. Several methods have been developed to jointly account for DNA sequence and shape properties in predicting TF binding affinity. However, a limitation of these methods is that they typically require a training set of aligned TF binding sites.\\n\\nResultsWe describe a sequence+shape kernel that leverages DNA sequence and shape information to better understand protein-DNA binding preference and affinity. This kernel extends an existing class of k-mer based sequence kernels, based on the recently described di-mismatch kernel. Using three in vitro benchmark datasets, derived from universal protein binding microarrays (uPBMs), genomic context PBMs (gcPBMs) and SELEX-seq data, we demonstrate that incorporating DNA shape information improves our ability to predict protein-DNA binding affinity. In particular, we observe that (1) the k-spectrum+shape model performs better than the classical k-spectrum kernel, particularly for small k values; (2) the di-mismatch kernel performs better than the k-mer kernel, for larger k; and (3) the di-mismatch+shape kernel performs better than the di-mismatch kernel for intermediate k values.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software is available at https://bitbucket.org/wenxiu/sequence-shape.git\\n\\nContactrohs@usc.edu, william-noble@uw.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
