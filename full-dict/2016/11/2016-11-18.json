    "abstract": "The process of domestication leads to major morphological and genetic changes, which in combination are known as domestication syndrome that differentiates crops from their wild ancestors. We characterized the genomic and phenotypic diversity of the South American grain amaranth Amaranthus caudatus, which has been cultivated for thousands of years and is one of the three native grain amaranths of South and Central America. Previously, several models of domestication were proposed including a domestication from the close relatives and putative ancestors A. hybridus or A. quitensis. To investigate the evolutionary relationship of A. caudatus and its two close relatives, we genotyped 119 amaranth accessions of the three species from the Andean region using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and compared phenotypic variation in two domestication-related traits, seed size and seed color. The analysis of 9,485 SNPs revealed a strong genetic differentiation of cultivated A. caudatus from the relatives A. hybridus and A. quitensis. The two relatives did not cluster according to the species assigment but formed mixed groups according to their geographic origin in Ecuador and Peru, respectively. A. caudatus had a higher genetic diversity than its close relatives and shared a high proportion of polymorphisms with their wild relatives consistent with the absence of a strong bottleneck or a high level of recent gene flow. Genome sizes and seed sizes were not significantly different between A. caudatus and its relatives, although a genetically distinct group of A. caudatus from Bolivia had significantly larger seeds. We conclude that despite a long history of human cultivation and selection for white grain color, A. caudatus shows a weak genomic and phenotypic domestication syndrome and is an incompletely domesticated species because of weak selection or high levels of gene flow from its sympatric close undomesticated relatives that counteracted the fixation of key domestication traits.",

    "abstract": "Paleochronic reversion (an atavism) in Psophocarpus presents a basic floral phylloid ground state. That ground state can quickly change as permutation transformation (Tx) begins. The form of permutation can vary as phyllotactic phylloid (TPhyld) and/or floral axial decompression (TAxl) presenting linear elongation (TLong), rotational (TRtn) and/or lateral (TLat) components. Research with 70 reverted floral specimens documented varying degrees of phyllotactic permutation at the bracts (Bt) region and inter-bracts (IBS) sub-region of the pre-whorls pedicel-bracts anatomic zone. Permutation further yielded an inter-zonal pericladial stalk (PCL). It continued at the floral whorls zone: the calyx (Cl), corolla (Crla), androecium (Andr), and gynoecium (Gynec) with components therein. These organ regions present a continuum as an axial dynamic vector space {pound}Taxi of floral permutation dominated by axial expansion (AE) so that an anatomic sequence of permutation activity runs from the bracts (Bt) region to the carpel (Crpl) inclusive with components therein, summarized by the formula:\\n\\n [Formula]stamen fltn [Formula] Andr spiral [Formula] Crpl {+/-}(Crpl web {+/-} VASCARP {+/-} Crpl diadn {+/-} Crpl fltn {+/-} [fltn no] {+/-} Crpl Rtn) = Tx.

    "abstract": "RNA viruses are notorious for their ability to evolve rapidly under selection in novel environments. It is known that the high mutation rate of RNA viruses can generate huge genetic diversity to facilitate viral adaptation. However, less attention has been paid to the underlying fitness landscape that represents the selection forces on viral genomes. Here we systematically quantified the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of about 1,600 single amino acid substitutions in the drug-targeted region of NS5A protein of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). We found that the majority of non-synonymous substitutions incur large fitness costs, suggesting that NS5A protein is highly optimized in natural conditions. We characterized the adaptive potential of HCV by subjecting the mutant viruses to selection by the antiviral drug Daclatasvir. Both the selection coefficient and the number of beneficial mutations are found to increase with the level of environmental stress, which is modulated by the concentration of Daclatasvir. The changes in the spectrum of beneficial mutations in NS5A protein can be explained by a pharmacodynamics model describing viral fitness as a function of drug concentration. We test theoretical predictions regarding the distribution of beneficial fitness effects of mutations. We also interpret the data in the context of Fishers Geometric Model and find an increased distance to optimum as a function of environmental stress. Finally, we show that replication fitness of viruses is correlated with the pattern of sequence conservation in nature and viral evolution is constrained by the need to maintain protein stability.",

    "abstract": "The ability to replace genes coding for cellular proteins with DNA that codes for fluorescent protein-tagged versions opens the way to counting the number of molecules of each protein component of macromolecular assemblies in vivo by measuring fluorescence microscopically. Converting fluorescence to absolute numbers of molecules requires a fluorescent standard whose molecular composition is known precisely. In this report the construction, properties, and mode of using a set of fluorescence calibration standards are described. The standards are based on an icosahedral virus engineered to contain exactly 240 copies of one of seven different fluorescent proteins. Two applications of the fluorescent standards to counting molecules in the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii are described. Methods for improving the preciseness of the measurements and minimizing potential inaccuracies are emphasized.\\n\\nLay AbstractA broad goal of modern biology is to understand how the machines within living cells work. It is nowadays routine to identify the individual protein components of a machine, but not yet straightforward to tell how many copies of each component are needed to build a functional assembly. In many types of cells it is now possible to substitute for the native proteins within cells altered versions that are fluorescent. If one knew how much fluorescence is generated by a single molecule of the altered protein, then one could use a light microscope to count the number of copies of the protein in a cellular machine by simply measuring the total fluorescence coming from that part of the cell. This paper describes the construction and methods for using a set of fluorescent virus particles that can be used to determine how much fluorescence is contributed by one molecule of fluorescent protein. The virus particles were chosen for this role because the particular icosahedral symmetry of their structure guarantees that each particle contains exactly 240 copies of one fluorescent protein.",

    "abstract": "Uterine secretory proteins protect the uterus and conceptuses against infection, facilitate implantation, control cellular damage resulting from implantation, and supply embryos with nutrients. The early conceptus of the European polecat (Mustela putorius) grows and develops free in the uterus until implanting at about 12 days after mating. Using a proteomics approach we found that the proteins appearing in the uterus leading up to and including the time of implantation changed dramatically with time. Several of the proteins identified have been found in pregnant uteri of other placental mammals, such as 1-antitrypsin, serum albumin, lactoferrin, cathepsin L1, uteroferrin, and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase. The broad-spectrum proteinase inhibitor 2-macroglobulin rose from relatively low abundance initially to dominate the protein profile by the time of implantation. Its functions may be to limit damage caused by the release of proteinases during implantation, and to control other processes around the site of implantation. Lipocalin-1 (also known as tear lipocalin) has not previously been recorded as a uterine secretion in pregnancy, and also increased substantially in concentration. If polecat lipocalin-1 has similar biochemical properties to the human form, then it may have a combined function in transporting or scavenging lipids, and antimicrobial activities. The changes in the uterine secretory proteome of Euroepan polecats may be similar in those species of mustelid that engage in embryonic diapause, but possibly only following reactivation of the embryo.",

    "abstract": "A forward genetic screen is one of the best methods for revealing the regulatory functions of genes. In plants, this technique is highly efficient since it is relatively easy to grow and screen the phenotypes of hundreds or thousands of individuals. The cost-efficiency and ease of data production afforded by next-generation sequencing techniques have created new opportunities for mapping induced mutations. The principles of genetic mapping remain the same. However, the details have changed, which allows for rapid mapping of causal mutations. Current mapping tools are often not user-friendly and complicated or require extensive preparation steps. To simplify the process of mapping new mutations, we developed a pipeline that takes next generation sequencing fastq files as input, calls on several well-established and freely available genome-analysis tools, and outputs the most likely causal DNA change(s). The pipeline has been validated in Arabidopsis and can be readily applied to other species.",

    "abstract": "Subsurface groundwater-surface water mixing zones (hyporheic zones) have enhanced biogeochemical activity, but assembly processes governing subsurface microbiomes remain a critical uncertainty in understanding hyporheic biogeochemistry. To address this obstacle, we investigated (a) biogeographical patterns in attached and waterborne microbiomes across three hydrologically-connected, physicochemically-distinct zones (inland hyporheic, nearshore hyporheic, and river); (b) assembly processes that generated these patterns; (c) groups of organisms that corresponded to deterministic changes in the environment; and (d) correlations between these groups and hyporheic metabolism. All microbiomes remained dissimilar through time, but consistent presence of similar taxa suggested dispersal and/or common selective pressures among zones. Further, we demonstrated a pronounced impact of deterministic assembly in all microbiomes as well as seasonal shifts from heterotrophic to autotrophic microorganisms associated with increases in groundwater discharge. The abundance of one statistical cluster of organisms increased with active biomass and respiration, revealing organisms that may strongly influence hyporheic biogeochemistry. Based on our results, we propose a conceptualization of hyporheic zone metabolism in which increased organic carbon concentrations during surface water intrusion support heterotrophy, which succumbs to autotrophy under groundwater discharge. These results provide new opportunities to enhance microbially-explicit ecosystem models describing hyporheic zone biogeochemistry and its influence over riverine ecosystem function.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementSubsurface zones of groundwater and surface water mixing (hyporheic zones) are hotspots of biogeochemical activity and strongly influence carbon, nutrient and contaminant dynamics within riverine ecosystems. Hyporheic zone microbiomes are responsible for up to 95% of riverine ecosystem respiration, yet the ecology of these microbiomes remains poorly understood. While significant progress is being made in the development of microbially-explicit ecosystem models, poor understanding of hyporheic zone microbial ecology impedes development of such models in this critical zone. To fill the knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive analysis of biogeographical patterns in hyporheic microbiomes as well as the ecological processes that govern their composition and function through space and time. Despite pronounced hydrologic connectivity throughout the hyporheic zone--and thus a strong potential for dispersal--we find that ecological selection deterministically governs microbiome composition within local environments, and we identify specific groups of organisms that correspond to seasonal changes in hydrology. Based on our results, we propose a conceptual model for hyporheic zone metabolism in which comparatively high-organic C conditions during surface water intrusion into the hyporheic zone support heterotrophic metabolisms that succumb to autotrophy during time periods of groundwater discharge. These results provide new opportunities to develop microbially-explicit ecosystem models that incorporate the hyporheic zone and its influence over riverine ecosystem function.",
