    "abstract": "BackgroundThe high-dose hook effect (also called prozone effect) refers to the observation that if a multivalent protein acts as a linker between two parts of a protein complex, then increasing the amount of linker protein in the mixture does not always increase the amount of fully formed complex. On the contrary, at a high enough concentration range the amount of fully formed complex actually decreases. It has been observed that allosterically regulated proteins seem less susceptible to this effect. The aim of this study was two-fold: First, to investigate the mathematical basis of how allostery mitigates the prozone effect. And second, to explore the consequences of allostery and the high-dose hook effect using the example of calmodulin, a calcium-sensing protein that regulates the switch between long-term potentiation and long-term depression in neurons.\\n\\nResultsWe use a combinatorial model of a \\\"perfect linker protein\\\" (with infinite binding affinity) to mathematically describe the hook effect and its behaviour under allosteric conditions. We show that allosteric regulation does indeed mitigate the high-dose hook effect. We then turn to calmodulin as a real-life example of an allosteric protein. Using kinetic simulations, we show that calmodulin is indeed subject to a hook effect. We also show that this effect is stronger in the presence of the allosteric activator Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), because it reduces the overall cooperativity of the calcium-calmodulin system. It follows that, surprisingly, there are conditions where increased amount of allosteric activator actually decrease the activity of a protein.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that cooperative binding can indeed act as a protective mechanism against the hook effect. This will have implications in vivo where the extent of cooperativity of a protein can be modulated, for instance, by allosteric activators or inhibitors. This can result in counterintuitive effects of decreased activity with increased concentrations of both the allosteric protein itself and its allosteric activators.",

    "abstract": "How mating affects male lifespan is poorly understood. Using single worm lifespan assays, we discovered that males live significantly shorter after mating in both androdioecious (male and hermaphroditic) and gonochoristic (male and female) Caenorhabditis. Germline-dependent shrinking, glycogen loss, and ectopic expression of vitellogenins contribute to male post-mating lifespan reduction, which is conserved between the sexes. In addition to mating-induced lifespan decrease, worms are subject to killing by male pheromone-dependent toxicity. C. elegans males are the most sensitive, whereas C. remanei are immune, suggesting that males in androdioecious and gonochoristic species utilize male pheromone differently as a toxin or a chemical messenger. Our study reveals two mechanisms involved in male lifespan regulation: germline-dependent shrinking and death is the result of an unavoidable cost of reproduction and is evolutionarily conserved, whereas male pheromone-mediated killing provides a novel mechanism to cull the male population and ensure a return to the self-reproduction mode in androdioecious species. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the shared vs. sex- and species-specific mechanisms that regulate lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Temporal asynchrony among species helps diversity to stabilize ecosystem functioning, but identifying the mechanisms that determine synchrony remains a challenge. Here, we refine and test theory showing that synchrony depends on three factors: species responses to environmental variation, interspecific interactions, and demographic stochasticity. We then conduct simulation experiments with empirical population models to quantify the relative influence of these factors on the synchrony of dominant species in five semiarid grasslands. We found that the average synchrony of per capita growth rates, which can range from 0 (perfect asynchrony) to 1 (perfect synchrony), was higher when environmental variation was present (0.62) rather than absent (0.43). Removing interspecific interactions and demographic stochasticity had small effects on synchrony. For the dominant species in these plant communities, where species interactions and demographic stochasticity have little influence, synchrony reflects the covariance in species responses to the environment.",

    "abstract": "By following the evolution of populations that are initially genetically homogeneous, much can be learned about core biological principles. For example, it allows for detailed studies of the rate of emergence of de novo mutations and their change in frequency due to drift and selection. Unfortunately, in multicellular organisms with generation times of months or years, it is difficult to set up and carry out such experiments over many generations. An alternative is provided by \\\"natural evolution experiments\\\" that started from colonizations or invasions of new habitats by selfing lineages. With limited or missing gene flow from other lineages, new mutations and their effects can be easily detected. North America has been colonized in historic times by the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and although multiple intercrossing lineages are found today, many of the individuals belong to a single lineage, HPG1. To determine in this lineage the rate of substitutions - the subset of mutations that survived natural selection and drift -, we have sequenced genomes from plants collected between 1863 and 2006. We identified 73 modern and 27 herbarium specimens that belonged to HPG1. Using the estimated substitution rate, we infer that the last common HPG1 ancestor lived in the early 17th century, when it was most likely introduced by chance from Europe. Mutations in coding regions are depleted in frequency compared to those in other portions of the genome, consistent with purifying selection. Nevertheless, a handful of mutations is found at high frequency in present-day populations. We link these to detectable phenotypic variance in traits of known ecological importance, life history and growth, which could reflect their adaptive value. Our work showcases how, by applying genomics methods to a combination of modern and historic samples from colonizing lineages, we can directly study new mutations and their potential evolutionary relevance.",

We have used a common model framework for gene expression where both motif structures have an activating input and repressing regulator, with the same set of parameters to enable comparison of the responses. We studied the global sensitivity of the system properties such as steady-state gain, overshoot, peak time, and peak duration, to parameters. We find that, in all motifs, overshoot correlated negatively whereas peak duration varied concavely, with peak time. Differences in other system properties were found to be mainly dependent on the the nature of the regulator, than the motif structure. Protein mediated motifs showed a higher degree of adaptation; feedforward motifs exhibited perfect adaptation. RNA mediated motifs had a mild regulatory effect; they also exhibited lower peaking tendency and mean overshoot. Protein mediated feedforward motifs showed higher overshoot and lower peak time compared to corresponding feedback motifs.",

    "abstract": "The genus Amaranthus consists of 50 to 70 species and harbors several cultivated and weedy species of great economic importance. A small number of suitable traits, phenotypic plasticity, gene flow and hybridization made it difficult to establish the taxonomy and phylogeny of the whole genus despite various studies using molecular markers. We inferred the phylogeny of the Amaranthus genus using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 94 genebank accessions representing 35 Amaranthus species and measured their genome sizes. SNPs were called by de novo and reference-based methods, for which we used the distant sugarbeet Beta vulgaris and the closely related Amaranthus hypochondriacus as references. SNP counts and proportions of missing data differed between methods, but the resulting phylogenetic trees were highly similar. A distance-based neighbor joing tree of individual accessions and a species tree calculated with the multispecies coalescent supported a previous taxonomic classification into three subgenera although the subgenus A. Acnida consists of two highly differentiated clades. The analysis of the Hybridus complex within the A. Amaranthus subgenus revealed insights on the history of cultivated grain amaranths. The complex includes the three cultivated grain amaranths and their wild relatives and was well separated from other species in the subgenus. Wild and cultivated amaranth accessions did not differentiate according to the species assignment but clustered by their geographic origin from South and Central America. Different geographically separated populations of Amaranthus hybridus appear to be the common ancestors of the three cultivated grain species and A. quitensis might be additionally be involved in the evolution of South American grain amaranth (A. caudatus). We also measured genome sizes of the species and observed little variation with the exception of two lineages that showed evidence for a recent polyploidization. With the exception of two lineages, genome sizes are quite similar and indicate that polyploidization did not play a major role in the history of the genus.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of RNA-Seq data from individual differentiating cells enables us to reconstruct the differentiation process and the degree of differentiation (in pseudo-time) of each cell. Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation.\\n\\nIn this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses.\\n\\nThe R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODE.",

However, these methods come at a high cost and lack the scale of standard RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).

We applied it to 8,555 samples across 544 individuals from 53 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v6) project. ImReP is able to efficiently extract TCR- and BCR- derived reads from the RNA-Seq data and accurately assemble the complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3s), the most variable regions of B- and T-cell receptors determining their antigen specificity. Using ImReP, we have created the systematic atlas of immunological sequences for B- and T-cell repertoires across a broad range of tissue types, most of which have not been studied for B and T cell receptor repertoires. We have also examined the compositional similarities of clonal populations between the GTEx tissues to track the flow of T- and B- clonotypes across immune-related tissues, including secondary lymphoid organs and organs encompassing mucosal, exocrine, and endocrine sites. The atlas of T- and B-cell receptor receptors, freely available at https://sergheimangul.wordpress.com/atlas-immune-repertoires/, is the largest collection of CDR3 sequences and tissue types.

DESIGN: Retrospective study design utilizing logistic regression modeling of patient clinical symptoms collected from patient chart histories and referral data. SETTING: Regional fast-track TIA clinic on Vancouver Island, Canada, accepting referrals from emergency departments (ED) and general practice (GP). PARTICIPANTS: Model development: 4187 ED and GP referred patients from 2008-2011 who were assessed at the TIA clinic. Temporal hold-out validation: 1953 ED and GP referred patients from 2012-2013 assessed at the same clinic. OUTCOMES: Diagnosis of mild stroke/TIA by clinic neurologists. RESULTS: 123 candidate predictors were assessed using univariate feature selection for inclusion in the model, and culminated in the selection of 50 clinical features. Post-hoc investigation of the selected predictors revealed 12 clinically relevant interaction terms. Model performance on the temporal hold-out validation set achieved a sensitivity/specificity of 71.8% / 72.8% using the ROC01 cutpoint ([&ge;] 0.662), and an AUC of 79.9% (95% CI, 77.9%-81.9%).

    "abstract": "The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is an ideal model organism for studies of ciliary function and assembly. In assays for biological and biochemical effects of various factors on flagellar structure and function, synchronous culture is advantageous for minimizing variability. Here, we have characterized a method in which 100% synchronization is achieved with respect to flagellar length but not with respect to the cell cycle. The method requires inducing flagellar regeneration by amputation of the entire cell population and limiting regeneration time, which results in a maximally homogeneous distribution of flagellar length at three hours post-amputation. We find that time-limiting new protein synthesis during flagellar synchronization limits variability in the unassembled pool of limiting flagellar protein and variability in flagellar length without regulating the cell volume. We also find that long and short flagella mutants that regenerate normally require longer and shorter synchronization times, respectively. By minimizing flagellar length variability using a simple method requiring only hours and no changes in media, flagellar synchronization facilitates the detection of small changes in flagellar length resulting from both chemical and genetic perturbations in Chlamydomonas. This method increases our ability to probe the basic biology of ciliary size regulation and related disease etiologies.",

    "abstract": "When a bottleneck occurs, lethal recessive alleles from the ancestral population provide a genetic load. The purging of lethal recessive mutations may prolong the bottleneck, or even cause the population to become extinct. But the purging is of short duration, it will be over before near neutral deleterious alleles accumulate. Lethal recessive alleles from the parental population and near neutral deleterious mutations which occur during a bottleneck are temporally separated threats to the survival of a population. Breeding individuals from a large population into a small endangered population will provide the benefit of viable alleles to replace near neutral deleterious alleles but also the cost of lethal recessive mutations from the large population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPredator assemblages can differ substantially in their top-down effects on community composition and ecosystem function, but few studies have sought to explain this variation in terms of the phylogenetic distance between predators. The effect of a local predator assemblage will depend on three things - which predators tend to co-occur, how similar their prey preferences are, and how they interact with each other and the whole community. Phylogenetic distance between predators may correlate with each of these processes, either because related predators are more likely to share the same traits, and therefore have similar habitat and prey preferences, or because predators are more likely to compete, and therefore diverge in habitat and prey preferences. Therefore, the phylogenetic structure of predator assemblages could provide a unifying framework for predicting how predators will impact their prey - and therefore any ecosystem functions mediated by their prey.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined the effects of predators on macroinvertebrate food webs found in bromeliads, combining field observations, laboratory feeding trials and a manipulative experiment. We determined whether the phylogenetic distance between predators could explain: the co-observed occurrence of predator species among bromeliads, overlap in prey preferences under no-choice conditions, and effects of predator composition on prey survival, prey composition and ecosystem processes.\\n\\nResultsWe found that phylogenetic distance does not predict either the co-occurrence of predator species nor the overlap in their prey preferences. However, our manipulative experiment showed that prey mortality decreased as the phylogenetic distance between predator species increased, reflecting antagonistic interactions among more distant predators. These effects of phylogenetic distance on prey mortality did not translate into effects on ecosystem function, as measured by rates of detrital decomposition and nitrogen cycling.\\n\\nDiscussionWe conclude that the effects of predator phylogenetic diversity on the bromeliad food web are primarily determined by antagonistic predator-predator interac-tions, rather than habitat distribution or diet overlap. This study illustrates the potential of a phylogenetic community approach to understanding food webs dynamics.",

Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes.

It is known that mycoplasmas are able to stimulate the synthesis of certain cytokines, which act as mitogenes on the cell.

In particular, predicting the impact of the genetic variants on gene expression will allow to optimize specific pathways and functions for engineering new biological systems. In this context, the development of accurate methods for predicting translation efficiency from the nucleotide sequence is a key challenge in computational biology.\\n\\nMethodsIn this work we present PGExpress, a binary classifier to discriminate between mRNA sequences with low and high translation efficiency in E. coli. PGExpress algorithm takes as input 12 features corresponding to RNA folding and anti-Shine-Dalgarno hybridization free energies. The method was trained on a set of 1,772 sequence variants (WT-High) of 137 essential E. coli genes. For each gene, we considered 13 sequence variants of the first 33 nucleotides encoding for the same amino acids followed by the superfolder GFP. Each gene variant is represented sequence blocks that include the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), the first 33 nucleotides of the coding region (C33), the remaining part of the coding region (CC), and their combinations.\\n\\nResultsOur logistic regression-based tool (PGExpress) was trained using a 20-fold gene-based cross-validation procedure on the WT-High dataset. In this test PGExpress achieved an overall accuracy of 74%, a Matthews correlation coefficient 0.49 and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.81. Tested on 3 sets of sequences with different Ribosome Binding Sites, PGExpress reaches similar AUC. Finally, we validated our method by performing in-house experiments on five newly generated mRNA sequence variants. The predictions of the expression level of the new variants are in agreement with our experimental results in E. coli.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://folding.biofold.org/pgexpress\\n\\nContactmarkus.kollmann@hhu.de, emidio.capriotti@unibo.it",

    "abstract": "The humidity surrounding a sample is an important variable in scientific experiments. Biological samples in particular require not just a humid atmosphere but often a relative humidity (RH) that is in equilibrium with a stabilizing solution required to maintain the sample in the same state during measurements. The controlled dehydration of macromolecular crystals can lead to significant increases in crystal order, which often leads to higher diffraction quality. Devices that can accurately control the humidity surrounding crystals on a beamline have led to this technique being increasingly adopted, as experiments become easier and more reproducible. Matching the relative humidity to the mother liquor is the first step to allow the stable mounting of a crystal. In previous work, we measured the equilibrium relative humidity for a range of concentrations of the most commonly used precipitants and showed how this related to Raoults law for the equilibrium vapour pressure of water above a solution. However, a discrepancy between measured values and those predicted by theory could not be explained. Here, we have used a more precise humidity control device to determine equilibrium relative humidity points. The new results are in agreement with Raoults law. We also present a simple argument in statistical mechanics demonstrating that the saturated vapour pressure of a solvent is proportional to its mole fraction in an ideal solution: Raoults Law. The same argument can be extended to the case where solvent and solute molecules are of different size, as is the case with polymers. The results provide a framework for the correct maintenance of the RH surrounding samples.\\n\\nSynopsisThe equilibrium relative humidity values for a number of the most commonly used precipitants in biological macromolecule crystallisation have been measured using a new humidity control device.

    "abstract": "Mechanistic mathematical modeling of biochemical reaction networks using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models has improved our understanding of small-and medium-scale biological processes. While the same should in principle hold for large-and genome-scale processes, the computational methods for the analysis of ODE models which describe hundreds or thousands of biochemical species and reactions are missing so far. While individual simulations are feasible, the inference of the model parameters from experimental data is computationally too intensive. In this manuscript, we evaluate adjoint sensitivity analysis for parameter estimation in large scale biochemical reaction networks. We present the approach for time-discrete measurement and compare it to state-of-the-art methods used in systems and computational biology. Our comparison reveals a significantly improved computational efficiency and a superior scalability of adjoint sensitivity analysis. The computational complexity is effectively independent of the number of parameters, enabling the analysis of large-and genome-scale models. Our study of a comprehensive kinetic model of ErbB signaling shows that parameter estimation using adjoint sensitivity analysis requires a fraction of the computation time of established methods. The proposed method will facilitate mechanistic modeling of genome-scale cellular processes, as required in the age of omics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn this manuscript, we introduce a scalable method for parameter estimation for genome-scale biochemical reaction networks. Mechanistic models for genome-scale biochemical reaction networks describe the behavior of thousands of chemical species using thousands of parameters. Standard methods for parameter estimation are usually computationally intractable at these scales. Adjoint sensitivity based approaches have been suggested to have superior scalability but any rigorous evaluation is lacking. We implement a toolbox for adjoint sensitivity analysis for biochemical reaction network which also supports the import of SBML models. We show by means of a set of benchmark models that adjoint sensitivity based approaches unequivocally outperform standard approaches for large-scale models and that the achieved speedup increases with respect to both the number of parameters and the number of chemical species in the model. This demonstrates the applicability of adjoint sensitivity based approaches to parameter estimation for genome-scale mechanistic model. The MATLAB toolbox implementing the developed methods is available from http://ICB-DCM.github.io/AMICI/.",

    "abstract": "Wheat pre-breeders use soil coring and core-break counts to phenotype root architecture traits, with data collected on rooting density for hundreds of genotypes in small increments of depth. The measured densities are both large datasets and highly variable even within the same genotype, hence, any rigorous, comprehensive statistical analysis of such complex field data would be technically challenging. Traditionally, most attributes of the field data are therefore discarded in favor of simple numerical summary descriptors which retain much of the high variability exhibited by the raw data. This poses practical challenges: although plant scientists have established that root traits do drive resource capture in crops, traits that are more randomly (rather than genetically) determined are difficult to breed for. In this paper we develop a Bayesian hierarchical nonlinear modeling approach that utilizes the complete field data for wheat genotypes to fit an idealized relative intensity function for the root distribution over depth. Our approach was used to determine heritability: how much of the variation between field samples was purely random versus being mechanistically driven by the plant genetics? Based on the genotypic intensity functions, the overall heritability estimate was 0.62 (95% Bayesian confidence interval was 0.52 to 0.71). Despite root count profiles that were statistically very noisy, our Bayesian analysis led to denoised profiles which exhibited rigorously discernible phenotypic traits. The profile-specific traits could be representative of a genotype and thus can be used as a quantitative tool to associate phenotypic traits with specific genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Neural development is generally marked by an increase in the efficiency and diversity of neural processes. In a large sample (N = 114) of children and adults with ages ranging from 5 -44 years, we investigated the neural responses to naturalistic video stimuli. Videos from both real-life classroom settings and Hollywood feature films were used to probe different aspects of attention and engagement. For all stimuli, older ages were marked by more variable neural responses. Variability was assessed by the inter-subject correlation of evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. Young males also had more variable responses than young females. These results were replicated in an independent cohort (N = 303). When interpreted in the context of neural maturation, we conclude that neural function becomes more variable with maturity, at least in during the passive viewing of real-world stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNaturalistic videos were used to measure how a large sample of children and adults process environmentally meaningful stimuli. As age increased, neural responses were more variable, and females responded more variably than males - a difference that disappeared with age. These results are consistent with developmental theories positing that neural variability increases with maturation, and that neural maturation typically occurs earlier in females. This is the first study to investigate neural variability under naturalistic conditions in a developmental sample.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are folded in a hierarchy of topologically associating domains (TADs), subTADs and looping interactions. The nested nature of chromatin domains has rendered it challenging to identify a sensitive and specific metric for detecting subTADs and quantifying their dynamic reconfiguration across cellular states. Here, we apply graph theoretic principles to quantify hierarchical folding patterns in high-resolution chromatin topology maps. We discover that TADs can be accurately detected using a Louvain-like locally greedy algorithm to maximize network modularity. By varying a resolution parameter in the modularity quality function, we accurately partition the mouse genome across length scales into a hierarchical nested structure of network communities exhibiting a wide range of sizes. To distinguish high probability subTADs from the full detected set, we developed and applied a new  hierarchical spatial variance minimization method. Moreover, we identified a large number of dynamically altered communities between pluripotent embryonic stem cells and multipotent neural progenitor cells. Cell type specific boundaries correlate with trends in dynamic occupancy of the architectural protein CTCF, thereby validating their biological relevance. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of metrics from network science in quantifying a nested hierarchy of dynamic 3D chromatin communities across length scales. Our findings are significant toward unraveling the link between higher-order genome folding and gene expression during healthy development and the deregulation of molecular pathways linked to disease.",

    "abstract": "Vervet monkeys (genus Chlorocebus, also known as African green monkeys), are highly abundant in savannahs and riverine forests throughout sub-Saharan Africa. They are amongst the most widely distributed nonhuman primates, show considerable phenotypic diversity, and have long been an important biomedical model for a variety of human diseases1 and in vaccine research2-4. They are particularly interesting for HIV/AIDS research as they are the most abundant natural hosts of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a close relative of HIV. Here we present the first genome-wide survey of polymorphism in vervets, using sequencing data from 163 individuals sampled from across Africa and the Caribbean islands where vervets were introduced during the colonial era. We find high diversity, within and between taxa, and clear evidence that taxonomic divergence was reticulate rather than following a simple branching pattern. A scan for diversifying selection across vervet taxa yields gene enrichments much stronger than in similar studies on humans5. In particular, we report strong and highly polygenic selection signals affecting viral processes -- in line with recent evidence that proposes a driving role for viruses in protein evolution in mammals6. Furthermore, selection scores are highly elevated in genes whose human orthologs interact with HIV, and in genes that show a response to experimental SIV infection in vervet monkeys but not in rhesus macaques, suggesting that part of the signal reflects taxon-specific adaptation to SIV. Intriguingly, rather than affecting genes with antiviral and inflammatory-related functions7, selection in vervets appears to have primarily targeted genes involved in the transcriptional regulation of viruses, and in particular those that are harmful only under immunodeficiency, suggesting adaptation to living with SIV rather than defense against infection.",

Although stochastic choice mechanisms are assumed by many theoretical models, their origin and mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigated this issue by studying how neural circuits in the frontal cortex determine action timing in rats performing a waiting task. Electrophysiological recordings from two regions necessary for this behavior, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and secondary motor cortex (M2), revealed an unexpected functional dissociation. Both areas encoded deterministic biases in action timing, but only M2 neurons reflected stochastic trial-by-trial fluctuations. This differential coding was reflected in distinct timescales of neural dynamics in the two frontal cortical areas. These results suggest a two-stage model in which stochastic components of action timing decisions are injected by circuits downstream of those carrying deterministic bias signals.",

The memory circuitry within the ellipsoid body (EB) and mushroom body (MB) brain regions is crucial for SMD, which depends on the circadian clock genes Clock and cycle, but not timeless or period. SMD also relies on signaling via the neuropeptide sNPF, but not PDF or NPF. Sexual experience modifies the neuronal activity of a subset of sNPF-positive neurons involved in neuropeptide signaling, which modulates SMD. Thus, our study delineates the molecular and cellular basis for SMD - a plastic social behavior that serves as a model system to study how the brain switches the internal states between sexual drive and satiety.",

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive three-dimensional imaging technique with micrometer resolution allowing microstructural characterization of tissues in vivo and in real time. We present the first application of OCT for in vivo imaging of tissue and skeleton structure of intact living corals spanning a variety of morphologies and tissue thickness. OCT visualized different coral tissue layers (e.g. endoderm vs ectoderm), special structures such as mesenterial filaments and skeletal cavities, as well as mucus release from living corals. We also developed a new approach for non-invasive imaging and quantification of chromatophores containing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like host pigment granules in coral tissue. The chromatophore system is hyper-reflective and can thus be imaged with good optical contrast in OCT, enabling quantification of chromatophore size, distribution and abundance. Because of its rapid imaging speed, OCT can also be used to quantify coral tissue movement showing that maximal linear contraction velocity was ~120 m per second upon high light stimulation. Based on OCT imaging of tissue expansion and contraction, we made first estimates of dynamic changes in the coral tissue surface area, which varied by a factor of 2 between the contracted and expanded state of the coral Pocillopora damicornis. We conclude that OCT is an excellent novel tool for in vivo tomographic imaging of corals that can reveal tissue and skeleton organization as well as quantify dynamic changes in tissue structure and coral surface area non-invasively and at high spatio-temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "ATAC-seq is a high-throughput sequencing technique that aims at identifying DNA sequences located in open chromatin. Depending on the cell type, ATAC-seq may yield a high number of mitochondrial sequencing reads (~20-80% of the reads). As the regions of open chromatin of interest are usually located in the nuclear genome, mitochondrial reads are typically discarded from the analysis. To decrease wasted sequencing, we performed targeted cleavage of mitochondrial DNA using CRISPR/Cas9 and 100 mtDNA-specific guide RNAs. We also tested a modified ATAC-seq protocol that does not include detergent in the cell lysis buffer. Both treatments resulted in considerable reduction of mitochondrial reads (1.7 and 3-fold, respectively). The removal of detergent, however, resulted in increased background and fewer peaks identified. The highest number of peaks and highest quality data was obtained by preparing samples with the original ATAC-seq protocol (using detergent) and treating them with anti-mitochondrial guide RNAs and Cas9. This strategy could lead to considerable cost reduction and improved peak calling when performing ATAC-seq on a moderate to large number of samples and in cell types that contain a large amount of mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Communication through visual symbols is a key aspect of human culture. However, to what extent can people distinguish between human-origin and artificial symbols, and the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not clear. Using fMRI we contrasted brain activity during presentation of human-created abstract shapes and random-algorithm created shapes, both sharing similar low level features.\\n\\nWe found that participants correctly identified most shapes as human or random. The lateral occipital complex (LOC) was the main brain region showing preference to human-made shapes, independently of task. Furthermore, LOC activity was parametrically correlated to beauty and familiarity scores of the shapes (rated following the scan). Finally, a model classifier based only on LOC activity showed human level accuracy at discriminating between human-made and randomly-made shapes.\\n\\nOur results highlight the sensitivity of the human brain to social and cultural cues, and point to high-order object areas as central nodes underlying this capacity.",
