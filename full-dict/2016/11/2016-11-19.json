    "abstract": "Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal \\\"virtual laboratory\\\" for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the \\\"stage\\\") and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the \\\"players\\\" upon the stage).\\n\\nPhysiCell--physics-based multicellular simulator--is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility \\\"out of the box.\\\" The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes.\\n\\nWe demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a \\\"cellular cargo delivery\\\" system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThis paper introduces PhysiCell: an open source, agent-based modeling framework for 3-D multicellular simulations. It includes a standard library of sub-models for cell fluid and solid volume changes, cycle progression, apoptosis, necrosis, mechanics, and motility. PhysiCell is directly coupled to a biotransport solver to simulate many diffusing substrates and cell-secreted signals. Each cell can dynamically update its phenotype based on its microenvironmental conditions. Users can customize or replace the included sub-models.\\n\\nPhysiCell runs on a variety of platforms (Linux, OSX, and Windows) with few software dependencies. Its computational cost scales linearly in the number of cells. It is feasible to simulate 500,000 cells on quad-core desktop workstations, and millions of cells on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on hanging drop tumor spheroids (HDS) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate contact- and chemokine-based interactions among multiple cell types with examples in synthetic multicellular bioengineering, cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology.\\n\\nWe developed PhysiCell to help the scientific community tackle multicellular systems biology problems involving many interacting cells in multi-substrate microenvironments. PhysiCell is also an independent, cross-platform codebase for replicating results from other simulators.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin accessibility, a crucial component of genome regulation, has primarily been studied in homogeneous and simple systems, such as isolated cell populations or early-development models. Whether chromatin accessibility can be assessed in complex, dynamic systems in vivo with high sensitivity remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use ATAC-seq to identify chromatin accessibility changes in a whole animal, the model organism C. elegans, from embryogenesis to adulthood. Chromatin accessibility changes between developmental stages are highly reproducible, recapitulate histone modification changes, and reveal key regulatory aspects of the epigenomic landscape throughout organismal development. We find that over 5,000 distal non-coding regions exhibit dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility between developmental stages, and could thereby represent putative enhancers. When tested in vivo, several of these putative enhancers indeed drive novel cell-type-and temporal-specific patterns of expression. Finally, by integrating transcription factor binding motifs in a machine learning framework, we identify EOR-1 as a unique transcription factor that may regulate chromatin dynamics during development. Our study provides a unique resource for C. elegans, a system in which the prevalence and importance of enhancers remains poorly characterized, and demonstrates the power of using whole organism chromatin accessibility to identify novel regulatory regions in complex systems.",

Full sequences yield the most granular haplogroup classifications, but genotyping arrays can yield reliable calls, provided a reasonable number of phylogenetically informative variants has been assayed. The algorithm is robust to missing data, genotype errors, mutation recurrence, and other complications. We have tested the software on full sequences from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project and on subsets thereof constructed by downsampling to SNPs present on each of four genotyping arrays. We have also run the software on array data from more than 600,000 males.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling is a highly conserved cell signaling system in most multicellular organisms and plays a critical role in animal development. In various tumor cells, Notch signaling is elevated and has been considered as an important target in cancer treatments. In C. elegans, GLP-1 (one of two C. elegans Notch receptors) activity is required for cell fate specification in germline and somatic tissues. In this study, we have identified div-1 gene as a positive regulator for GLP-1/Notch-mediated cellular events. C. elegans div-1 encodes the B subunit of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex and is highly expressed in proliferative germ cells. Functional analyses demonstrated that i) DIV-1 is required for the robust proliferation typical of the germline, ii) loss of DIV-1 enhances and suppresses specific phenotypes that are associated with reduced and elevated GLP-1/Notch activity in germline and somatic tissues, and iii) DIV-1 works together with FBF/PUF proteins, downstream regulators of GLP-1/Notch signaling, to promote germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and germline proliferation. To maintain GSCs and proliferative cell fate, GLP-1/Notch activity must remain above a threshold for proliferation/differentiation decision. Our results propose that DIV-1 may control the level of threshold for GLP-1/Notch-mediated germline proliferation. PolA2, a mammalian homolog of the C. elegans DIV-1, has been emerged as a therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Notably, Notch signaling is altered in approximately one third of NSCLCs. Therefore, the discovery of the DIV-1 effect on GLP-1/Notch-mediated cellular events has implications for our understanding of vertebrate PolA2 protein and its influence on stem cell maintenance and tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The herpesvirus process of primary envelopment and de-envelopment as viral particles exit the nucleus has been for many years one of the least understood steps in the virus life cycle. Though viral proteins such as pUL31, pUL34, pUS3 and others are clearly important, these are likely insufficient for efficient fusion with the nuclear membrane. We postulated that host nuclear membrane proteins involved in virus nuclear egress would move from the inner to outer nuclear membranes due to membrane fusion events in primary envelopment and de-envelopment and then diffuse into the endoplasmic reticulum. Membrane fractions were prepared enriched in the nuclear envelope or the endoplasmic reticulum with and without HSV-1 infection and analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing several vesicle fusion proteins as candidates in the viral nuclear egress pathway. Knockdown of three of these, VAPB, Rab11b, and Rab18, significantly reduced titers of released virus while yielding nuclear accumulation of encapsidated particles. Antibody staining revealed that VAPB visually accumulates in the inner nuclear membrane during HSV-1 infection. VAPB also co-localizes at early time points with the viral pUL34 protein known to be involved in nuclear egress. Most strikingly, VAPB was also observed on HSV-1 virus particles by immunogold labelling electron microscopy. Thus, these data reveal several new host cell vesicle fusion proteins involved in viral nuclear egress.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman herpesviruses are associated with common human diseases such as chicken pox, shingles and mononucleosis and infect a wide range of animals making them economically important pathogens for livestock. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is most commonly associated with cold sores, but is also the leading cause of blindness by infection in the Western world. All herpesviruses share many aspects of infection. As large nuclear replicating dsDNA viruses with capsid sizes too large to use the nuclear pores to exit the nucleus, they have evolved a complex mechanism for envelopment and de-envelopment of primary herpesvirus particles, but this critical step in the virus lifecycle remains poorly understood. We have identified several host cell vesicle fusion proteins, VAPB, Rab11b and Rab18 that appear to contribute to this step in the HSV-1 life cycle. VAPB accumulates at the nuclear envelope with the HSV-1 pUL34 protein important for viral nuclear egress. Knockdown of any of these vesicle fusion proteins reduces viral titers, further arguing that they are important for nuclear egress. As there appears to be a specific subset of vesicle fusion proteins involved in viral egress, they could possibly represent novel targets for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The proteasome holoenzyme is activated by its regulatory particle (RP) consisting of two subcomplexes, the lid and the base. A key event in base assembly is the formation of a heterohexameric ring of AAA-ATPases, which is guided by at least four RP assembly chaperones in mammals: PAAF1, p28/gankyrin, p27/PSMD9 and S5b. We determined a cryo-EM structure of the human RP in complex with its assembly chaperone p28 at 4.5-[A] resolution. The Rpn1-p28-AAA subcomplex in the p28-bound RP is highly dynamic and was resolved to subnanometer resolution in seven states, which recapitulate the conformational landscape of the complex. Surprisingly, the p28-bound AAA ring does not form a channel in the free RP. Instead, it spontaneously samples multiple  open and  closed topologies. Our analysis suggests that p28 guides the proteolytic core particle to select certain conformation of the ATPase ring for RP engagement in the last step of the chaperone-mediated proteasome assembly.",

Currently, detailed insights on flagellar structure come from studies on protozoa. Here, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of intact human spermatozoon tails showed a variable number of microtubules in the singlet region. Inside their lumen, a novel left-handed interrupted helix which extends several micrometers at their plus ends was discovered. This structure was named Tail Axoneme Intra-Lumenal Spiral (TAILS) and binds directly to 11 protofilaments on the internal microtubule wall, coaxial with the surrounding microtubule lattice. It leaves a gap over the microtubule seam, which was directly visualized in both singlet and doublet microtubules. We suggest that TAILS may stabilize microtubules, enable rapid swimming or play a role in controlling the swimming direction of spermatozoa.",

To help address this difficulty, we developed Ragout, a reference-assisted assembly tool that now works for large and complex genomes. Taking one or more target assemblies (generated from an NGS assembler) and one or multiple related reference genomes, Ragout infers the evolutionary relationships between the genomes and builds the final assemblies using a genome rearrangement approach. Using Ragout, we transformed NGS assemblies of 15 different Mus musculus and one Mus spretus genomes into sets of complete chromosomes, leaving less than 5% of sequence unlocalized per set. Various benchmarks, including PCR testing and realigning of long PacBio reads, suggest only a small number of structural errors in the final assemblies, comparable with direct assembly approaches. Additionally, we applied Ragout to Mus caroli and Mus pahari genomes, which exhibit karyotype-scale variations compared to other genomes from the Muridae family. Chromosome color maps confirmed most large-scale rearrangements that Ragout detected.",

Here, we analyze both the within- and between-subject variability as well as the test-retest reliability of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) estimates in a unique data set comprising multiple fMRI scans (42) from 5 subjects, and 50 single scans from 50 subjects. To this aim we adopted a statistical framework enabling us to disentangle the contribution of different sources of variability and their dependence on scan duration, and showed that the low reliability of single links can be largely improved using multiple scans per subject. Moreover, we show that practically all observed inter-region variability (at the link-level) is not significant and due to the statistical uncertainty of the estimator itself rather than to genuine variability among areas. Finally, we use the proposed statistical framework to demonstrate that, despite the poor consistency of single links, the information carried by the whole-brain spontaneous correlation structure is indeed robust, and can in fact be used as a functional fingerprint.",
