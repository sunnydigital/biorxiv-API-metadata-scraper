    "abstract": "BackgroundDifferential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly.\\n\\nResultsWe present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (1) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs which permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (3) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete.\\n\\nConclusionsderfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.\\n\\nThe package is available from Bioconductor at www.bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder.",

    "abstract": "For several species, refuges (such as burrows, dens, roosts, nests) are an essential resource for protection from predators and extreme environmental conditions. Refuges also serve as focal sites for social interactions including mating, courtship and aggression. Knowledge of refuge use patterns can therefore provide information about social structure, mating and foraging success, as well as the robustness and health of wildlife populations, especially for species considered to be relatively solitary. In this study, we construct networks of burrow use to infer social associations in a threatened wildlife species typically considered solitary - the desert tortoise. We show that tortoise social networks are significantly different than null networks of random associations, and have moderate spatial constraints. We next use statistical models to identify major mechanisms behind individual-level variation in tortoise burrow use, popularity of burrows in desert tortoise habitat and test for stressor-driven changes in refuge use patterns. We show that seasonal variation has a strong impact on tortoise burrow switching behavior. On the other hand, burrow age and topographical condition influence the number of tortoises visiting a burrow in desert tortoise habitat. Of three major population stressors affecting this species (translocation, drought, disease), translocation alters tortoise burrow switching behavior, with translocated animals visiting fewer unique burrows than residents. In a species that is not social, our study highlights the importance of leveraging refuge use behavior to study the presence of and mechanisms behind non-random social structure and individual-level variation. Our analysis of the impact of stressors on refuge-based social structure further emphasizes the potential of this method to detect environmental or anthropogenic disturbances.\\n\\nSignificance statement: Adaptive and social behavior that affects fitness is now being increasingly incorporated in the conservation and management of wildlife species. However, direct observations of social interactions in species considered to be solitary are difficult, and therefore integration of behavior in conservation and management decisions in such species has been infrequent. For such species, we propose quantifying refuge use behavior as it can provide insights towards their (hidden) social structure, establish relevant contact patterns of infectious disease spread, and provide early warning signals of population stressors. Our study highlights this approach in a long-lived and threatened species, the desert tortoise. We provide evidence towards the presence of and identify mechanisms behind the social structure in desert tortoises formed by their burrow use preferences. We also show how individuals burrow use behavior responds to the presence of population stressors.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a comprehensive analysis of virulence in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici using QTL mapping. High throughput phenotyping based on automated image analysis allowed measurement of pathogen virulence on a scale and with a precision that was not previously possible. Across two mapping populations encompassing more than 520 progeny, 540,710 pycnidia were counted and their sizes and grey values were measured, yielding over 1.6 million phenotypes associated with pathogen reproduction. Large pycnidia were shown to produce more numerous and larger spores than small pycnidia. Precise measures of percent leaf area covered by lesions provided a quantitative measure of host damage. Combining these large and accurate phenotype datasets with a dense panel of RADseq genetic markers enabled us to genetically dissect pathogen virulence into components related to host damage and components related to pathogen reproduction. We show that different components of virulence can be under separate genetic control. Large-and small-effect QTLs were identified for all traits, with some QTLs specific to mapping populations, cultivars and traits and other QTLs shared among traits within the same mapping population. We associated the presence or absence of accessory chromosomes with several virulence traits, providing the first evidence for an important function associated with accessory chromosomes in this organism. A large-effect QTL involved in host specialization was identified on chromosome 7, leading to identification of candidate genes having a large effect on virulence.",

    "abstract": "Histone modifications are frequently used as markers for enhancer states, but how to interpret enhancer states in the context of embryonic development is not clear. The poised enhancer signature, involving H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27ac, has been reported to mark inactive enhancers that are poised for future activation. However, future activation is not always observed and alternative reasons for the widespread occurrence of this enhancer signature have not been investigated. By analyzing enhancers during dorsal-ventral (DV) axis formation in the Drosophila embryo, we find that the poised enhancer signature is specifically generated during patterning in the tissue where the enhancers are not induced, including at enhancers that are known to be repressed by a transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that, rather than serving simply as an intermediate step before future activation, the poised enhancer state may mark enhancers for spatial activation during tissue patterning. We discuss the possibility that the poised enhancer state is more generally the result of repression by transcriptional repressors.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is the central preoccupation of molecular biology, thus newly discovered facets of gene expression are of great interest. Recently, ourselves and others reported that in the diplomonad protist Giardia lamblia, the coding regions of several mRNAs are produced by ligation of independent RNA species expressed from distinct genomic loci. Such trans-splicing of introns was found to affect nearly as many genes in this organism as does classical cis-splicing of introns. These findings raised questions about the incidence of intron trans-splicing both across the G. lamblia transcriptome and across diplomonad diversity, however a dearth of transcriptomic data at the time prohibited systematic study of these questions. Here, I leverage newly available transcriptomic data from G. lamblia and the related diplomonad Spironucleus salmonicida to search for trans-spliced introns. My computational pipeline recovers all four previously reported trans-spliced introns in G. lamblia, suggesting good sensitivity. Scrutiny of thousands of potential cases revealed only a single additional trans-spliced intron in G. lamblia, in the p68 helicase gene, and no cases in S. salmonicida. The p68 intron differs from the previously reported trans-spliced introns in its high degree of streamlining: the core features of G. lamblia trans-spliced introns closely packed together, revealing striking efficiency in the implementation of a seemingly inherently inefficient molecular mechanism. These results serve to circumscribe the role of trans-splicing both in terms of genes effected and taxonomically. Future work should focus on the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary origins and phenotypic implications of this intriguing phenomenon.",

This article reports improved B-factor prediction achieved by sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond molecular dynamics simulations that use uniformly increased atomic masses by 100-fold to increase time resolution. Using the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, ubiquitin, and lysozyme as model systems, the B-factor root mean square deviations (mean {+/-} standard error) of these proteins were 3.1 {+/-} 0.2-9 {+/-} 1 [A]2 for C and 7.3 {+/-} 0.9-9.6 {+/-} 0.2 [A]2 for C{gamma}, when the sampling was done, for each of these proteins, over 20 distinct, independent, and 50-picosecond high-mass molecular dynamics simulations using AMBER forcefield FF12MC or FF14SB. These results suggest that sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond high-mass molecular dynamics simulations may be conducive to a priori prediction of crystallographic B-factors of a folded globular protein.",

Making accurate inferences from chromatin profiling experiments that involve diverse experimental parameters is challenging.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a convolutional denoising algorithm, Coda, that uses convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping from suboptimal to high-quality histone ChIP-seq data. This overcomes various sources of noise and variability, substantially enhancing and recovering signal when applied to low-quality chromatin profiling datasets across individuals, cell types, and species. Our method has the potential to improve data quality at reduced costs. More broadly, this approach - using a high-dimensional discriminative model to encode a generative noise process - is generally applicable to other biological domains where it is easy to generate noisy data but difficult to analytically characterize the noise or underlying data distribution.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/kundajelab/coda\\n\\nContactakundaje@stanford.edu",

Here we introduce the Singleton Density Score (SDS), a powerful measure to infer very recent changes in allele frequencies from contemporary genome sequences. When applied to data from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in the ancestors of modern Britons during the past 2,000 years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and HLA, and in favor of blond hair and blue eyes. Turning to signals of polygenic adaptation we find, remarkably, that recent selection for increased height has driven allele frequency shifts across most of the genome. Moreover, we report suggestive new evidence for polygenic shifts affecting many other complex traits. Our results suggest that polygenic adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation in modern humans.",

    "abstract": "To identify novel genetic variants associated with complex traits and to shed new insights on underlying biology, in addition to the most popular single SNP-single trait association analysis, it would be useful to explore multiple correlated (intermediate) traits at the gene-or pathway-level by mining existing single GWAS or meta-analyzed GWAS data. For this purpose, we present an adaptive gene-based test and a pathway-based test for association analysis of multiple traits with GWAS summary statistics. The proposed tests are adaptive at both the SNP-and trait-levels; that is, they account for possibly varying association patterns (e.g. signal sparsity levels) across SNPs and traits, thus maintaining high power across a wide range of situations. Furthermore, the proposed methods are general: they can be applied to mixed types of traits, and to Z-statistics or p-values as summary statistics obtained from either a single GWAS or a meta-analysis of multiple GWAS. Our numerical studies with simulated and real data demonstrated the promising performance of the proposed methods.\\n\\nThe methods are implemented in R package aSPU, freely and publicly available on CRAN at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aSPU/.",

    "abstract": "Isolated populations with novel phenotypes present an exciting opportunity to uncover the genetic basis of ecologically significant adaptation, and genomic scans for positive selection in such populations have often, but not always, led to candidate genes directly related to an adaptive phenotype. However, in many cases these populations were established by a severe bottleneck, which can make identifying targets of selection problematic. Here we simulate severe bottlenecks and subsequent selection on standing variation, mimicking adaptation after establishment of a new small population, such as an island or an artificial selection experiment. Using simulations of single loci under positive selection and population genetics theory, we examine how population size and age of the population isolate affects the ability of outlier scans for selection to identify adaptive alleles using both single site measures and haplotype structure. We find and explain an optimal combination of selection strength, starting frequency, and age of the adaptive allele, which we refer to as a Goldilocks zone, where adaptation is likely to occur, and yet the adaptive variants are most likely to derive from a single ancestor (a \\\"hard\\\" selective sweep); in this zone, four commonly used statistics detect selection with high power. Real-world examples of both island colonization and experimental evolution studies are discussed. Our study provides concrete considerations to be made before embarking on whole genome sequencing of differentiated populations.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly declining costs of sequencing human genomes and exomes are providing deeper insights into genomic variation than previously possible. Growing sequence datasets are uncovering large numbers of rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in coding regions, many of which may even be unique to single individuals. The rarity of such variants makes it difficult to use conventional variant-phenotype associations as a means of predicting their potential impacts. As such, protein structures may help to provide the needed means for inferring otherwise difficult-to-discern rare SNV-phenotype associations. Previous efforts have sought to quantify the effects of SNVs on structures by evaluating their impacts on global stability. However, local perturbations can severely impact functionality (such as catalysis, allosteric regulation, interactions and specificity) without strongly disrupting global stability. Here, we describe a workflow in which localized frustration (which quantifies unfavorable residue-residue interactions) is employed as a metric to investigate such effects. We apply frustration to study the impacts of a large number of SNVs available throughout a number of next-generation sequencing datasets. Most of our observations are intuitively consistent: we observe that disease-associated SNVs have a strong proclivity to induce strong changes in localized frustration, and rare variants tend to disrupt local interactions to a larger extent than do common variants. Furthermore, we observe that somatic SNVs associated with oncogenes induce stronger perturbations at the surface, whereas those associated with tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) induce stronger perturbations in the interior. These findings are consistent with the notion that gain-of-function (for oncogenes) and loss-of-function events (for TSGs) may act through changes in regulatory interactions and basic functionality, respectively",

    "abstract": "Some photosynthetic organisms live in extremely low light environments. Light limitation is associated with selective forces as well as reduced exposure to mutagens, and over evolutionary timescales it can leave a footprint on species genome. Here we present the chloroplast genomes of four green algae (Bryopsidales, Ulvophyceae), including the endolithic (limestone-boring) alga Ostreobium quekettii, which is a low light specialist. We use phylogenetic models and comparative genomic tools to investigate whether the chloroplast genome of Ostreobium corresponds to our expectations of how low light would affect genome evolution. Ostreobium has the smallest and most gene-dense chloroplast genome among Ulvophyceae reported to date, matching our expectation that light limitation would impose resource constraints. Rates of molecular evolution are significantly slower along the phylogenetic branch leading to Ostreobium, in agreement with the expected effects of low light and energy levels on molecular evolution. Given the exceptional ability of our model organism to photosynthesize under extreme low light conditions, we expected to observe positive selection in genes related to the photosynthetic machinery. However, we observed stronger purifying selection in these genes, which might either reflect a lack of power to detect episodic positive selection followed by purifying selection and/or a strengthening of purifying selection due to the loss of a gene related to light sensitivity. Besides shedding light on the genome dynamics associated with a low light lifestyle, this study helps to resolve the role of environmental factors in shaping the diversity of genome architectures observed in nature.\\n\\nData deposition: Chloroplast genome sequences will be deposited in GenBank",
