    "abstract": "Bluegill sunfish are one of the classic systems for studying male alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in teleost fishes. In this species, there are two distinct life histories: parental and cuckolder, encompassing three reproductive tactics, parental, satellite, and sneaker. The parental life history is fixed, whereas individuals who enter the cuckolder life history transition from the sneaker to the satellite tactic as they grow. For this study, we used RNAseq to characterize the brain transcriptome of the three male tactics and females during spawning to identify gene categories associated with each tactic and identify potential candidate genes influencing their different spawning behaviors. We found that sneaker males had higher levels of gene differentiation compared to the other two male tactics. Sneaker males also had high expression in ionotropic glutamate receptor genes, specifically AMPA receptors, which may be important for increased working spatial memory while attempting to cuckold parental males at their nests. Larger differences in gene expression also occurred among male tactics than between males and females. We found significant expression differences in several candidate genes that were previously identified in other species with ARTs and suggest a previously undescribed role for cAMP-responsive element modulator (crem) in influencing parental male behaviors during spawning.",

    "abstract": "The response of gene expression to intra-and extra-cellular cues is largely mediated through changes in the activity of transcription factors (TFs), whose sequence specificities are largely known. However, the rules by which promoters decode the amount of active TF into gene expression are not well understood. Here, we measure the activity of 6500 designed promoters at six different levels of TF activity in budding yeast. We observe that maximum promoter activity is determined by TF activity and not by the number of sites. Surprisingly, the addition of an activator-binding site often reduces expression. A thermodynamic model that incorporates competition between neighboring binding sites for a local pool of TF molecules explains this behavior and accurately predicts both absolute expression and the amount by which addition of a site increases or reduces expression. Taken together, our findings support a model in which neighboring binding sites interact competitively when TF is limiting but otherwise act additively\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn response to intracellular and extracellular signals organisms alter the concentration and activity of transcription factors (TFs), proteins that regulate gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms that determine the response of a target promoter to changes in the number of active TF molecules are not well understood. By combining mathematical modeling with measurements of TF dose-response curves for thousands of designed promoters, we show that competition for active TF molecules is a major factor in determining gene expression. At low TF concentrations additional activator-binding sites within a promoter can actually reduce expression. Thermodynamic modeling suggests that steric hindrance between neighboring binding sites cannot explain this behavior, but that competition for limiting TF molecules can.",

    "abstract": "We examined the biogeography of Streptomyces at regional spatial scales to identify factors that govern patterns of microbial diversity. Streptomyces are spore forming filamentous bacteria which are widespread in soil. Streptomyces strains were isolated from perennial grass habitats sampled across a spatial scale of more than 6,000 km. Previous analysis of this geographically explicit culture collection provided evidence for a latitudinal diversity gradient in Streptomyces species. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that this latitudinal diversity gradient is a result of evolutionary dynamics associated with historical demographic processes. Historical demographic phenomena have genetic consequences that can be evaluated through analysis of population genetics. We applied population genetic approaches to analyze population structure in six of the most numerically abundant and geographically widespread Streptomyces phylogroups from our culture collection. Streptomyces population structure varied at regional spatial scales and allelic diversity correlated with geographic distance. In addition, allelic diversity and gene flow are partitioned by latitude. Finally, we found that nucleotide diversity within phylogroups is negatively correlated with latitude. These results indicate that phylogroup diversification is constrained by dispersal limitation at regional spatial scales and they are consistent with the hypothesis that historical demographic processes have influenced the contemporary biogeography of Streptomyces.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementWe provide the first population genetic evidence that patterns of Streptomyces biogeography, which manifest in geographically explicit patterns of gene flow and a latitudinal gradient of nucleotide diversity, result from dispersal limitation and regional diversification due to drift. This contribution elucidates evolutionary processes that underlie patterns of microbial biogeography.",

Genes, however, can exhibit varying levels of cell-type specificity in their expression, and their coordinated expression manifests in tissue-specific function and pathology. Tissue-specific/ selective interaction mechanisms have significant applications in drug discovery, as they are more likely to reveal drug targets. Furthermore, tissue-specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are significantly implicated in human disease, including cancers. Finally, disease genes and protein complexes have the tendency to be differentially expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology. These observations motivate the construction of refined tissue-specific interactomes from organism-specific interactomes.\\n\\nResultsWe present a novel technique for constructing human tissue-specific interactomes. Using a variety of validation tests (ESEA, GO Enrichment, Disease-Gene Subnetwork Compactness), we show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state of the art techniques. Finally, using case studies of Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, we show that tissue-specific interactomes derived from our study can be used to construct pathways implicated in pathology and demonstrate the use of these pathways in identifying novel targets.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/mohammas/projects/ActPro.html",

    "abstract": "In theory, sensory perception should be more accurate when more neurons contribute to the representation of a stimulus. However, psychophysical experiments that use larger stimuli to activate larger pools of neurons sometimes report impoverished perceptual performance. To determine the neural mechanisms underlying these paradoxical findings, we trained monkeys to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli that varied in size across trials, while simultaneously recording from populations of motion-sensitive neurons in cortical area MT. We used the resulting data to constrain a computational model that explained the behavioral data as an interaction of three main mechanisms: noise correlations, which prevented stimulus information from growing with stimulus size; neural surround suppression, which decreased sensitivity for large stimuli; and a read-out strategy that emphasized neurons with receptive fields near the stimulus center. These results suggest that paradoxical percepts reflect tradeoffs between sensitivity and noise in neuronal populations.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular polysaccharides are compounds secreted by microorganisms into the surrounding environment and which are important for surface attachment and maintaining structural integrity within biofilms. The social nature of many extracellular polysaccharides remains unclear, and it has been suggested that they could function as either co-operative public goods, or as traits that provide a competitive advantage. Here we empirically test the co-operative nature of the PSL polysaccharide, which is crucial for the formation of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that: (1) PSL is not metabolically costly to produce; (2) PSL provides population level benefits in biofilms, for both growth and antibiotic tolerance; (3) the benefits of PSL production are social and are shared with other cells; (4) the benefits of PSL production appear to be preferentially directed towards cells which produce PSL; (5) cells which do not produce PSL are unable to successfully exploit cells which produce PSL. Taken together, this suggests that PSL is a social but relatively non-exploitable trait, and that growth within biofilms selects for PSL-producing strains, even when multiple strains can interact (low relatedness).",

    "abstract": "Highly diverse phenotypic traits are often encoded by clusters of gene paralogs that are physically linked on chromosomes. Examples include olfactory receptor gene clusters involved in the recognition of diverse odors, defensin and phospholipase gene clusters involved in snake venoms, and Hox gene clusters involved in morphological diversity. Historically, gene clusters have been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several paralogs, however, their genomic arrangements are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. For example, the prolactin gene cluster shows variation in paralogous gene number, order and intergenic distance across mammals, whereas animal Hox gene clusters are often broken into sub-clusters of different sizes. A lack of formal definition for clusters of gene paralogs does not only hamper the study of their evolutionary dynamics, but also the discovery of novel ones in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CGPFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of clusters of gene paralogs (CGPs) by examining the physical distribution of individual gene members of families of paralogous genes across chromosomes. Application of CGPFinder to diverse mammalian genomes accurately identified CGPs for many well-known gene clusters in the human and mouse genomes (e.g., Hox, protocadherin, Siglec, and beta-globin gene clusters) as well as for 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences were due to the exclusion of non-homologous genes that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of one or more genes between the CGPs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CGPs. Finally, examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CGPFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450, aquaporins, and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating the identification of CGPs and of genes that are members of CGPs, CGPFinder will facilitate furthering our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of genomic neighborhoods containing CGPs, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.",

The model includes three key mechanotransducers: mechanosensing ion channels, integrins and G-protein-coupled receptors. The reaction cascade consists of two interconnected parts. The first is rapid activation of calcium, which results in formation of calcium-calmodulin complexes, followed by recruitment of eNOS from caveolae. The second is phosphoryaltion of eNOS by protein kinases PKC and AKT. The model also includes a negative feedback loop due to inhibition of calcium influx into the cell by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In this feedback, increased nitric oxide (NO) levels cause an increase in cGMP levels, so that cGMP inhibition of calcium influx can limit NO production. The model was used to predict the dynamics of NO production by an EC subjected to a step increase of WSS from zero to a finite physiologically relevant value. Among several experimentally observed features, the model predicts a highly nonlinear, bipha-sic transient behavior of eNOS activation and NO production: a rapid initial activation due to the very rapid influx of calcium into the cytosol (occurring within 1 to 5 minutes) is followed by a sustained period of activation due to protein kinases.\\n\\nAcronymsAKT, protein kinase B; [Ca2+]c, [Ca2+]s, [Ca2+]e and [Ca2+]b, cytosolic, stored, external and buffer concentrations of calcium ions, respectively; Ca3-CaM and Ca4-CaM, calcium-calmodulin complexes with 3 and 4 calcium ions bound to CaM, respectively; CaM, calmodulin; CCE, capacitative calcium entry; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; EC, endothelial cell; ECM, extracellular matrix; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; eNOScav, eNOS bound to caveolin; eNOS*, eNOS-CaM complex phosphorylated at Ser-1197; eNOS0, caveolin-bound eNOS phosphorylated at Thr-495; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; G, active G proteins; Gt, total G proteins; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptors; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; IP3, inositol triphosphate; L-Arg, L-form of arginine; MSIC, mechanosensing ion channel; NO, nitric oxide; O2, oxygen; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phos-phatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases; PKC, protein kinase C; RBC, red blood cell; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; WSS, wall shear stress",

Numerous studies have investigated epigenetic gene regulation but there are limited studies on how the epigenetic landscape and the presence of pathogens influence the evolution of host traits. Here we formulate a multistable decision-switch model involving many possible phenotypes with the antagonistic influence of parasitism. As expected, pathogens can drive dominant (common) phenotypes to become inferior, such as through negative frequency-dependent selection. Furthermore, novel predictions of our model show that parasitism can steer the dynamics of phenotype specification from multistable equilibrium convergence to oscillations. This oscillatory behavior could explain pathogen-mediated epimutations and excessive phenotypic plasticity. The Red Queen dynamics also occur in certain parameter space of the model, which demonstrates winnerless cyclic phenotype-switching in hosts and in pathogens. The results of our simulations elucidate how epigenetic landscape is associated with the phenotypic fitness landscape and how parasitism facilitates non-genetic phenotypic diversity.",

In this study, we devised two novel metrics, Cohort Coverage Sparseness (CCS) and Unevenness (UE) Scores for a detailed assessment of the distribution of coverage of sequence reads. Employing these metrics we revealed non-uniformity of coverage and low coverage regions in the WES data generated by three different platforms. This non-uniformity of coverage is both local (coverage of a given exon across different platforms) and global (coverage of all exons across the genome in the given platform). The low coverage regions encompassing functionally important genes were often associated with high GC content, repeat elements and segmental duplications.

    "abstract": "There are many examples of adaptive molecular evolution in natural populations, but there is no existing method to verify which phenotypic changes were directly targeted by selection. The problem is that correlations between traits make it difficult to distinguish between direct and indirect selection. A phenotype is a direct target of selection when that trait in particular was shaped by selection to better perform a function. An indirect target of selection, also known as an evolutionary spandrel, is a phenotype that changes only because it is correlated with another trait under direct selection. Studies that mutate genes and examine the phenotypic consequences are increasingly common, and these experiments could estimate the mutational accessibility of the phenotypic changes that arise during an instance of adaptive molecular evolution. Under indirect selection, we expect phenotypes to evolve toward states that are more accessible by mutation. Deviation from this null expectation (evolution toward a phenotypic state rarely produced by mutation) would be compelling evidence of adaptation, and could be used to distinguish direct selection from indirect selection on correlated traits. To be practical, this molecular test of adaptation requires phenotypic differences that are caused by changes in a small number of genes. These kinds of genetically simple traits have been observed in many empirical studies of adaptive evolution. Here we describe how to use mutational accessibility to separate spandrels from direct targets of selection and thus verify adaptive hypotheses for phenotypes that evolve by adaptive molecular changes at one or a few genes.",

    "abstract": "The effective population size (Ne) is a major factor determining allele frequency changes in natural and experimental populations. Temporal methods provide a powerful and simple approach to estimate short-term Ne. They use allele frequency shifts between temporal samples to calculate the standardized variance, which is directly related to Ne. Here we focus on experimental evolution studies that often rely on repeated sequencing of samples in pools (Pool-Seq). Pool-Seq is cost-effective and outperforms individual-based sequencing in estimating allele frequencies, but it is associated with atypical sampling properties: additional to sampling individuals, sequencing DNA in pools leads to a second round of sampling increasing the estimated allele frequency variance. We propose a new estimator of Ne, which relies on allele frequency changes in temporal data and corrects for the variance in both sampling steps. In simulations, we obtain accurate Ne estimates, as long as the drift variance is not too small compared to the sampling and sequencing variance. In addition to genome-wide Ne estimates, we extend our method using a recursive partitioning approach to estimate Ne locally along the chromosome. Since type I error is accounted for, our method permits the identification of genomic regions that differ significantly in Ne. We present an application to Pool-Seq data from experimental evolution with Drosophila, and provide recommendations for whole-genome data.

To facilitate research in membrane dynamics, especially in fields where roles for ion channels are just beginning to be quantified, we must make these models easy to understand.\\n\\nHere, we show that the membrane differential equation central to conductance models can be understood using simple circular geometry.

Every feature of a membrane state diagram corresponds to a physiological variable, so that insight taken from a diagram can be translated back to the underlying model. The construction is elementary: we convert conductances to angles subtended on the circle and potentials to radii; currents are then areas of the enclosed annular sectors.\\n\\nOur method clarifies a powerful but prohibitive modeling approach and has the potential for widespread use in both electrophysiological research and pedagogy.

    "abstract": "We describe a new, highly accurate statistical method that computes the abundance of species in DNA sequences from a metagenomics sample. Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification with KrakEN) uses the taxonomy labels assigned by Kraken, a highly accurate metagenomics classification algorithm, to estimate the number of reads originating from each species present in a sample. Kraken classifies reads to the best matching location in the taxonomic tree, but does not estimate abundances of species. We use the Kraken database itself to derive probabilities that describe how much sequence from each genome is shared with other genomes in the database, and combine this information with the assignments for a particular sample to estimate abundance at the species level, the genus level, or above. Combined with the Kraken classifier, Bracken produces accurate species-and genus-level abundance estimates even when a sample contains multiple near-identical species.",

    "abstract": "Simple visual features, such as orientation, are thought to be represented in the spiking of visual neurons using population codes. I show that optimal decoding of such activity predicts characteristic deviations from the normal distribution of errors at low gains. Examining human perception of orientation stimuli, I show that these predicted deviations are present at near-threshold levels of contrast. The findings may provide a neural-level explanation for the appearance of a threshold in perceptual awareness, whereby stimuli are categorized as seen or unseen. As well as varying in error magnitude, perceptual judgments differ in certainty about what was observed. I demonstrate that variations in the total spiking activity of a neural population can account for the empirical relationship between subjective confidence and precision. These results establish population coding and decoding as the neural basis of perception and perceptual confidence.",

Availability of genome-wide expression data from different studies on septic shock empowers the quest for hitherto unidentified pathways by integration and meta-analysis of multiple data sets. Electronic search was performed on medical literature and gene expression databases. Selection of studies was based on the organism (human subjects), tissue of origin (circulating leukocytes) and the platform technology (gene expression microarray). Gene-level meta-analysis was conducted on the six selected studies to identify the genes consistently differentially expressed in septic shock. These genes were then subjected to pathway analysis. The identified up-regulated pathway hsa04380 (Osteoclast Differentiation) was validated in an independent cohort of patients. A simplified model was generated showing the major gene-modules dysregulated in SS.",

    "abstract": "Gene products or pathways that are aberrantly activated in cancer but not in normal tissue hold great promises for being effective and safe anticancer therapeutic targets. Many targeted drugs have entered clinical trials but so far showed limited efficacy mostly due to variability in treatment responses and often rapidly emerging resistance. Towards more effective treatment options, we will critically need multi-targeted drugs or drug combinations, which selectively inhibit the cancer cells and block distinct escape mechanisms for the cells to become resistant. Functional profiling of drug combinations requires careful experimental design and robust data analysis approaches. At the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), we have developed an experimental-computational pipeline for high-throughput screening of drug combination effects in cancer cells. The integration of automated screening techniques with advanced synergy scoring tools allows for efficient and reliable detection of synergistic drug interactions within a specific window of concentrations, hence accelerating the identification of potential drug combinations for further confirmatory studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMost molecular phylogenetic trees depict the relative closeness or the extent of similarity among a set of taxa based on comparison of sequences of homologous genes or proteins. Since the tree topology for individual monogenic traits varies among the same set of organisms and does not overlap taxonomic hierarchy, hence there is a need to generate multidimensional phylogenetic trees.\\n\\nResultsPhylogenetic trees were constructed for 119 prokaryotes representing 2 phyla under Archaea and 11 phyla under Bacteria after comparing multiple sequence alignments for 15 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase polypeptides. The topology of Neighbor Joining (NJ) trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides varied substantially. We use Euclidean geometry to estimate all-pairs distances in order to construct phylogenetic trees. Further, we used a novel \\\"Taxonomic fidelity\\\" algorithm to estimate clade by clade similarity between the phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic tree. We find that, as compared to trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides and rDNA sequences, the topology of our Euclidean tree and that for aligned and concatenated sequences of 15 proteins are closer to the taxonomic trees and offer the best consensus. We have also aligned sequences after concatenation, and find that by changing the order of sequence joining prior to alignment, the tree topologies vary. In contrast, changing the types of polypeptides in the grouping for Euclidean trees does not affect the tree topologies.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that a consensus phylogenetic tree of 15 polypeptides from 14 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for 119 prokaryotes using Euclidean geometry exhibits better taxonomic fidelity than trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides as well as 16S rDNA. We have also examined Euclidean N-dimensional trees for 15 tRNA synthetase polypeptides which give the same topology as that constructed after amalgamating 3-dimensional Euclidean trees for groups of 3 polypeptides. Euclidean N-dimensional trees offer a reliable future to multi-genic molecular phylogenetics.",

    "abstract": "The maximum intrinsic rate of population increase rmax is a commonly estimated demographic parameter used in assessments of extinction risk. In teleosts, rmax can be calculated using an estimate of spawners per spawner, but for chondrichthyans, most studies have used annual reproductive output b instead. This is problematic as it effectively assumes all juveniles survive to maturity. Here, we propose an updated rmax equation that uses a simple mortality estimator which also accounts for survival to maturity: the reciprocal of average lifespan. For 94 chondrichthyans, we now estimate that rmax values are on average 10% lower than previously published. Our updated rmax estimates are lower than previously published for species that mature later relative to maximum age and those with high annual fecundity. The most extreme discrepancies in rmax values occur in species with low age at maturity and low annual reproductive output. Our results indicate that chondrichthyans that mature relatively later in life, and to a lesser extent those that are highly fecund, are less resilient to fishing than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions depend on coordinated patterns of neural activity cascading across the brain, running in time from stimulus to response and in space from primary sensory regions to the frontal lobe. Measuring this cascade and how it flows through the brain is key to developing an understanding of how our brains function. However observing, let alone understanding, this cascade, particularly in humans, is challenging. Here, we report a significant methodological advance allowing this observation in humans at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. We use a novel encoding model to link simultaneously measured electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to infer the high-resolution spatiotemporal brain dynamics taking place during rapid visual perceptual decision-making. After demonstrating the methodology replicates past results, we show that it uncovers a previously unobserved sequential reactivation of a substantial fraction of the pre-response network whose magnitude correlates with decision confidence. Our results illustrate that a temporally coordinated and spatially distributed neural cascade underlies perceptual decision-making, with our methodology illuminating complex brain dynamics that would otherwise be unobservable using conventional fMRI or EEG separately. We expect this methodology to be useful in observing brain dynamics in a wide range of other mental processes.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings from molecular genetics now make it possible to test directly for natural selection by analyzing whether genetic variants associated with various phenotypes have been under selection. I leverage these findings to construct polygenic scores that use individuals' genotypes to predict their body mass index, educational attainment (EA), glucose concentration, height, schizophrenia, total cholesterol, and (in females) age at menarche. I then examine associations between these scores and fitness to test whether natural selection has been occurring. My study sample includes individuals of European ancestry born between 1931 and 1953 in the Health and Retirement Study, a representative study of the US population. My results imply that natural selection has been slowly favoring lower EA in both females and males, and are suggestive that natural selection may have favored a higher age at menarche in females. For EA, my estimates imply a rate of selection of about -1.5 months of education per generation (which pales in comparison with the increases in EA observed in contemporary times). Though they cannot be projected over more than one generation, my results provide additional evidence that humans are still evolving--albeit slowly, especially when compared to the rapid secular changes that have occurred over the past few generations due to cultural and environmental factors.",
