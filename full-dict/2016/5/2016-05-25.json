    "abstract": "Measures of population differentiation, such as FST, are traditionally derived from the partition of diversity within and between populations. However, the emergence of population clusters from multilocus analysis is a function of genetic structure (departures from panmixia) rather than of diversity. If the populations are close to panmixia, slight differences between the mean pairwise distance within and between populations (low FST) can manifest as strong separation between the populations, thus population clusters are often evident even when the vast majority of diversity is partitioned within populations rather than between them. For any given FST value, clusters can be tighter (more panmictic) or looser (more stratified), and in this respect higher FST does not always imply stronger differentiation. In this study we propose a measure for the partition of structure, denoted EST, which is more consistent with results from clustering schemes. Crucially, our measure is based on a statistic of the data that is a good measure of internal structure, mimicking the information extracted by unsupervised clustering or dimensionality reduction schemes. To assess the utility of our metric, we ranked various human (HGDP) population pairs based on FST and EST and found substantial differences in ranking order. In some cases examined, most notably among isolated Amazonian tribes, EST ranking seems more consistent with demographic, phylogeographic and linguistic measures of classification compared to FST. Thus, EST may at times outperform FST in identifying evolutionary significant differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) can provide material for evolutionary innovation. Assembly of large, outbred eukaryotic genomes can be difficult, but structural rearrangements within such taxa can be investigated using linkage maps. RAD sequencing provides unprecedented ability to generate high-density linkage maps for non-model species, but can result in low numbers of homologous markers between species due to phylogenetic distance or differences in library preparation. Family Salmonidae is ideal for studying the effects of WGD as the ancestral salmonid underwent WGD relatively recently, around 65 million years ago, then rediploidized and diversified. Extensive synteny between orthologous chromosomes occurs in extant salmonids, but each species has both conserved and unique chromosome arm fusions and fissions. Here we generate a high-density linkage map (3826 markers) for the Salvelinus genera (Brook Charr S. fontinalis), and then identify orthologous chromosome arms among the other available salmonid high-density linkage maps, including six species of Oncorhynchus, and one species for each of Salmo and Coregonus, as well as the sister group for the salmonids, Esox lucius for homeolog designation. To this end, we developed O_SCPCAPMC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWAPC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAPCC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWOMPC_SCPLOW, a program that identifies identical and proximal markers between linkage maps using a reference genome of a related species as an intermediate. This approach increases the number of comparable markers between linkage maps by 5-fold, enabling a characterization of the most likely history of retained chromosomal rearrangements post-WGD, and identifying several conserved chromosomal inversions. Analyses of RADseq-based linkage maps from other taxa will also benefit from O_SCPCAPMC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWAPC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAPCC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWOMPC_SCPLOW, available at: https://github.com/enormandeau/mapcomp/",

    "abstract": "A long-standing hypothesis asserts that plant-feeding insects specialize on particular host plants because of negative interactions (trade-offs) between adaptations to alternative hosts, yet empirical evidence for such trade-offs is scarce. Most studies have looked for microevolutionary performance trade-offs within insect species, but host-use could also be constrained by macroevolutionary trade-offs caused by epistasis and historical contingency. On the other hand, evolutionary interactions between adaptations to diverse hosts could be neutral or positive rather than negative. Here we used a phylogenetic approach to estimate the micro-and macroevolutionary correlations between use of alternative host plants within two major orders of plant-feeding insects: Lepidoptera (caterpillars) and Hemiptera (true bugs). Across 1604 caterpillar species, we found both positive and negative pairwise correlations between use of diverse host taxa, with overall network patterns suggesting that different host-use constraints act over micro-and macroevolutionary timescales. In contrast, host-use patterns of 955 true bug species revealed uniformly positive correlations between presence on the same host taxa over both timescales. The lack of consistent patterns across timescales and insect orders indicates that host-use trade-offs are historically contingent rather than universal constraints. Moreover, we observed few negative correlations overall despite the wide taxonomic and ecological diversity of the focal host taxa, suggesting that positive interactions between host-use adaptations, not trade-offs, dominate the long-term evolution of host use in plant-feeding insects.",

I show that optimal decoding of such activity predicts characteristic deviations from the normal distribution of errors at low gains. Examining human perception of orientation stimuli, I show that these predicted deviations are present at near-threshold levels of contrast. The findings may provide a neural-level explanation for the appearance of a threshold in perceptual awareness, whereby stimuli are categorized as seen or unseen. As well as varying in error magnitude, perceptual judgments differ in certainty about what was observed. I demonstrate that variations in the total spiking activity of a neural population can account for the empirical relationship between subjective confidence and precision. These results establish population coding and decoding as the neural basis of perception and perceptual confidence.",

    "abstract": "Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid, accurate and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers. The system uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized specifically for the metagenomic classification problem. Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (4.2 GB for 4,078 bacterial and 200 archaeal genomes) and classifies sequences at very high speed, allowing it to process the millions of reads from a typical high-throughput DNA sequencing run within a few minutes. Together these advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers. Because of its space-optimized indexing schemes, Centrifuge also makes it possible to index the entire NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequence database (a total of 109 billion bases) with an index size of 69 GB, in contrast to k-mer based indexing schemes, which require far more extensive space. Centrifuge is available as free, open-source software from www.ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe evolution of gene body methylation (gbM), its origins and its functional consequences are poorly understood. By pairing the largest collection of transcriptomes (>1000) and methylomes (77) across Viridiplantae we provide novel insights into the evolution of gbM and its relationship to CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) proteins.\\n\\nResultsCMTs are evolutionary conserved DNA methyltransferases in Viridiplantae. Duplication events gave rise to what are now referred to as CMT1, 2 and 3. Independent losses of CMT1, 2 and 3 in eudicots, CMT2 and ZMET in monocots and monocots/commelinids, variation in copy number and non-neutral evolution suggests overlapping or fluid functional evolution of this gene family. DNA methylation within genes is widespread and is found in all major taxonomic groups of Viridiplantae investigated. Genes enriched with methylated CGs (mCG) were also identified in species sister to angiosperms. The proportion of genes and DNA methylation patterns associated with gbM are restricted to angiosperms with a functional CMT3 or ortholog. However, mCG-enriched genes in the gymnosperm Pinus taeda shared some similarities with gbM genes in Amborella trichopoda. Additionally, gymnosperms and ferns share a CMT homolog closely related to CMT2 and 3. Hence, the dependency of gbM on a CMT most likely extends to all angiosperms and possibly gymnosperms and ferns.\\n\\nConclusionsThe resulting gene family phylogeny of CMT transcripts from the most diverse sampling of plants to date redefines our understanding of CMT evolution and its evolutionary consequences on DNA methylation. Future, functional tests of homologous and paralogous CMTs will uncover novel roles and consequences to the epigenome.",

    "abstract": "Often the time-derivative of a measured variable is of as much interest as the variable itself. For a growing population of biological cells, for example, the population's growth rate is typically more important than its size. Here we introduce a non-parametric method to infer first and second time-derivatives as a function of time from time-series data. Our approach is based on established properties of Gaussian processes and therefore applies to a wide range of data. In tests, the method is at least as accurate as others, but has several advantages: it estimates errors both in the inference and in any summary statistics, such as lag times, allows interpolation with the corresponding error estimation, and can be applied to any number of experimental replicates. As illustrations, we infer growth rate from measurements of the optical density of populations of microbial cells and estimate the rate of in vitro assembly of an amyloid fibril and both the speed and acceleration of two separating spindle pole bodies in a single yeast cell. Being accessible through both a GUI and from scripts, our algorithm should have broad application across the sciences.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus infection was declared a public health emergency of international concern in February 2016 in response to the outbreak in Brazil and its suspected link with congenital anomalies. In this study we use notification data and disease natural history parameters to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of Zika in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We also obtain estimates of R0 of dengue from time series of dengue cases in the outbreaks registered in 2002 and 2012 in the city, when DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes respectively, had just emerged. Our estimates of the basic reproduction number for Zika in Rio de Janeiro based on surveillance notifications (R0 = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.97 - 2.97) were higher than those obtained for dengue in the city (year 2002: R0 = 1.70 [1.50 - 2.02]; year 2012: Ro = 1.25 [1.18 - 1.36]). Given the role of Aedes aegypti as vector of both the Zika and dengue viruses, we also derive Ro of Zika as a function of both dengue reproduction number and entomological and epidemiological parameters for dengue and Zika. Using the dengue outbreaks from previous years allowed us to estimate the potential R0 of Zika. Our estimates were closely in agreement with our first Zikas R0 estimation from notification data. Hence, these results validate deriving the potential risk of Zika transmission in areas with recurring dengue outbreaks. Whether transmission routes other than vector-based can sustain a Zika epidemic still deserves attention, but our results suggest that the Zika outbreak in Rio de Janeiro emerged due to population susceptibility and ubiquitous presence of Ae. aegypti.",

We identified a correlation between body mass and sequence divergence for the motor domain of three adult myosin II isoforms ({beta}, 2A, 2B) suggesting that these isoforms have adapted to increasing body mass. In contrast the non-muscle and developmental isoforms show no correlation of sequence divergence with body mass, while the sarcomeric myosin 7b, extraocular and 2X isoforms showed a divergence intermediate between these two groups. The 2B and {beta}-myosin motor domain showed the greatest rate of sequence divergence (-0.84 and -0.69 % per ten-fold increase in mass respectively). {beta}-myosin is abundant in cardiac ventricle and slow skeletal muscle.

Because the genetic basis of polyphenism switches has only begun to be understood, how their mechanisms arise is unclear. In the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which has a mouthpart polyphenism specialized for alternative diets, a gene (eud-1) executing the polyphenism switch was recently identified as the product of lineage-specific duplications. Here we infer the role of gene duplications in producing a switch gene. Using reverse genetics and population genetic analyses, we examine evidence for competing scenarios of degeneration and complementation, neutral evolution, and functional specialization. Of the daughter genes, eud-1 alone has assumed switch-like regulation of the mouth polyphenism. Measurements of life-history traits in single, double, and triple sulfatase mutants did not, given modest sample sizes and a benign environment, identify alternative or complementary roles for eud-1 paralogs. Although possible roles are still unknown, selection analyses of the sister species and 104 natural isolates of P. pacificus detected purifying selection on the genes, suggesting their functionality by their fixation and evolutionary maintenance. Our approach shows the tractability of reverse genetics in a non-traditional model system to study evolution by gene duplication.",

    "abstract": "Most hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and suffer limited treatment options. Challenges in early stage diagnosis may be due to the genetic complexity of HCC. Gene fusion plays a critical function in tumorigenesis and cancer progression in multiple cancers, yet the identities of fusion genes as potential diagnostic markers in HCC have not been investigated.Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on noncancerous and cancerous lesions in two representative HBV-HCC patients. Potential fusion genes were identified by STAR-Fusion in STAR software and validated by four publicly available RNA-seq datasets. Fourteen pairs of frozen HBV-related HCC samples and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues were examined by RT-PCR analysis for gene fusion expression.We identified 2,354 different gene fusions in the two HBV-HCC patients. Validation analysis against the four RNA-seq datasets revealed only 1.8% (43/2,354) as recurrent fusions that were supported by public datasets. Comparison with four fusion databases demonstrated that three (HLA-DPB2-HLA-DRB1, CDH23-HLA-DPB1, and C15orf57-CBX3) out of 43 recurrent gene fusions were annotated as disease-related fusion events. Nineteen were novel recurrent fusions not previously annotated to diseases, including DCUN1D3-GSG1L and SERPINA5-SERPINA9. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing of 14 pairs of HBV-related HCC samples confirmed expression of six of the new fusions, including RP11-476K15.1-CTD-2015H3.2.Our study provides new insights into gene fusions in HCC and could contribute to the development of anti-HCC therapy. RP11-476K15.1-CTD-2015H3.2 may serve as a new therapeutic biomarker in HCC.",

Contrary to the expectation of associative models, the high prior rate of reward for F did not disrupt learning of the entire list. Monkeys (who each completed many sessions) learned to anticipate that novel stimuli should be preferred over F. We interpret this as evidence of a general task representation of TI that generalizes beyond learning about specific stimuli. Humans (who were task-naive) showed a transitory bias to F when it was paired with novel stimuli, but very rapidly unlearned that bias. Performance with respect to the remaining stimuli was consistent with past reports of TI in both species. These results are difficult to reconcile with any account that seeks to assign the strength of association between individual stimuli and rewards. Instead, they support both sophisticated cognitive processes in both species, albeit with some species differences.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 522 open access human iPSCs derived from 189 healthy male and female individuals as part of the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci:http://www.hipsci.org). Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability for use in genetic studies of complex human traits and cancer. Using a combination of genomewide analyses we find that 5-25% of the variation in different iPSC phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences betweenindividuals. We also assess the phenotypic effects of rare, genomic copy number mutations that are recurrently seen following iPSC reprogramming and present an initial map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of pluripotent cells in humans.",

    "abstract": "Methylation in the human genome is known to be associated with development and disease. The Illumina Infinium methylation arrays are by far the most common way to interrogate methylation across the human genome. This paper provides a Bioconductor workflow using multiple packages for the analysis of methylation array data. Specifically, we demonstrate the steps involved in a typical differential methylation analysis pipeline including: quality control, filtering, normalization, data exploration and statistical testing for probe-wise differential methylation. We further outline other analyses such as differential methylation of regions, differential variability analysis, estimating cell type composition and gene ontology testing. Finally, we provide some examples of how to visualise methylation array data.",
