    "abstract": "Mutation rate varies along the human genome, and part of this variation is explainable by measurable local properties of the DNA molecule. Moreover, mutation rates differ between orthologous genomic regions of different species, but the drivers of this change are unclear. Here, we compare the local mutation rates of several species. We show that these rates are very similar between human and apes, implying that their variation has a strong underlying cryptic component not explainable by the known genomic features. Mutation rates become progressively less similar in more distant species, and these changes are partially explainable by changes in the local genomic features of orthologous regions, most importantly, in the recombination rate. However, they are much more rapid, implying that the cryptic component underlying the mutation rate is more ephemeral than the known genomic features. These findings shed light on the determinants of mutation rate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and Cyclin E are key players in cell proliferation and development. Hyperactivation of hh and cyclin E. has been linked to several types of cancer. However, transcriptional regulation of hh and cyclin E. are not well understood. Here we show that an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor Apontic (Apt) is an activator of hh and cyclin E. in Drosophila. Apt directly promotes the expression of hh and cyclin E. through its binding site in the promoter regions of hh and cyclin E. during wing development. This Apt-dependent proper expression of hh and cyclin E. is required for cell proliferation and development of the wing. Apt-mediated expression of hh and cyclin E. can direct proliferation of Hh-expressing cells and simultaneous growth, patterning and differentiation of Hh-recipient cells. The discovery of the coordinated expression of Hh and principal cell-cycle regulator Cyclin E. by Apt implicates insight into the mechanism by which deregulated hh and cyclin E promotes tumor formation.\\n\\nSummary statementWe identified a novel role for Apontic as an important common regulator of the transcription of hedgehog and cyclin E. Our study provides important insights into the mechanism of organ development.",

    "abstract": "Genome assemblies obtained from short read sequencing technologies are often fragmented into many contigs because of the abundance of repetitive sequences. Long read sequencing technologies allow the generation of reads spanning most repeat sequences, providing the opportunity to complete these genome assemblies. However, substantial amounts of sequence data and computational resources are required to overcome the high per-base error rate inherent to these technologies. Furthermore, most existing methods only assemble the genomes after sequencing has completed which could result in either generation of more sequence data at greater cost than required or a low-quality assembly if insufficient data are generated. Here we present the first computational method which utilises real-time nanopore sequencing to scaffold and complete short-read assemblies while the long read sequence data is being generated. The method reports the progress of completing the assembly in real-time so users can terminate the sequencing once an assembly of sufficient quality and completeness is obtained. We use our method to complete four bacterial genomes and one eukaryotic genome, and show that it is able to construct more complete and more accurate assemblies, and at the same time, requires less sequencing data and computational resources than existing pipelines. We also demonstrate that the method can facilitate real-time analyses of positional information such as identification of bacterial genes encoded in plasmids and pathogenicity islands.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the binding affinity between MHC proteins and their peptide ligands is a key problem in computational immunology. State of the art performance is currently achieved by the allele-specific predictor NetMHC and the pan-allele predictor NetMHCpan, both of which are ensembles of shallow neural networks. We explore an intermediate between allele-specific and pan-allele prediction: training allele-specific predictors with synthetic samples generated by imputation of the peptide-MHC affinity matrix. We find that the imputation strategy is useful on alleles with very little training data. We have implemented our predictor as an open-source software package called MHCflurry and show that MHCflurry achieves competitive performance to NetMHC and NetMHCpan.",

Our methodology based on a kinematic analysis of cell lineage data reveals deformation patterns and quantitative morphogenetic landmarks for a new type of developmental table. The characteristic spatial and temporal length scales of mechanical deformation patterns derived from a continuous approximation of cell displacements indicate a compressible fluid-like behavior of zebrafish gastrulating tissues. The instantaneous deformation rate at the mesoscopic level of the cells neighborhood is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The robustness of mechanical patterns results from their cumulative history along cell trajectories. Unsupervised classification of mechanical descriptor profiles was used to assess the homogeneity of biomechanical cues in cell populations. Further clustering of cell trajectories according to their cumulative mesoscopic biomechanical history during gastrulation revealed ordered and coherent spatiotemporal patterns comparable to that of the embryonic fate map.",

    "abstract": "Metagenome shotgun sequencing presents opportunities to identify organisms that may prevent or promote disease. The analysis of sample diversity is achieved by taxonomic identification of metagenomic reads followed by generating an abundance profile. Numerous tools have been developed based on different design principles. Tools achieving high precision can lack sensitivity in some applications. Conversely, tools with high sensitivity can suffer from low precision and require long computation time. In this paper, we present WEVOTE (WEighted VOting Taxonomic idEntification), a method that classifies metagenome shotgun sequencing DNA reads based on an ensemble of existing methods using k-mer-based, marker-based, and naive-similarity based approaches. Our evaluation on fourteen benchmarking datasets shows that WEVOTE improves the classification precision by reducing false positive annotations while preserving a high level of sensitivity. WEVOTE is an efficient and automated tool that combines multiple individual taxonomic identification methods to produce more precise and sensitive microbial profiles. WEVOTE is developed primarily to identify reads generated by MetaGenome Shotgun sequencing. It is expandable and has the potential to incorporate additional tools to produce a more accurate taxonomic profile. WEVOTE was implemented using C++ and shell scripting and is available at www.bitbucket.org/ametwally/wevote",

    "abstract": "Policing is a widespread mechanism regulating cooperation in both human and animal social groups. Policing can promote the evolution and maintenance of cooperation among non-relatives by tying the reproductive success of individuals to the efficiency and success of the group. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of reproductive policing using a multi-scale computational model inspired by the copy number control system of conjugative bacterial plasmids. Our results show that the repression of competition through policing can evolve across a very broad range of migration (plasmid conjugation) rates, improving system-level performance and bringing efficiency gains to the group beyond those achievable by pure self-restraint. Reproductive policing acts to increase genetic relatedness by reducing variation in group size which, in turn, reduces the heterogeneity of the plasmid population. When among-group migration is high, coercive policing strategies are favoured, characterized by high levels of policing coupled with relatively lower obedience. Coercive policing strategies preferentially limit the reproduction of rival lineages while, at the same time, maintaining effective collective reproductive control.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe emergence and maintenance of cooperation is a topic of great importance in evolutionary biology. The evolution of cooperation has been explained in the context of kin selection when there is sufficient genetic relatedness among interacting individuals. When there is insufficient relatedness, the presence of alternative mechanisms, such as mutual policing, can promote the evolution and maintenance of cooperation by tying the reproductive success of individual to the efficiency and success of the group. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of reproductive policing using an agent-based computational model inspired by a simple and elegant biological example: replication control among conjugative plasmids, a class of molecular symbionts of bacterial hosts. Our results show that the repression of competition through policing evolves and improves plasmid group performance beyond levels achievable by self-restraint, across a very broad range of migration rates. Under conditions of high migration (frequent conjugation), we observe the evolution of coercive policing strategies that limit the reproduction of rival lineages by investing disproportionately in policing relative to their obedience to the policing trait.",

    "abstract": "Using CRISPR/Cas9, diverse genomic elements may be studied in their endogenous context. Pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) are used to delete regulatory elements and small RNA genes, while longer RNAs can be silenced through promoter deletion. We here present CRISPETa, a bioinformatic pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgRNA design based on an empirical scoring model. Multiple sgRNA pairs are returned for each target. Any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel, making CRISPETa equally appropriate for studies of individual elements, or complex library screens. Fast run-times are achieved using a precomputed off-target database. sgRNA pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering. We present a series of pre-designed, high-coverage library designs for entire classes of non-coding elements in human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila and C. elegans. Using an improved version of the DECKO deletion vector, together with a quantitative deletion assay, we test CRISPETa designs by deleting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the MALAT1 oncogene. These achieve efficiencies of [&ge;]50%, resulting in production of mutant RNA. CRISPETa will be useful for researchers seeking to harness CRISPR for targeted genomic deletion, in a variety of model organisms, from single-target to high-throughput scales.",
