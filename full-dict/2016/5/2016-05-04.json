    "abstract": "Autophagy is a conserved cellular degradation pathway wherein a double membrane vesicle, called as an autophagosome captures longlived proteins, damaged or superfluous organelles and delivers to the lysosome for degradation1. We have identified a novel role for septins in autophagy. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that localize at the bud-neck and are involved in cytokinesis in budding yeast2. We show that septins under autophagy prevalent conditions are majorly localized to the cytoplasm in the form of punctate structures. Further, we report that septins not only localize to pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) but also to autophagosomes in the form of punctate structures. Interestingly, septins also form small non-canonical rings around PAS during autophagy. Furthermore, we observed that in one of the septin Ts\\\" mutant, cdc10-5, the anterograde trafficking of Atg9 was affected at the non-permissive temperature (NPT). All these results suggest a role of septins in early stages of autophagy during autophagosome formation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe identification of genomic biomarkers is a key step towards improving diagnostic tests and therapies. We present a reference-free method for this task that relies on a k-mer representation of genomes and a machine learning algorithm that produces intelligible models. The method is computationally scalable and well-suited for whole genome sequencing studies.\\n\\nResultsThe method was validated by generating models that predict the antibiotic resistance of C. difficile, M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae for 17 antibiotics. The obtained models are accurate, faithful to the biological pathways targeted by the antibiotics, and they provide insight into the process of resistance acquisition. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of the method revealed tight statistical guarantees on the accuracy of the obtained models, supporting its relevance for genomic biomarker discovery.\\n\\nConclusionsOur method allows the generation of accurate and interpretable predictive models of phenotypes, which rely on a small set of genomic variations. The method is not limited to predicting antibiotic resistance in bacteria and is applicable to a variety of organisms and phenotypes. Kover, an efficient implementation of our method, is open-source and should guide biological efforts to understand a plethora of phenotypes (http://github.com/aldro61/kover/).",

Here we analyze the effects of SVs on gene expression, quantitative traits, and intrinsic reproductive isolation in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We establish a high-quality curated catalog of SVs in the genomes of a worldwide library of S. pombe strains, including duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations. We show that copy number variants (CNVs) frequently segregate within closely related clonal populations, are weakly linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and show other genetic signals consistent with rapid turnover. These transient CNVs produce stoichiometric effects on gene expression both within and outside the duplicated regions. CNVs make substantial contributions to quantitative traits such as cell shape, cell growth under diverse conditions, sugar utilization in winemaking, whereas rearrangements are strongly associated with reproductive isolation. Collectively, these findings have broad implications for evolution and for our understanding of quantitative traits including complex human diseases.",

    "abstract": "A{beta} peptides play a central role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) by exerting cellular toxicity correlated with aggregate formation. Experimental evidences showed an intraneuronal accumulation of A{beta} peptides and an interference with mitochondrial functions. Nevertheless, the relevance of intracellular A{beta} peptides in the pathophysiology of AD remained controversial. Here, we found that the two major species of A{beta} peptides, in particular A{beta}42, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the preprotein import reactions essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. However, A{beta} peptides interacted only weakly with mitochondria and did not affect the inner membrane potential or the structure of the preprotein translocase complexes. A{beta} peptides significantly decreased the import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins through a extra-mitochondrial co-aggregation mechanism. Co-aggregation and import inhibition were significantly stronger in case of the longer peptide A{beta}42, correlating with its importance in AD pathology. Our results demonstrate that a direct interference of aggregation-prone A{beta} peptides with mitochondrial protein biogenesis represents a crucial aspect of the pathobiochemical mechanisms contributing to cellular damage in AD.",

We earlier reported it to improve life history traits and to suppress neurodegeneration as well as induced apoptosis in Drosophila.\\n\\nAim of the studyTo examine effects of dietary AR supplement on cell stress responses in Drosophila melanogaster.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsLarvae/flies, reared on normal food or on that supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) AR, were exposed to crowding, thermal or oxidative stress and examined for survival, stress tolerance and levels of lipid peroxides, SOD and HSPs.\\n\\nResultsWild type larvae/flies reared on AR supplemented food survived the various cell stresses much better than those reared on normal food. AR-fed mutant park13 or DJ-1{beta}Delta93 (Parkinsons disease model) larvae, however, showed only partial or no protection, respectively, against paraquat-induced oxidative stress, indicating essentiality of DJ-1{beta} for AR mediated oxidative stress tolerance. AR feeding reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation even in aged (35 day old) wild type flies while enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We show for the first time that while Hsp70 or Hsp83 expression under normal or stress conditions was not differentially affected by AR feeding, Hsp27 levels were elevated in AR fed wild type control as well as heat shocked larvae. Therefore, besides the known anti-oxidant activity of Phyllanthus emblica fruits, dietary AR also enhances cellular levels of Hsp27.\\n\\nConclusionIn the context of the reported \\\"anti-aging\\\" and \\\"healthy-aging\\\" effects of AR, the present in vivo study on a model organisms shows that AR feeding significantly improves tolerance to a variety of cell stresses through reduced ROS and lipid peroxidation and enhanced SOD activity and Hsp27.

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome is transcribed into large numbers of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but the definition of functional lncRNA groups has proven difficult, partly due to their low sequence conservation and lack of identified shared properties. Here we consider positional conservation across mammalian genomes as an indicator of functional commonality. We identify 665 conserved lncRNA promoters in mouse and human genomes that are preserved in genomic position relative to orthologous coding genes. The identified  positionally conserved lncRNA genes are primarily associated with developmental transcription factor loci with which they are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Strikingly, over half of all positionally conserved RNAs in this set are linked to distinct chromatin organization structures, overlapping the binding sites for the CTCF chromatin organizer and located at chromatin loop anchor points and borders of topologically associating domains (TADs). These topological anchor point (tap)RNAs possess conserved sequence domains that are enriched in potential recognition motifs for Zinc Finger proteins. Characterization of these noncoding RNAs and their associated coding genes shows that they are functionally connected: they regulate each others expression and influence the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells in vitro in a similar fashion. Thus, interrogation of positionally conserved lncRNAs identifies a new subset of tapRNAs with shared functional properties. These results provide a large dataset of lncRNAs that conform to the \\\"extended gene\\\" model, in which conserved developmental genes are genomically and functionally linked to regulatory lncRNA loci across mammalian evolution.",

This perspective will focus on enumerating the elements of computational strategies that, when coupled to appropriate experimental designs, can lead to accurate large-scale models of chromatin-state and transcriptional regulatory structure and dynamics. We highlight four research questions that require further investigation in order to make progress in network inference: using overall constraints on network structure like sparsity, use of informative priors and data integration to constrain individual model parameters, estimation of latent regulatory factor activity under varying cell conditions, and new methods for learning and modeling regulatory factor interactions. We conclude that methods combining advances in these four categories of required effort with new genomic technologies will result in biophysically motivated dynamic genome-wide regulatory network models for several of the best studied organisms and cell types.",

    "abstract": "Diverse eukaryotic cells crawl through complex environments using distinct modes of migration. To understand the underlying mechanisms and their evolutionary relationships, we must define each mode, and identify its phenotypic and molecular markers. Here, we focus on a widely dispersed migration mode characterized by dynamic, actin-filled pseudopods that we call \\\"-motility.\\\" Mining genomic data reveals a clear trend: only organisms with both WASP and SCAR/WAVE--activators of branched actin assembly--make actin-filled pseudopods. While SCAR has been shown to drive pseudopod formation, WASPs role in this process is controversial. We hypothesize that these genes together represent a genetic signature of -motility, because both are used for pseudopod formation. WASP depletion from human neutrophils confirms that both proteins are involved in explosive actin polymerization, pseudopod formation, and cell migration, and colocalize to dynamic signaling structures. Moreover, retention of WASP together with SCAR correctly predicts -motility in disease-causing chytrid fungi, which we show crawl at >30 m/min with actin-filled pseudopods. By focusing on one migration mode in many eukaryotes, we identify a genetic marker of pseudopod formation, the morphological feature of -motility, providing evidence for a widely distributed mode of cell crawling with a single evolutionary origin.",

Mean diffusivity was the most age-sensitive diffusion measure, with negative age associations strongest in the thalamic radiation and association fibres. Inter-individual differences in white matter microstructure across brain tracts become increasingly correlated in older age. This connectivity  de-differentiation may reflect an age-related aggregation of systemic detrimental effects on the brain. We report several other novel results, including comparative age associations with volumetric indices and associations with hemisphere and sex.

To study the establishment of asymmetry and the development of the anteroposterior axis (AP) in culture, we utilised our Gastruloid model system. Gastruloids, highly reproducible embryonic organoids formed from aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells, display symmetry-breaking, polarised gene expression and axial development, mirroring the processes on a time-scale similar to that of the mouse embyro. Using Gastruloids formed from mouse ESCs containing reporters for Wnt, FGF and Nodal signalling, we were able to quantitatively assess the contribution of these signalling pathways to the establishment of asymmetry through single time-point and live-cell fluorescence microscopy.\\n\\nDuring the first 24-48h of culture, interactions between the Wnt/{beta}-Catenin and Nodal/TGF{beta} signalling pathways promote the initial symmetry-breaking event, manifested through polarised Brachyury (T/Bra) expression. Neither BMP nor FGF signalling is required for the establishment of asymmetry, however Wnt signalling is essential for the amplification and stability of the initial patterning event. Additionally, low, endogenous levels of FGF (24-48h) has a role in the amplification of the established pattern at later time-points.\\n\\nOur results confirm that Gastruloids behave like epiblast cells in the embryo, leading us to translate the processes and signalling involved in pattern formation of Gastruloids in culture to the development of the embryo, firmly establishing Gastruloids as a highly reproducible, robust model system for studying cell fate decisions and early pattern formation in culture.",

However, how MT polymerisation cycles are produced and spatiotemporally regulated at a molecular level is unclear, as the entire cycle has not been recapitulated in vitro with defined components. In this study, we reconstituted dynamic MT plus end behaviour involving all three phases, by mixing tubulin with five Drosophila proteins, EB1, XMAP215Msps, Sentin, kinesin-13Klp10A, and CLASPMast/Orbit. When singly mixed with tubulin, CLASPMast/Orbit strongly inhibited MT catastrophe and reduced the growth rate. However, in the presence of the other four factors, CLASPMast/Orbit acted as an inducer of pausing. The mitotic kinase Plk1Polo modulated the activity of CLASPMast/Orbit and kinesin-13Klp10A, and increased the dynamic instability of MTs, reminiscent of mitotic cells. These results suggest that five conserved proteins constitute the core factors for creating dynamic MTs in cells, and that Plk1-dependent phosphorylation is a crucial event for switching from the interphase to mitotic mode.",

The GoM model allows each biological sample to have partial memberships in multiple biologically-distinct clusters, in contrast to traditional clustering methods that partition samples into distinct subgroups. We also provide methods for identifying genes that are distinctively expressed in each cluster to help biologically interpret the results. Applied to a dataset of 53 human tissues, the GoM approach highlights similarities among biologically-related tissues and identifies distinctively-expressed genes that recapitulate known biology.

    "abstract": "The 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) locus encodes for three OAS enzymes (OAS1-3) involved in innate immune response. This region harbors high amounts of Neandertal ancestry in non-African populations; yet, strong evidence of positive selection in the OAS region is still lacking. Here we used a broad array of selection tests in concert with neutral coalescent simulations to firmly demonstrate a signal of adaptive introgression at the OAS locus. Furthermore, we characterized the functional consequences of the Neandertal haplotype in the transcriptional regulation of OAS genes at baseline and infected conditions. We found that cells from people with the Neandertal-like haplotype express lower levels of OAS3 upon infection, as well as distinct isoforms of OAS1 and OAS2. Notably, the Neandertal-introgressed haplotype reintroduced an ancestral splice variant of OAS1 encoding a more active protein, suggesting that adaptive introgression occurred as a means to resurrect adaptive variation that had been lost outside Africa.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing holds great promise to accelerate the development of new crop varieties by providing a powerful tool to modify the genomic regions controlling major agronomic traits. To diversify the set of tools available for wheat genome engineering, we have established a tRNA-based multiplex gene editing strategy for hexaploid wheat.\\n\\nResultsThe functionality of the various CRISPR/Cas9 components was assessed using the transient expression in the wheat protoplasts followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the targeted genomic regions. The efficiency of wheat codon-optimized Cas9 for targeted gene editing in wheat was validated. Multiple single guide RNAs (gRNAs) were evaluated for the ability to edit the homoeologous copies of four genes affecting some important agronomic traits in wheat. Low correspondence was found between the gRNA efficiency predicted bioinformatically and that assessed in the transient expression assay. A multiplex gene editing construct with several gRNA-tRNA units under the control of a single promoter for the RNA polymerase III generated indels at the targets sites with the efficiency comparable to that obtained for a single gRNA construct.\\n\\nConclusionsBy integrating the protoplast transformation assay with multiplexed NGS, it is possible to perform fast functional screens for a large number of gRNAs and to optimize constructs for effective editing of multiple independent targets in the wheat genome. The multiplexing capacity of the tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA construct is well suited for the simultaneous editing of the redundant gene copies in the allopolyploid genomes or genomic regions beneficially affecting multiple agronomic traits. A polycistronic gene construct that can be quickly assembled using the Golden Gate reaction along with the wheat codon optimized Cas9 will further expand the set of tools available for engineering the wheat genome.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions depend on coordinated patterns of neural activity cascading across the brain, running in time from stimulus to response and in space from primary sensory regions to the frontal lobe. Measuring this cascade and how it flows through the brain is key to developing an understanding of how our brains function. However observing, let alone understanding, this cascade, particularly in humans, is challenging. Here, we report a significant methodological advance allowing this observation in humans at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. We use a novel encoding model to link simultaneously measured electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to infer the high-resolution spatiotemporal brain dynamics taking place during rapid visual perceptual decision-making. After demonstrating the methodology replicates past results, we show that it uncovers a previously unobserved sequential reactivation of a substantial fraction of the pre-response network whose magnitude correlates with decision confidence. Our results illustrate that a temporally coordinated and spatially distributed neural cascade underlies perceptual decision-making, with our methodology illuminating complex brain dynamics that would otherwise be unobservable using conventional fMRI or EEG separately. We expect this methodology to be useful in observing brain dynamics in a wide range of other mental processes.",
