    "abstract": "In this paper I address the question -- how large is a phylogenetic sample? I propose a definition of a phylogenetic effective sample size for Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes -- the regression effective sample size. I discuss how mutual information can be used to define an effective sample size in the non-normal process case and compare these two definitions to an already present concept of effective sample size (the mean effective sample size). Through a simulation study I find that the AICc is robust if one corrects for the number of species or effective number of species. Lastly I discuss how the concept of the phylogenetic effective sample size can be useful for biodiversity quantification, identification of interesting clades and deciding on the importance of phylogenetic correlations.",

    "abstract": "Current evolutionary biology models usually assume that a phenotype undergoes gradual change. This is in stark contrast to biological intuition, which indicates that change can also be punctuated-the phenotype can jump. Such a jump can especially occur at speciation, i.e. dramatic change occurs that drives the species apart. Here we derive a Central Limit Theorem for punctuated equilibrium. We show that, if adaptation is fast, for weak convergence to hold, dramatic change has to be a rare event.\\n\\nAMS subject classification: 60F05, 60J70, 60J85, 62P10, 92B99",

    "abstract": "Quantifying differences or similarities in connectomes has been a challenge due to the immense complexity of global brain networks. Here we introduce a noninvasive method that uses diffusion MRI to characterize whole-brain white matter architecture as a single local connectome fingerprint that allows for a direct comparison between structural connectomes. In four independently acquired data sets with repeated scans (total N=213), we show that the local connectome fingerprint is highly specific to an individual, allowing for an accurate self-versus-others classification that achieved 100% accuracy across 17,398 identification tests. The estimated classification error was approximately one thousand times smaller than fingerprints derived from diffusivity-based measures or region-to-region connectivity patterns. The local connectome fingerprint also revealed neuroplasticity within an individual reflected as a decreasing trend in self-similarity across time, whereas this change was not observed in the diffusivity measures. Moreover, the local connectome fingerprint can be used as a phenotypic marker, revealing 12.51% similarity between monozygotic twins, 5.14% between dizygotic twins, and 4.51% between none-twin siblings. This novel approach opens a new door for probing the influence of pathological, genetic, social, or environmental factors on the unique configuration of the human connectome.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe local organization of white matter architecture is highly unique to individuals, making it a tangible metric of connectomic differences. The variability in local white matter architecture is found to be partially determined by genetic factors, but largely plastic across time. This approach opens a new door for probing the influence of pathological, genetic, social, or environmental factors on the unique configuration of the human connectome.",

    "abstract": "We introduce PICS (Pathway Informed Classification System) for classifying cancers based on tumor sample gene expression levels. PICS is a computational method capable of expeditiously elucidating both known and novel biological pathway involvement specific to various cancers, and uses that learned pathway information to separate patients into distinct classes. The method clearly separates a pan-cancer dataset into their tissue of origin and is also able to sub-classify individual cancer datasets into distinct survival classes. Gene expression values are collapsed into pathway scores that reveal which biological activities are most useful for clustering cancer cohorts into sub-types. Variants of the method allow it to be used on datasets that do and do not contain non-cancerous samples. Activity levels of all types of pathways, broadly grouped into metabolic, cellular processes and signaling, and immune system, are useful for separating the pan-cancer cohort. In the clustering of specific cancer types, certain pathway types become more valuable depending on the site being studied. For lung cancer, signaling pathways dominate, for pancreatic cancer signaling and metabolic pathways, and for melanoma immune system pathways are the most useful. This work suggests the utility of pathway level genomic analysis and points in the direction of using pathway classification for predicting the efficacy and side effects of drugs and radiation.",

    "abstract": "Advanced microscopy methods allow obtaining information on (dynamic) conformational changes in biomolecules via measuring a single molecular distance in the structure. It is, however, extremely challenging to capture the full depth of a three-dimensional biochemical state, binding-related structural changes or conformational cross-talk in multi-protein complexes using one-dimensional assays. In this paper we address this fundamental problem by extending the standard molecular ruler based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a two-dimensional assay via its combination with protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE). We show that donor brightness (via PIFE) and energy transfer efficiency (via FRET) can simultaneously report on e.g., the conformational state of dsDNA following its interaction with unlabelled proteins (BamHI, EcoRV, T7 DNA polymerase gp5/trx). The PIFE-FRET assay uses established labelling protocols and single molecule fluorescence detection schemes (alternating-laser excitation, ALEX). Besides quantitative studies of PIFE and FRET ruler characteristics, we outline possible applications of ALEX-based PIFE-FRET for single-molecule studies with diffusing and immobilized molecules. Finally, we study transcription initiation and scrunching of E. coli RNA-polymerase with PIFE-FRET and provide direct evidence for the physical presence and vicinity of the polymerase that causes structural changes and scrunching of the transcriptional DNA bubble.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly reducing cost of bacterial genome sequencing has lead to its routine use in large scale microbial analysis. Though mapping approaches can be used to find differences relative to the reference, many bacteria are subject to constant evolutionary pressures resulting in events such as the loss and gain of mobile genetic elements, horizontal gene transfer through recombination and genomic rearrangements. De novo assembly is the reconstruction of the underlying genome sequence, an essential step to understanding bacterial genome diversity. Here we present a high throughput bacterial assembly and improvement pipeline that has been used to generate nearly 20,000 draft genome assemblies in public databases. We demonstrate its performance on a public data set of 9,404 genomes. We find all the genes used in MLST schema present in 99.6% of assembled genomes. When tested on low, neutral and high GC organisms, more than 94% of genes were present and completely intact.

    "abstract": "The predictive modeling and design of biologically active RNA molecules requires understanding the energetic balance amongst their basic components. Rapid developments in computer simulation promise increasingly accurate recovery of RNAs nearest neighbor (NN) free energy parameters, but these methods have not been tested in predictive trials or on non-standard nucleotides. Here, we present the first such tests through a RECCES-Rosetta (Reweighting of Energy-function Collection with Conformational Ensemble Sampling in Rosetta) framework that rigorously models conformational entropy, predicts previously unmeasured NN parameters, and estimates these values systematic uncertainties. RECCES-Rosetta recovers the ten NN parameters for Watson-Crick stacked base pairs and thirty-two single-nucleotide dangling-end parameters with unprecedented accuracies - root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 0.28 kcal/mol and 0.41 kcal/mol, respectively. For set-aside test sets, RECCES-Rosetta gives an RMSD of 0.32 kcal/mol on eight stacked pairs involving G-U wobble pairs and an RMSD of 0.99 kcal/mol on seven stacked pairs involving non-standard isocytidine-isoguanosine pairs. To more rigorously assess RECCES-Rosetta, we carried out four blind predictions for stacked pairs involving 2,6-diaminopurine-U pairs, which achieved 0.64 kcal/mol RMSD accuracy when tested by subsequent experiments. Overall, these results establish that computational methods can now blindly predict energetics of basic RNA motifs, including chemically modified variants, with consistently better than 1 kcal/mol accuracy. Systematic tests indicate that resolving the remaining discrepancies will require energy function improvements beyond simply reweighting component terms, and we propose further blind trials to test such efforts.\\n\\nSignificanceUnderstanding RNA machines and how their behavior can be modulated by chemical modification is increasingly recognized as an important biological and bioengineering problem, with continuing discoveries of riboswitches, mRNA regulons, CRISPR-guided editing complexes, and RNA enzymes. Computational strategies to understanding RNA energetics are being proposed, but have not yet faced rigorous tests. We describe a modeling strategy called  RECCES-Rosetta that models the full ensemble of motions of RNA in single-stranded form and in helices, including non-standard nucleotides such as 2,6-diaminopurine, a variant of adenosine. When compared to experiments, including blind tests, the energetic accuracies of RECCES-Rosetta calculations are at levels close to experimental error, suggesting that computation can now be used to predict and design basic RNA energetics.",

    "abstract": "In natural settings, microbes tend to grow in dense populations [1-4] where they need to push against their surroundings to accommodate space for new cells. The associated contact forces play a critical role in a variety of population-level processes, including biofilm formation [5-7], the colonization of porous media [8, 9], and the invasion of biological tissues [10-12]. Although mechanical forces have been characterized at the single cell level [13-16], it remains elusive how collective pushing forces result from the combination of single cell forces. Here, we reveal a collective mechanism of confinement, which we call self-driven jamming, that promotes the build-up of large mechanical pressures in microbial populations. Microfluidic experiments on budding yeast populations in space-limited environments show that self-driven jamming arises from the gradual formation and sudden collapse of force chains driven by microbial proliferation, extending the framework of driven granular matter [17-20]. The resulting contact pressures can become large enough to slow down cell growth by delaying the cell cycle in the G1 phase and to strain or even destroy the microenvironment through crack propagation. Our results suggest that self-driven jamming and build-up of large mechanical pressures is a natural tendency of microbes growing in confined spaces, contributing to microbial pathogenesis and biofouling [21-26].",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity hotspots, which harbor more endemic species than elsewhere on Earth, are increasingly threatened. There is a need to accelerate collection efforts in these regions before threatened or endangered species become extinct. The diverse geographical, ecological, genetic, morphological, and behavioral data generated from the on-site collection of an individual specimen are useful for many scientific purposes. However, traditional methods for specimen preparation in the field do not permit researchers to retrieve neuroanatomical data, disregarding potentially useful data for increasing our understanding of brain diversity. These data have helped clarify brain evolution, deciphered relationships between structure and function, and revealed constraints and selective pressures that provide context about the evolution of complex behavior. Here, we report our field-testing of two commonly used laboratory-based techniques for brain preservation while on a collecting expedition in the Congo Basin and Albertine Rift, two poorly known regions associated with the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot.\\n\\nFirst, we found that transcardial perfusion fixation and long-term brain storage, conducted in remote field conditions with no access to cold storage laboratory equipment, had no observable impact on cytoarchitectural features of lizard brain tissue when compared to lizard brain tissue processed under laboratory conditions. Second, field-perfused brain tissue subjected to prolonged post-fixation remained readily compatible with subsequent immunohistochemical detection of neural antigens, with immunostaining that was comparable to that of laboratory-perfused brain tissue. Third, immersion-fixation of lizard brains, prepared under identical environmental conditions, was readily compatible with subsequent iodine-enhanced X-ray microcomputed tomography, which facilitated the non-destructive imaging of the intact brain within its skull.\\n\\nIn summary, we have validated multiple approaches to preserving intact lizard brains in remote field conditions with limited access to supplies and a high degree of environmental exposure. This protocol should serve as a malleable framework for researchers attempting to rescue perishable and irreplaceable morphological and molecular data from regions of disappearing biodiversity. Our approach can be harnessed to extend the numbers of species being actively studied by the neuroscience community, by reducing some of the difficulty associated with acquiring brains of animal species that are not readily available in captivity.",

We investigated this contribution in multi-electrode array recordings from human and monkey neocortex by examining the spike-triggered LFP average (st-LFP). The resulting st-LFPs were dominated by broad spatio-temporal components due to ongoing activity, synaptic inputs and recurrent connectivity. To reduce the spatial reach of the st-LFP and observe the local field related to a single spike we applied a spatial filter, whose weights were adapted to the covariance of ongoing LFP. The filtered st-LFPs were limited to the perimeter of 800 m around the neuron, and propagated at axonal speed, which is consistent with their unitary nature. In addition, we discriminated between putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons and found that the inhibitory st-LFP peaked at shorter latencies, consistently with previous findings in hippocampal slices. Thus, in human and monkey neocortex, the LFP reflects primarily inhibitory neuron activity.",

    "abstract": "The isolation-with-migration (IM) model is commonly used to make inferences about gene flow during speciation, using polymorphism data. However, Becquet and Przeworski (2009) report that the parameter estimates obtained by fitting the IM model are very sensitive to the model's assumptions (including the assumption of constant gene flow until the present). This paper is concerned with the isolation-with-initial-migration (IIM) model of Wilkinson-Herbots (2012), which drops precisely this assumption. In the IIM model, one ancestral population divides into two descendant subpopulations, between which there is an initial period of gene flow and a subsequent period of isolation. We derive a very fast method of fitting an extended version of the IIM model, which also allows for asymmetric gene flow and unequal population sizes. This is a maximum-likelihood method, applicable to data on the number of segregating sites between pairs of DNA sequences from a large number of independent loci. In addition to obtaining parameter estimates, our method can also be used to distinguish between alternative models representing different evolutionary scenarios, by means of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the procedure on pairs of Drosophila sequences from approximately 30,000 loci. The computing time needed to fit the most complex version of the model to this data set is only a couple of minutes. The R code to fit the IIM model can be found in the supplementary files of this paper.",

Genetic association reveals a novel gene+pathway dual-hit model, better explaining ASD risk than the well-accepted mutation burden model.\\n\\nIn multiple analyses with independent datasets, hundreds of variants or genes consistently converge to several canonical pathways. Unlike the reported gene groups or networks, these pathways define novel, relevant, recurrent and systematic ASD biology. At sub-pathway level, most variants disrupt the pathway-related gene functions, and multiple interacting variants spotlight key modules, e.g. cAMP second-messenger system and mGluR signaling regulation by GRK in synapses. At super-pathway level, these distinct pathways are highly interconnected, and further converge to a few biology themes, i.e. synaptic function, morphology and plasticity. Therefore, ASD is a not just multi-genic but a multi-pathway disease.",

    "abstract": "The cost-effectiveness of sequencing pools of individuals (Pool-Seq) provides the basis for the popularity and wide-spread use of this method for many research questions, ranging from unravelling the genetic basis of complex traits to the clonal evolution of cancer cells. Because the accuracy of Pool-Seq could be affected by many potential sources of error, several studies determined, for example, the influence of the sequencing technology, the library preparation protocol, and mapping parameters. Nevertheless, the impact of the mapping tools has not yet been evaluated. Using simulated and real Pool-Seq data, we demonstrate a substantial impact of the mapping tools leading to characteristic false positives in genome-wide scans. The problem of false positives was particularly pronounced when data with different read lengths and insert sizes were compared. Out of 14 evaluated algorithms novoalign, bwa mem and clc4 are most suitable for mapping Pool-Seq data. Nevertheless, no single algorithm is sufficient for avoiding all false positives. We show that the intersection of the results of two mapping algorithms provides a simple, yet effective strategy to eliminate false positives. We propose that the implementation of a consistent Pool-seq bioinformatics pipeline building on the recommendations of this study can substantially increase the reliability of Pool-Seq results, in particular when libraries generated with different protocols are being compared.",

    "abstract": "In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, specification of the legs begins during embryogenesis when Wingless signaling induces small groups of cells to form the imaginal disc primordia in the thoracic segments. This signal initiates expression of transcription factors that will later be used to pattern the legs. The paralogous genes disconnected and disco-related encode transcription factors that are expressed in the disc primordia during early embryogenesis, and their expression continues in the leg discs during larval and pupal stages. The importance of these two genes in establishing the leg development trajectory was indicated by our previous observation that ectopic expression of either gene in the wing discs cells caused legs to develop in place of wings. However, because of their redundancy and requirement for survival during embryogenesis, we were unable to define their role in development of the adult legs. Here, we report loss-of-function analyses of the disco genes during development of the legs. We discovered that loss of both genes functions causes both truncation of the distal leg with apparent overgrowth of proximal regions and complete loss of legs and ventral thoracic body patterning. At the molecular level we noted reduction or loss of signaling and transcription factors that pattern the proximal-distal axis of the legs. We conclude from these studies that the disco genes promote leg development through regulation of signaling processes, but also by stabilizing expression of the leg determination gene network.",

    "abstract": "Just like recurrent somatic alterations characterize cancer genes, mutually exclusive or co-occurring alterations across genes suggest functional interactions. Identifying such patterns in large cancer studies thus helps the discovery of unknown interactions. Many studies use Fishers exact test or simple permutation procedures for this purpose. These tests assume identical gene alteration probabilities across tumors, which is not true for cancer. We show that violating this assumption yields many spurious co-occurrences and misses many mutual exclusivities. We present DISCOVER, a novel statistical test that addresses the limitations of existing tests. In a comparison with six published mutual exclusivity tests, DISCOVER is more sensitive while controlling its false positive rate. A pan-cancer analysis using DISCOVER finds no evidence for widespread co-occurrence. Most co-occurrences previously detected do not exceed expectation by chance. In contrast, many mutual exclusivities are identified. These cover well known genes involved in the cell cycle and growth factor signaling. Interestingly, also lesser known regulators of the cell cycle and Hedgehog signaling are identified.\\n\\nAvailabilityR and Python implementations of DISCOVER, as well as Jupyter notebooks for reproducing all results and figures from this paper can be found at http://ccb.nki.nl/software/discover.",

    "abstract": "SWR1-type nucleosome remodeling factors replace histone H2A by variants to endow chromatin locally with specialized functionality. In Drosophila melanogaster a single H2A variant, H2A.V, combines functions of mammalian H2A.Z and H2A.X in transcription regulation and DNA damage response. A major role in H2A.V incorporation for the only SWR1-like enzyme in flies, Domino, is assumed, but not well documented in vivo. It is also unclear, whether the two alternatively spliced isoforms, dom-A and dom-B, have redundant or specialized functions. Loss of both DOM isoforms compromises oogenesis causing female sterility. Therefore, we systematically explored roles of the two DOM isoforms during oogenesis using a cell type-specific knockdown approach. Despite their ubiquitous expression, DOM-A and DOM-B have non-redundant functions in germline and soma for egg chamber formation. We show that chromatin incorporation of H2A.V in germline and somatic cells depends on DOM-B, while incorporation in endoreplicating germline nurse cells is independent of DOM. In contrast, DOM-A promotes the removal of H2A.V from stage 5 nurse cells. Remarkably, the two DOM isoforms have distinct functions in cell type-specific development and H2A.V exchange.\\n\\nSummary Statement\\n\\nIsoforms of nucleosome remodeling factor Domino change chromatin structure by histone variant exchange to direct essential cellular processes in oocyte development.",

    "abstract": "Nicotine may affect cell function by rearranging protein complexes. We aimed to determine nicotine-induced alterations of protein complexes in Caenorhabditis elegans cells, thereby revealing links between nicotine exposure and protein complex modulation. We compared the proteomic alterations induced by low and high nicotine concentrations (0.01 mM and 1 mM) with the control (no nicotine) in vivo by using mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques, specifically the CTAB discontinuous gel electrophoresis coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS and spectral counting. As a result, we identified dozens of C. elegans proteins that are present exclusively or in higher abundance in either nicotine-treated or untreated worms. Based on these results, we report a network that captures the key protein components of nicotine-induced protein complexes and speculate how the different protein modules relate to their distinct physiological roles. Using functional annotation of detected proteins, we hypothesize that the identified complexes can modulate the energy metabolism and level of oxidative stress. These proteins can also be involved in modulation of gene expression and may be crucial in Alzheimers disease. The findings reported in our study reveal intracellular interactions of many proteins with cytoskeleton and may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signaling and trafficking in cells.\\n\\nSignificance of the studyMost of us are affected by nicotine, not only because of the common use of tobacco products. Nicotine is also included in many popular vegetables of the family Solanaceae, such as tomatoes and peppers. However, these two sources provide the body with radically different doses of nicotine.\\n\\nStrong biological effects of nicotine rely on binding to the nicotinic receptor, which partially mimics the action of the natural hormone acetylcholine. In our study we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. General principles of functioning of human cells and C. elegans cells are similar. The worm is, however, a compromise between simplicity and complexity, which may facilitate understanding of the more complex systems, like the human body. Our study revealed in the presence of a low nicotine concentration a different composition of polypeptides in the organism than in the presence of a high nicotine concentration. The rearrangements of protein complexes concern proteins involved e.g. in the course of Alzheimers disease, which seems interesting in the context of our aging societies. From the perspective of the development of biological research, the ability to identify the components of large protein complexes can contribute to a better understanding of the functioning of cells.",

    "abstract": "The Method of Loci is one, if not the most, efficient mnemonic encoding strategy. This strategy combines the core cognitive processes commonly linked to medial temporal lobe (MTL) activity: spatial processing and associative memory processes. During such tasks fMRI studies consistently demonstrate increases in medial temporal lobe (MTL) activity, while electrophysiological studies have emphasized the important role of theta oscillations (3-8 Hz) in the MTL. How MTL activity is linked to theta oscillatory EEG power, however, is unknown. Specifically, it is not known whether increases or decreases in MTL theta power are associated with increased BOLD signal. To investigate this question we recorded EEG and fMRI while participants used the spatial Method of Loci contrasted to the Pegword Method, a similarly associative but non spatial mnemonic. Surprisingly, the more effective spatial mnemonic induced a pronounced theta power decrease in the left MTL compared to the non-spatial associative mnemonic strategy. This effect was mirrored by BOLD signal increases in the MTL. This pattern of results suggests that theta oscillations in the MTL are negatively related to BOLD signal increases. These findings extend the well-known negative relation of alpha/beta oscillations and BOLD signals in the cortex to theta oscillations in the MTL. The results also demonstrate that decreases in theta power can index MTL involvement during encoding.\\n\\nSignificance StatementStudies investigating the oscillatory correlates of memory encoding largely focus on activity in the theta frequency and often implicitly assume that increases in theta activity reflect similar processes as typically reported increases MTL activity changes in fMRI studies. The presented study found decreases in theta power, not increases, closely mapping to MTL BOLD signal increases during the same paradigm. This finding is in line with studies showing a negative relationship between low frequency power and BOLD changes in the cortex, but challenges the assumption that theta power increases reflect MTL activity. The reported findings importantly contribute to answer the question of how and which oscillatory activity indexes MTL memory processes.",

In cell culture and zebrafish, we show that rates and patterns of editing are tunable, and that thousands of lineage-informative barcode alleles can be generated. We find that most cells in adult zebrafish organs derive from relatively few embryonic progenitors.

However, very few studies in this domain have focused on emerging infections, generating a gap of knowledge that hampers epidemiological response planning. Here, we analyze the case of a Chikungunya outbreak that occurred in Martinique in 2014. Using time series estimates from a network of sentinel practitioners covering the entire island, we first analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics and show that the largest city has served as the epicenter of this epidemic. We further show that the epidemic spread from there through two different propagation waves moving northwards and southwards, probably by individuals moving along the road network. We then develop a mathematical model to explore the drivers of the temporal dynamics of this mosquito-borne virus. Finally, we show that human behavior, inferred by a textual analysis of messages published on the social network Twitter, is required to explain the epidemiological dynamics over time. Overall, our results suggest that human behavior has been a key component of the outbreak propagation, and we argue that such results can lead to more efficient public health strategies specifically targeting the propagation process.",
