    "abstract": "Copper is essential for life but toxic, therefore all organisms control tightly its intracellular abundance. Bacteria have indeed whole operons devoted to copper resistance, with genes that code for efflux pumps, oxidases, etc. Recently, the CopM protein of the CopMRS operon was described as a novel important element for copper tolerance in Synechocystis. This protein consists of a domain of unknown function, and was proposed to act as a periplasmic/extracellular copper binder. This work describes a bioinformatic study of CopM including structural models based on homology modeling and on residue coevolution, to help expand on its recent biochemical characterization. The protein is predicted to be periplasmic but membrane-anchored, not secreted. Two disordered regions are predicted, both possibly involved in protein-protein interactions. The 3D models disclose a 4-helix bundle with several potential copper-binding sites, most of them largely buried inside the bundle lumen. Some of the predicted copper-binding sites involve residues from the disordered regions, suggesting they could gain structure upon copper binding and thus possibly modulate the interactions they mediate. All models are provided as PDB files in the Supporting Information and can be visualized online at http://lucianoabriata.altervista.org/modelshome.html Note (January 2017): Recent X-ray structures of apo, copper- and silver-bound CopM are < 3[A] RMSD away from the models, and reveal metal-dependent structural flexibility (Zhao et al Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2016)",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers exciting possibilities to address biological and medical questions, but a systematic comparison of recently developed protocols is still lacking. Here, we generated data from 447 mouse embryonic stem cells using Drop-seq, SCRB-seq, Smart-seq (on Fluidigm C1) and Smart-seq2 and analyzed existing data from 35 mouse embryonic stem cells prepared with CEL-seq. We find that Smart-seq2 is the most sensitive method as it detects the most genes per cell and across cells with the most even coverage, well suited for annotating transcriptomes. However, we also find that unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), available for CEL-seq, Drop-seq and SCRB-seq, reduce the measurement noise considerably, which is most relevant for quantifying transcriptomes. Importantly, we show by power simulations that SCRB-seq and Drop-seq are the most cost-efficient methods for detecting differentially expressed genes. Our analyses offer a solid basis for an informed choice among five prominent scRNA-seq protocols and for future evaluations of protocol improvements.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gene expression, in addition to sequence polymorphisms, is known to influence developmental, physiological and metabolic traits in plants. Genetic mapping populations have facilitated identification of expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), the genetic determinants of variation in gene expression patterns. We used an introgression population developed from the wild desert-adapted Solanum pennellii and domesticated tomato Solanum lycopersicum to identify the genetic basis of transcript level variation. We established the effect of each introgression on the transcriptome, and identified ~7,200 eQTL regulating the steady state transcript levels of 5,300 genes. Barnes-Hut t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding clustering identified 42 modules revealing novel associations between transcript level patterns and biological processes. The results showed a complex genetic architecture of global transcript abundance pattern in tomato. Several genetic hotspots regulating a large number of transcript level patterns relating to diverse biological processes such as plant defense and photosynthesis were identified. Important eQTL regulating transcript level patterns were related to leaf number and complexity, and hypocotyl length. Genes associated with leaf development showed an inverse correlation with photosynthetic gene expression but eQTL regulating genes associated with leaf development and photosynthesis were dispersed across the genome. This comprehensive expression QTL analysis details the influence of these loci on plant phenotypes, and will be a valuable community resource for investigations on the genetic effects of eQTL on phenotypic traits in tomato.",

    "abstract": "A long standing debate in biochemistry is to determine whether the conformational changes observed during biomolecular interactions proceed through conformational selection (of preexisting isoforms) or induced fit (ligand-induced 3D reshaping). The latter mechanism had been invoked in certain circumstances, for example to explain the non-Michaelian activity of monomeric enzymes like glucokinase. But the relative importance of induced fit has been recently depreciated in favor of conformational selection, assumed to be always sufficient, predominant in general and in particular for glucokinase. The relative contributions of conformational selection and induced fit are reconsidered here in and out of equilibrium, in the light of earlier concepts such as the cyclic equilibrium rule and the turning wheel of Wyman, using single molecule state probability, one way fluxes and net fluxes. The conditions for a switch from conformational selection to induced fit at a given ligand concentration are explicitly determined. Out of equilibrium, the inspection of the enzyme states circuit shows that conformational selection alone would give a Michaelian reaction rate but not the established nonlinear behavior of glucokinase. Moreover, when induced fit and conformational selection coexist and allow kinetic cooperativity, the net flux emerging in the linkage cycle necessarily corresponds to the induced fit path.",

New methods for analyzing CyTOF data attempt to improve automation, scalability, performance, and interpretation of data generated in large studies. Assigning individual cells into discrete groups of cell types (gating) involves time-consuming sequential manual steps, untenable for larger studies. We introduce DeepCyTOF, a standardization approach for gating, based on deep learning techniques. DeepCyTOF requires labeled cells from only a single sample. It is based on domain adaptation principles and is a generalization of previous work that allows us to calibrate between a target distribution and a source distribution in an unsupervised manner. We show that Deep-CyTOF is highly concordant (98%) with cell classification obtained by individual manual gating of each sample when applied to a collection of 16 biological replicates of primary immune blood cells, even when measured accross several instruments. Further, DeepCyTOF achieves very high accuracy on the semi-automated gating challenge of the FlowCAP-I competition as well as two CyTOF datasets generated from primary immune blood cells: (i)14 subjects with a history of infection with West Nile virus (WNV), (ii) 34 healthy subjects of different ages. We conclude that deep learning in general, and DeepCyTOF specifically, offers a powerful computational approach for semi-automated gating of CyTOF and flow cytometry data.",

These yeasts have lost the ability to make normal eukaryotic heterochromatin with histone H3K9 methylation, which is a major component of pericentromeric regions in other eukaryotes. Following this loss, several different types of centromere emerged, including two types of sequence-defined (\\\"point\\\") centromeres, and the epigenetically-defined \\\"small regional\\\" centromeres of Candida albicans. Here we report that centromeres of the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (formerly called Pichia pastoris) are structurally-defined. Each of its four centromeres consists of a 2-kb inverted repeat (IR) flanking a 1-kb central core (mid) region. The four centromeres are unrelated in sequence. CenH3 (Cse4) binds strongly to the cores, with a decreasing gradient along the IRs. This mode of organization resembles Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeres but is much more compact and lacks the extensive flanking heterochromatic otr repeats. Different isolates of K. phaffii show polymorphism for the orientation of the mid regions, due to recombination in the IRs. CEN4 is located within a 138-kb region that changes orientation during mating-type switching, but switching does not induce recombination of centromeric IRs. The existing genetic toolbox for K. phaffii should facilitate analysis of the relationship between the IRs and the establishment and maintenance of centromeres in this species.",

    "abstract": "Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. These abnormalities were originally thought to reflect a pleiotropic impact of silencing suppressors on miRNA control of plant development. However, subsequent work with the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing showed that global impairment of the miRNA pathway was not responsible for the phenotypical anomalies. More recently, developmental defects caused by a P1/HC-Pro transgene under control of the 35S promoter were attributed to moderate upregulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ARF8), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence in that work was that the developmental defects in the 35S-pro:P1/HC-Pro transgenic Arabidopsis were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the arf8-6 mutation. Arf8-6 is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. Here we report a re-investigation of the role of ARF8 in P1/HC-Pro-mediated developmental defects. We characterized the progeny of a cross between our 35S-pro:P1/HC-Pro transgenic Arabidopsis line and the same arf8-6 T-DNA insertion mutant used in the earlier study. The T-DNA mutation had little effect in the F1 generation, but almost all arf8-6/P1/HC-Pro progeny had lost the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F2 generation. However, this loss of phenotype was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the ARF8 gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the 35S-pro:P1/HC-Pro transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA2accompanied by the appearance of 35S promoter siRNAs. Furthermore, arf8-8, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together these data argue against the reported role of increased ARF8 expression in mediating developmental defects in P1/HC-Pro transgenic plants.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRNA silencing is an important antiviral defense in plants that uses small RNA molecules to target the invading RNA. Plant viruses, however, have countered with proteins that suppress RNA silencing, and one of the best-studied plant viral suppressors of silencing is P1/HC-Pro. When the genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is bioengineered to express P1/HC-Pro, the resulting plants display distinct developmental abnormalities. These abnormalities are thought to arise because P1/HC-Pro also interferes with the arm of RNA silencing that uses small RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate expression of the plant's own genes. Earlier work, however, showed that interference with all miRNAs in general could not be responsible for these developmental defects. More recently, it was reported that enhanced expression of a single miRNA-controlled gene, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ARF8), underlies the developmental defects caused by P1/HC-Pro. However, using the same ARF8 mutation as that report, as well as a second, independent ARF8 loss-of function mutation, we now show that mis-regulation of ARF8 is not responsible for those defects. One or a few key miRNA-controlled factors might, in fact, underlie the developmental defects caused by P1/HC-Pro; however, our results show that ARF8 is not one of the key factors.",

A GRN links the expression levels of a set of genes via regulatory controls that gene products exert on one another. Boolean networks are a common modeling choice since they balance between detail and ease of analysis. However, even for Boolean networks the problem of fitting a given network model to an expression dataset is NP-Complete. Previous methods have addressed this issue heuristically or by focusing on acyclic networks and specific classes of regulation functions. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for this problem that makes use of sampling in order to handle large datasets. Our algorithm can handle time series data for any network type and steady state data for acyclic networks. Using in-silico time series data we demonstrate good performance on large datasets with a significant level of noise.",

Fluctuating epistatic interactions drive stabilities into and out of these regions of near neutrality, with the time spent in the neutral region and thus the rate of substitution governed by physicochemical similarities between the amino acids. We derive a theoretical framework for how site-specific stabilities are determined, and demonstrate that substitution rates and the magnitude of the evolutionary Stokes shift can be predicted from biophysics and the effect of sequence entropy alone. Population genetics underlays our analysis, but population size does not determine the absolute rate of amino acid substitutions.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of local adaptation at fine spatial scales are central to understanding how evolution proceeds, and are essential to the effective management of economically and ecologically important forest tree species. Here, we employ single and multilocus analyses of genetic data (n = 116,231 SNPs) to describe signatures of fine-scale adaptation within eight whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) populations across the local extent of the environmentally heterogeneous Lake Tahoe Basin, USA. We show that despite highly shared genetic variation (FST = 0.0069) there is strong evidence for adaptation to the rain shadow experienced across the eastern Sierra Nevada. Specifically, we build upon evidence from a common garden study and find that allele frequencies of loci associated with four phenotypes (mean = 236 SNPs), 18 environmental variables (mean = 99 SNPs), and those detected through genetic differentiation (n = 110 SNPs) exhibit significantly higher signals of selection (covariance of allele frequencies) than could be expected to arise, given the data. We also provide evidence that this covariance tracks environmental measures related to soil water availability through subtle allele frequency shifts across populations. Our results replicate empirical support for theoretical expectations of local adaptation for populations exhibiting strong gene flow and high selective pressures, and suggest that ongoing adaptation of many P. albicaulis populations within the Lake Tahoe Basin will not be constrained by the lack of genetic variation. Even so, some populations exhibit low levels of heritability for the traits presumed to be related to fitness. These instances could be used to prioritize management to maintain adaptive potential. Overall, we suggest that established practices regarding whitebark pine conservation be maintained, with the additional context of fine-scale adaptation.",

Our analysis suggests competitive dominance as a plausible mechanism underlying community assembly patterns over these continental scales. In particular, we find a clear signal of plant-to-plant competition in mid-latitude ecoregions, where conditions for growth (reflected in actual evapotranspiration rates and gross primary productivities) are optimal.

We describe 32 independent coding mutations: these included common mutations outside the kelch13 propeller region associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ~0.079. There was no change in diversity in flanking markers, but resistance allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The rapid spread of C580Y suggests that the genomic signature may be considerably harder in the near future, and that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective sweeps. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation to generate beneficial alleles and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple amino-acid mutations in kelch13 can confer resistance providing a large mutational target - we estimate the target size is between 87 and 163bp. (2) The population mutation parameter ({Theta}=2Ne) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of resistant alleles and is ~ 5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is between 88 thousand and 1.2 million. This is 52 to 705-fold greater than Ne estimates based on fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in Plasmodium. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events, ART-R evolution is not limited by availability of mutations, and the Ne relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.\\n\\nSignificance StatementPrevious work has identified surprisingly few origins of resistance to antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and pyrimethamine. This has lead to optimism about prospects for minimizing resistance evolution through combination therapy. We studied a longitudinal collection of malaria parasites from the Thai-Myanmar border (2001-14) to examine an ongoing selective event in which [&ge;]32 independent alleles associated with ART-R evolved. Three factors appear to explain the large number of origins observed: the large number of amino acid changes that result in resistance (i.e. large mutational \\\"target size\\\"), the large estimated effective population size (Ne), and the fact that we were able to document this selective event in real time, rather than retrospectively.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation affecting gene regulation is a driver of phenotypic differences between individuals and can be used to uncover how biological processes are organized in a cell. Although detecting cis-eQTLs is now routine, trans-eQTLs have proven more challenging to find due to the modest variance explained and the multiple testing burden when comparing millions of SNPs for association to thousands of transcripts. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of trans-eQTLs by looking for SNPs associated with the expression of multiple genes simultaneously. We find substantial evidence of trans-eQTLs, with an 1.8-fold enrichment in nominally significant markers in all three populations and significant overlap between results across the populations. These trans-eQTLs target the same genes and show the same direction of effect across populations. We define a high-confidence set of eight independent trans-eQTLs which are associated to multiple transcripts in all three populations, and affect the same targets in all three populations with the same direction of effect. We then show that target transcripts of trans-eQTLs encode proteins that interact more frequently than expected by chance, and are enriched for pathway annotations indicative of roles in basic cell homeostasis. Thus, we have demonstrated that trans-eQTLs can be accurately identified even in studies of limited sample size.",

    "abstract": "Allosteric regulation is central to many biochemical processes. Allosteric sites provide a target to fine-tune protein activity, yet we lack computational methods to predict them. Here, we present an efficient graph-theoretical approach for identifying allosteric sites and the mediating interactions that connect them to the active site. Using an atomistic graph with edges weighted by covalent and non-covalent bond energies, we obtain a bond-to-bond propensity that quantifies the effect of instantaneous bond fluctuations propagating through the protein. We use this propensity to detect the sites and communication pathways most strongly linked to the active site, assessing their significance through quantile regression and comparison against a reference set of 100 generic proteins. We exemplify our method in detail with three well-studied allosteric proteins: caspase-1, CheY, and h-Ras, correctly predicting the location of the allosteric site and identifying key allosteric interactions. Consistent prediction of allosteric sites is then attained in a further set of 17 proteins known to exhibit allostery. Because our propensity measure runs in almost linear time, it offers a scalable approach to high-throughput searches for candidate allosteric sites.",

While these receptors are most extensively studied for their roles in chemosensory detection in insects, recent work has implicated two family members, IR21a and IR25a, in thermosensation in Drosophila. Here we characterize one of the most deeply conserved receptors, IR93a, and show that it is co-expressed and functions with IR21a and IR25a to mediate physiological and behavioral responses to cool temperatures. IR93a is also co-expressed with IR25a and a distinct receptor, IR40a, in a discrete population of sensory neurons in the sacculus, a multi-chambered pocket within the antenna. We demonstrate that this combination of receptors is important for neuronal responses to dry air and behavioral discrimination of humidity differences. Our results identify IR93a as a common component of molecularly and cellularly distinct IR pathways underlying thermosensation and hygrosensation in insects.",

Motile animals need to alter motion patterns in different environments. For example, crocodiles and other animals can walk on solid ground but switch to swimming in water beds. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also shows adaptability by employing thrashing behaviour in low viscosity media and crawling in high viscosity media. The mechanism that enables this adaptability is an active area of research. It has been attributed previously to neuro-modulation by dopamine and serotonin.\\n\\nThe aim of this study is to physiologically investigate the neuronal mechanisms of modulation of locomotion by dopamine. The results suggest that the mechanosensory properties of the dopaminergic neurons PDE are not limited to touch sensation, but to surrounding environment resistance as well. The significance of such characterization is improving our understanding of dopamine gait switching which gets impaired in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "1Statistical models in medical and population genetics typically assume that individuals assort randomly in a population. While this simplifies model complexity, it contradicts an increasing body of evidence of non-random mating in human populations. Specifically, it has been shown that assortative mating is significantly affected by genomic ancestry. In this work we examine the effects of ancestry-assortative mating on the linkage disequilibrium between local ancestry tracks of individuals in an admixed population. To accomplish this, we develop an extension to the Wright-Fisher model that allows for ancestry based assortative mating. We show that ancestry-assortment perturbs the distribution of local ancestry linkage disequilibrium (LAD) and the variance of ancestry in a population as a function of the number of generations since admixture. This assortment effect can induce errors in demographic inference of admixed populations when methods assume random mating. We derive closed form formulae for LAD under an assortative-mating model with and without migration. We observe that LAD depends on the correlation of global ancestry of couples in each generation, the migration rate of each of the ancestral populations, the initial proportions of ancestral populations, and the number of generations since admixture. We also present the first evidence of ancestry-assortment in African Americans and examine LAD in simulated and real admixed population data of African Americans. We find that demographic inference under the assumption of random mating significantly underestimates the number of generations since admixture, and that accounting for assortative mating using the patterns of LAD results in estimates that more closely agrees with the historical narrative.",

To facilitate understanding of the tumor-immune cell interactions, we characterized the intratumoral immune landscapes and the cancer antigenomes from 20 solid cancers, and created The Cancer Immunome Atlas (http://tcia.at). Cellular characterization of the immune infiltrates revealed a role of cancer-germline antigens in spontaneous immunity and showed that tumor genotypes determine immunophenotypes and tumor escape mechanisms. Using machine learning we identified determinants of tumor immunogenicity and developed a scoring scheme for the quantification termed immunophenoscore. The immunophenoscore was superior predictor of response to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies in two independent validation cohorts. Our findings and the developed resource may help informing cancer immunotherapy and facilitate the development of precision immune-oncology.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to understand how sequences of action potentials (\\\"spikes\\\") encode information about sensory signals and motor outputs. Although traditional theories of neural coding assume that information is conveyed by the total number of spikes fired (spike rate), recent studies of sensory [1-5] and motor [6] activity have shown that far more information is carried by the millisecond-scale timing patterns of action potentials (spike timing). However, it is unknown whether or how subtle differences in spike timing drive differences in perception or behavior, leaving it unclear whether the information carried by spike timing actually plays a causal role in brain function [1]. Here we demonstrate how a precise spike timing code is read out downstream by the muscles to control behavior. We provide both correlative and causal evidence to show that the nervous system uses millisecond-scale variations in the timing of spikes within multi-spike patterns to regulate a relatively simple behavior - respiration in the Bengalese finch, a songbird. These findings suggest that a fundamental assumption of current theories of motor coding requires revision, and that significant improvements in applications, such as neural prosthetic devices, can be achieved by using precise spike timing information.",

Although there has been some investigation into clonal invertebrates and yeast, nothing is known about kin selection in clonal vertebrates. We show that a clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), can distinguish between different clonal lineages, associating with genetically identical, sister clonals, and use multiple sensory modalities. Also, they scale their aggressive behaviors according to the relatedness to other females: they are more aggressive to non-related clones.
