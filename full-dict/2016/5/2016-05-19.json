    "abstract": "BackgroundDifferential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly.\\n\\nResultsWe present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (1) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs which permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (3) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete.\\n\\nConclusionsderfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.\\n\\nThe package is available from Bioconductor at www.bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder.",

    "abstract": "Genome assemblies that are accurate, complete, and contiguous are essential for identifying important structural and functional elements of genomes and for identifying genetic variation. Nevertheless, most recent genome assemblies remain incomplete and fragmented. While long molecule sequencing promises to deliver more complete genome assemblies with fewer gaps, concerns about error rates, low yields, stringent DNA requirements, and uncertainty about best practices may discourage many investigators from adopting this technology. Here, in conjunction with the platinum standard Drosophila melanogaster reference genome, we analyze recently published long molecule sequencing data to identify what governs completeness and contiguity of genome assemblies. We also present a hybrid meta-assembly approach that achieves remarkable assembly contiguity for both Drosophila and human assemblies with only modest long molecule sequencing coverage. Our results motivate a set of preliminary best practices for obtaining accurate and contiguous assemblies, a \\\"missing manual\\\" that guides key decisions in building high quality de novo genome assemblies, from DNA isolation to polishing the assembly.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThree to four gene expression-based subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) have been previously reported. We sought to systematically determine the similarity of HGSC subtypes between populations.\\n\\nMethodsWe independently clustered (k = 3 and k = 4) five publicly-available HGSC mRNA expression datasets with >130 tumors using k-means and non-negative matrix factorization. Within each population, we summarized differential expression patterns for each cluster as moderated t statistic vectors using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. We calculated Pearsons correlations of these vectors to determine similarities and differences in expression patterns between clusters. We defined syn-clusters (SC) as sets of clusters that were strongly correlated across populations, and associated their expression patterns with biological pathways using geneset overrepresentation analyses.\\n\\nResultsAcross populations, for k = 3, moderated t score correlations for clusters 1, 2 and 3, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.80-0.90, and 0.65-0.77. For k = 4, correlations for clusters 1-4, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.83-0.89, 0.51-0.76, and 0.61-0.75. Within populations, comparing analogous clusters (k = 3 versus k = 4), correlations were high for clusters 1 and 2 (0.91-1.00), but were lower for cluster 3 (0.22-0.80). Results are similar using non-negative matrix factorization. SC1 corresponds to previously-reported mesenchymal-like, SC2 to proliferative-like, SC3 to immunoreactive-like, and SC4 to differentiated-like subtypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe mesenchymal-like and proliferative-like subtypes are remarkably consistent across populations and could be uniquely targeted for treatment. The other two previously described subtypes are considerably less robust, and since cross-population comparison reveals that k = 3 and k = 4 are both consistent with our results, they may not represent clear subtypes.",

This study was also performed in breast tumors according to estrogen receptor status and melanoma tumors with proliferative and invasive phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsTranscript isoform signatures accurately separate early from late stage and metastatic from non-metastatic tumors, and are predictive of the survival of patients with undetermined lymph node invasion or metastatic status. These signatures show similar, and sometimes better, accuracies compared with known gene expression signatures, and are largely independent of gene expression changes. Furthermore, we show frequent transcript isoform changes in breast tumors according to estrogen receptor status, and in melanoma tumors according to the invasive or proliferative phenotype, and derive accurate predictive models of stage and survival within each patient subgroup.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analyses reveal new signatures based on transcript isoform abundances that characterize tumor phenotypes and their progression independently of gene expression.

    "abstract": "In clinical practice and biomedical research populations are often divided categorically into distinct racial/ethnic groups. In reality, these categories, which are based on social rather than biological constructs, comprise diverse groups with highly heterogeneous histories, cultures, traditions, religions, social and environmental exposures and ancestral backgrounds. Their use is thus widely debated and genetic ancestry has been suggested as a complement or alternative to this categorization. However, few studies have examined the relative contributions of racial/ethnic identity, genetic ancestry, and environmental exposures on well-established and fundamental biological processes. We examined the associations between ethnicity, ancestry, and environmental exposures and DNA methylation. We typed over 450,000 CpG sites in primary whole blood of 573 individuals of diverse Hispanic descent who also had high-density genotype data. We found that both self-identified ethnicity and genetically determined ancestry were significantly associated with methylation levels at a large number of CpG sites (916 and 194, respectively). Among loci differentially methylated between ethnic groups, a median of 75.7% (IQR 45.8% to 92%) of the variance in methylation associated with ethnicity could be accounted for by shared genomic ancestry accounts. We also found significant enrichment (p = 4.2 x 10-64) of ethnicity-associated sites amongst loci previously associated with environmental and social exposures, particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy. Our study suggests that although differential methylation between ethnic groups can be partially explained by the shared genetic ancestry, a significant effect of ethnicity is likely due to environmental, social, or cultural factors, which differ between ethnic groups.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryIn order to better understand the role of ethnic self-identification and genetically determined ancestry in biomedical outcomes, we explore their relative contributions to variation in methylation, a fundamental biological process.\\n\\nSources of FundingThis research was supported in part by the Sandler Family Foundation, the American Asthma Foundation, National Institutes of Health (P60 MD006902, R01 HL117004, R21ES24844, U54MD009523, R01 ES015794, R01 HL088133, M01 RR000083, R01 HL078885, R01 HL104608, U19 AI077439, M01 RR00188, U01 HG009080, and R01 HL135156), ARRA grant RC2 HL101651, and TRDRP 24RT-0025; EGB was supported in part through grants from the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI), and NIH (K23 HL004464); NZ was supported in part by an NIH career development award from the NHLBI (K25HL121295).

    "abstract": "Human aging is associated with cognitive decline and an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease. Our objective for this study was to evaluate potential relationships between age and variation in gene expression across different regions of the brain. We analyzed the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data from 54 and 101 tissue samples across 13 brain regions in post-mortem donors of European descent aged between 20 and 70 years at death. After accounting for the effects of covariates and hidden confounding factors, we identified 1,446 protein-coding genes whose expression in one or more brain regions is correlated with chronological age at a false discovery rate of 5%. These genes are involved in various biological processes including apoptosis, mRNA splicing, amino acid biosynthesis, and neurotransmitter transport. The distribution of these genes among brain regions is uneven, suggesting variable regional responses to aging. We also found that the aging response of many genes, e.g., TP37 and C1QA, depends on individuals genotypic backgrounds. Finally, using dispersion-specific analysis, we identified genes such as IL7R, MS4A4E, and TERF1/TERF2 whose expressions are differentially dispersed by aging, i.e., variances differ between age groups. Our results demonstrate that age-related gene expression is brain region-specific, genotype-dependent, and associated with both mean and dispersion changes. Our findings provide a foundation for more sophisticated gene expression modeling in the studies of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that is rapidly spreading across the Americas1. Due to a probable association between Zika virus infection and a congenital neurological disorder called microcephaly2, the epidemic trajectory of this viral infection poses a significant concern for the nearly 15 million children born in the Americas each year. The potential magnitude of the ongoing Zika epidemic is exceedingly difficult to gauge based on existing data3, due to a number of uncertainties that cloud the relationship between observed cases and true infections. As an alternative to methods that depend on unreliable case data, we developed and applied a new method that leverages highly spatially resolved data about drivers of Zika transmission to project that 1.1 (1.0-1.9) million infections in childbearing women and 64.2 (53.6-108.1) million infections across all demographic strata could occur before the first wave of the epidemic concludes. Our projection is largely consistent with annual, region-wide estimates of 53.8 (40.0-71.8) million infections by dengue virus4, which has many similarities to Zika. Our projection is also consistent with state-level data from Brazil on confirmed, Zika-associated microcephaly cases5, and it suggests that the current epidemic has the potential to negatively impact tens of thousands of pregnancies. These projections constitute an important early contribution to efforts to understand the potential magnitude of the Zika epidemic, and our methods offer a new way to make rapid assessments of the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases.",

With the shift to high-throughput sequencing, a major challenge for clinical diagnostics is the cross-identification of variants called on their genomic position to resources that rely on transcript- or protein-based descriptions.\\n\\nMethodsWe evaluated the accuracy of three tools (SnpEff, Variant Effect Predictor and Variation Reporter) that generate transcript and protein-based variant nomenclature from genomic coordinates according to guidelines by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Our evaluation was based on comparisons to a manually curated list of 127 test variants of various types drawn from data sources, each with HGVS-compliant transcript and protein descriptors. We further evaluated the concordance between annotations generated by Snpeff and Variant Effect Predictor with those in major germline and cancer databases: ClinVar and COSMIC, respectively.\\n\\nResultsWe find that there is substantial discordance between the annotation tools and databases in the description of insertion and/or deletions. Accuracy based on our ground truth set was between 80-90% for coding and 50-70% for protein variants, numbers that are not adequate for clinical reporting. Exact concordance for SNV syntax was over 99.5% between ClinVar and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and SnpEff, but less than 90% for non-SNV variants. For COSMIC, exact concordance for coding and protein SNVs were between 65 and 88%, and less than 15% for insertions. Across the tools and datasets, there was a wide range of equivalent expressions describing protein variants.\\n\\nConclusionOur results reveal significant inconsistency in variant representation across tools and databases.

Currently, polyclonal antibodies are the standard despite several limitations: they are non-renewable, vary in performance between lots, and need to be validated with each new lot. In contrast, monoclonal antibody lots are renewable and provide consistent performance. To increase ChIP-seq standardization, we investigated whether monoclonal antibodies could replace polyclonal antibodies. We compared monoclonal antibodies that target five key histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3) to their polyclonal counterparts in both human and mouse cells.\\n\\nResultsOverall performance was highly similar for four monoclonal/polyclonal pairs, including when we used two distinct lots of the same monoclonal antibody. In contrast, the binding patterns for H3K27ac differed substantially between polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. However, this was most likely due to the distinct immunogen used rather than the clonality of the antibody.\\n\\nConclusionsAltogether, we found that monoclonal antibodies as a class perform as well as polyclonal antibodies for the detection of histone post-translational modifications in both human and mouse. Accordingly, we recommend the use of monoclonal antibodies in ChIP-seq experiments.",

This dimensionality can sometimes be reduced while still retaining relevant information. In the case of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, more than 90% of the shape variance can be captured using just four principal components. However, it remains unclear if other methods can achieve a more compact representation or contribute further biological insight to worm locomotion. Here we take a data-driven approach to worm shape analysis using independent component analysis (ICA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a cosine series, and jPCA and confirm that the dimensionality of worm shape space is close to four. Projecting worm shapes onto the bases derived using each method gives interpretable features ranging from head movements to tail oscillation. We use these as a comparison method to find differences between the wild type N2 worms and various mutants. The different bases provide complementary views of worm behavior and we expect that closer examination of the time series of projected amplitudes will lead to new results in the future.",

Whilst these analyses clearly demonstrate the overall enrichment of disease risk alleles on gene regulatory regions, they are not designed to identify individual regulatory regions mediating risk or the genes under their control, and thus uncover the specific molecular events driving disease risk. To do so we have departed from standard practice by identifying regulatory regions which replicate across samples, and connect them to the genes they control through robust re-analysis of public data. We find substantial evidence of regulatory potential in 132/301 (44%) risk loci across nine autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and are able to prioritize a single gene in 104/132 (79%) of these.

Moreover, previous methods accepted as input all variants predicted by variant-callers, regardless of differences in dispersion of variant allele frequencies (VAFs) due to uneven depth of coverage and possible presence of strand bias, prohibiting accurate inference of clonal architecture. We present a general framework for assignment of functional mutations to specific cancer clones, which is based on distinction between passenger variants with expected low dispersion of VAF versus putative functional variants, which may not be used for the reconstruction of cancer clonal architecture but can be assigned to inferred clones at the final stage. The key element of our framework is QuantumClone, a method to cluster variants into clones, which we have thoroughly tested on simulated data. QuantumClone takes into account VAFs and genotypes of corresponding regions together with information about normal cell contamination. We applied our framework to whole genome sequencing data for 19 neuroblastoma trios each including constitutional, diagnosis and relapse samples. We discovered specific pathways recurrently altered by deleterious mutations in different clonal populations. Some such pathways were previously reported (e.g., MAPK and neuritogenesis) while some were novel (e.g., epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell survival and DNA repair). Most pathways and their modules had more mutations at relapse compared to diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Parent-of-origin effect loci have non-Mendelian inheritance in which phenotypes are determined by either the maternal or paternal allele alone. In angiosperms, parent-of-origin effects can be caused by loci required for gametophyte development or by imprinted genes needed for seed development. Few parent-of-origin effect loci have been identified in maize (Zea mays) even though there are a large number of imprinted genes known from transcriptomics. We screened rough endosperm (rgh) mutants for parent-of-origin effects using reciprocal crosses with inbred parents. Six maternal rough endosperm (mre) and three paternal rough endosperm (pre) mutants were identified with three mre loci mapped. When inherited from the female parent, mre/+ seeds reduce grain-fill with a rough, etched, or pitted endosperm surface. Pollen transmission of pre mutants results in rgh endosperm as well as embryo lethality. Eight of the loci had significant distortion from the expected one-to-one ratio for parent-of-origin effects. Linked markers for mre1, mre2, and mre3 indicated that the mutant alleles have no bias in transmission. Histological analysis of mre1, mre2, mre3, and pre*-949 showed altered timing of starch grain accumulation and basal endosperm transfer cell layer (BETL) development. The mre1 locus delays BETL and starchy endosperm development, while mre2 and pre*-949 cause ectopic starchy endosperm differentiation. We conclude that many parent-of-origin effects in maize have incomplete penetrance of kernel phenotypes and that there is a large diversity of endosperm developmental roles for parent-of-origin effect loci.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSeveral recent studies have demonstrated that the bottom-up signaling of a visual stimulus is subserved by interareal gamma-band synchronization, whereas top-down influences are mediated by alpha-beta band synchronization. These processes may implement top-down control of stimulus processing if top-down and bottom-up mediating rhythms are coupled via cross-frequency interaction. To test this possibility, we investigated Granger-causal influences among awake male macaque primary visual area V1, higher visual area V4 and parietal control area 7a during attentional task performance. Top-down 7a-to-V1 beta-band influences enhanced visually driven V1-to-V4 gamma-band influences. This enhancement was spatially specific and largest when beta-band activity preceded gamma-band activity by [~]0.1 s, suggesting a causal effect of top-down processes on bottom-up processes. We propose that this cross-frequency interaction mechanistically subserves the attentional control of stimulus selection.\\n\\nSignificance StatementContemporary research indicates that the alpha-beta frequency band underlies top-down control, while the gamma-band mediates bottom-up stimulus processing. This arrangement inspires an attractive hypothesis, which posits that top-down beta-band influences directly modulate bottom-up gamma band influences via cross-frequency interaction. We evaluate this hypothesis determining that beta-band top-down influences from parietal area 7a to visual area V1 are correlated with bottom-up gamma frequency oscillations from V1 to area V4, in a spatially specific manner, and that this correlation is maximal when top-down activity precedes bottom-up activity. These results show that for top-down processes such as spatial attention, elevated top-down beta-band influences directly enhance feedforward stimulus induced gamma-band processing, leading to enhancement of the selected stimulus.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory system, like other sensory systems, can detect specific stimuli of interest amidst complex, varying backgrounds. To gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying this ability, we imaged responses of mouse olfactory bulb glomeruli to single odors and hundreds of mixtures. We used this data to build a model of mixture responses that incorporated nonlinear interactions and trial-to-trial variability and explored potential decoding mechanisms that can mimic mouse performance from our previous study (Rokni et al., 2014) when given glomerular responses as input. We find that a linear decoder with sparse weights could match mouse performance using just a small subset of the glomeruli (~ 15). However, when such a decoder is trained only with single odors, it generalizes poorly to mixture stimuli due to nonlinear mixture responses. We show that mice similarly fail to generalize, although they could in principle fully decompose the mixtures. This suggests that mice learn this segregation task discriminatively by adjusting task-specific decision boundaries without taking advantage of a demixed representation of odors.",

In this study, we found improved ligand binding mode predictions of small medicinal compounds to MDM2 based on RMSD values using AutoDock and AutoDock Vina employing protein binding site flexibility. Additional analysis suggests a data mining protocol using linear regression can isolate the particular flexible bonds necessary for future optimum docking results.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe identification of enhancer is a challenging task. Various types of epigenetic information including histone modification have been utilized in the construction of enhancer prediction models based on a diverse panel of machine learning models. However, DNA methylation profiles generated from the whole genome bisulfate sequencing (WGBS) have not been fully explored for their potential in enhancer prediction despite the fact that low methylated regions (LMRs) have been implied to be distal active regulatory regions.\\n\\nMethodIn this work we propose a prediction framework, LMethyR-SVM, using LMRs identified from cell-type-specific WGBS DNA methylation profiles based on an unlabeled-negative learning framework. In LMethyR-SVM, the set of cell-type-specific LMRs is further divided into three sets: reliable positive, like positive, and likely negative, according to their resemblance to a small set of experimentally validated enhancers in the VISTA database based on an estimated non-parametric density distribution. Then, the prediction model is trained by solving a weighted support vector machine.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate the performance of LMethyR-SVM by using the WGBS DNA methylation profiles derived from the H1 human embryonic stem cell type (H1) and the fetal lung fibroblast cell type (IMR90). The predicted enhancers are highly conserved with a reasonable validation rate based on a set of commonly used positive markers including transcription factors, p300 binding and DNase-I hypersensitive sites. In addition, we show evidence that the large fraction of LMethyR-SVM predicted enhancers are not predicted by ChromHMM in H1 cell type and they are more enriched for the FANTOM5 enhancers.\\n\\nConclusionOur work suggests that low methylated regions detected from the WGBS data are useful as complementary resources to histone modification marks in developing models for the prediction of cell type-specific enhancers.",

    "abstract": "Metagenome shotgun sequencing presents opportunities to identify organisms that may prevent or promote disease. The analysis of sample diversity is achieved by taxonomic identification of metagenomic reads followed by generating an abundance profile. Numerous tools have been developed based on different design principles. Tools achieving high precision can lack sensitivity in some applications. Conversely, tools with high sensitivity can suffer from low precision and require long computation time. In this paper, we present WEVOTE (WEighted VOting Taxonomic idEntification), a method that classifies metagenome shotgun sequencing DNA reads based on an ensemble of existing methods using k-mer-based, marker-based, and naive-similarity based approaches. Our evaluation on fourteen benchmarking datasets shows that WEVOTE improves the classification precision by reducing false positive annotations while preserving a high level of sensitivity. WEVOTE is an efficient and automated tool that combines multiple individual taxonomic identification methods to produce more precise and sensitive microbial profiles. WEVOTE is developed primarily to identify reads generated by MetaGenome Shotgun sequencing. It is expandable and has the potential to incorporate additional tools to produce a more accurate taxonomic profile. WEVOTE was implemented using C++ and shell scripting and is available at www.bitbucket.org/ametwally/wevote",

    "abstract": "APOBEC3A/B cytidine deaminase is responsible for the majority of cancerous mutations in a large fraction of cancer samples. However, its role in heritable mutagenesis remains very poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that both in yeast and in human cancerous cells, most of APOBEC3A/B-induced mutations occur on the lagging strand during replication. Here, we use data on rare human polymorphisms, interspecies divergence, and de novo mutations to study germline mutagenesis, and analyze mutations at nucleotide contexts prone to attack by APOBEC3A/B. We show that such mutations occur preferentially on the lagging strand. Moreover, we demonstrate that APOBEC3A/B-like mutations tend to produce strand-coordinated clusters, which are also biased towards the lagging strand. Finally, we show that the mutation rate is increased 3 of C[-&gt;]G mutations to a greater extent than 3 of C[-&gt;]T mutations, suggesting pervasive translesion bypass of the APOBEC3A/B-induced damage. Our study demonstrates that 20% of C[-&gt;]T and C[-&gt;]G mutations segregating as polymorphisms in human population are attributable to APOBEC3A/B activity.",
