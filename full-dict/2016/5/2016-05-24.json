    "abstract": "Competition chip is an experimental method that allows transcription factor (TF) chromatin turnover dynamics to be measured across a genome. We develop and apply a physical model of TF-chromatin competitive binding using chemical reaction rate theory and derive the physical half-life or residence time for TATA-binding protein (TBP) across the yeast genome from competition ChIP data. Using our physical modeling approach where we explicitly include the induction profile of the competitor in the model, we are able to estimate yeast TBP-chromatin residence time as short as 1.3 minutes, demonstrating that competition ChIP is a relatively high temporal-resolution approach. Strikingly, we find a median value of ~5 TBP-chromatin binding events associated with the synthesis of one RNA molecule across Pol II genes, suggesting multiple rounds of pre-initiation complex assembly and disassembly before productive elongation of Pol II is achieved at most genes in the yeast genome.",

    "abstract": "In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.",

    "abstract": "The identification and mobilization of useful genetic variation from germplasm banks for use in breeding programs is critical for future genetic gain and protection against crop pests. Plummeting costs of next-generation sequencing and genotyping is revolutionizing the way in which researchers and breeders interface with plant germplasm collections. An example of this is the high density genotyping of the entire USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. We assessed the usefulness of 50K SNP data collected on 18,480 domesticated soybean (G. max) accessions and vast historical phenotypic data for developing genomic prediction models for protein, oil, and yield. Resulting genomic prediction models explained an appreciable amount of the variation in accession performance in independent validation trials, with correlations between predicted and observed reaching up to 0.92 for oil and protein and 0.79 for yield. The optimization of training set design was explored using a series of cross-validation schemes. It was found that the target population and environment need to be well represented in the training set. Secondly, genomic prediction training sets appear to be robust to the presence of data from diverse geographical locations and genetic clusters. This finding, however, depends on the influence of shattering and lodging, and may be specific to soybean with its presence of maturity groups. The distribution of 7,608 non-phenotyped accessions was examined through the application of genomic prediction models. The distribution of predictions of phenotyped accessions was representative of the distribution of predictions for non-phenotyped accessions, with no non-phenotyped accessions being predicted to fall far outside the range of predictions of phenotyped accessions.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities inhabiting the human body exhibit significant variability across different individuals and tissues, and are suggested to play an important role in health and disease. High-throughput sequencing offers unprecedented possibilities to profile microbial community composition, but limitations of existing taxonomic classification methods (including incompleteness of existing microbial reference databases) limits the ability to accurately compare microbial communities across different samples. In this paper, we present a method able to overcome these limitations by circumventing the classification step and directly using the sequencing data to compare microbial communities. The proposed method provides a powerful reference-free way to assess differences in microbial abundances across samples. This method, called EMDeBruijn, condenses the sequencing data into a de Bruijn graph. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is then used to measure similarities and differences of the microbial communities associated with the individual graphs. We apply this method to RNA-Seq data sets from a coronary artery calcification (CAC) study and shown that EMDeBruijn is able to differentiate between case and control CAC samples while utilizing all the candidate microbial reads. We compare these results to current reference-based methods, which are shown to have a limited capacity to discriminate between case and control samples. We conclude that this reference-free approach is a viable choice in comparative metatranscriptomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Oceanic microbial diversity covaries with physicochemical parameters. Temperature, for example, explains approximately half of global variation in surface taxonomic abundance. It is unknown, however, whether covariation patterns hold over narrower parameter gradients and spatial scales, and extending to mesopelagic depths. We collected and sequenced 45 epipelagic and mesopelagic microbial metagenomes on a meridional transect through the eastern Red Sea. We asked which environmental parameters explain the most variation in relative abundances of taxonomic groups, gene ortholog groups, and pathways--at a spatial scale of <2000 km, along narrow but well-defined latitudinal and depth-dependent gradients. We also asked how microbes are adapted to gradients and extremes in irradiance, temperature, salinity, and nutrients, examining the responses of individual gene ortholog groups to these parameters. Functional and taxonomic metrics were equally well explained (75-79%) by environmental parameters. However, only functional and not taxonomic covariation patterns were conserved when comparing with an intruding water mass with different physicochemical properties. Temperature explained the most variation in each metric, followed by nitrate, chlorophyll, phosphate, and salinity. That nitrate explained more variation than phosphate suggested nitrogen limitation, consistent with low surface N:P ratios. Covariation of gene ortholog groups with environmental parameters revealed patterns of functional adaptation to the challenging Red Sea environment: high irradiance, temperature, salinity, and low nutrients. Nutrient acquisition gene ortholog groups were anticorrelated with concentrations of their respective nutrient species, recapturing trends previously observed across much larger distances and environmental gradients. This dataset of metagenomic covariation along densely sampled environmental gradients includes online data exploration supplements, serving as a community resource for marine microbial ecology.",

Therefore, the correlation between gas production and FISH hybridisation rates was analysed in different anaerobic digester sludges. High gasification activity coincided with high hybridisation rates. Low hybridisation rates were especially achieved with reactor samples subjected to long starvation periods showing low biogas production.\\n\\nBased on our findings we conclude that samples for FISH analysis should be fixed as soon as possible to prevent a loss of microbial activity resulting in lower FISH signals. Furthermore, the location of sampling is of importance, since samples from different fermenters within the same biogas plant also varied strongly in their FISH hybridisation rate. Our results indicate that FISH could be a useful method for assessing the metabolic state of microorganisms in anaerobic digester plants.",

The negative correlation between protein copy number and bits per amino acid indicates the selective pressure to reduce translational errors.

    "abstract": "Centrifuge is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid, accurate and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers. The system uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized specifically for the metagenomic classification problem. Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (4.2 GB for 4,078 bacterial and 200 archaeal genomes) and classifies sequences at very high speed, allowing it to process the millions of reads from a typical high-throughput DNA sequencing run within a few minutes. Together these advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers. Because of its space-optimized indexing schemes, Centrifuge also makes it possible to index the entire NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequence database (a total of 109 billion bases) with an index size of 69 GB, in contrast to k-mer based indexing schemes, which require far more extensive space.

    "abstract": "Contrary to what is often assumed in population genetics, independently segregating loci do not have completely independent ancestries, since all loci are inherited through a single, shared population pedigree. Previous work has shown that the non-independence between gene genealogies of independently segregating loci created by the population pedigree is weak in panmictic populations, and predictions made from standard coalescent theory are accurate for populations that are at least moderately sized. Here, we investigate patterns of coalescence in pedigrees of structured populations. We find that the pedigree creates deviations away from the predictions of the structured coalescent that persist on a longer timescale than in the case of panmictic populations. Nevertheless, we find that the structured coalescent provides a reasonable approximation for the coalescent process in structured population pedigrees so long as migration events are moderately frequent and there are no migration events in the recent pedigree of the sample. When there are migration events in the recent sample pedigree, we find that distributions of coalescence in the sample can be modeled as a mixture of distributions from different initial sample configurations. We use this observation to motivate a maximum-likelihood approach for inferring migration rates and mutation rates jointly with features of the pedigree such as recent migrant ancestry and recent relatedness. Using simulation, we show that our inference framework accurately recovers long-term migration rates in the presence of recent migration events in the sample pedigree.",

    "abstract": "Although there is a well developed theory on the relationship between the intrinsic growth rate r and temperature T, it is not yet clear how r relates to abundance, and how abundance relates to T. Many species often have stable enough population dynamics that one can talk about a stochastic equilibrium population size N*. There is sometimes an assumption that N* and r are positively correlated, but there is lack of evidence for this. To try to understand the relationship between r, N*, and T we used a simple chemostat model. The model shows that N* not only depends on r, but also on the mortality rate, the half-saturation constant of the nutrient limiting r, and the conversion coefficient of the limiting nutrient. Our analysis shows that N* positively correlates to r only with high mortality rate and half-saturation constant values. The response curve of N* vs. T can be flat, Gaussian, convex, and even temperature independent depending on the values of the variables in the model and their relationship to T. Moreover, whenever the populations have not reached equilibrium and might be in the process of doing so, it could be wrongly concluded that N* and r are positively correlated. Because of their low half-saturation constants, unless conditions are oligotrophic, microorganisms would tend to have flat abundance response curves to temperature even with high mortality rates. In contrast, unless conditions are eutrophic, it should be easier to get a Gaussian temperature response curve for multicellular organisms because of their high half-saturation constant. This work sheds light to why it is so difficult for any general principles to emerge on the abundance response to temperature. We conclude that directly relating N* to r is an oversimplification that should be avoided.",

By pairing the largest collection of transcriptomes (>1000) and methylomes (77) across Viridiplantae we provide novel insights into the evolution of gbM and its relationship to CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) proteins.\\n\\nResultsCMTs are evolutionary conserved DNA methyltransferases in Viridiplantae. Duplication events gave rise to what are now referred to as CMT1, 2 and 3. Independent losses of CMT1, 2 and 3 in eudicots, CMT2 and ZMET in monocots and monocots/commelinids, variation in copy number and non-neutral evolution suggests overlapping or fluid functional evolution of this gene family. DNA methylation within genes is widespread and is found in all major taxonomic groups of Viridiplantae investigated. Genes enriched with methylated CGs (mCG) were also identified in species sister to angiosperms. The proportion of genes and DNA methylation patterns associated with gbM are restricted to angiosperms with a functional CMT3 or ortholog. However, mCG-enriched genes in the gymnosperm Pinus taeda shared some similarities with gbM genes in Amborella trichopoda. Additionally, gymnosperms and ferns share a CMT homolog closely related to CMT2 and 3. Hence, the dependency of gbM on a CMT most likely extends to all angiosperms and possibly gymnosperms and ferns.\\n\\nConclusionsThe resulting gene family phylogeny of CMT transcripts from the most diverse sampling of plants to date redefines our understanding of CMT evolution and its evolutionary consequences on DNA methylation. Future, functional tests of homologous and paralogous CMTs will uncover novel roles and consequences to the epigenome.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian chromosomes are organized in structural and functional domains of 0.1-10 Mb, which are characterized by high self-association frequencies in the nuclear space and different contact probabilities with nuclear sub-compartments. They exhibit distinct chromatin modification patterns, gene expression levels and replication timing. Recently, nucleolus-associated chromosomal domains (NADs) have been discovered, yet their precise genomic organization and dynamics are still largely unknown. Here, we use nucleolus genomics and single-cell experiments to address these questions in human embryonic fibroblasts during replicative senescence. Genome-wide mapping reveals 1,646 NADs in proliferating cells, which cover about 38% of the annotated human genome. They are mainly heterochromatic and correlate with late replicating loci. Using Hi-C data analysis, we show that interactions of NADs dominate interphase chromosome contacts in the 10-50 Mb distance range. Interestingly, only minute changes in nucleolar association are observed upon senescence. These spatial rearrangements in subdomains smaller than 100 kb are accompanied with local transcriptional changes. In contrast, large centromeric and pericentromeric satellite repeat clusters extensively dissociate from nucleoli in senescent cells. We use gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to map the epigenetic regulatory network that governs these changes. The GSEA results together with cellular chromatin analyses suggest that histone H3K9 trimethylation is involved in regulating the nucleolus association of chromatin. Collectively, this study identifies connections between the nucleolus, 3D genome structure, and cellular aging at the level of interphase chromosome organization.",

However, the original version of tissue-driven hypothesis cannot rule out the tissue-specific effect of mutational variance. In this perspective, we solve this problem by modifying the evolutionary model that underlies the tissue expression evolution. Reanalysis of the microarray data reanalysis has revealed the relative importancebetween tissue-specific functional constraints and mutational variances in the tissue evolution.

Diploid males are expected to be more frequent in genetically eroded populations (such as islands and captive populations), as genetic diversity at the csd locus should be low. However, only a few studies have focused on the relation between population size, genetic diversity and the proportion of diploid males in the field. Here, we developed new microsatellites markers in order to assess and compare genetic diversity and diploid male proportion in populations from three distinct habitat types (mainland, island or captive), in the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. Eroded genetic diversity and higher diploid male proportion were found in island and captive populations, and habitat type had large effect on genetic diversity. Therefore, diploid male proportion reflects the decreasing genetic diversity in small and isolated populations. Thus, Hymenopteran populations can be at high extinction risk due to habitat destruction or fragmentation.",

The completeness and quality were assessed with the Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) and Transrate tools at each stage of the assemblies. The final datasets of 11,315-12,849 transcripts contained 5,610-7,712 updates and corrections to >50% of existing gene models including changes to hundreds or thousands of protein products. Putative novel genes are also identified and alternative splice isoforms were observed for the first time in P. pallidum, D. lacteum and D. fasciculatum.\\n\\nConclusionsIn taking a whole transcriptome approach to genome annotation with empirical data we have been able to enrich the annotations of four existing genome sequencing projects. In doing so we have identified updates to the majority of the gene annotations across all four species under study and found putative novel genes and transcripts which could be worthy for follow-up. The new transcriptome data we present here will be a valuable resource for genome curators in the Dictyostelia and we propose this effective methodology for use in other genome annotation projects.",

In the mouse, area-to-area connections have only been systematically mapped using bulk labeling techniques, which obscure the diverse projections of intermingled single neurons. Here we describe MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), a technique that can map the projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons by labeling large sets of neurons with random RNA sequences (\\\"barcodes\\\"). Axons are filled with barcode mRNA, each putative projection area isdissected, and the barcode mRNA is extracted and sequenced. Applying MAPseq to the locus coeruleus (LC), we find that individual LC neurons have preferred cortical targets.

    "abstract": "A requisite precondition for the application of next-generation sequencing to clinical medicine is the ability to confidently call genotype at each coding/splicing position of every gene of interest. Current gold standard technologies, such as Sanger sequencing and microarrays, allow confident identification of the genomic origin of the DNA of interest. A commonly used minimum standard for the adoption of new technology in medicine is non-inferiority. We developed a metric to quantify the extent to which current sequencing technologies reach this clinical grade reporting standard. This metric, the rationale for which we present here, is defined as the absolute number of base pairs per gene not callable with confidence, as specified by the presence of 20 high quality (Q20) bases from uniquely mapped (mapq>0) reads per locus. To illustrate the utility of this metric, we apply it across data from several commercially available clinical sequencing products. We present specific examples of coverage for genes known to be important for clinical medicine. We derive data from a variety of platforms including whole genome sequencing (Illumina Hiseq and X chemistry) and exome capture (including medically optimized capture from Agilent, Baylor Clinical Lab, and Personalis). We observe that compared to whole genomes (with {small tilde}30x average coverage), augmented exomes perform far better for known disease causing genes, but less well for other genes and in untranslated regions. Increasing whole genome coverage improves this discrepancy with an average coverage of {small tilde}45x representing the cross over point where performance equals that of exome capture for disease causing genes. A combination of some genome-wide coverage and augmented exon coverage may offer the most cost effective solution for clinical grade genome sequencing today. In summary, this coverage metric provides transparency regarding the current state of next-generation sequencing for clinical medicine and will inform genotype interpretation, technology improvement, and sequencing platform choices for physicians and laboratories. We provide an application on precision.fda.gov (Coverage of Key Genes app) to calculate this metric.",

However, RNA transcriptional regulators suffer from incomplete repression, making their dynamic range less than that of their protein counterparts. This incomplete repression can cause expression leak, which impedes the construction of larger RNA synthetic regulatory networks. Here we demonstrate how naturally derived antisense RNA-mediated transcriptional regulators can be configured to regulate both transcription and translation in a single compact RNA mechanism that functions in Escherichia coli. Using in vivo gene expression assays, we show that a combination of transcriptional termination and RBS sequestration increases repression from 85% to 98% and activation from 10 fold to over 900 fold in response to cognate antisense RNAs. We also show that orthogonal versions of this mechanism can be created through engineering minimal antisense RNAs. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of this dual control mechanism, we use it to reduce circuit leak in an RNA-only transcriptional cascade that activates gene expression as a function of a small molecule input. We anticipate these regulators will find broad use as synthetic biology moves beyond parts engineering to the design and construction of larger and more sophisticated circuits.",

The mechanisms leading to the establishment and progression of the infection are currently unknown. An animal model to study these mechanisms is sorely needed. We report the first in vivo model of granulomatous pulmonary nocardiosis that closely resembles human pathology. BALB/c mice infected intranasally with two different doses of GFP-expressing Nocardia brasiliensis ATCC700358 (NbGFP), develop weight loss and pulmonary granulomas. Mice infected with 109 CFUs progressed towards death within a week while mice infected with 108 CFUs died after five to six months. Histological examination of the lungs revealed that both the higher and lower doses of NbGFP induced granulomas with NbGFP clearly identifiable at the center of the lesions. Mice exposed to 108 CFUs and subsequently to 109 CFUs were not protected against disease severity but had less granulomas suggesting some degree of protection. Attempts to identify a cellular target for the infection were unsuccessful but we found that bacterial microcolonies in the suspension used to infect mice were responsible for the establishment of the disease. Small microcolonies of NbGFP, incompatible with nocardial doubling times starting from unicellular organisms, were identified in the lung as early as six hours after infection. Mice infected with highly purified unicellular preparations of NbGFP did not develop granulomas despite showing weight loss. Finally, intranasal delivery of nocardial microcolonies was enough for mice to develop granulomas with minimal weight loss. Taken together these results show that Nocardia brasiliensis microcolonies are both necessary and sufficient for the development of granulomatous pulmonary nocardiosis in mice.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge of the post-genomic era is to comprehensively characterize the cellular role of the [~]20,000 proteins encoded in the human genome. To systematically study protein function in a native cellular background, libraries of human cell lines expressing proteins tagged with a functional sequence at their endogenous loci would be very valuable. Here, using electroporation of Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins and taking advantage of a split-GFP system, we describe a scalable method for the robust, scarless and specific tagging of endogenous human genes with GFP. Our approach requires no molecular cloning and allows a large number of cell lines to be processed in parallel. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by targeting 48 human genes and show that the resulting GFP fluorescence correlates with protein expression levels. We next present how our protocols can be easily adapted for the tagging of a given target with GFP repeats, critically enabling the study of low-abundance proteins. Finally, we show that our GFP tagging approach allows the biochemical isolation of native protein complexes for proteomic studies. Together, our results pave the way for the large-scale generation of endogenously tagged human cell lines for the proteome-wide analysis of protein localization and interaction networks in a native cellular context.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe function of a large fraction of the human proteome still remains poorly characterized. Tagging proteins with a functional sequence is a powerful way to access function, and inserting tags at endogenous genomic loci allows the preservation of a near-native cellular background. To characterize the cellular role of human proteins in a systematic manner and in a native context, we developed a method for tagging endogenous human proteins with GFP that is both rapid and readily applicable at a genome-wide scale. Our approach allows studying both localization and interaction partners of the protein target.

    "abstract": "Social dilemmas are an integral part of social interactions. Cooperative actions, ranging from secreting extra-cellular products in microbial populations to donating blood in humans, are costly to the actor and hence create an incentive to shirk and avoid the costs. Nevertheless, cooperation is ubiquitous in nature. Both costs and benefits often depend non-linearly on the number and types of individuals involved-as captured by idioms such as  too many cooks spoil the broth where additional contributions are discounted, or  two heads are better than one where cooperators synergistically enhance the group benefit. Interaction group sizes may depend on the size of the population and hence on ecological processes. This results in feedback mechanisms between ecological and evolutionary processes, which jointly affect and determine the evolutionary trajectory. Only recently combined eco-evolutionary processes became experimentally tractable in microbial social dilemmas. Here we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of non-linear social dilemmas in settings where the population fluctuates in size and the environment changes over time. In particular, cooperation is often supported and maintained at high densities through ecological fluctuations. Moreover, we find that the combination of the two processes routinely reveals highly complex dynamics, which suggests common occurrence in nature.",

In both humans and animals, cortisol is frequently studied as a biomarker for exposure to environmental stress. Relatively little attention has been paid to the possible role of genetic variation in heterogeneity in chronic cortisol, in spite of well-studied biological pathways of glucocorticoid function. Using recently developed technology, hair samples can now be used to measure accumulation of cortisol over several months. In contrast to more conventional salivary measures, hair cortisol is not influenced by diurnal variation or transient hormonal reactivity. In an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 1 070 child and adolescent twins and multiples from 556 unique families, we estimated genetic and environmental influences on hair concentrations of cortisol and its inactive metabolite, cortisone. We identified sizable genetic influences on cortisol that decrease with age, concomitant with genetic influences on cortisone that increase with age. Shared environmental influences on cortisol and cortisone were modest and, for cortisol, decreased with age. Twin-specific, non-shared environmental contributions to cortisol and cortisone became increasingly correlated with age. We find some evidence for sex differences in the biometric contributions to cortisol, but no strong evidence for main or moderating effects of family socioeconomic status on cortisol or cortisone. This study constitutes the first genetic study of hormone concentrations in human hair, and provides the most definitive characterization to-date of age and socioeconomic influences on hair cortisol.",

Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5P and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.",

    "abstract": "Gene transcription is a highly stochastic and dynamic process. As a result, the mRNA copy number of a given gene is heterogeneous both between cells and across time. We present a framework to model gene transcription in populations of cells with time-varying (stochastic or deterministic) transcription and degradation rates. Such rates can be understood as upstream cellular drives representing the effect of different aspects of the cellular environment. We show that the full solution of the master equation contains two components: a model-specific, upstream effective drive, which encapsulates the effect of the cellular drives (e.g., entrainment, periodicity or promoter randomness), and a downstream transcriptional Poissonian part, which is common to all models. Our analytical framework allows us to treat cell-to-cell and dynamic variability consistently, unifying several approaches in the literature. We apply the obtained solution to characterize several gene transcription models of experimental relevance, and to explain the influence on gene transcription of synchrony, stationarity, ergodicity, as well as the effect of time-scales and other dynamic characteristics of drives. We also show how the solution can be applied to the analysis of single-cell data, and to reduce the computational cost of sampling solutions via stochastic simulation.",

Uncertainty remains despite evidence that resting-state FC patterns are highly similar to cognitive task activation patterns. Identifying the distributed processes that shape localized cognitive task activations may help reveal why resting-stateFC is so strongly related to cognitive task activations. We found that estimating task-evoked activity flow (the spread of activation amplitudes) over resting-state FC networks allows prediction of cognitive task activations in a large-scale neural network model. Applying this insight to empirical functional MRI data, we found that cognitive task activations can be predicted in held-out brain regions (and held-out individuals via estimated activity flow over resting-state FC networks.

Consequently, many modeling frameworks exist to capture microbial population growth measurements. However, current models are designed to quantify growth under conditions that produce a specific functional form. Extensions to these models are required to quantify the effects of perturbations, which often exhibit non-standard growth curves. Rather than fix expected functional forms of different experimental perturbations, we developed a general and robust model of microbial population growth curves using Gaussian process (GP) regression. GP regression modeling of high resolution time-series growth data enables accurate quantification of population growth, and can be extended to identify differential growth phenotypes due to genetic background or stress. Additionally, confounding effects due to experimental variation can be controlled explicitly. Our framework substantially outperforms commonly used microbial population growth models, particularly when modeling growth data from environmentally stressed populations. We apply the GP growth model to a collection of growth measurements for seven transcription factor knockout strains of a model archaeal organism, Halobacterium salinarum. Using these models fitted to growth data, two statistical tests were developed to quantify the differential effects of genetic and environmental perturbations on microbial growth. These statistical tests accurately identify known regulators and implicate novel regulators of growth under standard and stress conditions. Furthermore, the fitted GP regression models are interpretable, recapitulating biological knowledge of growth response while providing new insights into the relevant parameters affecting microbial population growth.",

Experimental techniques such as cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation have enabled the identification of RBPs, RNA-binding domains (RBDs), and their regulatory roles in the eukaryotic species such as human and yeast in large-scale. In contrast, our knowledge of the number and potential diversity of RBPs in bacteria is poorer due to the technical challenges associated with the existing global screening approaches.We introduce APRICOT, a computational pipeline for the sequence-based identification and characterization of proteins using RBDs known from experimental studies. The pipeline identifies functional motifs in protein sequences using Position Specific Scoring Matrices and Hidden Markov Models of the functional domains and statistically scores them based on a series of sequence-based features. Subsequently, APRICOT identifies putative RBPs and characterizes them by several biological properties. Here we demonstrate the application and adaptability of the pipeline on large-scale protein sets, including the bacterial proteome of Escherichia coli. APRICOT showed better performance on various datasets compared to other existing tools for the sequence-based prediction of RBPs by achieving an average sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.91 respectively.

    "abstract": "Vascular development involves de novo formation of a capillary plexus, which is then pruned and remodeled by angiogenic events. Cytoskeletal remodeling and directional endothelial migration are essential for developmental and pathological angiogenesis. Smad-dependent TGF{beta} signaling controls vascular patterning and is negatively regulated by microtubules. Here we show that a positive regulator of TGF{beta} signaling is essential for developmental vascular patterning and microtubule stability. Rudhira/BCAS3 is known to bind microtubules and to play a nodal role in cytoskeletal remodeling and directional endothelial cell (EC) migration in vitro. We demonstrate that the molecular and cellular function of Rudhira is deployed at critical steps in vascular patterning. We generated the first floxed mice for rudhira and find that global or endothelial knockout of rudhira results in mid-gestation lethality due to aberrant embryonic and extra-embryonic vessel patterning and defective cardiac morphogenesis. Rudhira null yolk sac ECs show random and retarded migration. Yolk sac transcriptome analysis revealed key mediators of angiogenic processes and TGF{beta} receptor signaling were perturbed in rudhira null mutants. Molecular and biochemical analyses showed that rudhira depletion reduced microtubule stability but increased expression of pathway inhibitors leading to high levels of SMAD2/3 ubiquitination and reduced activation. These effects were not rescued by exogenous TGF{beta}. However, TGF{beta} treatment of wild type ECs increased Rudhira expression. Further, exogenous Rudhira, which promotes directional cell migration, caused increased SMAD2/3 nuclear translocation and reduced inhibitor levels. Therefore, we propose that Rudhira and TGF{beta} signaling are mutually dependent. Rudhira has a dual function in promoting TGF{beta} signaling, possibly by sequestering microtubules and simultaneously preventing SMAD2/3 ubiquitination to permit EC migration and vascular patterning. TGF{beta} signaling and aberrant human Rudhira (Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence 3, BCAS3) expression are both associated with tumour metastasis. Our study identifies a cytoskeletal, cell type-specific modulator of TGF{beta} signaling important in development and cancer.",

    "abstract": "During nervous system development, neurons and their progenitors often migrate to their final destinations. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the bilateral Q neuroblasts and their descendants migrate long distances in opposite directions, despite being born in the same posterior region. QR on the right migrates anteriorly and generates the AQR neuron positioned near the head, and QL on the left migrates posteriorly, giving rise to the PQR neuron positioned near the tail. In a screen for genes required for AQR and PQR migration, we identified an allele of nfm-1, which encodes a molecule similar to vertebrate NF2/Merlin, an important tumor suppressor in humans. Mutations in NF2 lead to Neurofibromatosis Type II, characterized by benign tumors of glial tissues. These molecules contain Four-point-one Ezrin Radixin Moesin (FERM) domains characteristic of cytoskeletal-membrane linkers, and vertebrate NF2 is required for epidermal integrity. Vertebrate NF2 can also regulate several transcriptional pathways including the Hippo pathway. Here we demonstrate that in C. elegans, nfm-1 is required for complete migration of AQR and PQR, and that it likely acts outside of the Q cells themselves in a non-autonomous fashion. We also show a genetic interaction between nfm-1 and the C. elegans Slit homolog slt-1, which encodes a conserved secreted guidance cue. In vertebrates, NF2 can control Slit2 mRNA levels through the hippo pathway in axon pathfinding, suggesting a conserved interaction of NF2 and Slit2 in regulating migration.",

    "abstract": "Much adaptive evolutionary change is underlain by mutational variation in regions of the genome that regulate gene expression rather than in the coding regions of the genes themselves. An understanding of the role of gene expression variation in facilitating local adaptation will be aided by an understanding of underlying regulatory networks. Here, we characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression variation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), an important model in the study of adaptive evolution. We collected transcriptomic and genomic data from 60 half-sib families using an expression microarray and genotyping-by-sequencing, and located QTL underlying the variation in gene expression (eQTL) in liver tissue using an interval mapping approach. We identified eQTL for several thousand expression traits. Expression was influenced by polymorphism in both cis and trans regulatory regions. Trans eQTL clustered into hotspots. We did not identify master transcriptional regulators in hotspot locations: rather, the presence of hotspots may be driven by complex interactions between multiple transcription factors. One observed hotspot co-located with a QTL recently found to underlie salinity tolerance in the threespine stickleback. However, most other observed hotspots did not co-locate with regions of the genome known to be involved in adaptive divergence between marine and freshwater habitats.",

    "abstract": "Genome scan approaches promise to map genomic regions involved in adaptation of individuals to their environment. Outcomes of genome scans have been shown to depend on several factors including the underlying demography, the adaptive scenario, and the software or method used. We took advantage of a pedagogical experiment carried out during a summer school to explore the effect of an unexplored source of variability, which is the degree of user expertise.Participants were asked to analyze three simulated data challenges with methods presented during the summer school. In addition to submitting lists, participants evaluated a priori their level of expertise. We measured the quality of each genome scan analysis by computing a score that depends on false discovery rate and statistical power. In an easy and a difficult challenge, less advanced participants obtained similar scores compared to advanced ones, demonstrating that participants with little background in genome scan methods were able to learn how to use complex software after short introductory tutorials. However, in a challenge ofintermediate difficulty, advanced participants obtained better scores. To explain the difference, we introduce a probabilistic model that shows that a larger variation in scores is expected for SNPs of intermediate difficulty of detection. We conclude that practitioners should develop their statistical and computational expertise to follow the development of complex methods. To encourage training, we release the website of the summer school where users can submit lists of candidate loci, which will be scored and compared to the scores obtained by previous users.",

Testing and refining these multiprocess theories of PM requires a way of tracking participants reliance on WM versus EM. Here we use multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to derive a trial-by-trial measure of WM use in prospective memory. We manipulated strategy demands by varying the degree of proactive interference (which impairs EM) and the memory load required to perform the secondary task (which impairs WM). For the condition in which participants were pushed to rely more on WM, our MVPA measures showed 1) greater WM use and 2) a trial-by-trial correlation between WM use and PM behavior. Finally, we also showed that MVPA measures of WM use are not redundant with other behavioral measures: in the condition in which participants were pushed more to rely on WM, using neural and behavioral measures together led to better prediction of PM accuracy than either measure on its own.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is known for its substantial clinical and suspected causal heterogeneity. It is characterised by low mood, psychomotor slowing, and increased levels of the personality trait neuroticism; factors which are also associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). It is possible that some cases of MDD may have a substantial genetic loading for SCZ. A sign of the presence of SCZ-like MDD sub-groups would be indicated by an interaction between MDD status and polygenic risk of SCZ on cognitive, personality and mood measures. In the current study, we hypothesised that higher SCZ-polygenic risk would define larger MDD case-control differences in cognitive ability, and smaller differences in distress and neuroticism. Polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for SCZ and their association with cognitive variables, neuroticism, mood, and psychological distress were estimated in a large population-based cohort (Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study, GS:SFHS). Individuals were divided into those with, and without, depression (n=2587 & n=16,764 respectively) to test whether there was an interaction between MDD status and schizophrenia risk. Replication was sought in UK Biobank (n=33,525). In both GS:SFHS and UK Biobank we found significant interactions between SCZ-PGRS and MDD status for measures of psychological distress and neuroticism. In both cohorts there was a reduction of case-control differences on a background of higher genetic risk of SCZ. These findings suggest that depression on a background of high genetic risk for SCZ may show attenuated associations with distress and neuroticism. This may represent a causally distinct form of MDD more closely related to SCZ.",

However, knowledge about how genetically similar epidemiologically linked isolates can be is vital for correct application of this methodology. To address this issue in C. jejuni we investigated the spatial and temporal signals in the genomes of a major clonal complex and generalist lineage, ST-45 CC, by exploiting the population structure and genealogy and applying genome-wide association analysis of 340 isolates from across Europe collected over a wide time-range. The occurrence and strength of the geographical signal varied between sublineages and followed the clonal frame when present, while no evidence of a temporal signal was found. Certain sublineages of ST-45 CC formed discrete and genetically isolated clades to which geography and time had left only negligible traces in the genomes. We hypothesize that these ST-45 CC clades form globally expanded monomorphic clones possibly spread across Europe by migratory birds. In addition, we observed an incongruence between the genealogy of the strains and MLST typing, thereby challenging the existing clonal complex definition and use of a common MLST-based nomenclature for the ST-45 CC of C. jejuni.",

    "abstract": "A complex disease generally results not from malfunction of individual molecules but from dysfunction of the relevant system or network, which dynamically changes with time and conditions. Thus, estimating a condition-specific network from a sample is crucial to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases at the system level. However, there is currently no effective way to construct such an individual-specific network by expression profiling of a single sample because of the requirement of multiple samples for computing correlations. We developed here with a statistical method, i.e., a sample-specific network method, which allows us to construct individual-specific networks based on molecular expression of a single sample. Using this method, we can characterize various human diseases at a network level. In particular, such sample-specific networks can lead to the identification of individual-specific disease modules as well as driver genes, even without gene sequencing information. Extensive analysis by using the Cancer Genome Atlas data not only demonstrated the effectiveness of the method, but also found new individual-specific driver genes and network patterns for various cancers. Biological experiments on drug resistance further validated one important advantage of our method over the traditional methods, i.e., we even identified those drug resistance genes that actually have no clearly differential expression between samples with and without the resistance, due to the additional network information.",
