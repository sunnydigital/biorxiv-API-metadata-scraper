    "abstract": "1 MotivationA series of methods in population genetics use multilocus genotype data to assign individuals membership in latent clusters. These methods belong to a broad class of mixed-membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation used to analyze text corpora. Inference from mixed-membership models can produce different output matrices when repeatedly applied to the same inputs, and the number of latent clusters is a parameter that is often varied in the analysis pipeline. For these reasons, quantifying, visualizing, and annotating the output from mixed-membership models are bottlenecks for investigators across multiple disciplines from ecology to text data mining.\\n\\n2 ResultsWe introduce pong, a network-graphical approach for analyzing and visualizing membership in latent clusters with a native D3.js interactive visualization. pong leverages efficient algorithms for solving the Assignment Problem to dramatically reduce runtime while increasing accuracy compared to other methods that process output from mixed-membership models. We apply pong to 225,705 unlinked genome-wide single-nucleotide variants from 2,426 unrelated individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project, and identify previously overlooked aspects of global human population structure. We show that pong outpaces current solutions by more than an order of magnitude in runtime while providing a customizable and interactive visualization of population structure that is more accurate than those produced by current tools.\\n\\n3 Availabilitypong is freely available and can be installed using the Python package management system pip. pongs source code is available at https://github.com/abehr/pong.\\n\\n4 Contactaaron_behr@alumni.brown.edu,\\n\\nsramachandran@brown.edu",

    "abstract": "HOT (high-occupancy target) regions, which are bound by a surprisingly large number of transcription factors, are considered to be among the most intriguing findings of recent years. An improved understanding of the roles that HOT regions play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying HOT regions across the spectrum of human cell types. We characterised and validated HOT regions in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and produced a catalogue of HOT regions in a broad range of human cell types. We found that HOT regions are associated with genes that control and define the developmental processes of the respective cell and tissue types. We also showed evidence of the developmental persistence of HOT regions at primitive enhancers and demonstrate unique signatures of HOT regions that distinguish them from typical enhancers and super-enhancers. Finally, we performed an epigenetic analysis to reveal the dynamic epigenetic regulation of HOT regions upon H1 differentiation. Taken together, our results provide a resource for the functional exploration of HOT regions and extend our understanding of the key roles of HOT regions in development and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs. However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers on a genome-wide scale remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding how leukocytes in the cervicovaginal and colorectal mucosae respond to pathogens, and how medical interventions affect these responses, is important for developing better tools to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. An effective cryopreservation protocol for these cells following their isolation will make studying them more feasible.\\n\\nMethods and findingsTo find an optimal cryopreservation protocol for mucosal mononuclear leukocytes, we compared cryopreservation media and procedures using human vaginal leukocytes and confirmed our results with endocervical and colorectal leukocytes. Specifically, we measured the recovery of viable vaginal T cells and macrophages after cryopreservation with different cryopreservation media and handling procedures. We found several cryopreservation media that led to recoveries above 75%. Limiting the number and volume of washes increased the fraction of cells recovered by 10-15%, possibly due to the small cell numbers in mucosal samples. We confirmed that our cryopreservation protocol also works well for both endocervical and colorectal leukocytes.\\n\\nCryopreserved leukocytes had slightly increased cytokine responses to antigenic stimulation relative to the same cells tested fresh. Additionally, we tested whether it is better to cryopreserve endocervical cells on the cytobrush or in suspension.\\n\\nConclusionsLeukocytes from cervicovaginal and colorectal tissues can be cryopreserved with good recovery of functional, viable cells using several different cryopreservation media. The number and volume of washes has an experimentally meaningful effect on the percentage of cells recovered. We provide a detailed, step-by-step protocol with best practices for cryopreservation of mucosal leukocytes.",

    "abstract": "One strategy for building ontologies covering domains such as disease or anatomy is to weave together existing knowledge sources (databases, vocabularies and ontologies) into single cohesive whole. A first step in this process is to generate mappings between the elements of these different sources. There are a number of well-known techniques for generating mappings (also known as ontology alignemnt), both manual and automatic[7]. Sometimes mappings are seen as an end in themselves, with the sources remaining in a loosely connected state. However, if we want to take the next step and use the mappings to integrate the different sources into a cohesive reference ontology, then we need to translate the mappings into precise logical relationships. This will allow us to safely merge equivalent concepts, creating a unified ontology. This translation is a non-trivial step, as each mapping can be interpreted as multiple different logical relationships, with each interpretation affecting the likelihood of the others. There is a lack of automated methods to assist with this last step; this resolution is typically performed by expert ontologists.\n\nHere we describe an ontology construction technique that takes two or more ontologies linked by hypothetical axioms, and estimates the most likely unified logical ontology. Hypothetical axioms can themselves be derived from semantically loose mappings. The method combines deductive reasoning and probabilistic inference and is called Bayesian OWL Ontology Merging (BOOM). We describe a special form k-BOOM that works by factorizing the probabilistic ontology into k submodules. We also briefly describe a supplemental lexical and knowledge-based technique for generating a set of hypothetical axioms from loose mappings.\n\nWe are currently using this technique to build a merged disease ontology (Monarch Disease Ontology; MonDO) that unifies a broad range of vocabularies into a consistent and coherent whole.",

    "abstract": "Complex behaviors demand temporal coordination among functionally distinct brain regions. The basal forebrains afferent and efferent structure suggests a capacity for mediating such coordination. During performance of a selective attention task, synaptic activity in this region was dominated by four amplitude-independent oscillations temporally organized by the phase of the slowest, a theta rhythm. Further, oscillatory amplitudes were precisely organized by task epoch and a robust input/output transform, from synchronous synaptic activity to spiking rates of basal forebrain neurons, was identified. For many neurons, spiking was temporally organized as phase precessing sequences against theta band field potential oscillations. Remarkably, theta phase precession advanced in parallel to task progression, rather than absolute spatial location or time. Together, the findings reveal a process by which associative brain regions can integrate independent oscillatory inputs and transform them into sequence-specific, rate-coded outputs that are adaptive to the pace with which organisms interact with their environment.",

Their repetitive nature poses genome assembly challenges and has stymied progress on the detailed study of satDNA structure. Here we use single molecule real-time sequencing reads to assemble and study the genomic structure of two complex satDNA loci in Drosophila melanogaster--260-bp and Responder--with unprecedented resolution. We find that complex satDNAs are organized into large tandem arrays interrupted by transposable elements. The homogenized repeats in the array center suggest that gene conversion and unequal crossovers drive the concerted evolution of repeats, the degree to which differs among satDNA loci. Both satDNA arrays have a higher order organization that suggests recent structural rearrangements. These assemblies provide a platform for the evolutionary and functional genomics of satDNAs in pericentric heterochromatin.",

Such understanding is crucial in light of ongoing environmental changes and the elevated risk of ecosystems alteration. In particular, knowledge of how humans may influence the structure of populations is imperative to allow for informed decisions in management and conservation as well as to gain a better understanding of anthropogenic impacts on the interplay between gene flow, genetic drift and selection. Here we use genome-wide molecular markers to characterize the population genetic structure and connectivity of Ipomoea purpurea, a noxious invasive weed. We likewise assess the interaction between natural and human-driven influences on genetic differentiation among populations. Our analyses find that human population density is an important predictor of pairwise population differentiation, suggesting that the agricultural and/or horticultural trade may be involved in maintaining some level of connectivity across distant agricultural fields. Climatic variation appears as an additional predictor of genetic connectivity in this species. We discuss the implications of these results and highlight future research needed to disentangle the mechanistic processes underlying population connectivity of weeds.",

Plant AGPase is a heterotetrameric enzyme that consists of large (LS) and small subunits (SS), which are encoded by two different genes. In this study, we showed that the conversion of Glu to Gly at position 370 in the LS of AGPase alters the heterotetrameric stability along with the binding properties of substrate and effectors of the enzyme. Kinetic analyses revealed that the affinity of the LSE370GSSWT AGPase for glucose-1-phosphate is 3-fold less than for wild type (WT) AGPase. Additionally, the LSE370GSSWT AGPase requires 3-fold more 3-phosphogyceric acid to be activated. Finally, the LSE370GSSWT AGPase is less heat stable compared with the WT AGPase. Computational analysis of the mutant Gly-370 in the 3D modeled LS AGPase showed that this residue changes charge distribution of the surface and thus affect stability of the LS AGPase and overall heat stability of the heterotetrameric AGPase. In summary, our results show that LSE370 intricately modulate the heat stability and enzymatic activity of the AGPase.",

    "abstract": "Bats are an important reservoir for pathogenic human respiratory and hemorrhagic viruses but only little is known about bat viruses causing gastroenteritis in humans, including rotavirus A strains (RVA). Only three RVA strains have been reported in bats in Kenya (straw-colored fruit bat) and in China (lesser horseshoe and a stoliczkas trident bat), being highly divergent from each other. To further elucidate the potential of bat RVAs to cause gastroenteritis in humans we started by investigating the genetic diversity of RVAs in fecal samples from 87 straw-colored fruit bats living in close contact with humans in Cameroon using metagenomics. Five samples contained significant numbers of RVA Illumina reads, sufficient to obtain their (near) complete genomes. A single RVA strain showed a close phylogenetic relationship with the Kenyan bat RVA strain in six gene segments, including VP7 (G25), whereas the other gene segments represented novel genotypes as ratified by the RCWG. The 4 other RVA strains were highly divergent from known strains (but very similar among each other) possessing all novel genotypes. Only the VP7 and VP4 genes showed a significant variability representing multiple novel G and P genotypes, indicating the frequent occurrence of reassortment events.\\n\\nComparing these bat RVA strains with currently used human RVA screening primers indicated that several of the novel VP7 and VP4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies. Therefore, novel VP6 based screening primers matching both human and bat RVAs were developed and used to screen samples from 25 infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population. Although RVA infections were identified in 36% of the infants, Sanger sequencing did not indicate evidence of interspecies transmissions.\\n\\nThis study identified multiple novel bat RVA strains, but further epidemiological studies in humans will have to assess if these viruses have the potential to cause gastroenteritis in humans.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the link between small-scale chromatin structure and large-scale chromosome folding during interphase is a prerequisite for understanding transcription. Yet, this link remains poorly investigated. Here, we introduce a simple biophysical model where interphase chromosomes are described in terms of the folding of chromatin sequences composed of alternating blocks of fibers with different thicknesses and flexibilities, and we use it to study the influence of sequence disorder on chromosome behaviors in space and time. By employing extensive computer simulations,we thus demonstrate that chromosomes undergo noticeable conformational changes only on length-scales smaller than 105 basepairs and time-scales shorter than a few seconds, and we suggest there might exist effective upper bounds to the detection of chromosome reorganization in eukaryotes. We prove the relevance of our framework by modeling recent experimental FISH data on murine chromosomes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA key determining factor in many important cellular processes as DNA transcription, for instance, the specific composition of the chromatin fiber sequence has a major influence on chromosome folding during interphase. Yet, how this is achieved in detail remains largely elusive. In this work, we explore this link by means of a novel quantitative computational polymer model for interphase chromosomes where the associated chromatin filaments are composed of mixtures of fibers with heterogeneous physical properties. Our work suggests a scenario where chromosomes undergo only limited reorganization, namely on length-scales below 105 basepairs and time-scales shorter than a few seconds. Our conclusions are supported by recent FISH data on murine chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications and other chromatin features partition the genome on multiple length scales. They define chromatin domains with distinct biological functions that come in sizes ranging from single modified DNA bases to several megabases in case of heterochromatic histone modifications. Due to chromatin folding, domains that are well separated along the linear nucleosome chain can form long-range interactions in three-dimensional space. It has now become a routine task to map epigenetic marks and chromatin structure by deep sequencing methods. However, assessing and comparing the properties of chromatin domains and their positional relationships across data sets without a priori assumptions remains challenging. Here, we introduce multi-scale correlation evaluation (MCORE), which uses the fluctuation spectrum of mapped sequencing reads to quantify and compare chromatin patterns over a broad range of length scales in a model-independent manner. We applied MCORE to map the chromatin landscape in mouse embryonic stem cells and differentiated neural cells. We integrated sequencing data from chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA expression, DNA methylation and chromosome conformation capture experiments into network models that reflect the positional relationships among these features on different genomic scales. Furthermore, we used MCORE to compare our experimental data to models for heterochromatin reorganization during differentiation. The application of correlation functions to deep sequencing data complements current evaluation schemes and will support the development of quantitative descriptions of chromatin networks.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes are long known to be co-transcribed in polycistrones, yet it remains impossible to study nascent mtDNA transcripts quantitatively in vivo using existing tools. To this end we used deep sequencing (GRO-seq and PRO-seq) and analyzed nascent mtDNA-encoded RNA transcripts in diverse human cell lines and metazoan organisms. Surprisingly, accurate detection of human mtDNA transcription initiation sites (TIS) in the heavy and light strands revealed a novel conserved transcription pausing site near the light strand TIS, upstream to the transcription-replication transition region. This pausing site correlated with the presence of a bacterial pausing sequence motif, yet the transcription pausing index varied quantitatively among the cell lines. Analysis of non-human organisms enabled de novo mtDNA sequence assembly, as well as detection of previously unknown mtDNA TIS, pausing, and transcription termination sites with unprecedented accuracy. Whereas mammals (chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, rat, and mouse) showed a human-like mtDNA transcription pattern, the invertebrate pattern (Drosophila and C. elegans) profoundly diverged. Our approach paves the path towards in vivo, quantitative, reference sequence-free analysis of mtDNA transcription in all eukaryotes.",

With the shift to high-throughput sequencing, a major challenge for clinical diagnostics is the cross-identification of variants called on their genomic position to resources that rely on transcript- or protein-based descriptions.\\n\\nMethodsWe evaluated the accuracy of three tools (SnpEff, Variant Effect Predictor and Variation Reporter) that generate transcript and protein-based variant nomenclature from genomic coordinates according to guidelines by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Our evaluation was based on comparisons to a manually curated list of 127 test variants of various types drawn from data sources, each with HGVS-compliant transcript and protein descriptors. We further evaluated the concordance between annotations generated by Snpeff and Variant Effect Predictor with those in major germline and cancer databases: ClinVar and COSMIC, respectively.\\n\\nResultsWe find that there is substantial discordance between the annotation tools and databases in the description of insertion and/or deletions. Accuracy based on our ground truth set was between 80-90% for coding and 50-70% for protein variants, numbers that are not adequate for clinical reporting. Exact concordance for SNV syntax was over 99.5% between ClinVar and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and SnpEff, but less than 90% for non-SNV variants. For COSMIC, exact concordance for coding and protein SNVs were between 65 and 88%, and less than 15% for insertions. Across the tools and datasets, there was a wide range of equivalent expressions describing protein variants.\\n\\nConclusionOur results reveal significant inconsistency in variant representation across tools and databases.

    "abstract": "Prediction of single-cross hybrid performance has been a major goal of plant breeders since the beginning of hybrid breeding. Genomic prediction has shown to be a promising approach, but only limited studies have examined the accuracy of predicting single cross performance. Most of the studies rather focused on predicting top cross performance using single tester to determine the inbred parents worth in hybrid combinations. Moreover, no studies have examined the potential of predicting single crosses made among random progenies derived from a series of biparental families, which resembles the structure of germplasm comprising the initial stages of a hybrid maize breeding pipeline. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of genomic prediction for identifying superior single crosses early in the breeding pipeline and optimize its application. To accomplish these objectives, we designed and analyzed a novel population of single-cross hybrids representing the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic/Non-Stiff Stalk heterotic pattern commonly used in the development of North American commercial maize hybrids. The single cross prediction accuracies estimated using cross-validation ranged from 0.40 to 0.74 for grain yield, 0.68 to 0.91 for plant height and 0.54 to 0.94 for staygreen depending on the number of tested parents of the single crosses. The genomic estimated general and specific combining abilities showed a clear advantage over the use of genomic covariances among single crosses, especially when one or both parents of the single cross were untested in hybrid combinations. Overall, our results suggest that genomic prediction of the performance of single crosses made using random progenies from the early stages of the breeding pipeline holds great potential to re-design hybrid breeding and increase its efficiency.",

Because the benefits of bet-hedging may manifest over long time intervals, bet-hedging strategies may be out-competed by strategies maximizing short-term fitness. Here, we investigate the interplay between two drivers of selection, environmental fluctuations and competition for limited resources, on different bet-hedging strategies. We consider an environment with frequent disasters that switch between which phenotypes they affect in a temporally-correlated fashion. We determine how organisms that stochastically switch between phenotypes at different rates fare in both competition and survival. When disasters are correlated in time, the best strategy for competition is among the worst for survival. Since the time scales over which the two agents of selection act are significantly different, environmental fluctuations and resource competition act in opposition and lead populations to evolve diversification strategies that ultimately drive them extinct.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection currently cannot be cured because the virus persists as integrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells despite years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). To characterize establishment, turnover, and evolution of viral DNA reservoirs we deep-sequenced the p17gag region of the HIV-1 genome from samples obtained after 3-18 years of suppressive ART from 10 patients. For each of these patients, whole genome deep-sequencing data of HIV-1 RNA populations before onset of ART were available from 6-12 longitudinal plasma samples spanning 5-8 years of untreated infection. This enabled a detailed analysis of the dynamics and origin of proviral DNA during ART. A median of 14% (range 0-42%) of the p17gag DNA sequences were overtly defective due to G-to-A hypermutation. The remaining sequences were remarkably similar to previously observed RNA sequences and showed no evidence of evolution over many years of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very similar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly before start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as a mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy. Rather, the data indicate that viral DNA variants are turning over as long as patients are untreated and that suppressive ART halts this turnover.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics experiments rely on accurate matching of experimental spectra against a database of protein sequences. Existing computational analysis methods are limited in the size of their sequence databases, which severely restricts the proteomic sequencing depth and functional analysis of highly complex samples. The growing amount of public high-throughput sequencing data will only exacerbate this problem. We designed a broadly applicable metaproteomic analysis method (ComPIL) that addresses protein database size limitations.\\n\\nResultsOur approach to overcome this significant limitation in metaproteomics was to design a scalable set of sequence databases assembled for optimal library querying speeds. ComPIL was integrated with a modified version of the search engine ProLuCID (termed \\\"Blazmass\\\") to permit rapid matching of experimental spectra. Proof-of-principle analysis of human HEK293 lysate with a ComPIL database derived from high-quality genomic libraries was able to detect nearly all of the same peptides as a search with a human database (~500x fewer peptides in the database), with a small reduction in sensitivity. We were also able to detect proteins from the adenovirus used to immortalize these cells. We applied our method to a set of healthy human gut microbiome proteomic samples and showed a substantial increase in the number of identified peptides and proteins compared to previous metaproteomic analyses, while retaining a high degree of protein identification accuracy, and allowing for a more in-depth characterization of the functional landscape of the samples.\\n\\nConclusionsThe combination of ComPIL with Blazmass allows proteomic searches to be performed with database sizes much larger than previously possible. These large database searches can be applied to complex meta-samples with unknown composition or proteomic samples where unexpected proteins may be identified. The protein database, proteomics search engine, and the proteomic data files for the 5 microbiome samples characterized and discussed herein are open source and available for use and additional analysis.",

    "abstract": "Although bacteria within the Verrucomicrobia phylum are pervasive in soils around the world, they are underrepresented in both isolate collections and genomic databases. Here we describe a single verrucomicrobial phylotype within the class Spartobacteria that is not closely related to any previously described taxa. We examined >1000 soils and found this spartobacterial phylotype to be ubiquitous and consistently one of the most abundant soil bacterial phylotypes, particularly in grasslands, where it was typically the most abundant phylotype. We reconstructed a nearly complete genome of this phylotype from a soil metagenome for which we propose the provisional name  Candidatus Udaeobacter copiosus. The Ca. U. copiosus genome is unusually small for soil bacteria, estimated to be only 2.81 Mbp compared to the predicted effective mean genome size of 4.74 Mbp for soil bacteria. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that Ca. U. copiosus is an aerobic chemoorganoheterotroph with numerous amino acid and vitamin auxotrophies. The large population size, relatively small genome and multiple putative auxotrophies characteristic of Ca. U. copiosus suggests that it may be undergoing streamlining selection to minimize cellular architecture, a phenomenon previously thought to be restricted to aquatic bacteria. Although many soil bacteria need relatively large, complex genomes to be successful in soil, Ca. U. copiosus appears to have identified an alternate strategy, sacrificing metabolic versatility for efficiency to become dominant in the soil environment.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) is an emerging technique, developed to non-invasively modulate brain function. However, the spatiotemporal distribution of the intracranial electric fields induced by TES remains poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how much current actually reaches the brain, and how it distributes across the brain. Lack of this basic information precludes a firm mechanistic understanding of TES effects. In this study we directly measure the spatial and temporal characteristics of the electric field generated by TES using stereotactic EEG (s-EEG) electrode arrays implanted in cebus monkeys and surgical epilepsy patients. We found a small frequency dependent decrease (10%) in magnitudes of TES induced potentials and negligible phase shifts over space. Electric field strengths were strongest in superficial brain regions with maximum values of about 0.5 mV/mm. Our results provide crucial information for the interpretation of human TES studies and the optimization and design of TES stimulation protocols. In addition, our findings have broad implications concerning electric field propagation in non-invasive recording techniques such as EEG/MEG.",

    "abstract": "The rapid three-fold enlargement of the hominin brain1,2 began about 2.3 million years ago (myr) as Africa dried and grass replaced brush, creating great savannas3. Seeking an amplifying feedback loop, I analyzed the lightning-brush-fire ecology for grazing animals in a grassy burn scar4. Discovering the new grass by exploring brush byways could promote a population boom-but only after grass-specialized herbivores evolved from mixed feeders5 at 2.4 myr. When the brush returned several decades later, the grazer boom would turn to bust, squeezing numerous descendants back into the core grasslands. Meat-eating Homo species would boom and bust when grazers did, enriching the core in whatever alleles were earlier concentrated in the brush fringe catchment zone for that boom. This return migration for Homo is what creates the amplifying feedback loop that speeds brain enlargement rate, likely up to the mutation rate limit. It also promotes trait hitchhiking: any brush-relevant allele, not just those for hunting, can experience amplifying feedback merely by hanging out in the catchment zone4. The shade offered by brush would have been the default location for cooperative nurseries, time-consuming food preparation, and toolmaking. Increased behavioral versatility correlates with larger brain size and the more versatile brains of a current generation need only spend more-than-average time in the booms catchment zone for this recursive evolutionary process to keep average brain size increasing via assortative mating. This helps account for the time when enlargement began, why it was linear, when it ended, and why it slowed in Neanderthals and in Asian Homo erectus. Without utilizing Darwins selective survival, the feedback loop makes advance room for \\\"free\\\" future functionality in the cerebral cortex, likely relevant to the evolutionary emergence of our structured intellectual functions6 such as syntax, contingent planning, games, and logic.",

    "abstract": "Here I analyze the brush-fire cycle behind the brushy frontier of a grassland, seeking evolutionary feedback loops for large grazing animals and their hominin predators. Several months after a lightning strike, the burn scar grows enough new grass to expand the carrying capacity for grass-specialized herbivores,which evolved from mixed feeders in Africa during the early Pleistocene. The frontier subpopulation of grazers that discovers the auxiliary grassland quickly multiplies,creating a secondary boom for its hominin predators as well. Following this boom, a bust occurs several decades later when the brush returns; it squeezes both prey and predator populations back into the core grassland. This creates a feedback loop that can repeatedly shift the cores gene frequencies toward those of the frontier subpopulation until fixation occurs. Any brush-relevant allele could benefit from this amplifying feedback loop, so long as its phenotypes concentrate near where fresh resources can suddenly open up, back in the brush. Thus, traits concentrated in the frontier fringe can hitchhike; improved survival is not needed. This is natural selection but utilizin selective reproductive opportunity instead of the usual selective survival. Cooperative nurseries in the brushs shade should concentrate the alleles favoring eusociality, repeatedly increasing their proportion via trait hitchhiking in the feedback loop.",
