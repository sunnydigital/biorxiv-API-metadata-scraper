    "abstract": "MotivationThe underlying genomic variation of a large number of pathogenic viruses can give rise to drug resistant mutations resulting in treatment failure. Next generation sequencing (NGS) enables the identification of viral quasi-species and the quantification of minority variants in clinical samples; therefore, it can be of direct benefit by detecting drug resistant mutations and devising optimal treatment strategies for individual patients.\\n\\nResultsThe ICONIC (InfeCtion respONse through vIrus genomiCs) project has developed an automated, portable and customisable high-throughput computational pipeline to assemble de novo whole viral genomes, either segmented or non-segmented, and quantify minority variants using residual diagnostic samples. The pipeline has been benchmarked on a dedicated High-Performance Computing cluster using paired-end reads from RSV and Influenza clinical samples. The median length of generated genomes was 96% for the RSV dataset and 100% for each Influenza segment. The analysis of each set lasted less than 12 hours; each sample took around 3 hours and required a maximum memory of 10 GB. The pipeline can be easily ported to a dedicated server or cluster through either an installation script or a docker image. As it enables the subtyping of viral samples and the detection of relevant drug resistance mutations within three days of sample collection, our pipeline could operate within existing clinical reporting time frames and potentially be used as a decision support tool towards more effective personalised patient treatments.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software and its documentation are available from https://github.com/ICONIC-UCL/pipeline\\n\\nContactt.cassarino@ucl.ac.uk, pk5@sanger.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The ability to quantify cellular heterogeneity is a major advantage of single-cell technologies. Although understanding such heterogeneity is of primary interest in a number of studies, for convenience, statistical methods often treat cellular heterogeneity as a nuisance factor. We present a novel method to characterize differences in expression in the presence of distinct expression states within and among biological conditions. Using simulated and case study data, we demonstrate that the modeling framework is able to detect differential expression patterns of interest under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing approaches, scDD has higher power to detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions that are more complex than a mean shift, and is able to characterize those differences. The freely available R package scDD implements the approach.",

    "abstract": "Microbial fatty acids preserve metabolic and environmental information in their hydrogen isotope ratios (2H/1H). This ratio is influenced by parameters that include the 2H/1H of water in the microbial growth environment, and biosynthetic fractionations between water and lipid. In some microbes, this biosynthetic fractionation has been shown to vary systematically with central energy metabolism, and controls on fatty acid 2H/1H may be linked to the intracellular production of NADPH. We examined the apparent fractionation between media water and the fatty acids produced by Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20. Growth was in batch culture with malate as an electron donor for sulfate respiration, and with pyruvate and fumarate as substrates for fermentation and for sulfate respiration. A larger fractionation was observed as a consequence of respiratory or fermentative growth on pyruvate than growth on fumarate or malate. This difference correlates with opposite apparent flows of electrons through the electron bifurcating/confurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB. When grown on malate or fumarate, mutant strains of D. alaskensis G20 containing transposon disruptions in a copy of nfnAB show different fractionations than the wild type strain. This phenotype is muted during fermentative growth on pyruvate, and it is absent when pyruvate is a substrate for sulfate reduction. All strains and conditions produced similar fatty acid profiles, and the 2H/1H of individual lipids changed in concert with the mass-weighted average. Unsaturated fatty acids were generally depleted in 2H relative to their saturated homologues, and anteiso-branched fatty acids were generally depleted in 2H relative to straight-chain fatty acids. Fractionation correlated with growth rate, a pattern that has also been observed in the fractionation of sulfur isotopes during dissimilatory sulfate reduction by sulfate reducing bacteria.",

A set of modular bioinformatic tools and workflows was implemented as the Metavisitor package in the Galaxy framework. Using the graphical Galaxy workflow editor, users with minimal computational skills can use existing Metavisitor workflows or adapt them to suit specific needs by adding or modifying analysis modules. Metavisitor can be used on our Mississippi server, or can be installed on any Galaxy server instance and a pre-configured Metavisitor server image is provided. Metavisitor works with DNA, RNA or small RNA sequencing data over a range of read lengths and can use a combination of de novo and guided approaches to assemble genomes from sequencing reads. We show that the software has the potential for quick diagnosis as well as discovery of viruses from a vast array of organisms. Importantly, we provide here executable Metavisitor use cases, which increase the accessibility and transparency of the software, ultimately enabling biologists or clinicians to focus on biological or medical questions.",

Using datasets from intracortical multi-electrode recordings and from large-scale electrocorticography (ECoG) grids, we investigated how visual features could be extracted from the local field potential (LFP) and how this compared with the information available from multi-unit activity (MUA). MUA recorded from macaque V1 contained comparable amounts of information as simultaneously recorded LFP power in two frequency bands, one in the alpha-beta band and the other in the gamma band. ECoG-LFP contained information in the same bands as microelectrode-LFP, even when identifying natural scenes.

To study the establishment of asymmetry and the development of the anteroposterior axis (AP) in culture, we utilised our Gastruloid model system. Gastruloids, highly reproducible embryonic organoids formed from aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells, display symmetry-breaking, polarised gene expression and axial development, mirroring the processes on a time-scale similar to that of the mouse embyro. Using Gastruloids formed from mouse ESCs containing reporters for Wnt, FGF and Nodal signalling, we were able to quantitatively assess the contribution of these signalling pathways to the establishment of asymmetry through single time-point and live-cell fluorescence microscopy.\\n\\nDuring the first 24-48h of culture, interactions between the Wnt/{beta}-Catenin and Nodal/TGF{beta} signalling pathways promote the initial symmetry-breaking event, manifested through polarised Brachyury (T/Bra) expression. Neither BMP nor FGF signalling is required for the establishment of asymmetry, however Wnt signalling is essential for the amplification and stability of the initial patterning event. Additionally, low, endogenous levels of FGF (24-48h) has a role in the amplification of the established pattern at later time-points.\\n\\nOur results confirm that Gastruloids behave like epiblast cells in the embryo, leading us to translate the processes and signalling involved in pattern formation of Gastruloids in culture to the development of the embryo, firmly establishing Gastruloids as a highly reproducible, robust model system for studying cell fate decisions and early pattern formation in culture.",

    "abstract": "Actomyosin contraction and relaxation in a monolayer is a fundamental biophysical process in development and homeostasis. Current methods used to characterize the mechanodynamics of monolayers often involve cells grown on solid supports such as glass or gels. The results of these studies are fundamentally influenced by these supporting structures. Here, we describe a new methodology for measuring the mechanodynamics of epithelial monolayers by culturing cells at an air-liquid interface. These model monolayers are grown in the absence of any supporting structures allowing us to remove cell-substrate effects. This methods potential was evaluated by observing and quantifying the generation and release of internal stresses upon actomyosin contraction (320{+/-}50Pa) and relaxation (190{+/-}40Pa) in response to chemical treatments. This is in contrast to the results observed in monolayers grown on solid substrates (glass and gels) where movement was drastically muted. Tracking the displacement of cell nuclei, cell edges and cluster perimeter allowed us to quantify the strain dynamics in the monolayer indicating the reliability of this method. New insights were also revealed with this approach. Although unsupported monolayers exhibited clear major and minor strain axes, they were not correlated to the general alignment of cell nuclei. The situation was dramatically different when the monolayers were grown on soft gels and hard glass substrates. It was observed that both gels and glass substrates led to the promotion of long-range alignment of cell nuclei. In addition, the strain orientation was correlated to nuclear alignment on the soft deformable gels. This new approach provides us with a picture of basal actomyosin mechanodynamics in a simplified system allowing us to infer how the presence of a substrate impacts actomyosin contractility and long-range multi-cellular organization and dynamics. This new methodology will also enable many new questions to be asked about the molecular regulation of the mechanodynamics of unsupported monolayers.",

    "abstract": "The response to a panel of steroids by the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from Amur sturgeon and tropical gar, two basal ray-finned fish, expressed in HEK293 cells was investigated. Half-maximal responses (EC50s) for transcriptional activation of sturgeon MR by 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol and aldosterone, and progesterone were between 13 pM and 150 pM. For gar MR, EC50s were between 8 pM and 55 pM. Such low EC50s support physiological regulation by these steroids of the MR in sturgeon and gar. Companion studies with human MR and zebrafish MR found higher EC50s compared to EC50s for sturgeon and gar MR, with EC50s for zebrafish MR closer to gar and sturgeon MR than was human MR. For zebrafish MR, EC50s were between 75 pM and 740 pM; for human MR, EC50s were between 65 pM and 2 nM. In addition to progesterone, spironolactone and 19nor-progesterone were agonists for all three fish MRs, in contrast to their antagonist activity for human MR, which is hypothesized to involve serine-810 in human MR because all three steroids are agonists for a mutant human Ser810Leu-MR. Paradoxically, sturgeon, gar and zebrafish MRs contain a serine corresponding to serine-810 in human MR. Our data suggests alternative mechanism(s) for progesterone, spironolactone and 19nor-progesterone as MR agonists in these three ray-finned fishes and the need for caution in applying data for progesterone signaling in zebrafish to human physiology.",

    "abstract": "The growth of pathogens is dictated by their interactions with the host environment. Many obligate intracellular pathogens undergo several cellular decisions as they progress through their life cycles inside of host cells. We studied this process for several species of microsporidia in the genus Nematocida in their co-evolved animal host Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that microsporidia can restructure multicellular host tissues into a single contiguous multinucleate cell. In particular, we found that all three Nematocida species we studied were able to spread across the cells of C. elegans tissues before forming spores, with two species causing syncytial formation in the intestine, and one species causing syncytial formation in the muscle. We also found that the decision to switch from replication to differentiation in N. parisii was altered by the density of infection, suggesting that environmental cues influence the dynamics of the pathogen life cycle. These findings show how microsporidia can maximize the use of host space for growth, and that environmental cues in the host can regulate a developmental switch in the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Determining the structure of a protein by any method requires varies contributions from experimental and computational sides. In a recent study, high-density cross-linking/mass spectrometry data in combination with ab initio structure prediction by conformational space search determined the structure of human serum albumin (HSA) domains, with an RMSD to X-ray structure of up to 2.53 [A], or 3.38 [A] in the context of blood serum. This paper reports the blind test on the readiness of this technology through the help of Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). We identified between 201-381 unique residue pairs at an estimated 5% FDR (at link level albeit with missing site assignment precision evaluation), for the four proteins that we provided data for. This equates to between 0.63-1.20 proximal residues per residue, which is comparable to that obtained in the HSA study (0.85 links per residue at 5% FDR). Nevertheless, initial results of CASP11 have suggested that improvements in structure prediction using cross-link data are slight. Most significantly, however, CASP11 revealed to us some of the current limitations of cross-linking, spelling out areas in which the method must develop in future: links spread unevenly over sequence and beta sheets both lacked links and suffered from weak definition of observed links over structure. With CASP12 taking place this year and biannually in the future, blind testing low-resolution structure analysis tools is a worthwhile and feasible undertaking.

    "abstract": "Embryonic axis extension is a complex multi-tissue morphogenetic process responsible for the formation of the posterior part of the amniote body. Cells located in the caudal part of the embryo divide and rearrange to participate in the elongation of the different embryonic tissues (e.g. neural tube, axial and paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate, ectoderm, endoderm). We previously identified the paraxial mesoderm as a crucial player of axis elongation, but how movements and growth are coordinated between the different posterior tissues to drive morphogenesis remain largely unknown. Here we use the quail embryo as a model system to quantify cell behavior and movements in the various tissues of the elongating embryo. We first quantify the tissue-specific contribution to axis elongation by using 3D volumetric techniques, then quantify tissue-specific parameters such as cell density and proliferation at different embryonic stages. To be able to study cell behavior at a multi-tissue scale we used high-resolution 4D imaging of transgenic quail embryos expressing constitutively expressed fluorescent proteins. We developed specific tracking and image analysis techniques to analyze cell motion and compute tissue deformations in 4D. This analysis reveals extensive sliding between tissues during axis extension. Further quantification of \\\"tissue tectonics\\\" showed patterns of rotations, contractions and expansions, which are coherent with the multi-tissue behavior observed previously. Our results confirm the central role of the PSM in axis extension; we propose that the PSM specific cell proliferation and migration programs control the coordination of elongation between tissues during axis extension.",

    "abstract": "High throughput RNA sequencing technologies have provided invaluable research opportunities across distinct scientific domains by producing quantitative readouts of the transcriptional activity of both entire cellular populations and single cells. The majority of RNA-Seq analyses begin by mapping each experimentally produced sequence (i.e., read) to a set of annotated reference sequences for the organism of interest. For both biological and technical reasons, a significant fraction of reads remains unmapped. In this work, we develop Read Origin Protocol (ROP) to discover the source of all reads originating from complex RNA molecules, recombinant T and B cell receptors, and microbial communities. We applied ROP to 8,641 samples across 630 individuals from 54 tissues. A fraction of RNA-Seq data (n=86) was obtained in-house; the remaining data was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v6) project. To generalize the reported number of accounted reads, we also performed ROP analysis on thousands of different, randomly selected, and publicly available RNA-Seq samples in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Our approach can account for 99.9% of 1 trillion reads of various read length across the merged dataset (n=10641). Using in-house RNA-Seq data, we show that immune profiles of asthmatic individuals are significantly different from the profiles of control individuals, with decreased average per sample T and B cell receptor diversity. We also show that immune diversity is inversely correlated with microbial load. Our results demonstrate the potential of ROP to exploit unmapped reads in order to better understand the functional mechanisms underlying connections between the immune system, microbiome, human gene expression, and disease etiology. ROP is freely available at https://github.com/smangul1/rop and currently supports human and mouse RNA-Seq reads.",

    "abstract": "The rising threat of antibiotic resistance in Europe and beyond is of increasing concern and is prompting renewed effort to better understand and mitigate their impact. Escherichia Coli blood stream infections are a more major concern in Europe given their incidence and severe associated outcomes. Additionally the level of 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems resistance among those bacteraemia has significantly increased, limiting available treatment options. We estimated the current burden associated with E. coli blood stream infections in Europe at 17,000 (95%CI [8,000; 30,000]) excess deaths and 960,000 (95%CI [600,000; 1,450,000]) extra hospital bed days. From those, the contribution due to 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems resistant strains reached 6,000 (95%CI [2,000; 12,000]) excess deaths, and 200,000 (95%CI [76,000; 420,000]) extra hospital bed stay. In the worst case scenario, we estimated the burden of E. coli blood stream infection in 2026 could increase over 4-fold, mostly resulting from an increase in the level of resistance rather than an increase in the incidence of blood stream infections. Finally, we estimated that the impact of combined novel diagnostics and treatments could substantially reduce the excess mortality by 18.5% to 55.5%, and length of stay by 13.2% to 75.6%.",

    "abstract": "In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, specification of the legs begins during embryogenesis when Wingless signaling induces small groups of cells to form the imaginal disc primordia in the thoracic segments. This signal initiates expression of transcription factors that will later be used to pattern the legs. The paralogous genes disconnected and disco-related encode transcription factors that are expressed in the disc primordia during early embryogenesis, and their expression continues in the leg discs during larval and pupal stages. The importance of these two genes in establishing the leg development trajectory was indicated by our previous observation that ectopic expression of either gene in the wing discs cells caused legs to develop in place of wings. However, because of their redundancy and requirement for survival during embryogenesis, we were unable to define their role in development of the adult legs. Here, we report loss-of-function analyses of the disco genes during development of the legs. We discovered that loss of both genes functions causes both truncation of the distal leg with apparent overgrowth of proximal regions and complete loss of legs and ventral thoracic body patterning. At the molecular level we noted reduction or loss of signaling and transcription factors that pattern the proximal-distal axis of the legs. We conclude from these studies that the disco genes promote leg development through regulation of signaling processes, but also by stabilizing expression of the leg determination gene network.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression can provide biological mechanisms which underlie genetic associations with complex traits and diseases, but often the most relevant tissue for the trait is inaccessible and a proxy is the only alternative. Here, we investigate shared and tissue specific patterns of variability in expression in multiple tissues, to quantify the degree of sharing of causes (genetic or non-genetic) of variability in gene expression among tissues. Using gene expression in ~800 female twins from the TwinsUK cohort in skin, fat, whole blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), we identified 9166 significant cis-eQTLs in fat, 9551 in LCLs, 8731 in skin and 5313 in blood (1% FDR). We observed up to 80% of cis-eQTLs are shared in pairs of tissues. In addition, the cis genetic correlation between tissues is > 90% for 35% of the genes, indicating for these genes a largely tissue-shared component of cis regulation. However, variance components show that cis genetic signals explain only a small fraction of the variation in expression, with from 67-87% of the variance explained by environmental factors, and 53% of the genetic effects occurring in trans. We observe a trans genetic correlation of 0 for all genes except a few which show correlation between fat and skin expression. The environmental effects are also observed to be entirely tissue specific, despite related tissues largely sharing exposures. These results demonstrate that patterns of gene expression are largely tissue specific, strongly supporting the need to study higher order regulatory interactions in the appropriate tissue context with large samples sizes and diversity of environmental contexts.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common disease have been hugely successful in implicating loci that modify disease risk. The bulk of these associations have proven robust and reproducible, in part due to community adoption of statistical criteria for claiming significant genotype-phenotype associations. Currently, studies of common disease are rapidly shifting towards the use of sequencing technologies. As the cost of sequencing drops, assembling large samples in global populations is becoming increasingly feasible. Sequencing studies interrogate not only common variants, as was true for genotyping-based GWAS, but variation across the full allele frequency spectrum, yielding many more (independent) statistical tests. We sought to empirically determine genome-wide significance for various analysis scenarios. Using whole-genome sequence data, we simulated sequencing-based disease studies of varying sample size and ancestry. We determined that future sequencing efforts in >2,000 samples should practically employ a genome-wide significance threshold of of p <5 x10-9, though the threshold does vary with ancestry. Studies of European or East Asian ancestry should set genome-wide significance at approximately p <5x10-9, but similar studies of African or South Asian samples should be more stringent (p <1x10-9). Because sequencing analysis brings with it many challenges (especially for rare variants), appropriate adoption of a revised multiple test correction will be crucial to avoid irreproducible claims of association.",

    "abstract": "The autoregulatory motif of Nanog, a heterogeneously expressed core pluripotency factor in mouse embryonic stem cells, remains debated. Although recent time-lapse microscopy data provide the unparalleled ability to monitor Nanog expression at the single-cell level, the extraction of mechanistic knowledge is precluded by the lack of inference techniques suitable for noisy, incomplete and heterogeneous data obtained from proliferating cell populations.\\n\\nThis work identifies Nanogs autoregulatory motif from quantified time-lapse fluorescence line-age trees with STILT (Stochastic Inference on Lineage Trees), a novel particle-filter based algorithm for exact Bayesian parameter inference and model selection of stochastic models. We first verify STILTs ability to accurately infer parameters and select the correct autoregulatory motif from simulated data. We then apply STILT to time-lapse microscopy movies of a fluorescent Nanog fusion protein reporter and reject the possibility of positive autoregulation. Finally, we use STILT for experimental design, perform in silico overexpression simulations, and experimentally validate model predictions via exogenous Nanog overexpression. We finally conclude that the protein expression dynamics and overexpression experiments strongly suggest a weak negative feedback from the protein on the DNA activation rate.\\n\\nWe find that a simple autoregulatory mechanism can explain the observed heterogeneous Nanog dynamics. This finding has implications on the understanding of the core pluripotency network, such as supporting the ability of mESC populations to diversify their proteomic profile to respond to a spectrum of differentiation cues. Beyond this application STILT constitutes a generally applicable fully Bayesian approach for model selection of gene regulatory models on the basis of time-lapse imaging data of proliferating cell populations.

    "abstract": "Understanding why some exotic species become widespread and abundant in their colonized range is a fundamental issue that still needs to be addressed. Among many hypotheses, newly established host populations may benefit from a parasite loss (\\\"enemy release\\\" hypothesis) through impoverishment of their original parasite communities or reduced infection levels. Moreover, the fitness of competing native hosts may be affected by the acquisition of exotic taxa from invaders (\\\"parasite spillover\\\") and/or by an increased transmission risk of native parasites due to their amplification by invaders (\\\"parasite spillback\\\"). We focused on gastrointestinal helminth communities to determine whether these predictions could explain the ongoing invasion success of the commensal house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), as well as the associated drop of native Mastomys species, in Senegal. For both invasive species, our results were consistent with the predictions of the enemy release hypothesis. A decrease of helminth overall prevalence and individual species richness was observed along the invasion gradients as well as lower specific prevalence/abundance (Aspiculuris tetraptera in M. m. domesticus, Hymenolepis diminuta in R. rattus) on the invasion fronts. Conversely, we did not find strong evidence of helminth spill-over or spill-back in invasion fronts, where native and invasive rodents co-occurred. Further experimental research is needed to determine whether and how the loss of helminths and reduced infection levels along invasion routes may result in any advantageous effects on invader fitness and competitive advantage.",

    "abstract": "The opsin gene family encodes key proteins animals use to sense light and has expanded dramatically since it originated early in animal evolution. Understanding the origins of opsin diversity can offer clues to how separate lineages of animals have repurposed different opsin paralogs for different light-detecting functions. However, the more we look for opsins outside of eyes and from additional animal phyla, the more opsins we uncover, suggesting we still do not know the true extent of opsin diversity, nor the ancestry of opsin diversity in animals. To estimate the number of opsin paralogs present in both the last common ancestor of the Nephrozoa (bilaterians excluding Xenoacoelomorpha), and the ancestor of Cnidaria + Bilateria, we reconstructed a reconciled opsin phylogeny using sequences from 14 animal phyla, especially the traditionally poorly-sampled echinoderms and molluscs. Our analysis strongly supports a repertoire of at least nine opsin paralogs in the bilaterian ancestor and at least four opsin paralogs in the last common ancestor of Cnidaria + Bilateria. Thus, the kernels of extant opsin diversity arose much earlier in animal history than previously known. Further, opsins likely duplicated and were lost many times, with different lineages of animals maintaining different repertoires of opsin paralogs. This phylogenetic information can inform hypotheses about the functions of different opsin paralogs and be used to understand how and when opsins were incorporated into complex traits like eyes and extraocular sensors.",
