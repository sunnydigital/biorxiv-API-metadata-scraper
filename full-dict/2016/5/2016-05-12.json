    "abstract": "Populations continually incur new mutations with fitness effects ranging from lethal to adaptive. While the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations is not directly observable, many mutations likely have either no effect on organismal fitness or are deleterious. Historically, it has been hypothesized that a population may carry many mildly deleterious variants as segregating variation, which reduces the mean absolute fitness of the population. Recent advances in sequencing technology and sequence conservation-based metrics for inferring the functional effect of a variant permit examination of the persistence of deleterious variants in populations. The issue of segregating deleterious variation is particularly important for crop improvement, because the demographic history of domestication and breeding allows deleterious variants to persist and reach moderate frequency, potentially reducing crop productivity. In this study, we use exome resequencing of fifteen barley accessions and genome resequencing of eight soybean accessions to investigate the prevalence of deleterious SNPs in the protein-coding regions of the genomes of two crops. We conclude that individual cultivars carry hundreds of deleterious SNPs on average, and that nonsense variants make up a minority of deleterious SNPs. Our approach annotates known phenotype-altering variants as deleterious more frequently than the genome-wide average, suggesting that putatively deleterious variants are likely to affect phenotypic variation. We also report the implementation of a SNP annotation tool (BAD_Mutations) that makes use of a likelihood ratio test based on alignment of all currently publicly available Angiosperm genomes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCodon models are widely used to identify the signature of selection at the molecular level and to test for changes in selective pressure during the evolution of genes encoding proteins. The large size of the state space of the Markov processes used to model codon evolution makes it difficult to use these models with large biological datasets. We propose here to use state aggregation to reduce the state space of codon models and, thus, improve the computational performance of likelihood estimation on these models.\\n\\nResultsWe show that this heuristic speeds up the computations of the M0 and branch-site models up to 6.8 times. We also show through simulations that state aggregation does not introduce a detectable bias. We analysed a real dataset and show that aggregation provides highly correlated predictions compared to the full likelihood computations. Finally, state aggregation is a very general approach and can be applied to any continuous-time Markov process-based model with large state space, such as amino acid and coevolution models. We therefore discuss different ways to apply state aggregation to Markov models used in phylogenetics.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe heuristic is implemented in the godon package (https://bitbucket.org/Davydov/godon) and in a version of FastCodeML (https://gitlab.isb-sib.ch/phylo/fastcodeml).",

    "abstract": "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.",

Here, we have mapped with electron microscopy the complete wiring diagram of the Drosophila larval antennal lobe, an olfactory neuropil similar to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We found a canonical circuit with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits and behavior.",

Previous reports revealed widespread 3' modifications (truncations and non-templated tailing) of plant miRNAs when the 2'-C-methyltransferase HEN1 is absent. However, non-templated nucleotides in plant heterochromatic siRNAs have not been deeply studied, especially in wild-type plants. We systematically studied non-templated nucleotide patterns in plant small RNAs by analyzing small RNA sequencing libraries from Arabidopsis. tomato, Medicago, rice, maize, and Physcomitrella. Elevated rates of non-templated nucleotides were observed at the 3' ends of both miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs from wild-type specimens of all species. 'Off-sized' small RNAs, such as 25 and 23 nt siRNAs arising from loci dominated by 24 nt siRNAs, often had very high rates of 3'-non-templated nucleotides. The same pattern was observed in all species that we studied. Further analysis of 24 nt siRNA clusters in Arabidopsis revealed distinct patterns of 3'-non-templated nucleotides of 23 nt siRNAs arising from heterochromatic siRNA loci. This pattern of non-templated 3' nucleotides on 23 nt siRNAs is not affected by loss of known small RNA 3'-end modifying enzymes, and may result from modifications added to longer heterochromatic siRNA precursors.",

These high-dimensional population snapshot techniques are complemented by low-dimensional time-resolved, microscopy-based monitoring methods. Both fronts of advance have exposed a rich heterogeneity of cell states within uniform cell populations in many biological contexts, producing a new kind of data that has stimulated a series of computational analysis methods for data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and cluster (subpopulation) identification. The next step is now to go beyond collecting data and correlating data points: to connect the dots, that is, to understand what actually underlies the identified data patterns. This entails interpreting the \\\"clouds of points\\\" in state space as a manifestation of the underlying molecular regulatory network. In that way control of cell state dynamics can be formalized as a quasi-potential landscape, as first proposed by Waddington. We summarize key methods of data acquisition and computational analysis and explain the principles that link the single-cell resolution measurements to dynamical systems theory.",

    "abstract": "Several taxonomically distinct mammalian groups - certain microbats and cetaceans (e.g. dolphins) - share both morphological adaptations related to echolocation behavior and strong signatures of convergent evolution at the amino acid level across seven genes related to auditory processing. Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) are nocturnal lemurs with a derived auditory processing system. Aye-ayes tap rapidly along the surfaces of dead trees, listening to reverberations to identify the mines of wood-boring insect larvae; this behavior has been hypothesized to functionally mimic echolocation. Here we investigated whether there are signals of genomic convergence between aye-ayes and known mammalian echolocators. We developed a computational pipeline (BEAT: Basic Exon Assembly Tool) that produces consensus sequences for regions of interest from shotgun genomic sequencing data for non-model organisms without requiring de novo genome assembly. We reconstructed complete coding region sequences for the seven convergent echolocating bat-dolphin genes for aye-ayes and another lemur. Sequences were compared in a phylogenetic framework to those of bat and dolphin echolocators and appropriate non-echolocating outgroups. Our analysis reaffirms the existence of amino acid convergence at these loci among echolocating bats and dolphins; we also detected unexpected signals of convergence between echolocating bats and both mice and elephants. However, we observed no significant signal of amino acid convergence between aye-ayes and echolocating bats and dolphins; our results thus suggest that aye-aye tap-foraging auditory adaptations represent distinct evolutionary innovations. These results are also consistent with a developing consensus that convergent behavioral ecology is not necessarily a reliable guide to convergent molecular evolution.",

To diversify the set of tools available for wheat genome engineering, we have established a tRNA-based multiplex gene editing strategy for hexaploid wheat.\\n\\nResultsThe functionality of the various CRISPR/Cas9 components was assessed using the transient expression in the wheat protoplasts followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the targeted genomic regions. The efficiency of wheat codon-optimized Cas9 for targeted gene editing in wheat was validated. Multiple single guide RNAs (gRNAs) were evaluated for the ability to edit the homoeologous copies of four genes affecting some important agronomic traits in wheat. Low correspondence was found between the gRNA efficiency predicted bioinformatically and that assessed in the transient expression assay. A multiplex gene editing construct with several gRNA-tRNA units under the control of a single promoter for the RNA polymerase III generated indels at the targets sites with the efficiency comparable to that obtained for a single gRNA construct.\\n\\nConclusionsBy integrating the protoplast transformation assay with multiplexed NGS, it is possible to perform fast functional screens for a large number of gRNAs and to optimize constructs for effective editing of multiple independent targets in the wheat genome. The multiplexing capacity of the tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA construct is well suited for the simultaneous editing of the redundant gene copies in the allopolyploid genomes or genomic regions beneficially affecting multiple agronomic traits. A polycistronic gene construct that can be quickly assembled using the Golden Gate reaction along with the wheat codon optimized Cas9 will further expand the set of tools available for engineering the wheat genome.",

    "abstract": "Ecological opportunity is frequently proposed as the sole ingredient for adaptive radiation into novel niches. Alternatively, genome-wide hybridization resulting from  hybrid swarm may be the trigger. However, these hypotheses have been difficult to test due to the rarity of comparable control environments lacking adaptive radiations. Here I exploit such a pattern in microendemic radiations of Caribbean pupfishes. I show that a sympatric three-species radiation on San Salvador Island, Bahamas diversified 1,445 times faster than neighboring islands in jaw length due to evolution of a novel scale-eating adaptive zone from a generalist ancestral niche. I then sampled 22 generalist populations on seven neighboring islands and measured morphological diversity, stomach content diversity, dietary isotopic diversity, genetic diversity, lake/island areas, macroalgae richness, and Caribbean-wide patterns of gene flow. None of these standard metrics of ecological opportunity or gene flow were associated with adaptive radiation, except for slight increases in macroalgae richness. Thus, exceptional trophic diversification is highly localized despite myriad generalist populations in comparable environmental and genetic backgrounds. This study provides a strong counterexample to the ecological/hybrid-swarm theories of adaptive radiation and suggests that diversification of novel specialists on a sparse fitness landscape is constrained by more than ecological opportunity and gene flow.",

    "abstract": "The microscopic analysis of telomere features provides a wealth of information on the mechanism by which tumor cells maintain their unlimited proliferative potential. Accordingly, the analysis of telomeres in tissue sections of patient tumor samples provides can be exploited to obtain diagnostic information and to define tumor subgroups. In many instances, however, analysis of the image data is conducted by manual inspection of 2D images at relatively low resolution for only a small part of the sample. As the telomere feature signal distribution is frequently heterogeneous, this approach is prone to a biased selection of the information present in the image and lacks subcellular details. Here we address these issues by using an automated high-resolution imaging and analysis workflow that quantifies individual telomere features on tissue sections for a large number of cells. The approach is particularly suited to assess telomere heterogeneity and low abundant cellular sub-populations with distinct telomere characteristics in a reproducible manner. It comprises the integration of multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence and DNA staining with targeted automated 3D fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. We apply our method to telomeres in glioblastoma and prostate cancer samples, and describe how the imaging data can be used to derive statistically reliable information on telomere length distribution or colocalization with PML nuclear bodies. We anticipate that relating this approach to clinical outcome data will prove to be valuable for pretherapeutic patient stratification.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Species diversity varies greatly across the different taxonomic groups that comprise the Tree of Life (ToL). This imbalance is particularly conspicuous within angiosperms, but is largely unexplained. Seed mass is one trait that may help clarify why some lineages diversify more than others because it confers adaptation to different environments, which can subsequently influence speciation and extinction. The rate at which seed mass changes across the angiosperm phylogeny may also be linked to diversification by increasing reproductive isolation and allowing access to novel ecological niches. However, the magnitude and direction of the association between seed mass and diversification has not been assessed across the angiosperm phylogeny. Here, we show that absolute seed size and the rate of change in seed size are both associated with variation in diversification rates. Based on the largest available angiosperm phylogenetic tree, we found that smaller-seeded plants had higher rates of diversification, possibly due to improved colonisation potential. The rate of phenotypic change in seed size was also strongly positively correlated with speciation rates, providing rare, large-scale evidence that rapid morphological change is associated with species divergence. Our study now reveals that variation in morphological traits and, importantly, the rate at which they evolve can contribute to explaining the extremely uneven distribution of diversity across the ToL.",

    "abstract": "Explaining the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding or eusociality remains a challenge. Surprisingly, fundamental ecological factors, specifically competition for limited resources and resource variance, are frequently ignored in models of animal sociality. We here develop a mathematical model that includes density-dependent population growth and quantify the influence of cooperative foraging on resource use efficiency. We derive optimal resource sharing strategies, ranging from egalitarian to cooperatively breeding and eusocial groups. We find that, while egalitarian resource sharing is a risk-reducing foraging strategy, eusociality yields additional benefits: like egalitarian strategies, eusocial groups can reduce their members starvation risk by reducing resource variance. Additionally, eusocial groups increase their reproductive output by increasing intra-group variance in resources allocated to reproduction. This allows reproduction even when resources are so scarce that solitary animals would not be able to reproduce. In a majority of environmental situations and life-histories, this twofold benefit of eusociality increased resource use efficiency and led to supersaturation, that is, to a strong increase in carrying capacity. Supersaturation provides indirect benefits to group members even for low intra-group relatedness and represents one potential explanation for the evolution and maintenance of eusociality and cooperative breeding.",

    "abstract": "Ocean microbes drive global-scale biogeochemical cycling1, but do so under constraints imposed by viruses on host community composition, metabolism, and evolutionary trajectories2-5. Due to sampling and cultivation challenges, genome-level viral diversity remains poorly described and grossly understudied in nature such that <1% of observed surface ocean viruses, even those that are abundant and ubiquitous, are  known5. Here we analyze a global map of abundant, double stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses and viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) with genomic and ecological contexts through the Global Ocean Viromes (GOV) dataset, which includes complete genomes and large genomic fragments from both surface and deep ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina research expeditions6,7. A total of 15,222 epi- and mesopelagic viral populations were identified that comprised 867 viral clusters (VCs, approximately genus-level groups8,9). This roughly triples known ocean viral populations10, doubles known candidate bacterial and archaeal virus genera9, and near-completely samples epipelagic communities at both the population and VC level. Thirty-eight of the 867 VCs were identified as the most impactful dsDNA viral groups in the oceans, as these were locally or globally abundant and accounted together for nearly half of the viral populations in any GOV sample. Most of these were predicted in silico to infect dominant, ecologically relevant microbes, while two thirds of them represent newly described viruses that lacked any cultivated representative. Beyond these taxon-specific ecological observations, we identified 243 viral-encoded AMGs in GOV, only 95 of which were known. Deeper analyses of 4 of these AMGs revealed that abundant viruses directly manipulate sulfur and nitrogen cycling, and do so throughout the epipelagic ocean. Together these data provide a critically-needed organismal catalog and functional context to begin meaningfully integrating viruses into ecosystem models as key players in nutrient cycling and trophic networks.",

    "abstract": "The Ramachandran plot is among the most central concepts in structural biology which uses torsion angles to describe polypeptide and protein conformation. To help visualize the features of high-fidelity Ramachandran plots, it is helpful to look beyond the common two-dimensional psi-phi-plot, which for a large dataset does not serve very well to convey the true nature of the distribution. In particular, when a large subset of the observations is found very narrowly distributed within one small region, this is not well seen in the simple plot because the data points congest one another. Zika Virus (ZIKV) protein databank has been chosen as specimen for analysis. This is because the structure, tropism, and pathogenesis of ZIKV are largely unknown and are the focus of current investigations in an effort to address the need for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutics. After a brief survey on Zika Virus, it is shown that when a dense dataset of ZIKV protein databank is passed through a colour-coded scaled algorithm, a three dimensional plot gets generated which gives a much more compelling impression of the proportions of residues in the different parts of the protein rather than representing it in a normal two dimensional psi-phi plot.",

    "abstract": "Ecological antagonisms such as predation, parasitism, competition, and abiotic environmental stress play key roles in shaping population biology, in particular by inducing stress responses and selecting for tolerant or resistant phenotypes. Little is known, however, about their impact on social traits, such as the production of public goods. Evolutionary trade-off theory predicts that adaptation to stresses should lessen investments in costly helping behaviours when cooperation does not increase resistance or tolerance, but support for this prediction is scarce. We employed theory and experiments to investigate how ecological antagonism influences social dynamics and resistance evolution in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We subjected two clones of bacterium to four doses of antibiotics and assessed growth and frequencies of public goods producing and non-producing genotypes. Our results show that abiotic stress selects against public goods production. Specifically, we found that non-producers of costly iron chelating molecules (siderophores) most rapidly increased in frequency under intermediate antibiotic pressure. Moreover, the dominance of non-producers in mixed cultures was associated with higher survival and resistance to antibiotics than in either producer or non-producer monocultures. Mathematical modelling explains this counterintuitive result, and shows how these qualitative patterns are predicted to generalise to many other systems. Our results shed light on the complex interactions between social traits and ecological antagonisms, and in particular the consequences for bacterial social evolution and antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) are pervasive in gut microbiota, but it remains unclear how often ARG are transferred, particularly to pathogens. Traditionally, ARG spread is attributed to horizontal transfer mediated either by DNA transformation, bacterial conjugation or generalized transduction. However, recent viral metagenome (virome) analyses suggest that ARG are frequently carried by phages, which is inconsistent with the traditional view that phage genomes rarely encode ARG. Here we used exploratory and conservative bioinformatic strategies found in the literature to detect ARG in phage genomes, and experimentally assessed a subset of ARG predicted using exploratory thresholds. ARG abundances in 1,181 phage genomes were vastly over-estimated using exploratory thresholds (421 predicted vs 2 known), due to low similarities and matches to protein unrelated to antibiotic resistance. Consistent with this, 4 ARG predicted using exploratory thresholds were experimentally evaluated and failed to confer antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli. Re-analysis of available human-or mouse-associated viromes for ARG and their genomic context suggested that bona fide ARG attributed to phages in viromes were previously over-estimated. These findings provide guidance for documentation of ARG in viromes, and re-assert that ARG are rarely encoded in phages.",

The latter explains how gene regulatory networks produce multiple attractor states, the self-stabilizing patterns of gene activation across the genome that account for \\\"epigenetic memory\\\".

Evolutionary rescue is an important phenomenon at the intersection of ecology and population genetics. While most population genetic models of evolutionary rescue focus on estimating the probability of rescue, we focus on whether one or more adaptive lineages contribute to evolutionary rescue. We find that when evolutionary rescue is likely, it is often driven by soft selective sweeps where multiple adaptive mutations spread through the population simultaneously. We give full analytic results for the probability of evolutionary rescue and the probability that evolutionary rescue occurs via soft selective sweeps in our model. We expect that these results will find utility in understanding the genetic signatures associated with various evolutionary rescue scenarios in large populations, such as the evolution of drug resistance in viral, bacterial, or eukaryotic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is a complex consortium of microorganisms with the ability to influence important aspects of host health and development. Harnessing this  microbial organ for biomedical applications requires clarifying the degree to which host and bacterial factors act alone or in combination to govern the stability of specific lineages. To address this we combined bacteriological manipulation and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to monitor the dynamics of a defined two-species microbiota within the vertebrate gut. We observed that the interplay between each population and the gut environment produced distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Consequently, one species dominates while the other experiences dramatic collapses that are well fit by a stochastic mathematical model. Modeling revealed that bacterial competition could only partially explain the observed phenomena, suggesting that a host factor is also important in shaping the community. We hypothesized the host determinant to be gut motility, and tested this mechanism by measuring colonization in hosts with enteric nervous system dysfunction due to mutation in the Hirschsprung disease locus ret. In mutant hosts we found reduced gut motility and, confirming our hypothesis, robust coexistence of both bacterial species. This study provides evidence that host-mediated spatial structuring and stochastic perturbation of communities along with bacterial competition drives population dynamics within the gut. In addition, this work highlights the capacity of the enteric nervous system to affect stability of gut microbiota constituents, demonstrating that the  gut-brain axis is bidirectional. Ultimately, these findings will help inform disease mitigation strategies focused on engineering the intestinal ecosystem.",

In C. elegans, the synapsis checkpoint selectively removes nuclei with unsynapsed chromosomes by inducing apoptosis. This checkpoint depends on Pairing Centers (PCs), cis-acting sites that promote pairing and synapsis. We have hypothesized that the stability of homolog pairing at PCs is monitored by this checkpoint. Here, we report that SC components SYP-3, HTP-3, HIM-3 and HTP-1 are required for a functional synapsis checkpoint. Mutation of these components does not abolish PC function, demonstrating they are bonafide checkpoint components. Further, we identify mutant backgrounds in which the instability of homolog pairing at PCs does not correlate with the synapsis checkpoint response. Altogether, these data suggest that, in addition to homolog pairing, SC assembly may be monitored by the synapsis checkpoint.",

To preserve cellular function, transcription of proteasome subunit genes is induced in response to proteasome dysfunction caused by pathogen attacks or proteasome inhibitor drugs. In Caenorhabditis elegans, this response requires SKN-1, a transcription factor related to mammalian Nrf1/2. Here, we use comprehensive genetic analyses to identify the pathway required for C. elegans to detect proteasome dysfunction and activate SKN-1. Genes required for SKN-1 activation encode regulators of ER traffic, a peptide N-glycanase, and DDI-1, a conserved aspartic protease. DDI-1 expression is induced by proteasome dysfunction, and we show that DDI-1 is required to cleave and activate an ER-associated isoform of SKN-1. Mammalian Nrf1 is also ER-associated and subject to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a conserved mechanism of proteasome surveillance. Targeting mammalian DDI1 protease could mitigate effects of proteasome dysfunction in aging and protein aggregation disorders, or increase effectiveness of proteasome inhibitor cancer chemotherapies.",

Here, we use a recently developed unsupervised technique to discover and track the occurrence of all stereotyped behaviors performed by fruit flies moving in a shallow arena.

LoF-intolerant genes also carry a modest excess of inherited PTVs; though the strongest de novo impacted genes contribute little to this, suggesting the excess of inherited risk resides lower-penetrant genes.

    "abstract": "The time it takes for a completed manuscript to be published traditionally can be extremely lengthy. Article publication delay, which occurs in part due to constraints associated with peer review, can prevent the timely dissemination of critical and actionable data associated with new information on rare diseases or developing health concerns such as Zika virus. Preprint servers are open access online repositories housing preprint research articles that enable authors (1) to make their research immediately and freely available and (2) to receive commentary and peer review prior to journal submission. There is a growing movement of preprint advocates aiming to change the current journal publication and peer review system, proposing that preprints catalyze biomedical discovery, support career advancement, and improve scientific communication. While the number of articles submitted to and hosted by preprint servers are gradually increasing, there has been no simple way to identify biomedical research published in a preprint format, as they are not typically indexed and are only discoverable by directly searching the specific preprint server websites. To address this issue, we created a search engine that quickly compiles preprints from disparate host repositories and provides a one-stop search solution. Additionally, we developed a web application that bolsters the discovery of preprints by enabling each and every word or phrase appearing on any website to be integrated with articles from preprint servers. The bioPreprint search engine is publicly available at http://www.hsls.pitt.edu/resources/preprint.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of endemic infections is of critical importance for a deeper understanding of pathogen transmission, and for the design of more efficient public health strategies. However, very few studies in this domain have focused on emerging infections, generating a gap of knowledge that hampers epidemiological response planning. Here, we analyze the case of a Chikungunya outbreak that occurred in Martinique in 2014. Using time series estimates from a network of sentinel practitioners covering the entire island, we first analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics and show that the largest city has served as the epicenter of this epidemic. We further show that the epidemic spread from there through two different propagation waves moving northwards and southwards, probably by individuals moving along the road network. We then develop a mathematical model to explore the drivers of the temporal dynamics of this mosquito-borne virus. Finally, we show that human behavior, inferred by a textual analysis of messages published on the social network Twitter, is required to explain the epidemiological dynamics over time. Overall, our results suggest that human behavior has been a key component of the outbreak propagation, and we argue that such results can lead to more efficient public health strategies specifically targeting the propagation process.",
