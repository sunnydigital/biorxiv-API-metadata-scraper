    "abstract": "Many of the characteristics associated with mammalian sleep are also observed in Drosophila, making the fruit-fly a powerful model organism for studying the genetics of this important process. Among these similarities is the presence of sexual dimorphic sleep patterns, which in flies, is manifested as increased mid-day sleep ( siesta) in males, compared to females. Here, we have used targeted miss-expression of the gene transformer (tra) and tra2 to either feminise or masculinise specific neural and non-neural tissues in the fly. Feminization of males using three different GAL4 drivers which are expressed in the mushroom bodies induced a female-like reduced siesta, while the masculinisation of females using these drivers triggered the male-like increased siesta. We also observed a similar reversal of sex-specific sleep by miss-expressing tra in the fat body, a key tissue in energy metabolism and hormone secretion. In addition, the daily expression levels of takeout, an important circadian clock output gene, were sexually dimorphic. Taken together, our experiments suggest that sleep-sexual dimorphism in Drosophila is driven by multiple neural and non-neural circuits, within and outside the brain.",

    "abstract": "Methods for inference and interpretation of evolutionary quantitative genetic parameters, and for prediction of the response to selection, are best developed for traits with normal distributions. Many traits of evolutionary interest, including many life history and behavioural traits, have inherently non-normal distributions. The generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework has become a widely used tool for estimating quantitative genetic parameters for non-normal traits. However, whereas GLMMs provide inference on a statistically-convenient latent scale, it is sometimes desirable to express quantitative genetic parameters on the scale upon which traits are expressed. The parameters of a fitted GLMMs, despite being on a latent scale, fully determine all quantities of potential interest on the scale on which traits are expressed. We provide expressions for deriving each of such quantities, including population means, phenotypic (co)variances, variance components including additive genetic (co)variances, and parameters such as heritability. We demonstrate that fixed effects have a strong impact on those parameters and show how to deal for this effect by averaging or integrating over fixed effects. The expressions require integration of quantities determined by the link function, over distributions of latent values. In general cases, the required integrals must be solved numerically, but efficient methods are available and we provide an implementation in an R package, QGglmm. We show that known formulae for quantities such as heritability of traits with Binomial and Poisson distributions are special cases of our expressions. Additionally, we show how fitted GLMM can be incorporated into existing methods for predicting evolutionary trajectories. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting method for evolutionary prediction by simulation, and apply our approach to data from a wild pedigreed vertebrate population.",

    "abstract": "Ash dieback due to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is threatening the Fraxinus excelsior species in most of its natural range in Europe and it is becoming obvious that other species in the Fraxinus genus are susceptible to the disease. The fungal pathogen apparently originates from Asia where it may act as an endophyte of local species like F. mandshurica. Previous studies reported significant levels of genetic variability for susceptibility in F. excelsior either in field or inoculation experiments. The present study was based on a field experiment planted in 1995, fifteen years before onset of the disease. Crown and collar status were monitored on 788 trees from 23 open-pollinated progenies originating from 3 French provenances. Susceptibility was modelled using a Bayesian approach where spatio-temporal effects were explicitly taken into account, thus providing accurate narrow-sense heritability estimates (h2). While moderate narrow-sense heritability estimates for Crown Dieback (CD, h2 = 0.42 in this study) have already been reported in the literature, this study is first to show that Collar Lesions are also heritable (h2 = 0.49 for prevalence and h2 = 0.42 for severity) and that there is significant genetic correlation between the severities of both traits (rspearman=0.40). Unexpectedly, their spatio-temporal dynamics followed almost opposite patterns. While no significant Provenance effect were detected for any trait, significant Family effects were found for both CD and CL. Moreover, the analysis strategy implemented here allowed to compute Individual Breeding Values (IBV) and to show that there is more genetic variability within families than between families. In agreement with previous reports, early flushing correlates with better crown status. Consequences of these results in terms of management and breeding are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A pair of vertebrate-specific and brain-expressed pre-synaptic genes, NTNG1 and NTNG2, contributes to the Intellectual Quotient (IQ) test scores in a complementary manner. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NTNG1 are associated with attenuated verbal comprehension (VC) or processing speed (PS) while NTNG2 SNPs affect working memory (WM) and perceptual organization (PO), forming cognitive endophenotypes in healthy and schizophrenia (SCZ)-affected human subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs), defined as 21 nucleotide (nu) long NTNG gene loci symmetrically embedding the IQ-affecting mutation alleles (VC/PS and WM/PO), underwent dramatic evolutionary changes from mice through primates to hominins, at the accelerated rates. Mutation alleles associated with the higher VC and WM IQ scores are found in the genomes of extinct hominins of Neolithic times, however, lower WM scores associated allele is also detectable in Mesolithic hunters genomes. Protein sequence of NTNG1 is 100% conserved among the primates, archaic and modern extinct hominins while NTNG2 underwent a recent selection sweep encoding a primate-specific S371A/V (~50,000 yrs BC), and a modern human (5,300 yrs BC) T346A substitutions. We show that a 500 mln yrs old genomic duplication of a synapse primordial gene provided a substrate for further synapse elaborations and its ultimate capacitive expansion of what evolved into a vertebrate cognitive superior complexity - intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Recent hypotheses suggest that learning to read influences the cognitive and cerebral organization of other perceptual skills, including face processing. Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is a disorder of face recognition in the absence of acquired brain injury, and in the context of normal intelligence and general cognitive development. To shed light on the potential relationship between reading and face processing in this group (and in general), we investigated reading performance in 10 participants with DP and 20 matched controls. We find that the group of DPs perform strikingly similar to the control group on four sensitive reading tests measuring visual recognition and naming of single letters and words, word length effects, and text reading speed and comprehension. Thus, there is a clear dissociation between impaired face processing and preserved reading in this group, a finding that challenges the recently proposed hypothesis that reading acquisition and face processing abilities are intrinsically linked. Developmental prosopagnosics can learn to read as fluently as normal subjects, while they are seemingly unable to learn efficient strategies for recognizing faces.",

    "abstract": "Standard BOLD connectivity analyses depend on aggregating the signals of individual voxel within regions of interest (ROIs). In certain cases, this aggregation implies a loss of valuable functional and anatomical information about sub-regions of voxels that drive the ROI level connectivity. We describe a data-driven statistical search method that identifies the voxels that are chiefly responsible for exchanging signals between regions of interest that are known to be effectively connected. We apply the method to high-resolution resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from medial temporal lobe regions of interest of a single healthy individual measured repeated times over a year and a half. The method successfully recovered densely connected voxels within larger ROIs of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus subfields consistent with the well-known medial temporal lobe structural connectivity. To assess the performance of our method in more common scanning protocols we apply it to resting state fMRI data of corticostriatal regions of interest for 50 healthy individuals. The method recovered densely connected voxels within the caudate nucleus and the putamen in good qualitative agreement with structural connectivity measurements. We describe related methods for estimation of effective connections at the voxel level that merit investigation.",
