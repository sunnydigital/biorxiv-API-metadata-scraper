    "abstract": "Gene duplication was proposed by S.Ohno (1) as a key mechanism of a novel gene function evolution. A pair of gene paralogs, NTNG1 and NTNG2, sharing identical gene and protein structures and encoding similar proteins, forms a functional complement subfunctionalising (SF) within cognitive domains and forming cognitive endophenotypes, as detected by Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests (2). Both NTNG paralogs are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), with unique nonoverlapping segregation among the other 15 cognitive disorders (CD), emphasizing an evolutionary gain-dependent link between advanced cognitive functions and concomitant neurocognitive pathologies. Complementary expression and human brain transcriptome composition of the paralogs explains the observed phenomena of their functional complementarity. The lowest identity among NTNGs is found in a middle of encoded by them proteins designated as uknown (Ukd) domain. NTNG1 contains anthropoid-specific constrained regions, and both genes contain non-coding conserved sequences underwent accelerated evolution in human. NTNG paralogs SF perturbates \\\"structure drives function\\\" concept at protein and gene levels. The paralogs function diversification forms a so-called \\\"Cognitive Complement (CC)\\\", a product of gene duplication and subsequent cognitive subfunction bifurcation among the NTNG gene duplicates.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscles arise from diverse embryonic origins, yet converge on common regulatory programs involving muscle regulatory factor (MRF)-family genes. Here, we compare the molecular basis of myogenesis in two separate muscle groups in the simple chordate Ciona: the atrial and oral siphon muscles. Here, we describe the ontogeny of OSM progenitors and characterize the clonal origins of OSM founders to compare mechanisms of OSM specification to what has been established for ASM. We determined that, as is the case in the ASM, Ebf and Tbx1/10 are both expressed and function upstream of Mrf in the OSM founder cells. However, regulatory relationships between Tbx1/10, Ebf and Mrf differ between the OSM and ASM lineages: while Tbx1/10, Ebf and Mrf form a linear cascade in the ASM, Ebf and Tbx1/10 are expressed in the inverse temporal order and are required together in order to activate Mrf in the OSM founder cells.",

    "abstract": "Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is a deltaretrovirus closely related to the Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). Cattle are the natural host of BLV where it integrates into B-cells and produces a lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic but following a protracted latency period about {bsim}5% develop an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, mirroring the disease trajectory of HTLV-1. The 5LTRs of both the BLV and HTLV-1 proviruses are transcriptionally silent in tumors, however they are not entirely quiescent, with the HLTV-1 antisense transcript HBZ and the BLV microRNAs constitutively expressed in tumors. Here, using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that in addition to microRNAs, the BLV provirus also constitutively expresses two antisense transcripts in all BLV infected samples examined. The first transcript (AS1) has alternate potential polyadenylation sites generating a short transcript of {bsim}600bp (aS1-S) and a less abundant longer transcript of {bsim}2200bp (AS1-L). Alternative splicing also creates a second transcript of {bsim}400bp (AS2) utilizing the first exon of AS1. Production of AS transcripts from the 3LTR was supported by reporter assays demonstrating that the BLV LTR has substantial and Tax-independent antisense promoter activity. BLV AS transcripts predominantly localize in the nucleus. Examination of protein coding potential showed AS2 to be non-coding, while the AS1-S/L transcripts coding potential is ambiguous, with a small potential open reading frame (ORF) of 264bp present. The AS1-L transcript overlaps the BLV microRNAs transcribed in the sense direction. Using high throughput sequencing of RNA-ligase-mediated (RLM) 5 RACE products, we show that the perfect complementary between the transcripts leads to RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) mediated cleavage of AS1-L. Furthermore, experiments using BLV proviruses where the microRNAs were removed or inverted point to additional transcriptional interactions between the two viral RNA species. Knock down of AS1-S/L using locked nucleic acids (LNAs) showed no obvious effect on the cells phenotype. While a detailed elucidation of the BLV antisense transcripts function remains in the future, the constitutive expression in all samples examined, points to a vital role for the transcripts in the life cycle and oncogenic potential of BLV.",

    "abstract": "De novo assembly of short RNA-Seq reads into transcripts is challenging due to sequence similarities in transcriptomes arising from gene duplications and alternative splicing of transcripts. We present Shannon, an RNA-Seq assembler with an optimality guarantee derived from principles of information theory: Shannon reconstructs nearly all information-theoretically reconstructable transcripts. Shannon is based on a theory we develop for de novo RNA-Seq assembly that reveals differing abundances among transcripts to be the key, rather than the barrier, to effective assembly. The assembly problem is formulated as a sparsest-flow problem on a transcript graph, and the heart of Shannon is a novel iterative flow-decomposition algorithm. This algorithm provably solves the information-theoretically reconstructable instances in linear-time even though the general sparsest-flow problem is NP-hard. Shannon also incorporates several additional new algorithmic advances: a new error-correction algorithm based on successive cancelation, a multi-bridging algorithm that carefully utilizes read information in the k-mer de Bruijn graph, and an approximate graph partitioning algorithm to split the transcriptome de Bruijn graph into smaller components. In tests on large RNA-Seq datasets, Shannon obtains significant increases in sensitivity along with improvements in specificity in comparison to state-of-the-art assemblers.",

Validation techniques confirmed the pathogens identified by NGS in each of the three positive cases. Clinical outcomes were consistent with the findings yielded by NGS on the presence or absence of an infectious pathogenic process in eight of ten cases, and were non-contributory in the remaining two.\\n\\nConclusionsNGS-guided metagenomic studies of brain, spinal cord or meningeal biopsies offer the possibility for dramatic improvements in our ability to detect (or rule out) a wide range of CNS pathogens, with potential benefits in speed, sensitivity, and cost.

    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) allows probing intermolecular interactions and conformational changes in biomacromolecules, and represents an invaluable tool for studying cellular processes at the molecular scale. smFRET experiments can detect the distance between two fluorescent labels (donor and acceptor) in the 3-10 nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry, molecules are free to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses the excitation volume, it emits a burst of photons, which can be detected by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The intensities of donor and acceptor fluorescence can then be related to the distance between the two fluorophores.\\n\\nWhile recent years have seen a growing number of contributions proposing improvements or new techniques in smFRET data analysis, rarely have those publications been accompanied by so.ware implementation. In particular, despite the widespread application of smFRET, no complete so.ware package for smFRET burst analysis is freely available to date.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce FRETBursts, an open source software for analysis of freely-diffusing smFRET data. FRETBursts allows executing all the fundamental steps of smFRET bursts analysis using state-of-the-art as well as novel techniques, while providing an open, robust and welldocumented implementation. Therefore, FRETBursts represents an ideal platform for comparison and development of new methods in burst analysis.\\n\\nWe employ modern software engineering principles in order to minimize bugs and facilitate long-term maintainability. Furthermore, we place a strong focus on reproducibility by relying on Jupyter notebooks for FRETBursts execution. Notebooks are executable documents capturing all the steps of the analysis (including data files, input parameters, and results) and can be easily shared to replicate complete smFRET analyzes. Notebooks allow beginners to execute complex workflows and advanced users to customize the analysis for their own needs. By bundling analysis description, code and results in a single document, FRETBursts allows to seamless share analysis workflows and results, encourages reproducibility and facilitates collaboration among researchers in the single-molecule community.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches have been widely used for the identification of neuropathology from neuroimaging data. However, these approaches require large samples and suffer from the challenges associated with multi-site, multi-protocol data. We propose a novel approach to address these challenges, and demonstrate its usefulness with the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. We predict symptom severity based on cortical thickness measurements from 156 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from four different sites. The proposed approach consists of two main stages: a domain adaptation stage using partial least squares regression to maximize the consistency of imaging data across sites; and a learning stage combining support vector regression for regional prediction of severity with elastic-net penalized linear regression for integrating regional predictions into a whole-brain severity prediction. The proposed method performed markedly better than simpler alternatives, better with multi-site than single-site data, and resulted in a considerably higher cross-validated correlation score than has previously been reported in the literature for multi-site data. This demonstration of the utility of the proposed approach for detecting structural brain abnormalities in ASD from the multi-site, multi-protocol ABIDE dataset indicates the potential of designing machine learning methods to meet the challenges of agglomerative data.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) can provide material for evolutionary innovation. Assembly of large, outbred eukaryotic genomes can be difficult, but structural rearrangements within such taxa can be investigated using linkage maps. RAD sequencing provides unprecedented ability to generate high-density linkage maps for non-model species, but can result in low numbers of homologous markers between species due to phylogenetic distance or differences in library preparation. Family Salmonidae is ideal for studying the effects of WGD as the ancestral salmonid underwent WGD relatively recently, around 65 million years ago, then rediploidized and diversified. Extensive synteny between orthologous chromosomes occurs in extant salmonids, but each species has both conserved and unique chromosome arm fusions and fissions. Here we generate a high-density linkage map (3826 markers) for the Salvelinus genera (Brook Charr S. fontinalis), and then identify orthologous chromosome arms among the other available salmonid high-density linkage maps, including six species of Oncorhynchus, and one species for each of Salmo and Coregonus, as well as the sister group for the salmonids, Esox lucius for homeolog designation. To this end, we developed O_SCPCAPMC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWAPC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAPCC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWOMPC_SCPLOW, a program that identifies identical and proximal markers between linkage maps using a reference genome of a related species as an intermediate. This approach increases the number of comparable markers between linkage maps by 5-fold, enabling a characterization of the most likely history of retained chromosomal rearrangements post-WGD, and identifying several conserved chromosomal inversions. Analyses of RADseq-based linkage maps from other taxa will also benefit from O_SCPCAPMC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWAPC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAPCC_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWOMPC_SCPLOW, available at: https://github.com/enormandeau/mapcomp/",

One AAV2 construct was used to deliver SpCas9 and the other delivered sgRNA against YFP or LacZ (control) in the presence of mCherry. Five weeks after intravitreal injection, retinal function was determined using electroretinography and CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene modifications were quantified in retinal flat mounts.\\n\\nRESULTSAAV2-mediated in vivo delivery of SpCas9 with sgRNA targeting YFP, significantly reduced the number of YFP fluorescent cells of the inner retina of our transgenic mouse model. Overall, we found an 84.0% (95% CI: 81.8-86.9) reduction of YFP-positive cells in YFP-sgRNA infected retinal cells compared to eyes treated with LacZ-sgRNA.

We now have several examples of fully sequenced closely related strains that are divergent for several disease phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsApproximately, 27.4M unique SNPs and 5M indels are identified across these strains compared to the C57BL/6J reference genome (GRCm38). The amount of variation found in the inbred laboratory mouse genome has increased to 71M SNPs and 12M indels. We investigate the genetic basis of highly penetrant cancer susceptibility in RF/J finding private novel missense mutations in DNA damage repair and highly cancer associated genes. We use two highly related strains (DBA/1J and DBA/2J) to investigate the genetic basis of collagen induced arthritis susceptibility.\\n\\nConclusionThis paper significantly expands the catalog of fully sequenced laboratory mouse strains and now contains several examples of highly genetically similar strains with divergent phenotypes. We show how studying private missense mutations can lead to insights into the genetic mechanism for a highly penetrant phenotype.",

Although originally identified through its association with the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase resistance gene, global genomic epidemiology studies have failed to resolve the geographical and temporal origin of the ST131 ancestor. Here, we developed a framework for the reanalysis of publicly available genomes from different sources and used this dataset to reconstruct the evolutionary steps that led to the emergence of FQR ST131. Using Bayesian estimation, we show that point mutations in chromosomal genes that confer FQR coincide with the first clinical use of fluoroquinolone in 1986, and illustrate the impact of this pivotal event in the rapid population expansion of ST131 worldwide from an apparent origin in North America. Furthermore, we identify key virulence factor acquisition events that predate the development of FQR, suggesting that the gain of virulence-associated genes followed by the tandem development of antibiotic resistance primed the successful global dissemination of ST131.",

Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, down-regulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic ROS, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTPlastid osmotic stress influences differentiation at the plant shoot apex. Two established mechanisms that control proliferation, the cytokinin/WUSCHEL stem cell identity loop and a plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway, are implicated.",

    "abstract": "Evolution and clinical manifestations of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection overlap with the pathologic processes that occur in sepsis1. Some viruses certainly compromise the immune system, leading to a breach in the integrity of the mucosal epithelial barrier, thus allowing bacterial translocation2, 3. Guided by these facts, we wondered if bacteria could be involved in the pathogenesis of some of the septic shock-like symptoms typical of EBOV infected patients, something that could have a dramatic impact on the design of new treatment approaches. We decided to search for bacteria in available EBOV patient sequence datasets. Given that EBOV is an RNA virus and that, hence, some NGS sequencing experiments carried out to sequence the EBOV genomes were RNA-Seq experiments, we thought that, if there were any bacteria in patient serum, at least some bacterial RNA might probably be detected in the sequenced material from Ebola patients. Thus, we searched for bacteria in a RNA-Seq public dataset from 99 Ebola samples from the last outbreak4, and surprisingly, in spite of the certainly suboptimal experimental conditions for bacterial RNA sequencing, we found bacteria in all of the 99 samples",

    "abstract": "With the rapid production of high dimensional genetic data, one major challenge in genome-wide association studies is to develop effective and efficient statistical tools to resolve the low power problem of detecting causal SNPs with low to moderate susceptibility, whose effects are often obscured by substantial background noises. Here we present a novel method that serves as an optimal technique for reducing background noises and improving detection power in genome-wide association studies. The approach uses hidden Markov model and its derivate Markov hidden Markov model to estimate the posterior probabilities of a markers being in an associated state. We conducted extensive simulations based on the human whole genome genotype data from the GlaxoSmithKline-POPRES project to calibrate the sensitivity and specificity of our method and compared with many popular approaches for detecting positive signals including the{chi} 2 test for association and the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Our simulation results suggested that at very low false positive rates (< 10-6), our method reaches the power of 0.9, and is more powerful than any other approaches, when the allelic effect of the causal variant is non-additive or unknown. Application of our method to the data set generated by Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium using 14,000 cases and 3,000 controls confirmed its powerfulness and efficiency under the context of the large-scale genome-wide association studies.",

    "abstract": "Mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its effects relies partly on how effectively land-atmosphere interactions can be quantified. Quantifying composition of past forest ecosystems can help understand processes governing forest dynamics in a changing world. Fossil pollen data provide information about past forest composition, but rigorous interpretation requires development of pollen-vegetation models (PVMs) that account for interspecific differences in pollen production and dispersal. Widespread and intensified land-use over the 19th and 20th centuries may have altered pollen-vegetation relationships. Here we use STEPPS, a Bayesian hierarchical spatial PVM, to estimate key process parameters and associated uncertainties in the pollenvegetation relationship. We apply alternate dispersal kernels, and calibrate STEPPS using a newly developed Euro-American settlement-era calibration data set constructed from Public Land Survey data and fossil pollen samples matched to the settlement-era using expert elicitation. Models based on the inverse power-law dispersal kernel outperformed those based on the Gaussian dispersal kernel, indicating that pollen dispersal kernels are fat tailed. Pine and birch have the highest pollen productivities. Pollen productivity and dispersal estimates are generally consistent with previous understanding from modern data sets, although source area estimates are larger. Tests of model predictions demonstrate the ability of STEPPS to predict regional compositional patterns.",

    "abstract": "Gene essentiality - whether or not a gene is necessary for cell growth - is a fundamental component of gene function. It is not well established how quickly gene essentiality can change, as few studies have compared empirical measures of essentiality between closely related organisms. Here we present the results of a Tn-seq experiment designed to detect essential protein coding genes in the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri 2a 2457T on a genome-wide scale. Superficial analysis of this data suggested that 451 protein-coding genes in this Shigella strain are critical for robust cellular growth on rich media. Comparison of this set of genes with a gold-standard data set of essential genes in the closely related Escherichia coli K12 BW25113 suggested that an excessive number of genes appeared essential in Shigella but non-essential in E. coli. Importantly, and in converse to this comparison, we found no genes that were essential in E. coli and non-essential in Shigella, suggesting that many genes were artefactually inferred as essential in Shigella. Controlling for such artefacts resulted in a much smaller set of discrepant genes. Among these, we identified three sets of functionally related genes, two of which have previously been implicated as critical for Shigella growth, but which are dispensable for E. coli growth. The data presented here highlight the small number of protein coding genes for which we have strong evidence that their essentiality status differs between the closely related bacterial taxa E. coli and Shigella. A set of genes involved in acetate utilization provides a canonical example. These results leave open the possibility of developing strain-specific antibiotic treatments targeting such differentially essential genes, but suggest that such opportunities may be rare in closely related bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of copy number alterations is an essential step in understanding the events driving tumor progression. While a variety of algorithms have been developed to use high-throughput sequencing data to profile copy number changes, no tool is able to reliably characterize ploidy and genotype absolute copy number from tumor samples which contain less than 40% tumor cells. To increase our power to resolve the copy number profile from low-cellularity tumor samples, we developed a novel approach which pre-phases heterozygote germline SNPs in order to replace the commonly used  B-allele frequency with a more powerful  parental-haplotype frequency. We apply our tool - sCNAphase - to characterize the copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity profiles of four publicly available breast cancer cell-lines. Comparisons to previous spectral karyotyping and microarray studies revealed that sCNAphase reliably identified overall ploidy as well as the individual copy number mutations from each cell-line. Analysis of artificial cell-line mixtures demonstrated the capacity of this method to determine the level of tumor cellularity, consistently identify sCNAs and characterize ploidy in samples with as little as 10% tumor cells. This novel methodology has the potential to bring sCNA profiling to low-cellularity tumors, a form of cancer unable to be accurately studied by current methods.",

    "abstract": "Myosin motors are the fundamental force-generating element of muscle contraction. Variation in the human {beta}-cardiac myosin gene (MYH7) can lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a heritable disease characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. How specific myosin variants alter motor function or clinical expression of disease remains incompletely understood. Here, we combine structural models of myosin from multiple stages of its chemomechanical cycle, exome sequencing data from population cohorts of 60,706 and 42,930 individuals, and genetic and phenotypic data from 2,913 HCM patients to elucidate novel structure-function relationships within {beta}-cardiac myosin. We first developed computational models of the human {beta}-cardiac myosin protein before and after the myosin power stroke. Then, using a spatial scan statistic modified to analyze genetic variation in protein three-dimensional space, we found significant enrichment of disease-associated variants in the converter, a kinetic domain that transduces force from the catalytic domain to the lever arm to accomplish the power stroke. Focusing our analysis on surface-exposed residues, we identified another region enriched for disease-associated variants that contains both the converter domain and residues on a single flat surface on the myosin head described as a myosin mesa. This surface is prominent in the pre-stroke model, but substantially reduced in size following the power stroke. Notably, HCM patients with variants in the enriched regions have earlier presentation and worse outcome than those with variants in other regions. In summary, this study provides a model for the combination of protein structure, large-scale genetic sequencing and detailed phenotypic data to reveal insight into time-shifted protein structures and genetic disease.",

    "abstract": "Teleost fishes not only communicate with well-known visual cues, but also olfactory and acoustic signals. Communicating with sound has advantages, as signals propagate fast, omnidirectionally, around obstacles, and over long distances. Heterogeneous environments might favour multimodal communication, especially in socially complex species, as combination of modalities strengths helps overcome their individual limitations. Cichlid fishes are known to be vocal, but a recent report suggests that this is not the case for the socially complex Princess cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher from Lake Tanganyika. Here we further investigated acoustic communication in this species. Wild and captive N. pulcher produced high frequency sounds (mean: 12 kHz), when stimulated by mirror images. In laboratory experiments, N. pulcher produced distinct two-pulsed calls mostly, but not exclusively, associated with agonistic displays. Our results suggest that male N. pulcher produce more sounds at greater durations than females. Thus, we confirm that the Princess cichlid does not produce low frequency sounds, but does produce high frequency sounds, both in combination with and independent from visual displays, suggesting that sounds are not a by-product of displays. Further studies on the hearing abilities of N. pulcher are needed to clarify if the high-frequency sounds are used in intra-or inter-specific communication.",
