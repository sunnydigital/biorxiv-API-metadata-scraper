    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers exciting possibilities to address biological and medical questions, but a systematic comparison of recently developed protocols is still lacking. Here, we generated data from 447 mouse embryonic stem cells using Drop-seq, SCRB-seq, Smart-seq (on Fluidigm C1) and Smart-seq2 and analyzed existing data from 35 mouse embryonic stem cells prepared with CEL-seq. We find that Smart-seq2 is the most sensitive method as it detects the most genes per cell and across cells with the most even coverage, well suited for annotating transcriptomes. However, we also find that unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), available for CEL-seq, Drop-seq and SCRB-seq, reduce the measurement noise considerably, which is most relevant for quantifying transcriptomes. Importantly, we show by power simulations that SCRB-seq and Drop-seq are the most cost-efficient methods for detecting differentially expressed genes. Our analyses offer a solid basis for an informed choice among five prominent scRNA-seq protocols and for future evaluations of protocol improvements.",

    "abstract": "An increased knowledge of the genetic regulation of expression in Arabidopsis thaliana is likely to provide important insights about the basis of the plants extensive phenotypic variation. Here, we reanalysed two publicly available datasets with genome-wide data on genetic and transcript variation in large collections of natural A. thaliana accessions. Transcripts from more than half of all genes were detected in the leaf of all accessions, and from nearly all annotated genes in at least one accession. Thousands of genes had high transcript levels in some accessions but no transcripts at all in others and this pattern was correlated with the genome-wide genotype. In total, 2,669 eQTL were mapped in the largest population, and 717 of them were replicated in the other population. 646 cis-eQTLs regulated genes that lacked detectable transcripts in some accessions, and for 159 of these we identified one, or several, common structural variants in the populations that were shown to be likely contributors to the lack of detectable RNA-transcripts for these genes. This study thus provides new insights on the overall genetic regulation of global gene-expression diversity in the leaf of natural A. thaliana accessions. Further, it also shows that strong cis-acting polymorphisms, many of which are likely to be structural variations, make important contributions to the transcriptional variation in the worldwide A. thaliana population.",

Resolution of genetic mapping is limited by the recombination rate. We developed a method that uses CRISPR to build mapping panels with targeted recombination events. We tested the method by generating a panel with recombination events spaced along a yeast chromosome arm, mapping trait variation, and then targeting a high density of recombination events to the region of interest. Using this approach, we fine-mapped manganese sensitivity to a single polymorphism in the transporter Pmr1. Targeting recombination events to regions of interest allows us to rapidly and systematically identify causal variants underlying trait differences.",

    "abstract": "In addition to its role in forming vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the coat protein complex II (COPII) is also responsible for selecting specific cargo proteins to be packaged into COPII transport vesicles. Comparison of COPII vesicle formation in mammalian systems and in yeast suggested that the former employs more elaborate mechanisms for cargo recognition, presumably to cope with a significantly expanded repertoire of cargo that transits the secretory pathway. Using proTGF, the transmembrane precursor of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF), as a model cargo protein, we demonstrate in cell-free assays that at least one auxiliary cytosolic factor is specifically required for the efficient packaging of proTGF into COPII vesicles. Using a knockout HeLa cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9, we provide functional evidence showing that a transmembrane protein, Cornichon-1 (CNIH), acts as a cargo receptor of proTGF. We show that both CNIH and the auxiliary cytosolic factor(s) are required for efficient recruitment of proTGF to the COPII coat in vitro. Moreover, we provide evidence that the recruitment of cargo protein by the COPII coat precedes and may be distinct from subsequent cargo packaging into COPII vesicles.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Forecasting and preventing rapid ecosystem state changes is important but hard to achieve without functionally relevant early warning indicators. Here we use metaproteomic analysis to identify protein biomarkers indicating a state change in an aquatic ecosystem resulting from detrital enrichment. In a 14-day field experiment, we used detritus (arthropod prey) to enrich replicate aquatic ecosystems formed in the water-filled pitcher-shaped leaves of the northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. Shotgun metaproteomics using a translated, custom metagenomic database identified proteins, molecular pathways, and microbial taxa that differentiated control oligotrophic ecosystems that captured only ambient prey from eutrophic ecosystems that were experimentally enriched. The number of microbial taxa was comparable between treatments; however, taxonomic evenness was higher in the oligotrophic controls. Aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria dominated control and enriched ecosystems, respectively. The molecular pathways and taxa identified in the enriched treatments were similar to those found in a wide range of enriched or polluted aquatic ecosystems and are derived from microbial processes that occur at the base of most detrital food webs. We encourage the use of metaproteomic pipelines to identify better early-warning indicators of impending changes from oligotrophic to eutrophic states in aquatic and other detrital-based ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The current outbreak of Zika virus poses a threat of unknown magnitude to human health1. While the range of the virus has been cataloged growing slowly over the last 50 years, the recent explosive expansion in the Americas indicates that the full potential distribution of Zika remains uncertain2-4. Moreover, most current epidemiology relies on its similarities to dengue fever, a phylogenetically closely related disease of unknown similarity in spatial range or ecological niche5,6. Here we compile the first spatially explicit global occurrence dataset from Zika viral surveillance and serological surveys, and construct ecological niche models to test basic hypotheses about its spread and potential establishment. The hypothesis that the outbreak of cases in Mexico and North America are anomalous and outside the ecological niche of the disease, and may be linked to El Nino or similar climatic events, remains plausible at this time7. Comparison of the Zika niche against the known distribution of dengue fever suggests that Zika is more constrained by the seasonality of precipitation and diurnal temperature fluctuations, likely confining the disease to the tropics outside of pandemic scenarios. Projecting the range of the diseases in conjunction with vector species (Aedes africanus, Ae. aegypti, and Ae. albopictus) that transmit the pathogens, under climate change, suggests that Zika has potential for northward expansion; but, based on current knowledge, Zika is unlikely to fill the full range its vectors occupy. With recent sexual transmission of the virus known to have occurred in the United States, we caution that our results only apply to the vector-borne aspect of the disease, and while the threat of a mosquito-carried Zika pandemic may be overstated in the media, other transmission modes of the virus may emerge and facilitate naturalization worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Understanding why so many species are rare yet persistent remains a significant challenge for both theoretical and empirical ecologists. Yenni, Adler, and Ernest (2012) proposed that strong negative frequency dependence causes species to be rare while simultaneously buffering them against extinction. This hypothesis predicts that, on average, rare species should experience stronger negative frequency dependence than common species. However, it is unknown if ecological communities generally show this theoretical pattern, or if rarity is primarily determined by other processes that overwhelm the effects of strong negative frequency dependence. We discuss the implications of this mechanism for natural communities, and develop a method to test for a non-random relationship between negative frequency dependence and relative abundance, using species abundance data from 90 communities across a broad range of environments and taxonomic groups. To account for biases introduced by measurement error, we compared the observed correlation between species relative abundance and the strength of frequency dependence against expectations from a randomization procedure. In approximately half of the analyzed communities, rare species showed disproportionately strong negative frequency dependence compared to common species. Specifically, we found a pattern of increasingly strong negative frequency dependence with decreasing relative abundance. Our results suggest that strong negative frequency dependence is a signature of both rarity and persistence for many species in many communities.",

Kronos obviates the need for explicit coding of workflows by compiling a text configuration file into executable Python applications. The framework of each workflow includes a run manager to execute the encoded workflows locally (or on a cluster or cloud), parallelize tasks, and log all runtime events. Resulting workflows are highly modular and configurable by construction, facilitating flexible and extensible meta-applications which can be modified easily through configuration file editing. The workflows are fully encoded for ease of distribution and can be instantiated on external systems, promoting and facilitating reproducible research and comparative analyses. We introduce a framework for building Kronos components which function as shareable, modular nodes in Kronos workflows.\\n\\nConclusionThe Kronos platform provides a standard framework for developers to implement custom tools, reuse existing tools, and contribute to the community at large. Kronos is shipped with both Docker and Amazon AWS machine images. It is free, open source and available through PyPI (Python Package Index) and https://github.com/jtaghiyar/kronos.",

An additional protein, the paraoxonase-like protein MEC-6, is essential for transduction, and previous work suggested that MEC-6 was part of the transduction complex. We found that MEC-6 and a similar protein, POML-1, reside primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and do not colocalize with MEC-4 on the plasma membrane in vivo. As with MEC-6, POML-1 is needed for touch sensitivity, for the neurodegeneration caused by the mec-4(d) mutation, and for the expression and distribution of MEC-4 in vivo. Both proteins are likely needed for the proper folding or assembly of MEC-4 channels in vivo as measured by FRET. MEC-6 detectably increases the rate of MEC-4 accumulation on the Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane. These results suggest that MEC-6 and POML-1 interact with MEC-4 to facilitate expression and localization of MEC-4 on the cell surface. Thus, MEC-6 and POML-1 act more like chaperones for MEC-4 than channel components.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing hypothesis asserts that plant-feeding insects specialize on particular host plants because of negative interactions (trade-offs) between adaptations to alternative hosts, yet empirical evidence for such trade-offs is scarce. Most studies have looked for microevolutionary performance trade-offs within insect species, but host-use could also be constrained by macroevolutionary trade-offs caused by epistasis and historical contingency. On the other hand, evolutionary interactions between adaptations to diverse hosts could be neutral or positive rather than negative. Here we used a phylogenetic approach to estimate the micro-and macroevolutionary correlations between use of alternative host plants within two major orders of plant-feeding insects: Lepidoptera (caterpillars) and Hemiptera (true bugs). Across 1604 caterpillar species, we found both positive and negative pairwise correlations between use of diverse host taxa, with overall network patterns suggesting that different host-use constraints act over micro-and macroevolutionary timescales. In contrast, host-use patterns of 955 true bug species revealed uniformly positive correlations between presence on the same host taxa over both timescales. The lack of consistent patterns across timescales and insect orders indicates that host-use trade-offs are historically contingent rather than universal constraints. Moreover, we observed few negative correlations overall despite the wide taxonomic and ecological diversity of the focal host taxa, suggesting that positive interactions between host-use adaptations, not trade-offs, dominate the long-term evolution of host use in plant-feeding insects.",

Recent advances in genome editing have enabled precise insertion of fluorescent protein tags into the genomes of diverse organisms.

Most quantitative comparisons of the brightness and photostability of different fluorescent proteins have been made in vitro, removed from biological variables that govern their performance in cells or organisms. To address the gap we quantitatively assessed fluorescent protein properties in vivo in an animal model system. We generated transgenic C. elegans strains expressing green, yellow, or red fluorescent proteins in embryos, and we imaged embryos expressing different fluorescent proteins under the same conditions for direct comparison. We found that mNeonGreen was not bright in vivo as predicted based on in vitro data, but that mNeonGreen is a better tag than GFP for specific kinds of experiments, and we report on optimal red fluorescent proteins. These results identify ideal fluorescent proteins for imaging in vivo in C. elegans embryos, and they suggest good candidate fluorescent proteins to test in other animal model systems.",

    "abstract": "The rate of carbon uptake by land plants depends on the ratio of leaf-internal to ambient carbon dioxide partial pressures1, here termed{chi} . This quantity is a key determinant of both primary production and transpiration and the relationship between them. But current models for{chi} are empirical and incomplete, contributing to the many uncertainties afflicting model estimates and future projections of terrestrial carbon uptake2,3. Here we show that a simple evolutionary optimality hypothesis4,5 generates functional relationships between{chi} and growth temperature, vapour pressure deficit and elevation that are precisely and quantitatively consistent with empirical{chi} values from a worldwide data set containing > 3500 stable carbon isotope measurements. A single global equation embodying these relationships then unifies the empirical light use efficiency model with the standard model of C3 photosynthesis1, and successfully predicts gross primary production as measured at flux sites. This achievement is notable because of the equation's simplicity (with just two parameters, both independently estimated) and applicability across biomes and plant functional types. Thereby it provides a theoretical underpinning, grounded in eco-evolutionary principles, for large-scale analysis of the CO2 and water exchanges between atmosphere and land.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted from metazoan cells and may convey selected membrane proteins and small RNAs to target cells for the control of cell migration, development and metastasis. To study the mechanisms of RNA packaging into exosomes, we devised a purification scheme based on the membrane marker CD63 to isolate a single exosome species secreted from HEK293T cells. Using immunoisolated CD63-containing exosomes we identified a set of microRNAs that are highly enriched with respect to their cellular levels. To explore the biochemical requirements for exosome biogenesis and RNA packaging, we devised a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the species-selective enclosure of miR-223 in isolated membranes supplemented with cytosol. We found that the RNA-binding protein Y-box protein I (YBX1) binds to and is required for the sorting of miR-223 in the cell-free reaction. Furthermore, YBX1 serves an important role in the secretion of miRNAs in exosomes by HEK293T cells.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring changes in infectious disease incidence is fundamental to outbreak detection and response, intervention outcome monitoring, and identifying environmental correlates of transmission. In the case of dengue, little is known about how consistently surveillance data track disease burden in a population over time. Here we use four years of monthly dengue incidence data from three sources - population-based ( passive) surveillance including suspected cases,  sentinel surveillance with 100% laboratory confirmation and complete reporting, and door-to-door ( cohort) surveillance conducted three times per week - in Iquitos, Peru, to quantify their relative consistency and timeliness. Data consistency was evaluated using annual and monthly expansion factors (EFs) as cohort incidence divided by incidence in each surveillance system, to assess their reliability for estimating disease burden (annual) and monitoring disease trends (monthly). Annually, passive surveillance data more closely estimated cohort incidence (average annual EF=5) than did data from sentinel surveillance (average annual EF=19). Monthly passive surveillance data generally were more consistent (ratio of sentinel/passive EF standard deviations=2.2) but overestimated incidence in 26% (11/43) of months, most often during the second half of the annual high season as dengue incidence typically wanes from its annual peak. Increases in sentinel surveillance incidence were correlated temporally (correlation coefficient = 0.86) with increases in the cohort, while passive surveillance data were significantly correlated at both zero-lag and a one-month lag (0.63 and 0.44, respectively). Together these results suggest that, rather than relying on a single data stream, a clearer picture of changes in infectious disease incidence might be achieved by combining the timeliness of sentinel surveillance with the representativeness of passive surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The concentrations of electron donors and acceptors in the terrestrial subsurface biosphere fluctuate due to migration and mixing of subsurface fluids, but the mechanisms and rates at which microbial communities respond to these changes are largely unknown. Subsurface microbial communities exhibit long cellular turnover times and are often considered relatively static--generating just enough ATP for cellular maintenance. Here, we investigated how subsurface populations of CH4 oxidizers respond to changes in electron acceptor availability by monitoring the biological and geochemical composition in a 1,339 meters-below-land-surface (mbls) fluid-filled fracture over the course of both longer (2.5 year) and shorter (2-week) time scales. Using a combination of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic analyses, we observe that the CH4 oxidizers within the subsurface microbial community change in coordination with electron acceptor availability over time. We then validate these findings through a series of 13C-CH4 laboratory incubation experiments, highlighting a connection between composition of subsurface CH4 oxidizing communities and electron acceptor availability.",

    "abstract": "Since most dramatic genomic changes are caused by genome rearrangements as well as gene duplications and gain/loss events, it becomes crucial to understand their mechanisms and reconstruct ancestral genomes of the given genomes. This problem was shown to be NP-complete even in the \\\"simplest\\\" case of three genomes, thus calling for heuristic rather than exact algorithmic solutions. At the same time, a larger number of input genomes may actually simplify the problem in practice as it was earlier illustrated with MGRA, a state-of-the-art software tool for reconstruction of ancestral genomes of multiple genomes.\\n\\nOne of the key obstacles for MGRA and other similar tools is presence of breakpoint reuses when the same breakpoint region is broken by several different genome rearrangements in the course of evolution. Furthermore, such tools are often limited to genomes composed of the same genes with each gene present in a single copy in every genome. This limitation makes these tools inapplicable for many biological datasets and degrades the resolution of ancestral reconstructions in diverse datasets.\\n\\nWe address these deficiencies by extending the MGRA algorithm to genomes with unequal gene contents. The developed next-generation tool MGRA2 can handle gene gain/loss events and shares the ability of MGRA to reconstruct ancestral genomes uniquely in the case of limited breakpoint reuse. Furthermore, MGRA2 employs a number of novel heuristics to cope with higher breakpoint reuse and process datasets inaccessible for MGRA. In practical experiments, MGRA2 shows superior performance for simulated and real genomes as compared to other ancestral genomes reconstruction tools. The MGRA2 tool is distributed as an open-source software and can be downloaded from GitHub repository http://github.com/ablab/mgra/. It is also available in the form of a web-server at http://mgra.cblab.org, which makes it readily accessible for inexperienced users.",

    "abstract": "Whole-chromosome aneuploidy is a hallmark of human malignancies. The prevalence of chromosome segregation errors in cancer - first noted more than 100 years ago - has led to the widespread belief that aneuploidy plays a crucial role in tumor development. Here, we set out to test this hypothesis. We transduced congenic euploid and trisomic fibroblasts with 14 different oncogenes or oncogene combinations, thereby creating genetically-matched cancer cell lines that differ only in karyotype. Surprisingly, nearly all aneuploid cell lines divided slowly in vitro, formed few colonies in soft agar, and grew poorly as xenografts, relative to matched euploid lines. Similar results were obtained when comparing a near-diploid human colorectal cancer cell line with derivatives of that line that harbored extra chromosomes. Only a few aneuploid lines grew at close to wild-type levels, and no aneuploid line exhibited greater tumorigenic capabilities than its euploid counterpart. These results demonstrate that rather than promoting tumorigenesis, aneuploidy, particularly single chromosome gains, can very often function as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, our results suggest one potential way that cancers can overcome the tumor suppressive effects of aneuploidy: rapidly-growing aneuploid cell lines that had evolved in vitro or in vivo demonstrated recurrent karyotype changes that were absent from their euploid counterparts. Thus, the genome-destabilizing effects of single-chromosome aneuploidy may facilitate the development of balanced, high-complexity karyotypes that are frequently found in advanced malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Multiple functions of cells cultured on flat substrates have been shown to depend on the elastic modulus of the substrate, E, with the dependence being strongest in a physiological range of soft tissues, corresponding to E from 0.1 to 100 kPa. Among those functions are stem cell differentiation, cell spreading, and cell signaling [1]. In the context of differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), substrates with E in the ranges of <4 kPa, 8-17 kPa, and >25 kPa, have been classified as soft (adipogenic) [2,3], medium rigidity (myogenic)1, and hard (osteogenic) [1], respectively. In most studies, the soft substrates are hydrogels, and variations in their elastic moduli are usually accompanied by variations in the dry mass and porosity. The paradigm of the effect of substrate rigidity on the cellular functions has been challenged by Trappmann et al. [4], who claimed that cell spreading and differentiation on hydrogel substrates depend not on the elastic moduli of the substrates, but rather on their porosity, which affects the density of adhesion points between the substrate surface and the extracellular matrix (ECM) coating on it. This claim has been rebutted by Wen at al. [3], who have used hydrogel substrates with different porosities but identical elastic moduli to show that it is the elastic modulus rather than the porosity that is key to the effect of the substrate on cell spreading and differentiation. Both publications agree, however, that there is no appreciable effect of the substrate rigidity on either cell spreading or differentiation, if the substrate is made of a silicone gel rather than a hydrogel. This conclusion appears to contradict the findings of several other groups, who reported that when cells are plated on an array of flexible silicone microposts, their spreading and differentiation depend on the rigidity of the substrate [5], and that when cell are plated on silicone gels, their differentiation depends on the gel rigidity [6]. To resolve this contradiction, we used soft, medium, and hard silicone gel substrates with elastic moduli of 0.5, 16, and 64 kPa, respectively, (Fig.1) to perform experiments similar to those reported in Refs.4 and 3, testing the dependence of differentiation and spreading of MSCs and of spreading of fibroblasts and keratinocytes on the substrate rigidity.",

Epigenomic and transcriptional analysis require separation of purified cell types, and long term preservation of cells requires their isolation and transfer into appropriate freezing media. There are currently no protocols for these procedures on the ISS. Currently samples are either frozen as mixed cell populations, with poor yield, or returned under ambient conditions, requiring timing with Soyuz missions. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of translating terrestrial cell purification techniques to the ISS. Our evaluations were performed in microgravity conditions during parabolic atmospheric flight. The pipetting of open liquids in microgravity was evaluated using analog blood fluids and several types of pipette hardware. The best performing pipettes were used to evaluate the pipetting steps required for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation via density gradient centrifugation (DGC). Evaluation of actual blood products was performed for both the overlay of diluted blood, and the extraction of isolated PBMCs. We also validated magnetic purification of cells. We found that positive displacement pipettes avoided air bubbles, and the tips allowed the strong surface tension of water, glycerol and blood to maintain a patent meniscus and withstand robust pipetting in microgravity. These procedures will greatly increase the breadth of research that can be performed onboard the ISS, and allow improvised experimentation on extraterrestrial missions.",
