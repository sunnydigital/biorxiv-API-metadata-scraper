    "abstract": "Bacteriorhodopsin, a light activated protein that creates a proton gradient in halobacteria, has long served as a simple model of proton pumps. Within bacteriorhodopsin, several key sites undergo protonation changes during the photocycle, moving protons from the higher pH cytoplasm to the lower pH extracellular side. The mechanism underlying the long-range proton translocation between the central (the retinal Schiff base SB216, D85 and D212) and exit clusters (E194 and E204) remains elusive. To obtain a dynamic view of the key factors controlling proton translocation, a systematic study using molecular dynamics simulation was performed for eight bacteriorhodopsin models varying in retinal isomer and protonation of the SB216, D85, D212 and E204. The side-chain orientation of R82 is determined primarily by the protonation states of the residues in the EC. The side-chain reorientation of R82 modulates the hydrogen-bond network and consequently possible pathways of proton transfer. Quantum mechanical intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations of proton-transfer in the methyl guanidinium-hydronium-hydroxide model system show that proton transfer via a guanidinium group requires an initial geometry permitting proton donation and acceptance by the same amine. In all the models, R82 can form proton wires with both the CC and the EC connected by the same amine. Alternatively, rare proton wires for proton transfer from the CC to the EC without involving R82 were found in an O state where the proton on D85 is transferred to D212.",

    "abstract": "Understanding patterns of genetic diversity is a crucial component of medical research in Africa. Here we use haplotype-based population genetics inference to describe gene-flow and admixture in a collection of 48 African groups with a focus on the major populations of the sub-Sahara. Our analysis presents a framework for interpreting haplotype diversity within and between population groups and provides a demographic foundation for genetic epidemiology in Africa. We show that coastal African populations have experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes as a series of admixture events over the last 7,000 years, and that Niger-Congo speaking groups from East and Southern Africa share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions associated with the adoption of new agricultural technologies. We demonstrate that most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of large-scale population movements over the last 4,000 years. Our in-depth analysis of admixture provides an insight into haplotype sharing across different geographic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new climatic and pathogenic environments, both of which will aid the interpretation of genetic studies of disease in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "Microbial populations often rely on the cooperative production of extracellular \\\"public goods\\\" molecules. The cooperative nature of public good production may lead to minimum viable population sizes, below which populations collapse. In addition, \\\"cooperator\\\" public goods producing cells face evolutionary competition from non-producing mutants, or \\\"freeloaders\\\". Thus, public goods cooperators have to be stable not only to the invasion of freeloaders, but also to ecological perturbations that may push their numbers too small to be sustainable. Through a combination of experiments with microbial populations and mathematical analysis of the Ecological Public Goods Game, we show that game parameters and experimental conditions that improve the evolutionary stability of cooperators also lead to a low ecological stability of the cooperator population. Complex regulatory strategies mimicking those used by microbes in nature may allow cooperators to beat this eco-evolutionary stability tradeoff and become resistant to freeloaders while at the same time maximizing their ecological stability. Our results thus identify the coupled eco-evolutionary stability as being key for the long-term viability of microbial public goods cooperators.",

    "abstract": "The packaging of eukaryotic genomes into nucleosomes plays critical roles in all DNA-templated processes, and chromatin structure has been implicated as a key factor in the evolution of gene regulatory programs. While the functions of many histone modifications appear to be highly conserved throughout evolution, some well-studied modifications such as H3K9 and H3K27 methylation are not found in major model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while other modifications gain/lose regulatory functions during evolution. To study such a transition we focused on H3K9 methylation, a heterochromatin mark found in metazoans and in the fission yeast S. pombe, but which has been lost in the lineage leading to the model budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We show that this mark is present in the relatively understudied yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, a Hemiascomycete that diverged from S. cerevisiae prior to the whole-genome duplication event that played a key role in the evolution of a primarily fermentative lifestyle. We mapped genome-wide patterns of H3K9 methylation as well as several conserved modifications. We find that well-studied modifications such as H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3S10ph exhibit generally conserved localization patterns. Interestingly, we show H3K9 methylation in K. lactis primarily occurs over highly-transcribed regions, including both Pol2 and Pol3 transcription units. We identified the H3K9 methylase as the ortholog of Set6, whose function in S. cerevisiae is obscure. Functionally, we show that deletion of KlSet6 does not affect highly H3K9me3-marked genes, providing another example of a major disconnect between histone mark localization and function. Together, these results shed light on surprising plasticity in the function of a widespread chromatin mark.",

    "abstract": "Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we provide a definition of the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, ... We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. In each case, by conditioning on the pedigree relating individuals in the population, we incorporate arbitrary selection and population structure. We suppose that we can observe the pedigree up to the present generation, together with all the ancestral traits, and we show, in particular, that the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order [Formula]. Simulations suggest that in particular cases the convergence may be as fast as 1/M.",

    "abstract": "Infection avoidance behaviours are the first line of defence against pathogenic encounters. Behavioural plasticity in response to internal or external cues can therefore generate potentially significant heterogeneity in infection. We tested whether Drosophila melanogaster exhibits infection avoidance behaviour during foraging, and whether this behaviour is modified by prior exposure to Drosophila C Virus (DCV) and by the risk of DCV encounter. We examined two measures of infection avoidance: (1) the motivation to feed in the presence of an infection risk and (2) the preference to feed on a clean food source over a potentially infectious source. While we found no clear evidence for preference of clean food sources over potentially infectious ones, female flies were less motivated to feed when presented with a risk of encountering DCV, but only if they had been previously exposed to the virus. We discuss the relevance of behavioural plasticity during foraging for host fitness and pathogen spread.",

    "abstract": "Craniofacial shape differences between taxa have often being linked to environmental adaptation, e.g. to new food sources, or have been studied in the context of domestication. Evidence for the genetic basis of such phenotypic differences to date suggests that within- as well as between-species variation has an oligogenic basis, i.e. few loci of large effect explain most of the variation. In mice, it has been shown that within-population craniofacial variation has a highly polygenic basis, but there are no data regarding the genetic basis of between-species differences. Here, we address this question using a phenotype-focused approach. Using 3D geometric morphometrics, we phenotyped a panel of mice derived from a natural hybrid zone between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus, and quantify the transition of craniofacial shape along the hybridization gradient. We find a continuous shape transition along the hybridization gradient, and unaltered developmental stability associated with hybridization. This suggests that the morphospace between the two subspecies is continuous despite reproductive isolation and strong barriers to gene flow. We show that quantitative changes in genome composition generate quantitative changes in craniofacial shape; this supports a highly polygenic basis for between-species craniofacial differences in the house mouse. We discuss our findings in the context of oligogenic versus polygenic models of the genetic architecture of morphological traits.",

However, applications of such analyses are frequently limited by peak overlap inherent to complex biomolecular systems. Moreover, systematic errors may arise due to the analysis of two-dimensional data using theoretical frameworks developed for one-dimensional experiments. Here we introduce a more accurate and convenient method for the analysis of such data, based on the direct quantum mechanical simulation and fitting of entire two-dimensional experiments, which we implement in a new software tool, TITAN (TITration ANalysis). We expect the approach, which we demonstrate for a variety of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, to be particularly useful in providing information on multi-step or multi-component interactions.",

However, more than a century after the rediscovery of Mendels law, the global landscape of monogenic variants as well as their effects and inheritance patterns within natural populations is still not well understood. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we performed a species-wide survey of Mendelian traits across a large population of isolates. We generated offspring from 41 unique parental pairs, and analyzed 1,105 cross/trait combinations. We found that 8.9% of the cases were Mendelian. Most were caused by common variants showing stable inheritances in a natural population. However, we also found that a rare monogenic variant related to drug resistance displayed a significant and variable expressivity across different genetic backgrounds, leading to modified inheritances ranging from intermediate to high complexities. Our results illustrate for the first time the continuum of the hidden complexity of a monogenic mutation, where genotype is hardly predictive of phenotype.",

The annotatr package reports all intersections of regions and annotations, giving a better understanding of the genomic context of the regions. A variety of graphics functions are implemented to easily plot numerical or categorical data associated with the regions across the annotations, and across annotation intersections, providing insight into how characteristics of the regions differ across the annotations. We demonstrate that annotatr is up to 27x faster than comparable R packages.

We focus on a well-defined set of signaling proteins profiled in four breast cancer cell lines under eight stimulus conditions and inhibition of specific kinases. The data, spanning multiple pathways and comprising approximately 70,000 phosphoprotein and 260,000 protein measurements, provide a wealth of testable, context-specific hypotheses, several of which we validate in independent experiments. Furthermore, the data provide a resource for computational methods development, permitting empirical assessment of causal network learning in a complex, mammalian setting.",

During recording, we dissociated subjective percepts from physical inputs in three distinct stimulus paradigms (passive viewing, continuous flash suppression, and backward masking).

Their relative distribution is important for the muscle function and can be altered in some neuromuscular diseases. Little is known about how the spatial organization of fast and slow fibres is established and maintained. In this work we use computerized image analysis and mathematical concepts to capture the organizational pattern in two different healthy muscles: biceps brachii and quadriceps. Here we show that each type of muscle portrays a characteristic topological pattern that allows distinguishing between them. The biceps brachii muscle presents a particular arrange based on the different size of slow and fast fibres, contrary to the quadriceps muscle where an unbiased distribution exists. Our results indicate that the relative size of each cellular type imposes an intrinsic organization into the tissue.
