    "abstract": "No two ovaries are alike, and indeed, the same ovary can change its architecture from day to day. This is because ovarian follicles are present in different numbers, positions, and states of maturation throughout reproductive life. All possible developmental states of follicles can be represented at any time, along with follicles that have committed to death (termed follicle atresia). Static histological and whole-mount imaging approaches allow snapshots of what is occurring within ovaries, but our views of dynamic follicle growth and death have been limited to these tools. We present a simple Markov chain model of the complex mouse ovary, called \\\"[O]vSim\\\". In the model, follicles can exist in one of three Markov states with stationary probabilities, Hold (growth arrest), Grow, and Die. The probability that individual primordial follicles can growth activate daily, the fraction of granulosa cells that survive as follicles grow, and the probability that individual follicles can commit to atresia daily are user definable parameters. When the probability of daily growth activation is stationary at 0.005, the probability of atresia for all follicles is near 0.1, and the probability of granulosa cell survival is modeled around 0.88, [O]vSim simulates the growth and fate of each of the approximately 3000 postpubertal mouse ovarian follicles in a fashion that approximates actual biological measurements (e.g., follicle counts). [O]vSim thus offers a starting platform to simulate mammalian ovaries and to explore factors that might impact follicle development and global organ function.\\n\\nAuthor Summary[O]vSim is a computer simulation of the dynamic growth of mouse ovarian follicles. The program is offered as the beginning of a research and teaching platform to model asynchronous follicle growth and survival or death.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila larval crawling is an attractive system to study patterned motor output at the level of animal behavior. Larval crawling consists of waves of muscle contractions generating forward or reverse locomotion. In addition, larvae undergo additional behaviors including head casts, turning, and feeding. It is likely that some neurons are used in all these behaviors (e.g. motor neurons), but the identity (or even existence) of neurons dedicated to specific aspects of behavior is unclear. To identify neurons that regulate specific aspects of larval locomotion, we performed a genetic screen to identify neurons that, when activated, could elicit distinct motor programs. We used 165 Janelia CRM-Gal4 lines - chosen for sparse neuronal expression - to express the warmth-inducible neuronal activator TrpA1 and screened for locomotor defects. The primary screen measured forward locomotion velocity, and we identified 63 lines that had locomotion velocities significantly slower than controls following TrpA1 activation (28{degrees}C). A secondary screen was performed on these lines, revealing multiple discrete behavioral phenotypes including slow forward locomotion, excessive reverse locomotion, excessive turning, excessive feeding, immobile, rigid paralysis, and delayed paralysis. While many of the Gal4 lines had motor, sensory, or muscle expression that may account for some or all of the phenotype, some lines showed specific expression in a sparse pattern of interneurons. Our results show that distinct motor programs utilize distinct subsets of interneurons, and provide an entry point for characterizing interneurons governing different elements of the larval motor program.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders begin with the emergence of inappropriate synaptic connectivity early in life, yet how the sustained disruption of experience-dependent plasticity aggravates symptoms in adulthood is unclear. Here we used pup retrieval learning to assay adult cortical plasticity in a female mouse model of Rett syndrome (MeCP2het). We show that auditory cortical plasticity and retrieval learning are impaired in MeCP2het. Specifically, normal MECP2 expression in the adult auditory cortex is required for efficient retrieval learning. In wild-type mice, cohabitation with a mother and her pups triggered transient changes to auditory cortical inhibitory networks, including elevated levels of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD67. However, MeCP2het further exhibited increased expression of parvalbumin (PV) and perineuronal nets (PNNs), events thought to suppress plasticity at the closure of critical periods and in adult learning. Averting these events with genetic and pharmacological manipulations of the GABAergic network restored retrieval behavior. We propose that adult retrieval learning triggers a transient episode of inhibitory plasticity in the auditory cortex that is dysregulated in MeCP2het. This window of heightened sensitivity to social sensory cues reveals a role of MeCP2 mutations in facilitating adult plasticity that is distinct from their effects on early development.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose that a disinhibitory circuit motif, which recently gained experimental support, can instantiate flexible routing of information flow along selective pathways in a complex system of cortical areas according to behavioral demands (pathway-specific gating). We developed a network model of pyramidal neurons and three classes of interneurons, with connection probabilities constrained by data. If distinct input pathways cluster on separate dendritic branches of pyramidal neurons, then a pathway can be gated-on by disinhibiting targeted dendrites. We show that this branch-specific disinhibition can be achieved despite dense in-terneuronal connectivity, even under the assumption of random connections. We found clustering of input pathways on dendrites can emerge through synaptic plasticity regulated by disinhibition. This gating mechanism in a neural circuit is further demonstrated by performing a context-dependent decision-making task. Our findings suggest a microcircuit architecture that harnesses dendritic computation and diverse inhibitory neuron types to subserve cognitive flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster is an important laboratory model for studies of antiviral immunity in invertebrates, and Drosophila species provide a valuable system to study virus host range and host switching. Here we use metagenomic RNA sequencing of ca. 1600 adult flies to discover 25 new RNA viruses associated with six different drosophilid hosts in the wild. We also provide a comprehensive listing of viruses previously reported from the Drosophilidae. The new viruses include Iflaviruses, Rhabdoviruses, Nodaviruses, and Reoviruses, and members of unclassified lineages distantly related to Negeviruses, Sobemoviruses and Poleroviruses, Flaviviridae, and Tombusviridae. Among these are close relatives of Drosophila X virus and Flock House virus, which we find in association with wild Drosophila immigrans. These two viruses are widely used in experimental studies but have not previously been reported to naturally infect Drosophila. Although we detect no new DNA viruses, in D. immigrans and D. obscura we identify sequences very closely related to Armadillidium vulgare Iridescent virus (Invertebrate Iridescent virus 31), bringing the total number of DNA viruses found in the Drosophilidae to three.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as an important tool for various genome engineering applications. A current obstacle to high throughput applications of CRISPR/Cas9 is the imprecise prediction of highly active single guide. RNAs (sgRNAs). We previously implemented the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce tissue-specific mutations in the tunicate Ciona. In the present study, we designed and tested 83 single guide RNA (sgRNA) vectors targeting 23 genes expressed in the cardiopharyngeal progenitors and surrounding tissues of Ciona embryo. Using high-throughput sequencing of mutagenized alleles, we identified guide sequences that correlate with sgRNA mutagenesis activity and used this information for the rational design of all possible sgRNAs targeting the Ciona transcriptome. We also describe a one-step cloning-free protocol for the assembly of sgRNA expression cassettes. These cassettes can be directly electroporated as unpurified PCR products into Ciona embryos for sgRNA expression in vivo, resulting in high frequency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in somatic cells of electroporated embryos.\\n\\nWe found a strong correlation between the frequency of an Ebf loss-of-function phenotype and the mutagenesis efficacies of individual Ebf-targeting sgRNAs tested using this method. We anticipate that our approach can be scaled up to systematically design and deliver highly efficient sgRNAs for the tissue-specific investigation of gene functions in Ciona.",

    "abstract": "Identifying active cis-regulatory regions in the human genome is critical for understanding gene regulation and assessing the impact of genetic variation on phenotype. Based on rich data resources such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM) projects, we introduce DECRES, the first supervised deep learning approach for the identification of enhancer and promoter regions in the human genome. Due to their ability to discover patterns in large and complex data, the introduction of deep learning methods enables a significant advance in our knowledge of the genomic locations of cis-regulatory regions. Using models for well-characterized cell lines, we identify key experimental features that contribute to the predictive performance. Applying DECRES, we delineate locations of 300,000 candidate enhancers genome wide (6.8% of the genome, of which 40,000 are supported by bidirectional transcription data) and 26,000 candidate promoters (0.6% of the genome).",

    "abstract": "A number of methods have been developed to use genetic sequence data to identify and delineate species. Some methods are based on heuristics, such as DNA barcoding which is based on a sequence-distance threshold, while others use Bayesian model comparison under the multispecies coalescent model. Here we use mathematical analysis and computer simulation to demonstrate large differences in statistical performance of species identification between DNA barcoding and Bayesian inference under the multispecies coalescent model as implemented in the BPP program. We show that a fixed genetic-distance threshold as used in DNA barcoding is problematic for delimiting species, even if the threshold is \\\"optimized\\\", because different species have different population sizes and different divergence times, and therefore display different amounts of intra-species versus inter-species variation. In contrast, BPP can reliably delimit species in such situations with only one locus and rarely supports a wrong assignment with high posterior probability. While under-sampling or rare specimens may pose problems for heuristic methods, BPP can delimit species with high power when multi-locus data are used, even if the species is represented by a single specimen. Finally we demonstrate that BPP may be powerful for delimiting cryptic species using specimens that are misidentified as a single species in the barcoding library.",
