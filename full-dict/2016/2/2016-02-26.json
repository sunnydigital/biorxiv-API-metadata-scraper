    "abstract": "ImportanceSeveral recent public health crises have shown that the surveillance of zoonotic agents in wildlife is important to prevent pandemic risks. Rodents are intermediate hosts for numerous zoonotic bacteria. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are very useful for the detection and surveillance of zoonotic bacteria, but rigorous experimental processes are required for the use of these cheap and effective tools in such epidemiological contexts. In particular, HTS introduces biases into the raw dataset that might lead to incorrect interpretations. We describe here a procedure for cleaning data before estimating reliable biological parameters, such as bacterial positivity, prevalence and coinfection, by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. This procedure, applied to 711 commensal rodents collected from 24 villages in Senegal, Africa, detected several emerging bacterial genera, some in high prevalence, while never before reported for West Africa. This study constitutes a step towards the use of HTS to improve our understanding of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission posed by wildlife, by providing a new strategy for the use of HTS platforms to monitor both bacterial diversity and infection dynamics in wildlife. In the future, this approach could be adapted for the monitoring of other microbes such as protists, fungi, and even viruses.\\n\\nSummaryHuman impact on natural habitats is increasing the complexity of human-wildlife interfaces and leading to the emergence of infectious diseases worldwide. Highly successful synanthropic wildlife species, such as rodents, will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in transmitting zoonotic diseases. We investigated the potential of recent developments in 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to facilitate the multiplexing of large numbers of samples, to improve our understanding of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission posed by urban rodents in West Africa. In addition to listing pathogenic bacteria in wild populations, as in other high-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies, our approach can estimate essential parameters for studies of zoonotic risk, such as prevalence and patterns of coinfection within individual hosts. However, the estimation of these parameters requires cleaning of the raw data to eliminate the biases generated by HTS methods. We present here an extensive review of these biases and of their consequences, and we propose a trimming strategy for managing them and cleaning the dataset. We also analyzed 711 commensal rodents collected from 24 villages in Senegal, including 208 Mus musculus domesticus, 189 Rattus rattus, 93 Mastomys natalensis and 221 Mastomys erythroleucus. Seven major genera of pathogenic bacteria were detected: Borrelia, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Streptobacillus and Orientia. The last five of these genera have never before been detected in West African rodents. Bacterial prevalence ranged from 0% to 90%, depending on the bacterial taxon, rodent species and site considered, and a mean of 26% of rodents displayed coinfection. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing strategy presented here has the advantage over other molecular surveillance tools of dealing with a large spectrum of bacterial pathogens without requiring assumptions about their presence in the samples. This approach is, thus, particularly suitable for continuous pathogen surveillance in the framework of disease monitoring programs",

The genetic variance components are defined in terms of genotypic values reflecting underlying genetic architecture (additive, dominance and epistatic genotypic effects) and allele frequencies. However, the dependency of the definition of genetic variance components on the underlying genetic models is not often appreciated. Here, we show how the partitioning of additive and non-additive genetic variation is affected by the genetic models and parameterization of allelic effects. We show that arbitrarily defined variance components often capture a substantial fraction of total genetic variation regardless of the underlying genetic architecture in simulated and real data. Therefore, variance component analysis cannot be used to infer genetic architecture of quantitative traits. The genetic basis of quantitative trait variation in a natural population can only be defined empirically using high resolution mapping methods followed by detailed characterization of QTL effects.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key players of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. These proteins influence both cellular physiology and pathology by regulating processes ranging from splicing and polyadenylation to mRNA localization, stability, and translation. To fine-tune the outcome of their regulatory action, RBPs rely on an intricate web of competitive and cooperative interactions. Several studies have described individual interactions of RBPs with RBP mRNAs, suggestive of a RBP-RBP regulatory structure. Here we present the first systematic investigation of this structure, based on a network including almost fifty thousand experimentally determined interactions between RBPs and bound RBP mRNAs.\\n\\nOur analysis identified two features defining the structure of the RBP-RBP regulatory network. What we call \\\"RBP clusters\\\" are groups of densely interconnected RBPs which co-regulate their targets, suggesting a tight control of cooperative and competitive behaviors. \\\"RBP chains\\\", instead, are hierarchical structures driven by evolutionarily ancient RBPs, which connect the RBP clusters and could in this way provide the flexibility to coordinate the tuning of a broad set of biological processes.\\n\\nThe combination of these two features suggests that RBP chains may use the modulation of their RBP targets to coordinately control the different cell programs controlled by the RBP clusters. Under this island-hopping model, the regulatory signal flowing through the chains hops from one RBP cluster to another, implementing elaborate regulatory plans to impact cellular phenotypes. This work thus establishes RBP-RBP interactions as a backbone driving post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression to allow the fine-grained control of RBPs and their targets.",

    "abstract": "Software to call single nucleotide polymorphisms or related genetic variants has converged on the variant call format (VCF) as the output format of choice. This has created a need for tools to work with VCF files. While an increasing number of software exists to read VCF data, many only extract the genotypes without including the data associated with each genotype that describes its quality. We created the R package vcfR to address this issue. We developed a VCF file exploration tool implemented in the R language because R provides an interactive experience and an environment that is commonly used for genetic data analysis. Functions to read and write VCF files into R as well as functions to extract portions of the data and to plot summary statistics of the data are implemented. VcfR further provides the ability to visualize how various parameterizations of the data affect the results. Additional tools are included to integrate sequence (FASTA) and annotation data (GFF) for visualization of genomic regions such as chromosomes. Conversion functions translate data from the vcfR data structure to formats used by other R genetics packages. Computationally intensive functions are implemented in C++ to improve performance. Use of these tools is intended to facilitate VCF data exploration, including intuitive methods for data quality control and easy export to other R packages for further analysis. VcfR thus provides essential, novel tools currently not available in R.",

We address the question if model selection matters topologically, that is, if conducting ML inferences under the optimal, instead of a standard General Time Reversible model, yields different tree topologies. We also assess, to which degree models selected and trees inferred under the three standard criteria (AIC, AICc, BIC) differ. Finally, we assess if the definition of the sample size (#sites versus #sites x #taxa) yields different models and, as a consequence, different tree topologies.\\n\\nResultsWe find that, all three factors (by order of impact: nucleotide model selection, information criterion used, sample size definition) can yield topologically substantially different final tree topologies (topological difference exceeding 10%) for approximately 5% of the tree inferences conducted on the 39 empirical datasets used in our study.\\n\\nConclusionsWe find that, using the best-fit nucleotide substitution model may change the final ML tree topology compared to an inference under a default GTR model. The effect is less pronounced when comparing distinct information criteria. Nonetheless, in some cases we did obtain substantial topological differences.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate choice and commitment of multipotent progenitor cells to a differentiated lineage requires broad changes of their gene expression profile. However, how progenitor cells overcome the stability of their robust gene expression configuration (attractor) and exit their state remains elusive. Here we show that commitment of blood progenitor cells to the erythroid or the myeloid lineage is preceded by the destabilization of their high-dimensional attractor state and that cells undergo a critical state transition. Single-cell resolution analysis of gene expression in populations of differentiating cells affords a new quantitative index for predicting critical transitions in a high-dimensional state space: decrease of correlation between cells with concomitant increase of correlation between genes as cells approach a tipping point. The detection of \\\"rebellious cells\\\" which enter the fate opposite to the one intended corroborates the model of preceding destabilization of the progenitor state. Thus, \\\"early-warning signals\\\" associated with critical transitions can be detected in statistical ensembles of high-dimensional systems, offering a formal tool for analyzing single-cells molecular profiles that goes beyond computational pattern recognition but is based on dynamical systems theory and can predict impending major shifts in cell populations in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Flowers show important structural variation as reproductive organs but the evolutionary forces underlying this diversity are still poorly understood. In animal-pollinated species, flower shape is strongly fashioned by selection imposed by pollinators, which is expected to vary according to guilds of effective pollinators. Using the Antillean subtribe Gesneriinae (Gesneriaceae), we tested the hypothesis that pollination specialists pollinated by one functional type of pollinator have maintained more similar corolla shapes through time due to stronger selection constraints compared to species with more generalist pollination strategies. Using geometric morphometrics and evolutionary models, we showed that the corolla of hummingbird specialists, bat specialists, and species with a mixed-pollination strategy (pollinated by hummingbirds and bats; thus a more generalist strategy) have distinct shapes and that these shapes have evolved under evolutionary constraints. However, we did not find support for smaller disparity in corolla shape for hummingbird specialists compared to more generalist species. This could be because the corolla shape of more generalist species in subtribe Gesneriinae, which has evolved multiple times, is finely adapted to be effectively pollinated by both bats and hummingbirds. These results suggest that pollination generalization is not necessarily associated with relaxed selection constraints.",

This is important as the inclusion of spatial correlations in continuum models of cell motility and proliferation without domain growth has previously been shown to be essential for their accuracy in certain scenarios. We include the effect of spatial correlations by deriving a system of ordinary differential equations that describe the expected evolution of individual and pair density functions for agents on a growing domain.

    "abstract": "Background.Background. Copy number variants (CNVs) are a type of polymorphism found to underlie phenotypic variation, both in humans and livestock. Most surveys of CNV in livestock have been conducted in the cattle genome, and often utilise only a single approach for the detection of copy number differences. Here we performed a study of CNV in sheep, using multiple methods to identify and characterise copy number changes. Comprehensive information from small pedigrees (trios) was collected using multiple platforms (array CGH, SNP chip and whole genome sequence data), with these data then analysed via multiple approaches to identify and verify CNVs.\\n\\nResults.In total, 3,488 autosomal CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified from 30 sheep. The average length of the identified CNVRs was 19kb (range of 1kb to 3.6Mb), with shorter CNVRs being more frequent than longer CNVRs. The total length of all CNVRs was 67.6Mbps, which equates to 2.7% of the sheep autosomes. For individuals this value ranged from 0.24 to 0.55%, and the majority of CNVRs were identified in single animals. Rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the genome, CNVRs tended to be clustered. Application of three independent approaches for CNVR detection facilitated a comparison of validation rates. CNVs identified on the Roche-NimbleGen 2.1M CGH array generally had low validation rates, while whole genome sequence data had the highest validation rate.\\n\\nConclusions.This study represents the first comprehensive survey of the distribution, prevalence and characteristics of CNVR in sheep. Multiple approaches were used to detect CNV regions and it appears that the best method for verifying CNVR on a large scale involves using a combination of detection methodologies. The characteristics of the 3,488 autosomal CNV regions identified in this study are comparable to other CNV regions reported in the literature and provide a valuable addition to the small subset of published sheep CNVs.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological developments allow investigation of the repeatability of evolution at the genomic level. Such investigation is particularly powerful when applied to a ring species, in which spatial variation represents changes during the evolution of two species from one. We examined genomic variation among three subspecies of the greenish warbler ring species, using genotypes at 13,013,950 nucleotide sites along a new greenish warbler consensus genome assembly. Genomic regions of low within-group variation are remarkably consistent between the three populations. These regions show high relative differentiation but low absolute differentiation between populations. Comparisons with outgroup species show the locations of these peaks of relative differentiation are not well explained by phylogenetically-conserved variation in recombination rates or selection. These patterns are consistent with a model in which selection in an ancestral form has reduced variation at some parts of the genome, and those same regions experience recurrent selection that subsequently reduces variation within each subspecies. The degree of heterogeneity in nucleotide diversity is greater than explained by models background selection, but are consistent with selective sweeps. Given the evidence that greenish warblers have had both population differentiation for a long period of time and periods of gene flow between those populations, we propose that some genomic regions underwent selective sweeps over a broad geographic area followed by within-population selection-induced reductions in variation. An important implication of this \\\"sweep-before-differentiation\\\" model is that genomic regions of high relative differentiation may have moved among populations more recently than other genomic regions.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal and striatal memory systems operate independently and in parallel in supporting spatial and response learning, respectively, when animals are explicitly trained in one task. Here, we investigated whether this principle continues to hold when animals are concurrently trained in two types of tasks. Rats were trained on a plus maze in either a spatial navigation or a cue response task (individual training), while a third set of rats acquired both (concurrent training). Subsequently, the rats underwent either sham surgery or neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus (HPC), medial dorsal striatum (DSM) or lateral dorsal striatum (DSL), followed by retention testing. Finally, rats in the individual training condition also acquired the novel  other task. When rats learned one task, HPC and DSL selectively supported spatial navigation cue response, respectively. However, when rats learned both tasks, HPC and DSL additionally supported the behavior incongruent with the processing style of the corresponding memory system. DSM significantly contributed to performance regardless of task or training procedure. Experience with the cue response task facilitated subsequent spatial learning, while experience with spatial navigation delayed both simultaneous and subsequent response learning. These findings suggest that multiple principles govern the interactions among memory systems.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCurrently, we distinguish among several types of memories, each supported by a distinct neural circuit. The memory systems are thought to operate independently and in parallel. Here, we demonstrate that the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum memory systems indeed operate independently and in parallel when rats learn one type of task at a time, but interact co-operatively and in synergism when rats concurrently learn two types of tasks. Furthermore, new learning is modulated by past experiences. These results can be explained by a model in which independent and parallel information processing that occurs in the separate memory-related neural circuits is supplemented by information transfer between the memory systems at the level of the cortex.",

    "abstract": "Fluid intelligence is a crucial cognitive ability that predicts key life outcomes across the lifespan. Strong empirical links exist between fluid intelligence and processing speed on the one hand, and white matter integrity and processing speed on the other. We propose a watershed model that integrates these three explanatory levels in a principled manner in a single statistical model, with processing speed and white matter figuring as intermediate endophenotypes. We fit this model in a large (N=555) adult lifespan cohort from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) using multiple measures of processing speed, white matter health and fluid intelligence. The model fit the data well, outperforming competing models and providing evidence for a many-to-one mapping between white matter integrity, processing speed and fluid intelligence. The model can be naturally extended to integrate other cognitive domains, endophenotypes and genotypes.",

    "abstract": "The electrophysiological study of learning is hampered by modern procedures for estimating firing rates: Such procedures usually require large datasets, and also require that included trials be functionally identical. Unless a method can track the real-time dynamics of how firing rates evolve, learning can only be examined in the past tense. We propose a quantitative procedure, called ARRIS, that can uncover trial-by-trial firing dynamics. ARRIS provides reliable estimates of firing rates based on small samples using the reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Using weighted interpolation, ARRIS can also provide estimates that evolve over time. As a result, both real-time estimates of changing activity, and of task-dependent tuning, can be obtained during the initial stages of learning.",
