    "abstract": "Motivated by load balance issues in parallel calculations of the phylogenetic likelihood function, we recently introduced an approximation algorithm for efficiently distributing partitioned alignment data to a given number of CPUs. The goal is to balance the accumulated number of sites per CPU, and, at the same time, to minimize the maximum number of unique partitions per CPU. The approximation algorithm assumes that likelihood calculations on individual alignment sites have identical runtimes and that likelihood calculation times on distinct sites are entirely independent from each other. However, a recently introduced optimization of the phylogenetic likelihood function, the so-called site repeats technique, violates both aforementioned assumptions. To this end, we modify our data distribution algorithm and explore 72 distinct heuristic strategies that take into account the additional restrictions induced by site repeats, to yield a  good parallel load balance.\\n\\nOur best heuristic strategy yields a reduction in required arithmetic operations that ranges between 2% and 92% with an average of 62% for all test datasets using 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 CPUs compared to the original site-repeat-agnostic data distribution algorithm.",

    "abstract": "There is intense interest in developing novel biomaterials which support the invasion and proliferation of living cells for potential applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Decellularization of existing tissues have formed the basis of one major approach to producing 3D scaffolds for such purposes. In this study, we utilize the native hypanthium tissue of apples and a simple preparation methodology to create implantable cellulose scaffolds. To examine biocompatibility, scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in wild-type, immunocompetent mice (males and females; 6-9 weeks old). Following the implantation, the scaffolds were resected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks and processed for histological analysis (H&E, Massons Trichrome, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 antibodies). Histological analysis revealed a characteristic foreign body response to the scaffold 1 week post-implantation. However, the immune response was observed to gradually disappear by 8 weeks post-implantation. By 8 weeks, there was no immune response in the surrounding dermis tissue and active fibroblast migration within the cellulose scaffold was observed. This was concomitant with the deposition of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Furthermore, active blood vessel formation within the scaffold was observed throughout the period of study indicating the pro-angiogenic properties of the native scaffolds. Finally, while the scaffolds retain much of their original shape they do undergo a slow deformation over the 8-week length of the study. Taken together, our results demonstrate that native cellulose scaffolds are biocompatible and exhibit promising potential as a surgical biomaterial.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that is rapidly spreading across the Americas1. Due to a probable association between Zika virus infection and a congenital neurological disorder called microcephaly2, the epidemic trajectory of this viral infection poses a significant concern for the nearly 15 million children born in the Americas each year. The potential magnitude of the ongoing Zika epidemic is exceedingly difficult to gauge based on existing data3, due to a number of uncertainties that cloud the relationship between observed cases and true infections. As an alternative to methods that depend on unreliable case data, we developed and applied a new method that leverages highly spatially resolved data about drivers of Zika transmission to project that 1.1 (1.0-1.9) million infections in childbearing women and 64.2 (53.6-108.1) million infections across all demographic strata could occur before the first wave of the epidemic concludes. Our projection is largely consistent with annual, region-wide estimates of 53.8 (40.0-71.8) million infections by dengue virus4, which has many similarities to Zika. Our projection is also consistent with state-level data from Brazil on confirmed, Zika-associated microcephaly cases5, and it suggests that the current epidemic has the potential to negatively impact tens of thousands of pregnancies. These projections constitute an important early contribution to efforts to understand the potential magnitude of the Zika epidemic, and our methods offer a new way to make rapid assessments of the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeuroticism is a risk factor for selected mental and physical illnesses and is inversely associated with intelligence. Intelligence appears to interact with neuroticism and mitigate its detrimental effects on physical health and mortality. However, the inter-relationships of neuroticism and intelligence for major depressive disorder (MDD) and psychological distress has not been well examined.\\n\\nMethodsAssociations and interactions between neuroticism and general intelligence (g) on MDD and psychological distress were examined in two population-based cohorts: Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS, N=19,200) and UK Biobank (N=90,529). The Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form-Revised measured neuroticism and g was extracted from multiple cognitive ability tests in each cohort. Family structure was adjusted for in GS:SFHS.\\n\\nResultsNeuroticism was associated with MDD and psychological distress in both samples. A significant interaction between neuroticism and g in predicting MDD status was found in UK Biobank (OR = 0.96, p < .01), suggesting that higher g ameliorated the adverse effects of neuroticism on the likelihood of having MDD. This interaction was not found in GS:SFHS. In both samples, higher neuroticism and lower intelligence were associated with increased psychological distress. A significant interaction was also found in both cohorts (GS:SFHS: {beta} = -0.05, p < .01; UK Biobank: {beta} = -0.02, p < .01), such that intelligence protected against the deleterious effect of neuroticism on psychological distress.\\n\\nConclusionsFrom two large cohort studies, our findings suggest intelligence acts a protective factor in mitigating the effects of neuroticism on risk for depressive illness and psychological distress.",

    "abstract": "The African Great Lakes are characterized by an extraordinary diversity of endemic cichlid fish species. The cause of this diversity is still largely unknown. Most studies have tried to solve this question by focusing on macro-evolutionary processes, such as speciation. However, the ecological processes determining local cichlid diversity have so far been understudied, even though knowledge on these might be crucial for understanding larger scale biodiversity patterns.\\n\\nUsing trait, environmental and abundance data of cichlid fishes along 36 transects, we have studied how differences in local environmental conditions influence cichlid community assembly in the littoral of Lake Tanganyika, Zambia. We investigated changes in average trait values and in trait-based community assembly processes along three key environmental gradients.\\n\\nSpecies diversity and local abundance decreased with increasing sand cover and diet-associated traits changed with depth. Analyses on within-community trait diversity patterns indicated that cichlid community assembly was mainly driven by stochastic processes, to a smaller extent by processes that limit the similarity among co-existing species and least by filtering processes that limit the range of species traits occurring in an environment. Despite, the low impact of habitat filtering processes, we find community dissimilarity to increase with increasing environmental difference.\\n\\nOur results suggest that local environmental conditions determine cichlid abundance, while the predominance of stochastic community assembly across all environments explains why the communities with the highest abundances contain most species.",

    "abstract": "Mareks disease (MD) is a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by airborne gallid herpesvirus type 2 (GaHV-2, aka MDV-1). Mature virions are formed in the feather follicle epithelium cells of infected chickens from which the virus is shed as fine particles of skin and feather debris, or poultry dust. Poultry dust is the major source of virus transmission between birds in agricultural settings. Despite both clinical and laboratory data that show increased virulence in field isolates of MDV-1 over the last 40 years, we do not yet understand the genetic basis of MDV-1 pathogenicity. Our present knowledge on genome-wide variation in the MDV-1 genome comes exclusively from laboratory-grown isolates. MDV-1 isolates tend to lose virulence with increasing passage number in vitro, raising concerns about their ability to accurately reflect virus in the field. The ability to rapidly and directly sequence field isolates of MDV-1 is critical to understanding the genetic basis of rising virulence in circulating wild strains. Here we present the first complete genomes of uncultured, field-isolated MDV-1. These five consensus genomes were derived directly from poultry dust or single chicken feather follicles without passage in cell culture. These sources represent the shed material that is transmitted to new hosts, vs. the virus produced by a point source in one animal. We developed a new procedure to extract and enrich viral DNA, while reducing host and environmental contamination. DNA was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput approaches and processed through a recently described bioinformatics workflow for de novo assembly and curation of herpesvirus genomes. We comprehensively compared these genomes to one another and also to previously described MDV-1 genomes. The field-isolated genomes had remarkably high DNA identity when compared to one another, with few variant proteins between them. In an analysis of genetic distance, the five new field genomes grouped separately from all previously described genomes. Each consensus genome was also assessed to determine the level of polymorphisms within each sample, which revealed that MDV-1 exists in the wild as a polymorphic population. By tracking a new polymorphic locus in ICP4 over time, we found that MDV-1 genomes can evolve in short period of time. Together these approaches advance our ability to assess MDV-1 variation within and between hosts, over time, and during adaptation to changing conditions.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade we witnessed how computational docking methods became a crucial tool in the search for new drug candidates. The  central dogma of small molecule docking is that compounds that dock correctly into the receptor are more likely to display biological activity than those that do not dock. This  dogma, however, possesses multiple twists and turns that may not be obvious to novice dockers. The first premise is that the compounds must dock; this implies: (i) availability of data, (ii) realistic representation of the chemical entities in a form that can be understood by the computer and the software, and, (iii) exhaustive sampling of the protein-ligand conformational space. The second premise is that, after the sampling, all docking solutions must be ranked correctly with a score representing the physico-chemical foundations of binding. The third premise is that  correctness must be defined unambiguously, usually by comparison with  static experimental data (or lack thereof). Each of these premises involves some degree of simplification of reality, and overall loss in the accuracy of the docking predictions.\\n\\nIn this chapter we will revise our latest experiences in receptor-based docking when dealing with all three above-mentioned issues. First, we will explain the theoretical foundation of ICM docking, along with a brief explanation on how we measure performance. Second, we will contextualize ICM by showing its performance in single and multiple receptor conformation schemes with the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) and the Pocketome. Third, we will describe which strategies we are using to represent protein plasticity, like using multiple crystallographic structures or Monte Carlo (MC) and Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) sampling methods, emphasizing how to overcome the associated pitfalls (e.g., increased number of false positives). In the last section, we will describe ALiBERO, a new tool that is helping us to improve the discriminative power of X-ray structures and homology models in screening campaigns.",

    "abstract": "Natural packed tissues are assembled as tessellations of polygonal cells that do not leave empty spaces between them. They include the epithelial sheets and the skeletal muscles. Epithelia are formed by equivalent cells that change shape and organization through development. The skeletal muscles appear as a mosaic composed by two different types of cells: the slow and fast fibres that are determined by the identities of the motor neurons that innervate them. Their relative distribution is important for the muscle function and can be altered in some neuromuscular diseases. Little is known about how the spatial organization of fast and slow fibres is established and maintained. In this work we use computerized image analysis and mathematical concepts to capture the organizational pattern in two different healthy muscles: biceps brachii and quadriceps. Here we show that each type of muscle portrays a characteristic topological pattern that allows distinguishing between them. The biceps brachii muscle presents a particular arrange based on the different size of slow and fast fibres, contrary to the quadriceps muscle where an unbiased distribution exists. Our results indicate that the relative size of each cellular type imposes an intrinsic organization into the tissue. These findings establish a new framework for the analysis of packed tissues where two or more cell types exist.",
