    "abstract": "We present a dynamical model of drug accumulation in bacteria. The model captures key features in experimental time courses on ofloxacin accumulation: initial uptake; two-phase response; and long-term acclimation. In combination with experimental data, the model provides estimates of import and export rates in each phase, the time of entry into the second phase, and the decrease of internal drug during acclimation. Global sensitivity analysis, local sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the model provide information about the robustness of these estimates, and about the relative importance of different parameters in determining the features of the accumulation time courses in three different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results lead to experimentally testable predictions of the effects of membrane permeability, drug efflux and trapping (e.g., by DNA binding) on drug accumulation. A key prediction is that a sudden increase in ofloxacin accumulation in both E. coli and S. aureus is accompanied by a decrease in membrane permeability.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBacteria live or die depending on how much antibiotic gets inside them. Using a simple mathematical model, detailed information about drug import and export can be teased out of time courses of internal drug levels after a sudden exposure. The results suggest that membrane permeability can suddenly decrease during exposure to drug, accompanied by an increase, rather than a decrease, in the internal drug level.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered as a major source of innovation in bacteria, and as such is expected to drive adaptation to new ecological niches. However, among the many genes acquired through HGT along the diversification history of genomes, only a fraction may have actively contributed to sustained ecological adaptation. We used a phylogenetic approach accounting for the transfer of genes (or groups of genes) to estimate the history of genomes in Agrobacterium biovar 1, a diverse group of soil and plant-dwelling bacterial species. We identified clade-specific blocks of co-transferred genes encoding coherent biochemical pathways that may have contributed to the evolutionary success of key Agrobacterium clades. This pattern of gene co-evolution rejects a neutral model of transfer, in which neighbouring genes would be transferred independently of their function and rather suggests purifying selection on collectively coded acquired pathways. The acquisition of these synapomorphic blocks of co-functioning genes probably drove the ecological diversification of Agrobacterium and defined features of ancestral ecological niches, which consistently hint at a strong selective role of host plant rhizospheres.",

    "abstract": "AimMany important patterns and processes vary across the phylogeny and depend on phylogenetic scale. Yet, phylogenetic scale has never been formally conceptualized and its potential remains largely unexplored. Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields, and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions.\\n\\nMethodsWe summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography, and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale-dependence, scaling, and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be employed to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism, or species-abundance distributions.\\n\\nMain conclusionsExplicit consideration of phylogenetic scale can provide new and more complete insight into many longstanding questions across multiple fields (macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography, macroevolution). Building on the existing resources and isolated efforts across fields, future research centered on phylogenetic scale might enrich our understanding of the processes that together, but over different scales, shape the diversity of life.",

Feature selection is intended to preserve biologically relevant information while removing genes only subject to technical noise.

Several different approaches have been proposed for unsupervised feature selection from unprocessed single-cell expression matrices, most based upon identifying highly variable genes in the dataset. We present two methods which take advantage of the prevalence of zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data to identify features.

    "abstract": "Despite intensive research on genetics of the craniofacial morphology using animal models and human craniofacial syndromes, the genetic variation that underpins normal human facial appearance is still largely elusive. Recent development of novel digital methods for capturing the complexity of craniofacial morphology in conjunction with high-throughput genotyping methods, show great promise for unravelling the genetic basis of such a complex trait.\\n\\nAs a part of our efforts on detecting genomic variants affecting normal craniofacial appearance, we have implemented a candidate gene approach by selecting 1,201 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4,732 tag SNPs in over 170 candidate genes and intergenic regions. We used 3-dimentional (3D) facial scans and direct cranial measurements of 587 volunteers to calculate 104 craniofacial phenotypes. Following genotyping by massively parallel sequencing, genetic associations between 2,332 genetic markers and 104 craniofacial phenotypes were tested.\\n\\nAn application of a Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance threshold produced significant associations between five craniofacial traits and six SNPs. Specifically, associations of nasal width with rs8035124 (15q26.1), cephalic index with rs16830498 (2q23.3), nasal index with rs37369 (5q13.2), transverse nasal prominence angle with rs59037879 (10p11.23) and rs10512572 (17q24.3), and principal component explaining 73.3% of all the craniofacial phenotypes, with rs37369 (5p13.2) and rs390345 (14q31.3) were observed.\\n\\nDue to over-conservative nature of the Bonferroni correction, we also report all the associations that reached the traditional genome-wide p-value threshold (<5.00E-08) as suggestive. Based on the genome-wide threshold, 8 craniofacial phenotypes demonstrated significant associations with 34 intergenic and extragenic SNPs. The majority of associations are novel, except PAX3 and COL11A1 genes, which were previously reported to affect normal craniofacial variation.\\n\\nThis study identified the largest number of genetic variants associated with normal variation of craniofacial morphology to date by using a candidate gene approach, including confirmation of the two previously reported genes. These results enhance our understanding of the genetics that determines normal variation in craniofacial morphology and will be of particular value in medical and forensic fields.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThere is a remarkable variety of human facial appearances, almost exclusively the result of genetic differences, as exemplified by the striking resemblance of identical twins. However, the genes and specific genetic variants that affect the size and shape of the cranium and the soft facial tissue features are largely unknown. Numerous studies on animal models and human craniofacial disorders have identified a large number of genes, which may regulate normal craniofacial embryonic development.\\n\\nIn this study we implemented a targeted candidate gene approach to select more than 1,200 polymorphisms in over 170 genes that are likely to be involved in craniofacial development and morphology. These markers were genotyped in 587 DNA samples using massively parallel sequencing and analysed for association with 104 traits generated from 3-dimensional facial images and direct craniofacial measurements. Genetic associations (p-values<5.00E-08) were observed between 8 craniofacial traits and 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including two previously described genes and 26 novel candidate genes and intergenic regions. This comprehensive candidate gene study has uncovered the largest number of novel genetic variants affecting normal facial appearance to date. These results will appreciably extend our understanding of the normal and abnormal embryonic development and impact our ability to predict the appearance of an individual from a DNA sample in forensic criminal investigations and missing person cases.",

    "abstract": "The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness richness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive way to measure human brain structure and activity that has been used for over 25 years. There are thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data analysis methods are being developed every year. The potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of existing and newly acquired data is hindered by difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for standardized input data. Here we propose to use container technology to make deployment of a wide range of data analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the existing data analysis tools to interface with data organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated progress in human neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "1Quiescent (Q-Cell) Escherichia coli cultures can be created by using the signalling molecule indole to halt cell division of an hns mutant strain. This uncouples metabolism from cell growth and allows for more efficient use of carbon feedstocks. However, the reason for the increased productivity of cells in this state was previously unknown. We show here that Q-cells can maintain metabolic activity in the absence of growth for up to 24 h, leading to four times greater per-cell productivity of a model metabolite, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), than a control. Metabolomic data show that by disrupting the proton-motive force, indole interrupts the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to the accumulation of metabolites in the glycolysis pathway that are excellent starting points for high-value chemical production. By comparing protein expression patterns between wild-type and Q-cell cultures we show that Q-cells overexpress stress response proteins, which prime them to tolerate the metabolic imbalances incurred through indole addition. Quiescent cultures produced half the cell biomass of control cultures lacking indole, but were still able to produce 39.4 g.L-1 of 3HB compared to 18.6 g.L-1 in the control. Therefore, Q-cells have high potential as a platform technology for the efficient production of a wide range of commodity and high value chemicals.",

In humans, most germline mutations are paternal in origin and the numbers of mutations per offspring increase markedly with paternal age 2,8,9 and more weakly with maternal age 10. Germline mutations can arise at any stage of the cellular lineage from zygote to gamete, resulting in mutations being represented in different proportion and types of cells, with the earliest embryonic mutations being mosaic in both somatic and germline cells. Here we use WGS of multi-sibling mouse and human pedigrees to show striking differences in germline mutation rate and spectra between the two species, including a dramatic reduction in mutation rate in human spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) divisions, which we hypothesise was driven by selection. The differences we observed between mice and humans result from both biological differences within the same stage of embryogenesis or gametogenesis and species-specific differences in cellular genealogies of the germline.",

    "abstract": "Experiments examining the social dynamics of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) have focused on mutants which do not respond to signals, and the role of QS-regulated exoproducts as public goods. The potential for QS signal molecules to themselves be social public goods has received much less attention. Here, we analyse how signal-deficient (lasI-) mutants of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa interact with wild-type cells in an environment where QS is required for growth. We show that when growth requires a  private intracellular metabolic mechanism activated by the presence of QS signal, lasI- mutants act as social cheats and outcompete signal-producing wild-type bacteria in mixed cultures, because they can use the signals produced by wild type cells. However, reducing the ability of signal molecules to diffuse through the growth medium, results in signal molecules becoming less accessible to mutants, leading to reduced cheating. Our results indicate that QS signal molecules can be considered as social public goods in a way that has been previously described for other exoproducts, but that spatial structuring of populations reduces exploitation by non-cooperative signal cheats.\\n\\nImportanceBacteria communicate via signaling molecules to regulate the expression of a whole range of genes. This process, termed quorum sensing (QS), moderates bacterial metabolism in many environmental conditions, from soil and water (where QS-regulated genes influence nutrient cycling) to animal hosts (where QS-regulated genes determine pathogen virulence). Understanding the ecology of QS could therefore yield vital clues as to how we might modify bacterial behaviour for environmental or clinical gains. Here, we demonstrate that QS signals act as shareable public goods. This means that their evolution, and therefore population-level responses to interference with QS, will be constrained by population structure. Further, we show that environmental structure (constraints on signal diffusion) alters the accessibility of QS signals and demonstrates that we need to consider population and environmental structure to help us further our understanding of QS signaling systems.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of newly formed natural or artificial polyploids may experience rapid gene loss and genome restructuring. In this study, we obtained tetraploid hybrids (4n=148, 4nJB) and triploid hybrids (3n=124, 3nJB) derived from the hybridization of two different subfamily species Carassius cuvieri ([female], 2n = 100, JCC) and Megalobrama amblycephala ([male], 2n = 48, BSB). Some significant morphological and physiological differences were detected in the polyploidy hybrids compared with their parents. To reveal the molecular traits of the polyploids, we compared the liver transcriptomes of 4nJB, 3nJB and their parents. The results indicated high proportion chimeric genes (31 > %) and mutated orthologous genes (17 > %) both in 4nJB and 3nJB. We classified 10 gene patterns within three categories in 4nJB and 3nJB orthologous gene, and characterized 30 randomly chosen genes using genomic DNA to confirm the chimera or mutant. Moreover, we mapped chimeric genes involved pathways and discussed that the phenotypic novelty of the hybrids may relate to some chimeric genes. For example, we found there is an intragenic insertion in the K+ channel kcnk5b, which may be related to the novel presence of the barbels in 4nJB. Our results indicated that the genomes of newly formed polyploids experienced rapid restructuring post-polyploidization, which may results in the phenotypic and phenotypic changes among the polyploidy hybrid offspring. The formation of the 4nJB and 3nJB provided new insights into the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of hybrid fish resulting from distant hybridization between subfamilies.",

As planktonically-grown M. tuberculosis are unlikely to be entirely representative of the bacterium during infection, we set out to determine how effective a range of anti-mycobacterial treatments were against M. tuberculosis growing as a biofilm, a bacterial phenotype known to be more resistant to antibiotic treatment. Light levels from bioluminescently-labelled M. tuberculosis H37Rv (strain BSG001) were used as a surrogate for bacterial viability, and were monitored before and after 1 week of treatment. After treatment, biofilms were disrupted, washed and inoculated into fresh broth and plated onto solid media to rescue any surviving bacteria. We found that in this phenotypic state M. tuberculosis was resistant to the majority of the compounds tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) increased by 20-fold to greater than 1000-fold, underlying the potential of this phenotype to cause significant problems during treatment.",

In Brazil, the Asian and East-Central South African (ECSA) genotypes are circulating in the north and northeast of the country, respectively. In 2015, the first autochthonous cases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil were reported but until now the circulating strains have not been characterized. Therefore, we aimed here to perform the molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of CHIKV strains circulating in the 2016 outbreak occurred in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro.\\n\\nMethodsThe cases analyzed in this study were collected at a private Hospital, from April 2016 to May 2016, during the chikungunya outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All cases were submitted to the Real Time RT-PCR for CHIKV genome detection and to anti-CHIKV IgM ELISA. Chikungunya infection was laboratorially confirmed by at least one diagnostic method and, randomly selected positive cases (n=10), were partially sequenced (CHIKV E1 gene) and analyzed.\\n\\nResultsThe results showed that all the samples grouped in ECSA genotype branch and the molecular characterization of the fragment did not reveal the A226V mutation in the Rio de Janeiro strains analyzed, but a K211T amino acid substitution was observed for the first time in all samples and a V156A substitution in two of ten samples.\\n\\nConclusionsPhylogenetic analysis and molecular characterization reveals the circulation of the ECSA genotype of CHIKV in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and two amino acids substitutions (K211T and V156A) exclusive to the CHIKV strains obtained during the 2016 epidemic, were reported.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding debate concerns whether functional responses are best described by prey-dependent versus ratio-dependent models. Theory suggests that ratio dependence can explain many food web patterns left unexplained by simple prey-dependent models. However, for logistical reasons, ratio dependence and predator dependence more generally have seen infrequent empirical evaluation and then only so in specialist predators, which are rare in nature. Here we develop an approach to simultaneously estimate the prey-specific attack rates and predator-specific interference rates of predators interacting with arbitrary numbers of prey and predator species. We apply the approach to field surveys and two field experiments involving two intertidal whelks and their full suite of potential prey. Our study provides strong evidence for the presence of weak predator dependence that is closer to being prey dependent than ratio dependent over manipulated and natural ranges of species abundances. It also indicates how, for generalist predators, even the qualitative nature of predator dependence can be prey-specific.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsCW contributed to method development, KC and IS performed the caging experiment, and MN conceived of the study, carried out the fieldwork and analyses, and wrote the manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Treatment strategies that anticipate and respond to the evolution of pathogens are promising tools for combating the global rise of antibiotic resistance1-3. Mutations conferring resistance to one drug can confer positive or negative cross-resistance to other drugs4. The sequential use of drugs exhibiting negative cross-resistance has been proposed to prevent or slow down the evolution of resistance5-8, although factors affecting its efficacy have not been investigated. Here we show that population diversity can disrupt the efficacy of negative cross-resistance-based therapies. By testing 3317 resistant Staphylococcus aureus mutants against multiple antibiotics, we show that first-step mutants exhibit diverse cross-resistance profiles: even when the majority of mutants show negative cross-resistance, rare positive cross-resistant mutants can appear. Using a drug pair showing reciprocal negative cross-resistance, we found that selection for resistance to the first drug in small populations can decrease resistance to the second drug, but identical selection conditions in large populations can increases resistance to the second drug through the appearance of rare positive cross-resistant mutants. We further find that, even with small populations and strong bottlenecks, resistance to both drugs can increase through sequential steps of negative cross-resistance cycling. Thus, low diversity is necessary but not sufficient for effective cycling therapies. While evolutionary interventions are promising tools for controlling antibiotic resistance, they can be sensitive to population diversity and the accessibility of evolutionary paths, and so must be carefully designed to avoid harmful outcomes.",

We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell data sets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference.

In this study, we used miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of 24 cancer types and 3 healthy tissues, collected from >8500 samples. We seek to classify the cancers origin and tissue identification using the expression from 1046 reported miRNAs. Despite an apparent uniform appearance of miRNAs among cancerous samples, we recover indispensable information from lowly expressed miRNAs regarding the cancer/tissue types. Multiclass support vector machine classification yields an average recall of 58% in identifying the correct tissue and tumor types. Data discretization has led to substantial improvement reaching an average recall of 91% (95% median). We propose a straightforward protocol as a crucial step in classifying tumors of unknown primary origin. Our counter-intuitive conclusion is that in almost all cancer types, highly expressing miRNAs mask the significant signal that lower expressed miRNAs provide.",

While high-throughput methods have made transcriptomics and proteomics datasets widely accessible and relatively economical to generate, systematic measurements of both mRNA and protein abundances under a wide range of different conditions are still relatively rare. Here we present a detailed, genome-wide transcriptomics and proteomics dataset of E. coli grown under 34 different conditions. We manipulate concentrations of sodium and magnesium in the growth media, and we consider four different carbon sources glucose, gluconate, lactate, and glycerol. Moreover, samples are taken both in exponential and stationary phase, and we include two extensive time-courses, with multiple samples taken between 3 hours and 2 weeks. We find that exponential-phase samples systematically differ from stationary-phase samples, in particular at the level of mRNA. Regulatory responses to different carbon sources or salt stresses are more moderate, but we find numerous differentially expressed genes for growth on gluconate and under salt and magnesium stress.

    "abstract": "Serious and debilitating symptoms of anxiety are the most common mental health problem worldwide, accounting for around 5% of all adult  years lived with disability in the developed world. Avoidance behaviour -avoiding social situations for fear of embarrassment, for instance-is a core feature of such anxiety. However, as for many other psychiatric symptoms, the biological mechanisms underlying avoidance remain unclear. Reinforcement-learning models provide formal and testable characterizations of the mechanisms of decision-making; here, we examine avoidance in these terms. One hundred and one healthy and pathologically anxious individuals completed an approach-avoidance go/no-go task under stress induced by threat of unpredictable shock. We show an increased reliance in the anxious group on a parameter of our reinforcement-learning model that characterizes a prepotent (Pavlovian) bias to withhold responding in the face of negative outcomes. This was particularly the case when the anxious individuals were under stress. This formal description of avoidance within the reinforcement-learning framework provides a new means of linking clinical symptoms with biophysically plausible models of neural circuitry and, as such, takes us closer to a mechanistic understanding of pathological anxiety.",

Migration of protein that does not correlate with formula MW, termed \\\"gel shifting\\\" appears to be common for histidine-rich proteins but not yet studied in detail. We investigated \\\"gel shifting\\\" in Ni2+-binding histidine-rich Hpn protein cloned from Helicobacter pylori strain SS1. Our data demonstrate two important factors determining \\\"gel shifting\\\" of Hpn, polyacrylamide-gel concentration and metal binding. Higher polyacrylamide-gel concentrations resulted in faster Hpn migration. Irrespective of polyacrylamide-gel concentration, preserved Hpn-Ni2+ complex migrated faster (3-4 kDa) than apo-Hpn, phenomenon termed \\\"metal gel-shift\\\" demonstrating an intimate link between Ni2+ binding and \\\"gel shifting\\\". To examine this discrepancy, eluted samples from corresponding spots on SDS-gel were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The MW of all samples was the same (6945.66{+/-}0.34 Da) and identical to formula MW with or without added mass of Ni2+. MALDI-TOF-MS of Ni2+-treated Hpn revealed that monomer bound up to six Ni2+ ions non-cooperatively, and equilibrium between protein-metal species was reliant on Ni2+ availability. This corroborates with gradually increased heterogeneity of apo-Hpn band followed by compact \\\"metal-gel shift\\\" band on SDS-PAGE.
