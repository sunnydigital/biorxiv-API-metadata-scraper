    "abstract": "Cell size is specific to each species and impacts their ability to function. While various phenomenological models for cell size regulation have been proposed, recent work in bacteria have demonstrated an adder model, in which a cell increments its size by a constant amount between each division. However, the coupling between cell size, shape and constriction, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate size control and the cell cycle dependence of bacterial growth, using multigenerational cell growth and shape data for single Caulobacter crescentus cells. Our analysis reveals a biphasic mode of growth: a relative timer phase before constriction where cell growth is correlated to its initial size, followed by a pure adder phase during constriction. Cell wall labeling measurements reinforce this biphasic model: a crossover from uniform lateral growth to localized septal growth is observed. We present a mathematical model that quantitatively explains this biphasic mixer model for cell size control.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have allowed for greater investigation into microbial regulation of mercury toxicity in the environment. In wetlands in particular, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence methylmercury (MeHg) production both through chemical interactions and through substrate effects on microbiomes. We conducted microcosm experiments in two disparate wetland environments (oligotrophic unvegetated and high-C vegetated sediments) to examine the impacts of plant leachate and inorganic mercury loadings (20 mg/L HgCl2) on microbiomes, DOM cycling, and MeHg production in the St. Louis River Estuary. Our research reveals the greater relative capacity for mercury methylation in vegetated over unvegetated sediments. Further, our work shows how mercury cycling in oligotrophic unvegetated sediments may be susceptible to DOM inputs in the St. Louis River Estuary: microcosms receiving leachate produced substantially more MeHg than unamended microcosms. We also demonstrate (1) changes in microbiome structure towards Clostridia, (2) metagenomic shifts toward fermentation, and (3) degradation of complex DOM; all of which coincide with elevated net MeHg production in unvegetated microcosms receiving leachate. Finally, we examine microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as known potential methylators and identify important organisms for future research in the Great Lakes region. Together, our work shows the influence of wetland vegetation in controlling MeHg production in the Great Lakes region and provides evidence that this may be due to both enhanced microbial activity as well as differences in microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Much ecological and evolutionary theory predicts that interspecific interactions often drive phenotypic diversification and that species phenotypes in turn influence species interactions. Several phylogenetic comparative methods have been developed to assess the importance of such processes in nature; however, the statistical properties of these methods have gone largely untested. Focusing mainly on scenarios of competition between closely-related species, we assess the performance of available comparative approaches for analyzing the interplay between interspecific interactions and species phenotypes. We find that currently used statistical methods largely fail to detect the impact of interspecific interactions on trait evolution, that sister taxa analyses often erroneously detect character displacement where it does not exist, and that recently developed process-based models have more satisfactory statistical properties. In weighing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, we hope to provide a clear guide for empiricists testing hypotheses about the reciprocal effect of interspecific interactions and species phenotypes and to inspire further development of process-based models.",

In order to determine whether recurrence occurred due to relapse of the original infecting isolate or reinfection with a different isolate weeks or months after initial treatment, we used whole-genome sequencing to assess the genetic basis of infection in 17 HIV-infected individuals with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. Comparisons revealed a clonal relationship for 15 pairs of isolates recovered before and after recurrence showing relapse of the original infection. The two remaining pairs showed high levels of genetic heterogeneity; in one pair we found this to be a result of infection by mixed genotypes, whilst the second was a result of nonsense mutations in the gene encoding the DNA mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MSH5 and RAD5. These nonsense mutations led to a hypermutator state, leading to dramatically elevated rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Hypermutator phenotypes owing to nonsense mutations in these genes have not previously been reported in Cryptococcus neoformans and represent a novel pathway for rapid within-host adaptation and evolution of resistance to firstline antifungal drugs.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementThe conserved protein kinase CK2 negatively regulates centrosome assembly and is required for proper cell cycle progression and cytokinesis in early C. elegans embryos.\\n\\nAbstractCentrosomes are the primary microtubule-organizing centers that orchestrate microtubule dynamics during the cell cycle. The correct number of centrosomes is pivotal for establishing bipolar mitotic spindles that ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes. Thus, centrioles must duplicate once per cell cycle, one daughter per mother centriole, the process of which requires highly coordinated actions among core factors and modulators. Protein phosphorylation is shown to regulate the stability, localization and activity of centrosome proteins. Here, we report the function of Casein Kinase II (CK2) in early C. elegans embryos. The catalytic subunit (KIN-3/CK2) of CK2 localizes to nuclei, centrosomes and midbodies. Inactivating CK2 leads to cell division defects, including chromosome missegregation, cytokinesis failure and aberrant centrosome behavior. Furthermore, depletion or inhibiting kinase activity of CK2 results in elevated ZYG-1 levels at centrosomes, restoring centrosome duplication and embryonic viability to zyg-1 mutants. Our data suggest that CK2 functions in cell division and negatively regulates centrosome duplication in a kinase-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "In diverse eukaryotes, certain introns increase mRNA accumulation through the poorly understood mechanism of intron-mediated enhancement (IME). A distinguishing feature of IME is that these introns have no effect from upstream or more than 1 Kb downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). To more precisely define the intron position requirements for IME in Arabidopsis, we tested the effect of the UBQ10 intron on gene expression from 6 different positions surrounding the TSS of a TRP1:GUS fusion. The intron strongly increased expression from all transcribed positions, but had no effect when 204 nt or more upstream of the 5-most TSS. When the intron was located in the 5 UTR, the TSS unexpectedly changed, resulting in longer transcripts. Remarkably, deleting 303 nt of the core promoter, including all known TSSs and all but 18 nt of the 5 UTR, had virtually no effect on the level of gene expression as long as a stimulating intron was included in the gene. When the core promoter was deleted, transcription initiated in normally untranscribed sequences the same distance upstream of the intron as when the promoter was intact. Together, these results suggest that certain introns play unexpectedly large roles in directing transcription initiation and represent a previously unrecognized type of downstream regulatory elements for genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. This study also demonstrates considerable flexibility in the sequences surrounding the TSS, indicating that the TSS is not determined by promoter sequences alone. These findings are relevant in practical applications where introns are used to increase gene expression and contribute to our general understanding of gene structure and regulation in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "How species arise is a fundamental question in biology. Species can be defined as populations of interbreeding individuals that are reproductively isolated from other such populations. Therefore, understanding how reproductive barriers evolve between populations is essential for understanding the process of speciation. Hybrid incompatibility (e.g. hybrid sterility and lethality) is a common and strong reproductive barrier in nature, but few studies have molecularly identified its genetic basis. Here we report a lethal incompatibility between two wild-isolates of the nematode Caenorhabditis nouraguensis. Hybrid inviability results from the incompatibility between a maternally inherited cytoplasmic factor from each strain and a recessive nuclear locus from the other. We have excluded the possibility that maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria cause the incompatibility by treating both strains with tetracycline and show that hybrid death is unaffected. Furthermore, cytoplasmic-nuclear incompatibility commonly occurs between other wild-isolates, indicating that this is a significant reproductive barrier within C. nouraguensis. We hypothesize that the maternally inherited cytoplasmic factor is the mitochondrial genome and that mitochondrial dysfunction underlies hybrid death. This system has the potential to shed light on the dynamics of divergent mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution and its role in promoting speciation.",

    "abstract": "Many morphological features, in both physical and biological systems, exhibit spatial patterns that are specifically characterized by a tendency to occur with even spacing (in one, two or three dimensions). The positions of crossover (CO) recombination events along meiotic chromosomes provides an interesting biological example of such an effect (1-3). In general, mechanisms that explain such patterns may (a) be mechanically-based, (b) occur by a reaction-diffusion mechanism in which macroscopic mechanical effects are irrelevant, or (c) involve a combination of both types of effects. We have proposed that meiotic CO patterns arise by a mechanical mechanism, have developed mathematical expressions for such a process based on a particular physical system with analogous properties (the so-called \\\"beam-film model\\\"), and have shown that the beam-film model can very accurately explain experimental CO patterns as a function of the values of specific defined parameters (4-7). Importantly, the mathematical expressions of the beam-film model can apply quite generally to any mechanism, whether it involves mechanical components or not, as long as its logic and component features correspond to those of the beam-film system (3; below). Furthermore, via its various parameters, the beam-film model discretizes the patterning process into specific components. Thus, the model can be used to explore the theoretically predicted effects of various types of changes in the patterning process. Such predictions can expand detailed understanding of the bases for various biological effects (e.g. 2, 5). We present here a new MATLAB program that implements the mathematical expressions of the beam-film model with increased robustness and accessibility as compared to programs presented previously. As in previous versions, the presented program permits both: (i) simulation of predicted CO positions along chromosomes of a test population; and (ii) easy analysis of CO positions, both for experimental data sets and for data sets resulting from simulations. The goal of the current presentation is to make these approaches more readily accessible to a wider audience of researchers. Also, the program is easily modified, and we encourage interested users to make changes to suit their specific needs.

However, little is known about if and how these improvements are maintained in dynamic environments in which the quality of appropriate priors changes from one stimulus to the next. Using a novel sound-localization task, we show that changes in stimulus predictability lead to arousal-mediated adjustments in the magnitude of prior-driven biases that optimize perceptual judgments about each stimulus. These adjustments depend on task-dependent changes in the relevance and reliability of prior expectations, which subjects update using both normative and idiosyncratic principles. The resulting variations in biases across task conditions and individuals are reflected in modulations of pupil diameter, such that larger stimulus-evoked pupil responses correspond to smaller biases. These results suggest a critical role for the arousal system in adjusting the strength of perceptual biases with respect to inferred environmental dynamics to optimize perceptual judgements.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInterannual variability in precipitation, particularly drought, can affect lignocellulosic crop biomass yields and composition, and is expected to increase biofuel yield variability. However, the effect of precipitation on downstream fermentation processes has never been directly characterized. In order to investigate the impact of interannual climate variability on biofuel production, corn stover and switchgrass were collected during three years with significantly different precipitation profiles, representing a major drought year (2012) and two years with average precipitation for the entire season (2010 and 2013). All feedstocks were AFEX (ammonia fiber expansion)-pretreated, enzymatically hydrolyzed, and the hydrolysates separately fermented using xylose-utilizing strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis. A chemical genomics approach was also used to evaluate the growth of yeast mutants in the hydrolysates.\\n\\nResultsWhile most corn stover and switchgrass hydrolysates were readily fermented, growth of S. cerevisiae was completely inhibited in hydrolysate generated from drought stressed switchgrass. Based on chemical genomics analysis, yeast strains deficient in genes related to protein trafficking within the cell were significantly more resistant to the drought year switchgrass hydrolysate. Detailed biomass and hydrolysate characterization revealed that switchgrass accumulated greater concentrations of soluble sugars in response to the drought and these sugars were subsequently degraded to pyrazines and imidazoles during ammonia-based pretreatment. When added ex situ to normal switchgrass hydrolysate, imidazoles and pyrazines caused anaerobic growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae.\\n\\nConclusionsIn response to the osmotic pressures experienced during drought stress, plants accumulate soluble sugars that are susceptible to degradation during chemical pretreatments. For ammonia-based pretreatment these sugars degrade to imidazoles and pyrazines. These compounds contribute to S. cerevisiae growth inhibition in drought year switchgrass hydrolysate. This work discovered that variation in environmental conditions during the growth of bioenergy crops could have significant detrimental effects on fermentation organisms during biofuel production. These findings are relevant to regions where climate change is predicted to cause an increased incidence of drought and to marginal lands with poor water holding capacity, where fluctuations in soil moisture may trigger frequent drought stress response in lignocellulosic feedstocks.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionChromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is recognized as the first-tier test in the genetic evaluation of children with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, congenital anomalies and autism spectrum disorders of unknown etiology.\\n\\nArray DesignTo optimize detection of clinically relevant copy number variants associated with these conditions, we designed a whole-genome microarray, FirstStepDx PLUS (FSDX). A set of 88,435 custom probes was added to the Affymetrix CytoScanHD platform targeting genomic regions strongly associated with these conditions. This combination of 2,784,985 total probes results in the highest probe coverage and clinical yield for these disorders.\\n\\nResults and DiscussionClinical testing of this patient population is validated on DNA from either non-invasive buccal swabs or traditional blood samples. In this report we provide data demonstrating the analytic and clinical validity of FSDX and provide an overview of results from the first 7,570 consecutive patients tested clinically. We further demonstrate that buccal sampling is an effective method of obtaining DNA samples, which may provide improved results compared to traditional blood sampling for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders who exhibit somatic mosaicism.\\n\\nClinical scenarioNeurodevelopmental disabilities, including developmental delays (DD), intellectual disabilities (ID), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), affect up to 15% of children (1). In the majority of cases, a childs clinical presentation does not allow for a definitive etiological diagnosis. In such cases, CMA is recommended as the first-tier test that should be used to evaluate for a potential genetic etiology (2-7). A definitive genetic diagnosis allows patients to more often receive appropriate medical care tailored to their condition, as reflected by medical management changes and improved access to necessary support and educational services (8-13).\\n\\nTest descriptionFirstStepDx PLUS (FSDX) is an optimized clinical microarray test provided in the context of a comprehensive clinical service. Testing starts with either a non-invasive buccal swab sample or traditional blood sample from which DNA extraction using a Gentra Puregene(R) kit specific to the sample type (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) is performed in one of several contracted CLIA/CAP credentialed laboratories according to manufacturers protocols. High quality genomic DNA is fragmented, labeled and hybridized to FSDX arrays using reagents, equipment and methodology as specified by by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA)(14). Washed arrays are scanned and raw data files are processed to CYCHP files using a reference file comprising at least 100 samples with normal array findings. Data analysis is performed using Chromosome Analysis Suite software version 2.0.1 (Affymetrix). Hybridization of patient DNA to oligonucleotide and SNP probes is independently compared against a previously analyzed cohort of normal samples to call CNVs and allele genotypes. The percentage mosaicism of whole-chromosome aneuploidies is determined using the average log2 ratio of the entire chromosome (14).\\n\\nMicroarray designFSDX was optimized by the addition of 88,435 custom probes targeting genomic regions strongly associated with ID/DD/ASD (15-24). This was effected, under GMP by Affymetrix, to the CytoScanHD platform using their microarray design process specifications which have been previously described (14). This is consistent with the ACMG recommendation of \\\"enrichment of probes targeting dosage-sensitive genes known to result in phenotypes consistent with common indications for a genomic screen\\\" (25). Critical regions that did not meet a desired probe density [&ge;]1 probe/1000 bp on the CytoScanHD were supplemented with additional probe content to allow for improved detection of smaller deletions and duplications in these critical regions. Finally, additional probes were added to improve detection of CNVs encompassing genes involved in other well-characterized neurodevelopmental disorders, for example GAMT (26) and GATM (27). All incremental probes were added in substitution for probes deemed sub-optimal by Affymetrix and previously masked, bringing FSDX to a grand total of 2,784,985 probes. Custom SNP probes (n =416) on FSDX are targeted by 12 oligonucleotides, three for each strand of each allele, which is approximately double the typical probe coverage for SNPs.\\n\\nTest interpretationCYCHP files are evaluated by ABMG certified cytogeneticists. Determination of CNVs is consistent with established cytogenetic standards. A minimum of 25-consecutive impacted probes is the baseline determinant for deletions and 50 probes for duplications independent of variant size. Rare CNVs are determined to be \\\"pathogenic\\\" if there is sufficient evidence published (at least two independent publications) to indicate that haploinsufficiency or triplosensitivity of the region or gene(s) involved is causative of clinical features or of sufficient overall size (28). If however, there is insufficient but at least preliminary evidence for a causative role for the region or gene(s) therein they are classified as variants of unknown significance (VOUS) independent of CNV size. Areas of absence of heterozygosity (AOH) are also classed as VOUS if of sufficient size and location to increase the risk for conditions with autosomal recessive inheritance or conditions with parent-of-origin/imprinting effects. Other CNVs are typically not reported after determination that they most likely represent normal common population variants and are contained in databases documenting presumptively benign CNVs, e.g., the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) (29). These parameters were standard independent of the microarray used for analysis in comparative studies.\\n\\nPublic health importanceA definitive genetic diagnosis facilitates patient access to appropriate and necessary medical and support services. Defining the underlying genetic cause of DD/ID/ASD and/or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) in each unique patient is vital to understanding etiology, prognosis, and course. It informs physicians of potential comorbid conditions for which a patient should be evaluated and treated proactively and optimally. Improved understandings of the appropriate therapeutic and behavioral approaches to that patient are also enabled. Genetic testing is best provided in the context of an integrated service (30), so FSDX provides comprehensive, clear, readable, and personalized reports for the healthcare provider and a family-friendly section to facilitate understanding of the often-complex results. The report is complemented by availability of pre- and post-test genetic counseling and technical support to providers. Moreover, FSDX includes personalized insurance pre-authorization and appeals assistance to overcome barriers encountered by both providers and families that, in many circumstances, prevent access to crucial genetic testing services (10-11).\\n\\nPublished reviews, recommendations and guidelinesThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2,3), the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (4,7), the American Academy of Pediatrics (5), and the American Academy of Neurology/Child Neurology Society (6) recommend CMA as the first-tier test in the genetic evaluation of children with unexplained DD, ID, or ASD. Considerable data supporting these guidelines are documented in numerous reviews and publications (31-36). The ACMG has also published guidelines on both array design (25) and the validation of arrays, including validation of a new version of a platform in use by the laboratory from the same manufacturer, and of additional sample types (28).",

    "abstract": "Increasingly accurate and massive data have recently shed light on the fundamental question of how cells maintain a stable size trajectory as they progress through the cell cycle. Microbes seem to use strategies ranging from a pure sizer, where the end of a given phase is triggered when the cell reaches a critical size, to pure adder, where the cell adds a constant size during a phase. Yet the biological origins of the observed spectrum of behavior remain elusive. We analyze a molecular size-control mechanism, based on experimental data from the yeast S. cerevisiae, that gives rise to behaviors smoothly interpolating between adder and sizer. The size-control is obtained from the titration of a repressor protein by an activator protein that accumulates more rapidly with increasing cell size. Strikingly, the size-control is composed of two different regimes: for small initial cell size, the size-control is a sizer, whereas for larger initial cell size, is is an imperfect adder. Our model thus indicates that the adder and critical size behaviors may just be different dynamical regimes of a single simple biophysical mechanism.",

Because flies exhibit saccadic visual behaviors and their compound eyes have relatively few ommatidia (sampling points), their photoreceptors would be expected to generate blurry and coarse retinal images of the world. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila see the world far better than predicted from the classic theories. By using electrophysiological, optical and behavioral assays, we found that R1-R6 photoreceptors encoding capacity in time is maximized to fast high-contrast bursts, which resemble their light input during saccadic behaviors. Whilst over space, R1-R6s resolve moving objects at saccadic speeds beyond the predicted motion-blur-limit. Our results show how refractory phototransduction and rapid photomechanical photoreceptor contractions jointly sharpen retinal images of moving objects in space-time, enabling hyperacute vision, and explain how such microsaccadic information sampling exceeds the compound eyes optical limits. These discoveries elucidate how acuity depends upon photoreceptor function and eye movements.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDMetafounders are pseudo-individuals that condense the genetic heterozygosity and relationships within and across base pedigree populations, i.e. ancestral populations. This work addresses estimation and usefulness of metafounder relationships in Single Step GBLUP.\\n\\nRESULTSWe show that the ancestral relationship parameters are proportional to standardized covariances of base allelic frequencies across populations, like Fst fixation indexes. These covariances of base allelic frequencies can be estimated from marker genotypes of related recent individuals, and pedigree. Simple methods for estimation include naive computation of allele frequencies from marker genotypes or a method of moments equating average pedigree-based and marker-based relationships. Complex methods include generalized least squares or maximum likelihood based on pedigree relationships. To our knowledge, methods to infer Fst coefficients and Fst differentiation have not been developed for related populations.\\n\\nA compatible genomic relationship matrix constructed as a crossproduct of {-1,0,1} codes, and equivalent (up to scale factors) to an identity by state relationship matrix at the markers, is derived. Using a simulation with a single population under selection, in which only males and youngest animals were genotyped, we observed that generalized least squares or maximum likelihood gave accurate and unbiased estimates of the ancestral relationship parameter (true value: 0.40) whereas the other two (naive and method of moments) were biased (estimates of 0.43 and 0.35). We also observed that genomic evaluation by Single Step GBLUP using metafounders was less biased in terms of accurate genetic trend (0.01 instead of 0.12 bias), slightly overdispersed (0.94 instead of 0.99) and as accurate (0.74) than the regular Single Step GBLUP. Single Step GBLUP using metafounders also provided consistent estimates of heritability.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSEstimation of metafounder relationship can be achieved using BLUP-like methods with pedigree and markers. Inclusion of metafounder relationships improves bias of genomic predictions with no loss in accuracy.",

Here we analyse whole genome sequence data from worldwide human populations, including 765 new genomes from across sub-Saharan Africa, and identify a diverse array of large copy number variants affecting the host invasion receptor genes GYPA and GYPB. We find that a nearby reported association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural variant that involves the loss of GYPB and gain of two hybrid genes, each with a GYPB extracellular domain and GYPA intracellular domain. This variant reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently risen in frequency in parts of Kenya. We show that the structural variant encodes the Dantu blood group antigen, and therefore a serologically distinct red cell phenotype.

Although these dynamics occur across multiple areas and behavioral conditions, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we analyze spontaneous population activity from the somatosensory cortex of urethane-anesthetized rats. We find that UP and DOWN periods are variable (i.e. non-rhythmic) and that the population rate shows no significant decay during UP periods. We build a network model of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that exhibits a new bistability between a quiescent state and a balanced state of arbitrarily low rate. Fluctuating inputs trigger state transitions. Adaptation in E cells paradoxically causes a marginal decay of E-rate but a marked decay of I-rate, a signature of balanced bistability that we validate experimentally. Our findings provide evidence of a bistable balanced network that exhibits non-rhythmic state transitions when the brain rests.",

However, the mechanical linkage of microtubule tips to their cargoes is poorly understood. CENP-F is a non-motor microtubule-binding protein that participates in microtubule binding at kinetochores and in the mitotic redistribution of the mitochondrial network. CENP-F-driven mitochondrial transport is linked to growing microtubule tips, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that CENP-F tracks growing microtubule ends in living cells. In vitro reconstitution demonstrates that microtubule tips can transport mitochondria and CENP-F-coated artificial cargoes over micrometer-long distances, during both growing and shrinking phases. Based on these and previous observations, we suggest that CENP-F might act as a transporter of mitochondria and other cellular cargoes by attaching them to dynamic microtubule ends.",

    "abstract": "The last known Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus) - aka the thylacine - died in 1936. Because its natural behavior was never documented, we are left to infer aspects of its behavior from museum specimens and unreliable historical recollections. Recent advances in brain imaging have made it possible to scan postmortem specimens of a wide range of animals, even more than a decade old. Any thylacine brain, however, would be more than 100 years old. Here, we show that it is possible to reconstruct white matter tracts in two thylacine brains. For functional interpretation, we compare to the white matter reconstructions of the brains of two Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii). We reconstructed the cortical projection zones of the basal ganglia and major thalamic nuclei. The basal ganglia reconstruction showed a more modularized pattern in the cortex of the thylacine, while the devil cortex was dominated by the putamen. Similarly, the thalamic projections had a more orderly topography in the thylacine than the devil. These results are consistent with theories of brain evolution suggesting that larger brains are more modularized. Functionally, the thylacines brain may have had relatively more cortex devoted to planning and decision-making, which would be consistent with a predatory ecological niche versus the scavenging niche of the devil.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe Tasmanian tiger - aka the thylacine - was a carnivorous marsupial and apex predator in Tasmania until the last one died in 1936. Very little is known about its natural behavior. Only four intact brain specimens are known to have survived. We used diffusion-weighted MRI to reconstruct the white matter pathways in two of these specimens, and for comparison, the brains of two Tasmanian devils. By comparing the maps of these projections in the cortex, we show that the thylacines brain is consistent with a more complex predatory strategy than the scavenging strategy of the Tasmanian devil.",

With the rapid development of revolutionized chromosome conformation capture technology and its genome-wide derivatives such as Hi-C, investigation of the genome folding becomes more efficient and convenient. How to robustly deal with these massive datasets and infer accurate 3D model and within-nucleus compartmentalization of chromosomes becomes a new challenge.\\n\\nResultThe implemented pipeline HBP (Hi-C BED file analysis Pipeline) integrates existing pipelines focusing on individual steps of Hi-C data processing into an all-in-one package with adjustable parameters to infer the consensus 3D structure of genome from raw Hi-C sequencing data. Whats more, HBP could assign statistical confidence estimation for chromatin interactions, and clustering interaction loci according to enrichment tracks or topological structure automatically.\\n\\nConclusionThe freely available HBP is an optimized and flexible pipeline for analyzing the folding of whole chromosome and interactions between some specific sites from the Hi-C raw sequencing reads to the partially processed datasets. The other complex genetic and epigenetic datasets from public sources such as GWAS, ENCODE consortiums etc. will also easily be integrated into HBP, hence the final output results of HBP could provide a comprehensive in-depth understanding for the specific chromatin interactions, potential molecular mechanisms and biological significance. We believe that HBP is a reliable tool for the rapidly analysis of Hi-C data and will be very useful for a wide range of researchers, particularly those who lack of background in computational biology.

    "abstract": "Lower pH is a well-replicated finding in the postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Interpretation of the data, however, is controversial as to whether this finding reflects a primary feature of the diseases or is a result of confounding factors such as medication, postmortem interval, and agonal state. To date, systematic investigation of brain pH has not been undertaken using animal models, which can be studied without confounds inherent in human studies. In the present study, we first confirmed that the brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder exhibit lower pH values by conducting a meta-analysis of existing datasets. We then utilized neurodevelopmental mouse models of psychiatric disorders in order to test the hypothesis that lower brain pH exists in these brains compared to controls due to the underlying pathophysiology of the disorders. We measured pH, lactate levels, and related metabolite levels in brain homogenates from three mouse models of schizophrenia (Schnurri-2 KO, forebrain-specific calcineurin KO, and neurogranin KO mice) and one of bipolar disorder (Camk2a HKO mice), and one of autism spectrum disorders (Chd8 HKO mice). All mice were drug-naive with the same postmortem interval and agonal state at death. Upon postmortem examination, we observed significantly lower pH and higher lactate levels in the brains of model mice relative to controls. There was a significant negative correlation between pH and lactate levels. These results suggest that lower pH associated with increased lactate levels is a pathophysiology of such diseases rather than mere artifacts.",

    "abstract": "The extension of the sectional model of the spruce crowns dynamics into diapason (0, 1) of the fractal parameter  has demonstrated the existence of green biomass on branches of three orders in form of photosynthesizing (green) points. We investigated the growth of point sets on an interval as a model of the origin of proto-plants, which are formed due to endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria and protists. The fractal properties of the sets of evenly placed points and group sets were studied using the box-counting method. For the group sets, the character of dependence  on the growing total number of points changes radically differently depending on whether the number of the points per group or the number of groups was fixed. As the host does not have the initial infrastructure needed for an increase in cyanobacteria per group, the first path is implemented and  decreases from 1 to 0.25 when groups consist of two points per group. If and when the host develops necessary anatomical features (infrastructure), the second pathway is realized and  grows to 1. The combined trajectory of  initially demonstrates a slow growth of the size of the photosynthetic system and then an exponential growth after the development of the hosts infrastructure. Similar fractal peculiarity also characterizes trees and is an innate property of plants. Assumptions on the morphological recapitulation of proto-plant in higher plants ontogenesis (embryogenesis and seed germination) and also a possibility to fix the number of cyanobacteria per group are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Plant specialized metabolites are chemically highly diverse, play key roles in host-microbe interactions, have important nutritional value in crops and are frequently applied as medicines. It has recently become clear that plant biosynthetic pathway-encoding genes are sometimes densely clustered in specific genomic loci: biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Here, we introduce plantiSMASH, a versatile online analysis platform that automates the identification of candidate plant BGCs. Moreover, it allows integration of transcriptomic data to prioritize candidate BGCs based on the coexpression patterns of predicted biosynthetic enzyme-coding genes, and facilitates comparative genomic analysis to study the evolutionary conservation of each cluster. Applied on 48 high-quality plant genomes, plantiSMASH identifies a rich diversity of candidate plant BGCs. These results will guide further experimental exploration of the nature and dynamics of gene clustering in plant metabolism. Moreover, spurred by the continuing decrease in costs of plant genome sequencing, they will allow genome mining technologies to be applied to plant natural product discovery.\\n\\nThe plantiSMASH web server, precalculated results and source code are freely available from http://plantismash.secondarymetabolites.org.",

    "abstract": "The visual neurosciences have made enormous progress in recent decades, in part because of the ability to drive visual areas by their sensory inputs, allowing researchers to reliably define visual areas across individuals and across species. Similar strategies for parceling higher-order cortex have proven elusive. Here, using a novel experimental task and nonlinear population receptive field modeling we map and characterize the topographic organization of several regions in human frontoparietal cortex. We discover maps of both polar angle and eccentricity that are organized into clusters, similar to visual cortex, where multiple maps of polar angle of the contralateral visual field share a confluent fovea. This is striking because neural activity in frontoparietal cortex is believed to reflect higher-order cognitive functions rather than external sensory processing. Perhaps the spatial topography in frontoparietal cortex parallels the retinotopic organization of sensory cortex to enable an efficient interface between perception and higher-order cognitive processes. Critically, these visual maps constitute well-defined anatomical units that future study of frontoparietal cortex can reliably target.",

    "abstract": "Plant species differ in many functional traits that drive differences in rates of photosynthesis, biomass allocation, and tissue turnover. Yet, it remains unclear how - and even if - such traits influence whole-plant growth, with the simple linear relationships predicted by existing theory often lacking empirical support. Here we present a new theoretical framework for understanding the effect of diverse functional traits on plant growth and shade-tolerance, extending a widely-used theoretical model that links growth rate in seedlings with a single leaf trait to explicitly include influences of size, light environment, and five other prominent traits: seed mass, height at maturation, leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area, and wood density. Based on biomass production and allocation, this framework explains why the influence of prominent traits on growth rate and shade tolerance often varies with plant size and why the impact of size on growth varies among traits. Considering growth rate in height, we find the influence of: i) leaf mass per unit leaf area is strong in small plants but weakens with size, ii) leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area does not change with size, iii) wood density is present across sizes but is strongest at intermediate sizes, iv) height at maturation strengthens with size, and v) seed mass decreases with size. Moreover, we show how traits moderate plant responses to light environment and also determine shade tolerance, supporting diverse empirical results. By disentangling the effects of plant size, light environment and traits on growth rates, our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for trait ecology and thus provide a platform for understanding growth across diverse species around the world.",

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is designated as the sole legal producer of Cannabis for use in US research studies. We sought to compare the chemical profiles of Cannabis varieties that are available to consumers in states that have state-legalized use versus what is available to researchers interested in studying the plant and its effects. Our results demonstrate that the federally produced Cannabis has significantly less variety and lower concentrations of cannabinoids. Current research, which has focused on material that is far less diverse and less potent than that used by the public, limits our understanding of the plants chemical, biological, psychological, medical, and pharmacological properties. Investigation is urgently needed on the diverse forms of Cannabis used by the public in state-legal markets.",

    "abstract": "Genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yet to be fully elucidated. Somatic mosaic mutations (SMMs) have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and overgrowth syndromes. Here, we systematically evaluate SMMs by leveraging whole-exome sequencing (WES) data on a large family-based ASD cohort, the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). We find evidence that ~10% of previously published de novo mutations are potentially SMMs. When using a custom somatic calling pipeline, we recalled all SSC WES data. We validated high and low confidence mutation predictions for a subset of families with single molecule molecular inversion probes. With these validation data, we iteratively developed a high confidence calling approach integrating logistic regression modeling and additional heuristics and applied it to the full cohort. Surprisingly, we found evidence of significant synonymous SMM burden in probands, with mutations more likely to be close to splicing sites. Overall, we observe no strong evidence of missense SMM burden. However, we do observe nominally significant signal for missense SMMs in those families without germline mutations, which strengthens specifically in genes intolerant to mutations. In contrast to missense germline mutations, missense SMMs show potential enrichment for chromatin modifiers. We observe 7-10% of parental mosaics are transmitted germline to a child as occult de novo mutations, which has important implications for recurrence risk for families and potential subclinical ASD features. Finally, we find SMMs in previously implicated high-confidence ASD risk genes, including CHD2, CTNNB1, KMT2C, SYNGAP1, and RELN, further suggesting that this class of mutations contribute to population risk.",

    "abstract": "The resolution of super-resolution microscopy based on single molecule localization is in part determined by the accuracy of the localization algorithm. In most published approaches to date this localization is done by fitting an analytical function that approximates the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope. However, particularly for localization in 3D, analytical functions such as a Gaussian, which are computationally inexpensive, may not accurately capture the PSF shape leading to reduced fitting accuracy. On the other hand, analytical functions that can accurately capture the PSF shape, such as those based on pupil functions, can be computationally expensive. Here we investigate the use of cubic splines as an alternative fitting approach. We demonstrate that cubic splines can capture the shape of any PSF with high accuracy and that they can be used for fitting the PSF with only a 2-3x increase in computation time as compared to Gaussian fitting. We provide an open-source software package that measures the PSF of any microscope and uses the measured PSF to perform 3D single molecule localization microscopy analysis with reasonable accuracy and speed.",
