    "abstract": "BackgroundReconstructing phylogenies through Bayesian methods has many benefits, which include providing a mathematically sound framework, providing realistic estimates of uncertainty and being able to incorporate different sources of information based on formal principles. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are popular for interpreting nucleotide sequence data, however for such studies one needs to specify a site model and associated substitution model. Often, the parameters of the site model is of no interest and an ad-hoc or additional likelihood based analysis is used to select a single site model.\\n\\nResultsbModelTest allows for a Bayesian approach to inferring and marginalizing site models in a phylogenetic analysis. It is based on trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that allow switching between substitution models as well as estimating the posterior probability for gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity a proportion of invariable sites and unequal base frequencies. The model can be used with the full set of time-reversible models on nucleotides, but we also introduce and demonstrate the use of two subsets of time-reversible substitution models.\\n\\nConclusionWith the new method the site model can be inferred (and marginalized) during the MCMC analysis and does not need to be pre-determined, as is now often the case in practice, by likelihood-based methods. The method is implemented in the bModelTest package of the popular BEAST 2 software, which is open source, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and allows joint site model and tree inference under a wide range of models.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies commonly associate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex with conscious perception. However, such studies only investigate correlation, rather than causation. In addition, many studies conflate objective performance with subjective awareness. In an influential recent paper, Rounis and colleagues addressed these issues by showing that theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (tbs-TMS) applied to the DLPFC impaired metacognitive (subjective) awareness for a perceptual task, while objective performance was kept constant. We attempted to replicate this finding, with minor modifications, including an active tbs-TMS control site. Using a between-subjects design for both DLPFC and posterior parietal cortices, we found no evidence of a tbs-TMS-induced metacognitive impairment. In a second experiment, we devised a highly rigorous within-subjects tbs-TMS design for DLPFC, but again failed to find any evidence of metacognitive impairment. One crucial difference between our results and the Rounis study is our strict exclusion of data deemed unsuitable for a signal detection theory analysis. Indeed, when we included this unstable data, a significant, though invalid, metacognitive impairment was found. These results cast doubt on previous findings relating metacognitive awareness to DLPFC, and inform the current debate concerning whether or not prefrontal regions are preferentially implicated in conscious perception.",

Here we describe networks of capacitating genetic interactions that contribute to quantitative trait variation in a large yeast intercross population.

    "abstract": "Giardia lamblia is the most prevalent protistan parasite, causing acute and chronic diarrheal disease in over one billion people worldwide. Vertebrate hosts ingest Giardia cysts from contaminated sources, and these cysts excyst in the gut to become motile trophozoites. Trophozoites colonize the small intestine by attaching to the intestinal villi and later differentiate into infectious cysts that are released into the environment, completing Giardias life cycle. Due to the limited accessibility of the gastrointestinal tract, our understanding of in in vivo temporal and spatial dynamics of giardiasis is largely inferred from parasite physiology in laboratory culture. Yet parasite growth under in vitro culture conditions may not mirror in vivo parasite physiology in the host. Here we develop bioluminescent imaging (BLI) methods to directly interrogate the temporal and spatial dynamics of giardiasis in mice, providing an improved animal model for the evaluation of anti-Giardia drugs. This non-invasive method of imaging giardiasis allows unprecedented and precise quantification of in vivo temporal and spatial patterns of infection. By infecting mice with parasites expressing constitutive or encystation-specific luciferase bioreporters, we show that parasite colonization of the gut is not uniform. Metabolically active parasites primarily colonize the proximal small intestine in \\\"hot spots\\\"--high density foci of infection that likely result in localized pathology to the gut epithelium. Using in vivo and ex vivo BLI of encystation-specific bioreporters, we show that encystation initiates shortly after inoculation and parasites encyst throughout the entire duration of infection. We also find that encystation is initiated in high density foci in the proximal small intestine, rather than the colon as has been previously assumed, and show that the initiation of encystation is magnified in parasites incubated at high density in laboratory culture. Prior models have suggested that chemical cues cause parasites to encyst as they are dislodged from the upper gut and travel to more distal regions of the gastrointestinal tract. We suggest a model of encystation in which parasites reach a threshold density that results the induction of encystation due to local nutrient depletion. The in vivo imaging of giardiasis has redefined the dynamics of the Giardia life cycle in the host, paving the way for future mechanistic studies of density-dependent processes in this highly prevalent, yet understudied parasite.",

However, it is unknown how strongly the neural patterns elicited by imagining specific episodes resemble the neural states elicited during the original encoding of those episodes. In the current study, using fMRI and a natural communication task, we traced how neural patterns associated with specific scenes depicted in a movie are encoded, verbally recalled, and then transferred to a group of naive listeners who construct the scenes of the movie in their imagination. By comparing neural patterns across the three conditions, we report, for the first time, that event-specific neural patterns are observed in the default mode network (DMN) and shared across the encoding, reinstatement (spoken recall), and new construction (imagination) of the same real-life episode. This study uncovers the intimate correspondences between memory encoding and imagination, and highlights the essential role that our common language plays in the process of transmitting ones experiences to other brains.",

Previous 4 studies have examined the phylogeny and function of these changes, but until now a 5 fundamental examination of the extant hydrocarbon metabolisms that supported these 6 changes had not been performed. Here, we reconstructed the genomes of 57 widespread 7 uncultivated bacteria from post spill sediments, and recovered their gene expression 8 pattern across the seafloor. These genomes comprised a common collection of bacteria 9 that were highly enriched in heavily affected sediments around the wellhead. While rare in distal sediments, some members were still detectable at sites up to 60 km away. Many of these genomes exhibited phylogenetic clustering indicative of common trait selection by the environment, and within half we identified 264 genes associated with hydrocarbon degradation. Observed alkane degradation ability was near ubiquitous among candidate hydrocarbon degraders, while just 3 harbored elaborate gene inventories for the degradation of alkanes and (poly)aromatic hydrocarbons. Differential gene expression profiles revealed a spill-promoted microbial sulfur cycle alongside gene up-regulation associated with polyaromatic hydrocarbon degradation. Gene expression associated with alkane degradation was widespread, although active alkane degrader identities changed along the pollution gradient. The resulting analysis suggests a broad metabolic capacity to respond to oil exists across a large array of usually rare bacteria.",

    "abstract": "That biodiversity declines with latitude is well known, but whether a metacommunity process is behind this gradient has received limited attention. We tested the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is progressively replaced by mass effects with increasing latitude, along with a series of related hypotheses. We explored these hypotheses by examining metacommunity structure in stream invertebrate metacommunities spanning the length of New Zealands two largest islands (~1300 km), further disentangling the role of dispersal by deconstructing assemblages into strong and weak dispersers. Given the highly dynamic nature of New Zealand streams, our alternative hypothesis was that these systems are so unpredictable (at different stages of post-flood succession) that metacommunity structure is highly context dependent from region to region. We rejected our primary hypotheses, pinning this lack of fit on the strong unpredictability of New Zealands dynamic stream ecosystems and fauna that has evolved to cope with these conditions. While local community structure turned over along this latitudinal gradient, metacommunity structure was highly context dependent and dispersal traits did not elucidate patterns. Moreover, the emergent metacommunity types exhibited no trends, nor did the important environmental variables. These results provide a cautionary tale for examining singular metacommunities. The considerable level of unexplained contingency suggests that any inferences drawn from one-off snapshot sampling may be misleading and further points to the need for more studies on temporal dynamics of metacommunity processes.",

However, most clinical microbiology techniques used to detect gut bacteria were developed over a century ago and rely on culture-based approaches that are often laborious, unreliable, and subjective. Further, culturing does not scale well for multiple targets and detects only a minority of the microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract. Here we present a clinical test for gut microorganisms based on targeted sequencing of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene. We tested 46 clinical prokaryotic targets in the human gut, 28 of which can be identified by a bioinformatics pipeline that includes sequence analysis and taxonomic annotation. Using microbiome samples from a cohort of 897 healthy individuals, we established a reference range defining clinically relevant relative levels for each of the 28 targets. Our assay accurately quantified all 28 targets and correctly reflected 38/38 verification samples of real and synthetic stool material containing known pathogens. Thus, we have established a new test to interrogate microbiome composition and diversity, which will improve patient diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. More broadly, our test will facilitate epidemiological studies of the microbiome as it relates to overall human health and disease.",

Here we utilize a firing rate model and a computational model to elucidate the potential functions of VIP cell depolarization during locomotion. Our analyses suggest 1) that surround suppression sharpens the visual responses in V1 to a stationary scene, 2) that depolarized VIP cells enhance V1 responses to moving objects by reducing self-induced surround suppression and 3) that during locomotion V1 neuron responses to some features of the moving objects can be selectively enhanced. Thus, VIP cells regulate surround suppression to allow pyramidal neurons to optimally encode visual information independent of behavioral state.",

    "abstract": "Settlement and metamorphosis mark a critical transition in the life cycle of marine invertebrates, during which larvae undergo substantial morphological, sensory, and genetic changes. High mortality during or after metamorphosis is commonly observed in both wild and hatchery settings, however, the underlying causes of this mortality remain poorly understood. Previous pair-crossing experiments with the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas showed that substantial genotype-dependent mortality (GDM) occurs around metamorphosis, but, owing to sparse temporal sampling, it remains unknown whether mortality occurs just before, during, or after settlement. In this laboratory study, microsatellite marker segregation ratios were followed daily throughout the settlement and metamorphosis of an inbred, F2 cross of the Pacific oyster to examine the fine-scale patterns of GDM in larvae and spat. Genetic control of settlement timing was also examined using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach. Settlement occurred over nine days (day 18 to day 27 post-fertilization) with 68% of individuals settling on an early (day 19) and a late (day 24) time point. Tracking the survival of spat for 40 days after initial settlement revealed almost no post-settlement mortality. Temporal analysis revealed that three of 11 loci exhibited segregation distortion at metamorphosis, one of which (Cg205) was followed throughout settlement. Alternative temporal patterns of selection against each homozygote at Cg205 suggest possible defects in both the competency pathway (inability to initiate metamorphosis) and the morphogenesis pathway (mortality during the metamorphic transition). QTL mapping of settlement timing identified three individual and one epistatic QTL (29% of the variance explained), however, two of these loci were closely linked to markers exhibiting GDM at metamorphosis, thus making it difficult to distinguish between genetic variance in settlement timing and differential mortality early or late in settlement. Overall, results from this study highlight the complex temporal patterns of viability selection during metamorphosis and show that endogenous mortality during the larval-juvenile transition appears to be focused during or just prior to metamorphosis. Fine-scale experimental analysis of settlement can reveal important genetic insights into larval settlement behavior and the sources of larval mortality, and future studies should be able to further dissect the functional targets of selection during metamorphosis.",

    "abstract": "The progress in experimental techniques aimed at 3D genome study is yet to bring about revelation of basic principles of genome folding. Chromosome conformation capture Hi-C technologies provide genome wide mapping of genomic loci interactions but spatial organization of chromosomes remains unknown. Here, we develop a polymer modeling approach to generate the ensemble of 3D chromosome conformations for mapping genetic loci contacts and the positions of megabase chromosomal domains in interphase chromosome at different time of mitosis-interphase transition. We demonstrate that (*) whole chromosome contact map (interactome) generated for mouse chromosome 18 structure and (**) contact patterns, observed soon after mitotic decondensation and remaining similar during G1, correlate well with the experimental Hi-C contact data. The results suggest that contact map formation and spatial compartmentalization of an interphase chromosome are driven by interactions between different types of domains during formation of globular chromosome state at the end of mitotis-G1 transition.",

    "abstract": "Emerging zoonoses are a prominent global health threat. Human beliefs are central to drivers of emerging zoonoses, yet little is known about the factors that influence perceived risks of animal contact. We present an inductive account of zoonosis risk perception, suggesting that beliefs about the range of animals that are able to transmit diseases to each other influence zoonosis risk perception. Consistent with our account, in Study 1, we find that participants who endorse higher likelihoods of cross-species disease transmission have stronger intention to report animal bites. In Study 2, using real world descriptions of Ebola virus from the WHO and CDC, we find that communications conveying a broader range of animals as susceptible increase intentions to report animal bites and decrease perceived safety of wild game meat. These results suggest that cognitive factors may be harnessed to modulate zoonosis risk perception and combat emerging infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "A small number of free-living viruses have been found to be obligately vertically transmitted, but it remains uncertain how widespread vertically transmitted viruses are and how quickly they can spread through host populations. Recent metagenomic studies have found several insects to be infected with sigma viruses (Rhabdoviridae). Here, we report that sigma viruses that infect Mediterranean fruit flies (Ceratitis capitata), Drosophila immigrans, and speckled wood butterflies (Pararge aegeria) are all vertically transmitted. We find patterns of vertical transmission that are consistent with those seen in Drosophila sigma viruses, with high rates of maternal transmission, and lower rates of paternal transmission. This mode of transmission allows them to spread rapidly in populations, and using viral sequence data we found the viruses in D. immigrans and C. capitata had both recently swept through host populations. The viruses were common in nature, with mean prevalences of 12% in C. capitata, 38% in D. immigrans and 74% in P. aegeria. We conclude that vertically transmitted rhabdoviruses may be widespread in insects, and that these viruses can have dynamic interactions with their hosts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInstrumental variable analysis, for example with physicians prescribing preferences as an instrument for medications issued in primary care, is an increasingly popular method in the field of pharmacoepidemiology. Existing power calculators for studies using instrumental variable analysis, such as Mendelian randomisation power calculators, do not allow for the structure of research questions in this field. This is because the analysis in pharmacoepidemiology will typically have stronger instruments and detect larger causal effects than in other fields. Consequently, there is a need for dedicated power calculators for pharmacoepidemiological research.\\n\\nMethods and resultsThe formula for calculating the power of a study using instrumental variable analysis in the context of pharmacoepidemiology is derived before being validated by a simulation study. The formula is applicable for studies using a single binary instrument to analyse the causal effect of a binary exposure on a continuous outcome. A web application is provided for the implementation of the formula by others.\\n\\nConclusionsThe statistical power of instrumental variable analysis in pharmacoepidemiological studies to detect a clinically meaningful treatment effect is an important consideration. Research questions in this field have distinct structures that must be accounted for when calculating power.\\n\\nFUNDING STATEMENTThis work was supported by the Perros Trust and the Integrative Epidemiology Unit.

    "abstract": "To facilitate high-throughput proteomic analyses we have developed a modified FASP protocol which improves the rate at which protein samples can be processed prior to mass spectrometry. Adapting the original FASP protocol to a 96-well format necessitates extended spin times for buffer exchange due to the low centrifugation speeds tolerated by these devices. However, by using 96-well plates with a more robust polyethersulfone molecular weight cutoff membrane, instead of the cellulose membranes typically used in these devices, we could use isopropanol as a wetting agent, decreasing spin times required for buffer exchange from an hour to 30 minutes. In a typical work flow used in our laboratory this equates to a reduction of 3 hours per plate. To test whether our modified protocol produced similar results to FASP and other FASP-like protocols we compared the performance of our modified protocol to the original FASP and the more recently described eFASP and MStern-blot. We show that all FASP-like methods, including our modified protocol, display similar performance in terms of proteins identified and reproducibility. Our results show that our modified FASP protocol is an efficient method for the high-throughput processing of protein samples for mass spectral analysis.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding posits that the human brain continually monitors the environment for regularities and detects inconsistencies. It is unclear, however, what effect attention has on expectation processes, as there have been relatively few studies and the results of these have yielded contradictory findings. Here, we employed Bayesian model comparison to adjudicate between two alternative computational models. The Opposition model states that attention boosts neural responses equally to predicted and unpredicted stimuli, whereas the Interaction model assumes that attentional boosting of neural signals depends on the level of predictability. We designed a novel, audiospatial attention task that orthogonally manipulated attention and prediction by playing oddball sequences in either the attended or unattended ear. We observed sensory prediction error responses, with electroencephalography, across all attentional manipulations. Crucially, posterior probability maps revealed that, overall, the Opposition model better explained scalp and source data, suggesting that attention boosts responses to predicted and unpredicted stimuli equally. Furthermore, Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) showed that these Opposition effects were expressed in plastic changes within the mismatch negativity network. Our findings provide empirical evidence for a computational model of the opposing interplay of attention and expectation in the brain.",

EuMicrobedbLite is a successor of the VBI Microbial Database (VMD) that was built using the Genome Unified Schema (GUS). In this version, the GUS schema has been greatly simplified with removal of many obsolete modules and redesign of others to incorporate contemporary data. Several dependencies such as perl object layers used for data loading in VMD have been replaced with independent light weight scripts. EumicrobedbLite now runs on a powerful annotation engine developed at our lab called \\\"Genome Annotator Lite\\\". Currently this database has 26 publicly available genomes and 10 EST datasets of oomycete organisms. The browser page has dynamic tracks presenting comparative genomics analyses, coding and non-coding data, tRNA genes, repeats and EST alignments. In addition, we have defined 44,777 core conserved proteins from twelve oomycete organisms that form 2974 clusters. Synteny viewing is enabled by incorporation of the Genome Synteny Viewer (GSV) tool. The user interface has undergone major changes for ease of browsing. Queryable comparative genomics information, conserved orthologous genes and pathways are among the new key features updated in this database. The browser has been upgraded to enable user upload of GFF files for quick view of genome annotation comparisons. The toolkit page integrates the EMBOSS package and has a gene prediction tool. Annotations for the organisms are updated once every six months to ensure quality. The database resource is available at www.eumicrobedb.org.",

    "abstract": "Variation in baseline ploidy is seen throughout the tree of life, yet the factors that determine why one ploidy level is selected over another remain poorly understood. Experimental evolution studies using asexual fungal microbes with manipulated ploidy levels intriguingly reveals a propensity to return to the historical baseline ploidy, a phenomenon that we term  ploidy drive. We evolved haploid, diploid, and polyploid strains of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans under three different nutrient limitation environments to test whether these conditions, hypothesized to select for low ploidy levels, could counteract ploidy drive. Strains generally maintained or acquired smaller genome sizes in minimal medium and under phosphorus depletion compared to in a complete medium, while mostly maintained or acquired increased genome sizes under nitrogen depletion. Surprisingly, improvements in fitness often ran counter to changes in total nuclear genome size; in a number of scenarios lines that maintained their original genome size often increased in fitness more than lines that converged towards diploidy. Combined, this work demonstrates a role for both the environment and genotype in determination of the rate of ploidy drive, and highlights questions that remain about the force(s) that cause genome size variation.",

Current methods that take advantage of this linkage information rely on models of recombination and coalescence, limiting the sample sizes and populations that they can analyze. We introduce a method, Minimal-Assumption Genomic Inference of Coalescence (MAGIC), that reconstructs key features of the evolutionary history, including the distribution of coalescence times, by integrating information across genomic length scales without using an explicit model of recombination, demography or selection. Using simulated data, we show that MAGICs performance is comparable to PSMC on single diploid samples generated with standard coalescent and recombination models. More importantly, MAGIC can also analyze arbitrarily large samples and is robust to changes in the coalescent and recombination processes. Using MAGIC, we show that the inferred coalescence time histories of samples of multiple human genomes exhibit inconsistencies with a description in terms of an effective population size based on single-genome data.",

Moreover, such experiments typically focus on protein-coding transcripts, ignoring the important impact of long noncoding RNAs. We evaluated coding and noncoding expression dynamics at high temporal resolution (6-hourly) in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells and report the effects of increased temporal resolution on the characterization of the underlying molecular processes. We present a refined resolution of global transcriptional alterations, including regulatory network interactions, coding and noncoding gene expression changes as well as alternative splicing events, many of which cannot be resolved by existing coarse developmental time-{-}-courses. We describe novel short lived and cycling patterns of gene expression and temporally dissect ordered gene expression at bidirectional promoters and responses to transcription factors.

    "abstract": "Patient classification has widespread biomedical and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response prediction. A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be easily interpretable to drive hypothesis-driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks. netDx meets the above criteria and particularly excels at data integration and model interpretability. As a machine learning method, netDx demonstrates consistently excellent performance in a cancer survival benchmark across four cancer types by integrating up to six genomic and clinical data types. In these tests, netDx has significantly higher average performance than most other machine-learning approaches across most cancer types and its best model outperforms all other methods for two cancer types. In comparison to traditional machine learning-based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway-level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in diverse data sets of breast cancer and asthma. Thus, netDx can serve both as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.",

However, most of the studies focused on the correlation analysis to define the functional connectivity for BOLD fluctuations between brain regions, which resulted in the limited understanding to the network properties of altered wirings in the schizophrenic brain. Here I characterized the distinctiveness of BOLD connectivity pattern in the schizophrenic brain relative to healthy brain with various similarity measures in the time-frequency domain, while participants are performing the working memory task in the MRI scanner. To assess the distinctiveness of the connectivity pattern, discrimination performances of the pattern classifier machines trained by each similarity measurement were compared. As a result, the classifier machine trained by cross-spectral coherence pattern in low frequency fluctuation (LFF, 0.01-0.08 Hz band) made better performance than the machine trained by correlation-based connectivity pattern. Interestingly, the classifier machine trained by time-lagging patterns in cross-correlation function of LFF produced higher classifying sensitivity than the machines trained by other measures. These results indicate that there are unobserved but considerable features in the functional connectivity pattern of schizophrenic brain which traditional emphasis on correlation analysis does not capture.",
