    "abstract": "Digital cell lineages reconstructed from 3D+time imaging data provide unique information to unveil mechanical cues and their role in morphogenetic processes. Our methodology based on a kinematic analysis of cell lineage data reveals deformation patterns and quantitative morphogenetic landmarks for a new type of developmental table. The characteristic spatial and temporal length scales of mechanical deformation patterns derived from a continuous approximation of cell displacements indicate a compressible fluid-like behavior of zebrafish gastrulating tissues. The instantaneous deformation rate at the mesoscopic level of the cells neighborhood is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The robustness of mechanical patterns results from their cumulative history along cell trajectories. Unsupervised classification of mechanical descriptor profiles was used to assess the homogeneity of biomechanical cues in cell populations. Further clustering of cell trajectories according to their cumulative mesoscopic biomechanical history during gastrulation revealed ordered and coherent spatiotemporal patterns comparable to that of the embryonic fate map.",

    "abstract": "Lesion and functional neuroimaging evidence suggest that local network deficits can be compensated by global network over-recruitment during a cognitive task. However, the neural mechanisms linking local and global network changes remain uncertain. To investigate this issue, we manipulated local function using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and measured structural and task-based functional network organization during memory encoding. The study yielded two main findings. First, consistent with the compensation hypothesis, 1-Hz rTMS attenuated local activity in the stimulated left prefrontal cortex (PFC) but increased the connectivity of this region with other brain areas, including contralateral PFC. Second, this 1-Hz related increase in global connectivity effects was associated with the volume of more global connections, suggesting white-matter constraints adaptive changes in functional connectivity. Taken together, these results clarify the neural mechanisms linking local and global network changes and the role of structural connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Injury of CNS nerve tracts remodels circuitry through dendritic spine loss and hyper-excitability, thus influencing recovery. Due to the complexity of the CNS, a mechanistic understanding of injury-induced synaptic remodeling remains unclear. Using microfluidic chambers to separate and injure distal axons, we show that axotomy causes retrograde dendritic spine loss at directly injured pyramidal neurons followed by retrograde presynaptic hyper-excitability. These remodeling events require activity at the site of injury, axon-to-soma signaling, and transcription. Similarly, directly injured corticospinal neurons in vivo also exhibit a specific increase in spiking following axon injury. Axotomy-induced hyper-excitability of cultured neurons coincides with elimination of inhibitory inputs onto injured neurons, including those formed onto dendritic spines. Netrin-1 downregulation occurs following axon injury and exogenous netrin-1 applied after injury normalizes spine density, presynaptic excitability, and inhibitory inputs at injured neurons. Our findings show that intrinsic signaling within damaged neurons regulates synaptic remodeling and involves netrin-1 signaling.",

However, none of the current architectures offers error-free and random-access readouts from a portable device. Here we show through experimental and theoretical verification that such a platform may be easily implemented in practice using MinION sequencers. The gist of the approach is to design an integrated pipeline that encodes data to avoid synthesis and sequencing errors, enables random access through addressing, and leverages efficient portable nanopore sequencing via new anchored iterative alignment and insertion/deletion error-correcting codes. Our work represents the only known random access DNA-based data storage system that uses error-prone MinION sequencers and produces error-free readouts with the highest reported information rate and density.",

However, existing theory assumes that organisms cannot detect changes in the environment and instead adapt to averages. This paper develops the first analytical model that allows for the simultaneous coevolution of socially learned traditions, reliance on social learning, and signal detection for environmental change. There are numerous conditions under which detection can be stable once common but cannot invade the population when rare. When signal detection is maintained by selection, it always leads to pure separating equilibria at which organisms always learn individually when they believe the environment has recently changed and otherwise always learn socially. Detection can increase mean fitness at equilibrium, but it may also reduce it.",

    "abstract": "Many viruses use a powerful terminase motor to pump their genome inside an empty procapsid shell during virus maturation. The large terminase (TerL) protein contains both enzymatic activities necessary for packaging in such viruses: the ATPase that powers DNA translocation and an endonuclease that cleaves the concatemeric genome both at initiation and completion of genome packaging. However, how TerL binds DNA during translocation and cleavage is still mysterious. Here we investigate DNA binding and cleavage using TerL from the thermophilic phage P74-26. We report the structure of the P74-26 TerL nuclease domain, which allows us to model DNA binding in the nuclease active site. We screened a large panel of TerL variants for defects in binding and DNA cleavage, revealing that the ATPase domain is the primary site for DNA binding, and is required for nucleolysis. The nuclease domain is dispensable for DNA binding but residues lining the active site guide DNA for cleavage. Kinetic analysis of nucleolysis suggests flexible tethering of the nuclease domains during DNA cleavage. We propose that interactions with the procapsid shell during DNA translocation conformationally restrict the nuclease domain, inhibiting cleavage; TerL release from the procapsid upon completion of packaging unlocks the nuclease domains to cleave DNA.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has hinted at the linkage disequilibrium (LD) dependent architecture of human complex traits, where SNPs with low levels of LD (LLD) have larger per-SNP heritability after conditioning on their minor allele frequency (MAF). However, this has not been formally assessed, quantified or biologically interpreted. Here, we analyzed summary statistics from 56 complex diseases and traits (average N = 101,401) by extending stratified LD score regression to continuous annotations. We determined that SNPs with low LLD have significantly larger per-SNP heritability. Roughly half of the LLD signal can be explained by functional annotations that are negatively correlated with LLD, such as DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS). The remaining signal is largely driven by our finding that common variants that are more recent tend to have lower LLD and to explain more heritability (P = 2.38 x 10-104); the youngest 20% of common SNPs explain 3.9x more heritability than the oldest 20%, consistent with the action of negative selection. We also inferred jointly significant effects of other LD-related annotations and confirmed via forward simulations that these annotations jointly predict deleterious effects. Our results are consistent with the action of negative selection on deleterious variants that affect complex traits, complementing efforts to learn about negative selection by analyzing much smaller rare variant data sets.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection and phenotypic plasticity can both produce locally differentiated phenotypes, but novel environments or gene combinations can produce plasticity that works in opposition to adaptive change. The red-shouldered soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma) was locally adapted to feed on the seeds of an introduced and a native host plant in Florida in the 1980s. By 2014, local differentiation was lost and replaced by phenotypically similar populations all adapted to the introduced host, likely as a result of gene flow. Here, I quantify the effects of these two host plants on individual performance, natural selection, and phenotypic plasticity. I find that the seed coat and seedpod of the native host have strong negative effects on juvenile survival and adult reproduction compared to the introduced host. I find support for the hypothesis that the seedpod is driving diversifying natural selection on beak length, which was previously locally adapted between hosts. I also find maladaptive plasticity induced by host plant: bugs develop beak lengths that are mismatched with the seedpod size of the host they are reared on. This plasticity may be the result of gene flow; hybrids in the 1990s showed the same pattern of maladaptive plasticity, and plasticity is stronger in the present in areas with high gene flow. Although ongoing natural selection has produced locally adapted genotypes in soapberry bugs, maladaptive plasticity has masked the phenotypic difference between populations in the field.",

Here, we systematically characterize the roles of Pif1 helicases in replisome progression and lagging-strand synthesis in S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that either Pif1 or Rrm3 redundantly stimulate strand-displacement by DNA polymerase {delta} during lagging-strand synthesis. By analyzing replisome mobility in pif1 and rrm3 mutants, we show that Rrm3, with a partially redundant contribution from Pif1, suppresses widespread terminal arrest of the replisome at tRNA genes. Although both head-on and codirectional collisions induce replication fork arrest at tRNA genes, head-on collisions arrest a higher proportion of replisomes; consistent with this observation, we find that head-on collisions between tRNA transcription and replisome progression are under-represented in the S. cerevisiae genome. Further, we demonstrate that tRNA-mediated arrest is R-loop independent, and propose that replisome arrest and DNA damage are mechanistically separable.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are inherently plastic, adjusting their structure, connectivity and excitability in response to changes in activity. How neurons sense changes in their activity level and then transduce these to structural changes remains to be fully elucidated. Working with the Drosophila larval locomotor network, we show that neurons use reactive oxygen species (ROS), metabolic byproducts, to monitor their activity. ROS signals are both necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent structural adjustments of both pre- and postsynaptic terminals and for network output, as measured by larval crawling behavior. We find the highly conserved Parkinsons disease-linked protein DJ-1{beta} acts as a redox sensor in neurons where it regulates pre- and postsynaptic structural plasticity, in part via modulation of the PTEN-PI3Kinase pathway. Neuronal ROS thus play an important physiological role as second messengers required for neuronal and network tuning, whose dysregulation in the ageing brain and under neurodegenerative conditions may contribute to synaptic dysfunction.",

Here, we resolve their deep phylogenetic relationships using presence/absence patterns of short interspersed elements (SINEs), a group of retroposons which is abundant in mammalian genomes but considered largely inactive in avian genomes. The resultant retroposon-based phylogeny provides a powerful and independent corroboration of previous indications derived from sequence-based analyses. Notably, SINE activity began in the common ancestor of Eupasseres (passerines excl. the New Zealand wrens Acanthisittidae) and ceased before the rapid diversification of oscine passerines (songbirds). Furthermore, we find evidence for very recent SINE activity within suboscine passerines, following the emergence of a SINE via acquisition of a different tRNA head as we suggest through template switching. We propose that the early evolution of passerines was unusual among birds in that it was accompanied by activity of SINEs. Their genomic and transcriptomic impact warrants further study in the light of the massive diversification of passerines.",

    "abstract": "The binding and contribution of transcription factors (TF) to cell specific gene expression is often deduced from open-chromatin measurements to avoid costly TF ChIP-seq assays. Thus, it is important to develop computational methods for accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we report a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining sets of OCRs with position weight matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks (HMs) can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC computes TF affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures of TF binding strength. Using machine learning, we find low affinity binding sites to improve our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to the standard presence/absence classification of binding sites. Further, we show that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a good prediction performance. In our application, gene-based scores computed by TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF ChIP-seq datasets. Finally, these scores correctly predict known transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively.",

Further, the models risk becoming inaccessible to experimentalists and other modelers, and their results may then be seen as less relevant to experimental work. To address these obstacles, we developed a tool for managing simulations called SimTracker. It supports users at each step of the modeling process, including execution of large scale parallel models on supercomputers. SimTracker is suitable for users with a range of modeling experience.

    "abstract": "The nonhybrid hierarchical assembly of PacBio long reads is becoming the most preferred method for obtaining genomes for microbial isolates. On the other hand, among massive numbers of Illumina sequencing reads produced, there is a slim chance of re-evaluating failed microbial genome assembly (high contig number, large total contig size, and/or the presence of low-depth contigs). We generated Illumina-type test datasets with various levels of sequencing error, pretreatment (trimming and error correction), repetitive sequences, contamination, and ploidy from both simulated and real sequencing data and applied k-mer abundance analysis to quickly detect possible diagnostic signatures of poor assemblies. Contamination was the only factor leading to poor assemblies for the test dataset derived from haploid microbial genomes, resulting in an extraordinary peak within low-frequency k-mer range. When thirteen Illumina sequencing reads of microbes belonging to genera Bacillus or Paenibacillus from a single multiplexed run were subjected to a k-mer abundance analysis, all three samples leading to poor assemblies showed peculiar patterns of contamination. Read depth distribution along the contig length indicated that all problematic assemblies suffered from too many contigs with low average read coverage, where 1% to 15% of total reads were mapped to low-coverage contigs. We found that subsampling or filtering out reads having rare k-mers could efficiently remove low-level contaminants and greatly improve the de novo assemblies. An analysis of 16S rRNA genes recruited from reads or contigs and the application of read classification tools originally designed for metagenome analyses can help identify the source of a contamination. The unexpected presence of proteobacterial reads across multiple samples, which had no relevance to our lab environment, implies that such prevalent contamination might have occurred after the DNA preparation step, probably at the place where sequencing service was provided.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical stress state of an organ is a critical, but still poorly understood, driver of organogenesis and regeneration. Here we report a chip-based regulated environment for micro-organs (REM-Chip) that enables systematic investigations of the crosstalk between an organs mechanical stress environment and biochemical signaling under a multitude of genetic and chemical perturbations. This method has enabled us to identify essential conditions for generating organ-scale intercellular calcium (Ca2+) waves (ICWs) in Drosophila wing imaginal discs that are also observed in vivo. Spontaneous ICWs require the presence of components in fly extract-based growth serum (FEX). Using the REM-Chip, we demonstrate that the release and not the initial application of mechanical compression is sufficient but not necessary to initiate ICWs. Further, the extent of the Ca2+ response is heterogeneous between discs and correlates with the degree of spontaneous ICWs activity in the pre-stress state. This system and method enable detailed examinations of the interplay between mechanical stress state, biochemical regulatory networks, and physiology in complex, hierarchically organized organ cultures.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis of cognitive empathy using the  Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (Eyes Test) in 88,056 research volunteers of European Ancestry (44,574 females and 43,482 males) from 23andMe Inc., and an additional 1,497 research volunteers of European Ancestry (891 females and 606 males) from the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS). We confirmed a female advantage on the Eyes Test (Cohens d = 0.21, P < 2.2x10-16), and identified a locus in 3p26.1 that is associated with scores on the Eyes Test in females (rs7641347, Pmeta = 1.58 x 10-8). Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explained 5.8% (95% CI: 0.45 - 0.72; P = 1.00 x 10-17) of the total trait variance in both sexes, and we identified a twin heritability of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.13-0.42). Finally, we identified significant genetic correlation between the Eyes Test and anorexia nervosa, measures of empathy (the Empathy Quotient), openness (NEO-Five Factor Inventory), and different measures of educational attainment and cognitive aptitude, and show that the genetic determinants of volumes of the dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) are positively correlated with the genetic determinants of performance on the Eyes Test.",

    "abstract": "Striatum is predominantly inhibitory and the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia. A functional characterization of its activity dynamics is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying phenomenon such as action selection and initiation. Here, we investigated the effects of the spatial connectivity structure on the emergence and maintenance of localized bumps of activity in large-scale striatal networks (~10,000 neurons). We show that in striatal network model in which the distance-dependent connection probability varies in a Gaussian fashion (Gaussian networks), the activity remains asynchronous irregular (AI) and spatially homogeneous, independent of the background input. By contrast, when the distance-dependent connectivity varies according to a Gamma distribution (Gamma networks), with short-range connectivity suppressed, a repertoire of activity dynamics can be observed: While weak background inputs induce spatially homogeneous AI activity, stronger background inputs induce stable, spatially localized activity bumps as in  winner-take-all (WTA) dynamics. Interestingly, for intermediate background inputs, the networks exhibit spatially localized, but unstable activity bumps (Transition Activity, TA), resembling the experimentally observed neuronal assembly dynamics in the striatum.\\n\\nAmong the three main regimes of network activity (AI, WTA, TA) we found that in the AI and TA regimes, network dynamics are flexible and can be easily modified by external stimuli. Moreover, the dynamical state of the network returns to the baseline after the stimulus is removed. By contrast, the dynamics in the WTA state are rigid and can only be changed by very strong external stimuli. These results support the hypothesis that the flexibility of the striatal network state in response to stimuli is important for its normal function and the  rigid network states (WTA) correspond to brain disorders such as Parkinsons disease, where the striatum looses its repertoire of dynamic states and is only receptive to very strong inputs.",

    "abstract": "Perception can be characterized as an inference process in which beliefs are formed about the world given sensory observations. The sensory neurons implementing these computations, however, are classically characterized with firing rates, tuning curves, and correlated noise. To connect these two levels of description, we derive expressions for how inferences themselves vary across trials, and how this predicts task-dependent patterns of correlated variability in the responses of sensory neurons. Importantly, our results require minimal assumptions about the nature of the inferred variables or how their distributions are encoded in neural activity. We show that our predictions are in agreement with existing measurements across a range of tasks and brain areas. Our results reinterpret task-dependent sources of neural covariability as signatures of Bayesian inference and provide new insights into their cause and their function.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGeneral connection between neural covariability and approximate Bayesian inference based on variability in the encoded posterior density.\nC_LIO_LIOptimal learning of a discrimination task predicts top-down components of noise correlations and choice probabilities in agreement with existing data.\nC_LIO_LIDifferential correlations are predicted to grow over the course of perceptual learning.\nC_LIO_LINeural covariability can be used to  reverse-engineer the subjects internal model.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Viral infection is usually studied at the level of cell populations, averaging over hundreds of thousands of individual cells. Moreover, measurements are typically done by analyzing a few time points along the infection process. While informative, such measurements are limited in addressing how cell variability affects infection outcome. Here we employ dynamic proteomics to study virus-host interactions, using the human pathogen Herpes Simplex virus 1 as a model. We tracked >50,000 individual cells as they respond to HSV1 infection, allowing us to model infection kinetics and link infection outcome (productive or not) with the cell state at the time of initial infection. We find that single cells differ in their preexisting susceptibility to HSV1, and that this is partially mediated by their cell-cycle position. We also identify specific changes in protein levels and localization in infected cells, attesting to the power of the dynamic proteomics approach for studying virus-host interactions.",

    "abstract": "Rare hybridisations between deeply divergent animal species have been reported for decades in a wide range of taxa, but have often remained unexplained, mainly considered chance events and reported as anecdotal. Here, we combine field observations with long-term data concerning natural hybridizations, climate, land-use, and field-validated species distribution models for two deeply divergent and naturally sympatric toad species in Europe (Bufo bufo and Bufotes viridis species groups). We show that climate warming and seasonal extreme temperatures are conspiring to set the scene for these maladaptive hybridisations, by differentially affecting life-history traits of both species. Our results identify and provide evidence of an ultimate cause for such events, and reveal that the potential influence of climate change on interspecific hybridisations goes far beyond closely related species. Furthermore, climate projections suggest that the chances for these events will steadily increase in the near future.",
