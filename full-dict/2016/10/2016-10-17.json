    "abstract": "O_LIRapid environmental change has generated growing interest in forecasts of future popu lation trajectories. Traditional population models built with detailed demographic obser vations from one study site can address the impacts of environmental change at particular locations, but are difficult to scale up to the landscape and regional scales relevant to man agement decisions. An alternative is to build models using population-level data that are much easier to collect over broad spatial scales than individual-level data. However, it is unknown whether models built using population-level data adequately capture the effects of density-dependence and environmental forcing that are necessary to generate skillful forecasts.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we test the consequences of aggregating individual 29 responses when forecasting the population states (percent cover) and trajectories of four perennial grass species in a semi-arid grassland in Montana, USA. We parameterized two population models for each species, one based on individual-level data (survival, growth and recruitment) and one on population-level data (percent cover), and compared their forecasting accuracy and fore cast horizons with and without the inclusion of climate covariates. For both models, we used Bayesian ridge regression to weight the influence of climate covariates for optimal prediction.\\nC_LIO_LIIn the absence of climate effects, we found no significant difference between the forecast accuracy of models based on individual-level data and models based on population-level data. Climate effects were weak, but increased forecast accuracy for two species. Increases in accuracy with climate covariates were similar between model types.\\nC_LIO_LIIn our case study, percent cover models generated forecasts as accurate as those from a demographic model. For the goal of forecasting, models based on aggregated individual level data may offer a practical alternative to data-intensive demographic models. Long time series of percent cover data already exist for many plant species. Modelers should exploit these data to predict the impacts of environmental change.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mitotic rounding (MR) during cell division is critical for the robust segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells and is frequently perturbed in cancerous cells. MR has been studied extensively in individual cultured cells, but the physical mechanisms regulating MR in intact tissues are still poorly understood. A cell undergoes mitotic rounding by simultaneously reducing adhesion with its neighbors, increasing actomyosin contraction around the cortex, and increasing the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. Whether these changes are purely additive, synergistic or impact separate aspects of MR is not clear. Specific modulation of these processes in dividing cells within a tissue is experimentally challenging, because of off-target effects and the difficulty of targeting only dividing cells. In this study, we analyze MR in epithelial cells by using a newly developed multi-scale, cell-based computational model that is calibrated using experimental observations from a model system of epithelial tissue growth, the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. The model simulations predict that increase in apical surface area of mitotic cells is solely driven by increasing cytoplasmic pressure. MR however is not achieved within biological constraints unless all three properties (cell-cell adhesion, cortical stiffness and pressure) are simultaneously regulated by the cell. The new multi-scale model is computationally implemented using a parallelization algorithm on a cluster of graphic processing units (GPUs) to make simulations of tissues with a large number of cells feasible. The model is extensible to investigate a wide range of cellular phenomena at the tissue scale.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMitotic rounding (MR) during cell division is critical for the robust segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells and is frequently perturbed in cancerous cells. MR has been studied extensively in individual cultured cells, but the physical mechanisms regulating MR in intact tissues are still poorly understood. The newly developed computational model Epi-scale enables one to produce new hypotheses about the underlying biophysical mechanisms governing MR of epithelial cells within the developing tissue micro-environment. In particular, our simulations results predict that robust mitotic rounding requires co-current changes in cell-cell adhesion, cortical stiffness and cytoplasmic pressure, and explains how regulation of each property impacts the shapes of dividing cells in tissues.",

    "abstract": "A crucial component of major transitions theory is that after the transition, adaptation occurs primarily at the level of the new, higher-level unit. For collective-level adaptations to occur, though, collective-level traits must be heritable. Since collective-level trait values are functions of lower-level trait values, collective-level heritability is related to particle-level heritability. However, the nature of this relationship has rarely been explored in the context of major transitions. We examine relationships between particle-level heritability and collective-level heritability for several functions that express collective-level trait value in terms of particle-level trait values. When a collective-level trait value is a linear function of particle-level trait values, the heritability of a collective-level trait is never less than that of the corresponding particle-level trait and is higher under most conditions. For more complicated functions, collective-level heritability is higher under most conditions, but can be lower when the function relating particle to cell-level trait values is sensitive to small fluctuations in the state of the particles within the collective. Rather than being an impediment to major transitions, we show that collective-level heritability superior to that of the lower-level units can often arise  for free, simply as a byproduct of collective formation.",

    "abstract": "A tragedy of the commons occurs when individuals take actions to maximize their payoffs even as their combined payoff is less than the global maximum had the players coordinated. The originating example is that of over-grazing of common pasture lands. In game theoretic treatments of this example there is rarely consideration of how individual behavior subsequently modifies the commons and associated payoffs. Here, we generalize evolutionary game theory by proposing a class of replicator dynamics with feedback-evolving games in which environment-dependent payoffs and strategies coevolve. We initially apply our formulation to a system in which the payoffs favor unilateral defection and cooperation, given replete and depleted environments respectively. Using this approach we identify and characterize a new class of dynamics: an oscillatory tragedy of the commons in which the system cycles between deplete and replete environmental states and cooperation and defection behavior states. We generalize the approach to consider outcomes given all possible rational choices of individual behavior in the depleted state when defection is favored in the replete state. In so doing we find that incentivizing cooperation when others defect in the depleted state is necessary to avert the tragedy of the commons. In closing, we propose new directions for the study of control and influence in games in which individual actions exert a substantive effect on the environmental state.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe robustness of ChIP-seq datasets is highly dependent upon the antibodies used. Currently, polyclonal antibodies are the standard despite several limitations: they are non-renewable, vary in performance between lots, and need to be validated with each new lot. In contrast, monoclonal antibody lots are renewable and provide consistent performance. To increase ChIP-seq standardization, we investigated whether monoclonal antibodies could replace polyclonal antibodies. We compared monoclonal antibodies that target five key histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3) to their polyclonal counterparts in both human and mouse cells.\\n\\nResultsOverall performance was highly similar for four monoclonal/polyclonal pairs, including when we used two distinct lots of the same monoclonal antibody. In contrast, the binding patterns for H3K27ac differed substantially between polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. However, this was most likely due to the distinct immunogen used rather than the clonality of the antibody.\\n\\nConclusionsAltogether, we found that monoclonal antibodies as a class perform as well as polyclonal antibodies for the detection of histone post-translational modifications in both human and mouse. Accordingly, we recommend the use of monoclonal antibodies in ChIP-seq experiments.",

A given set of taxa can be related in a limited number of ways, but if each taxon is represented by multiple sequences, the number of possible topologies becomes very large. Topology weighting reduces this complexity by quantifying the contribution of each 'taxon topology' to the full tree. We describe our method for topology weighting by iterative sampling of sub-trees (Twisst), and test it on both simulated and real genomic data. Overall, we show that this is an informative and versatile approach, suitable for exploring relationships in almost any genomic dataset.\\n\\nScripts to implement the method described are available at github.com/simonhmartin/twisst.",

Numerous candidate equation types (development functions) exist to describe the effect of temperature on development time, yet most studies use only a single type of equation and there is no consensus as to which, if any model predicts development rates better than the others, nor what the consequences of selecting a potentially incorrect model equation are on predicted development times. In this study, a literature search was performed of studies fitting development functions to development of arthropod larvae (99 species). The published data of most (79) of these species were then fit with 33 commonly-used development functions. Overall performance of each function type and consequences of using a function other than the best one to model data were assessed. Performance was also related to taxonomy and the range of temperatures examined. The majority (91.1 %) of studies were found to not use the best function out of those tested. Using the incorrect model lead to significantly less accurate (e.g., mean difference {+/-} SE 85.9 {+/-} 27.4 %, range: -1.7 to 1725.5 %) predictions of development times than the best function. Overall, more complex functions performed poorly relative to simpler ones. However, performance of some complex functions improved when wide temperature ranges were tested, which tended to be confined to studies of insects or arachnids compared with those of crustaceans.

    "abstract": "Various models describe asexual evolution by mutation, selection and drift. Some focus directly on fitness, typically modelling drift but ignoring or simplifying both epistasis and the distribution of mutation effects (travelling wave models). Others follow the dynamics of quantitative traits determining fitness (Fishers geometrical model), imposing a complex but fixed form of mutation effects and epistasis, and often ignoring drift. In all cases, predictions are typically obtained in high or low mutation rate limits and for long-term stationary regimes, thus loosing information on transient behaviors and the effect of initial conditions. Here, we connect fitness-based and trait-based models into a single framework, and seek explicit solutions even away from stationarity. The expected fitness distribution is followed over time via its cumulant generating function, using a deterministic approximation that neglects drift. In several cases, explicit trajectories for the full fitness distribution are obtained, for arbitrary mutation rates and standing variance. For non-epistatic mutation, especially with beneficial mutations, this approximation fails over the long term but captures the early dynamics, thus complementing stationary stochastic predictions. The approximation also handles several diminishing return epistasis models (e.g. with an optimal genotype): it can then apply at and away from equilibrium. General results arise at equilibrium, where fitness distributions display a  phase transition with mutation rate. Beyond this phase transition, in Fishers geometrical model, the full trajectory of fitness and trait distributions takes simple form, robust to details of the mutant phenotype distribution. Analytical arguments are explored for why and when the deterministic approximation applies.\\n\\nSignificance statementHow fast do asexuals evolve in new environments? Asexual fitness dynamics are well documented empirically. Various corresponding theories exist, to which they may be compared, but most typically describe stationary regimes, thus losing information on the shorter timescale of experiments, and on the impact of the initial conditions set by the experimenter. Here, a general deterministic approximation is proposed that encompasses many previous models as subcases, and shows surprising accuracy when compared to stochastic simulations. It can yield predictions over both short and long timescales, hopefully fostering the quantitative test of alternative models, using data from experimental evolution in asexuals.",

The field of mouse behavioral phenotyping was one of the first to raise this concern, and to relate it to other complicated methodological issues: the complex interaction between genotype and environment; the definitions of behavioral constructs; and the use of the mouse as a model animal for human health and disease mechanisms. In January 2015, researchers from various disciplines including genetics, behavior genetics, neuroscience, ethology, statistics and bioinformatics gathered in Tel Aviv University to discuss these issues. The general consent presented here was that the issue is prevalent and of concern, and should be addressed at the statistical, methodological and policy levels, but is not so severe as to call into question the validity and the usefulness of model organisms as a whole. Well-organized community efforts, coupled with improved data and metadata sharing, were agreed by all to have a key role to play in identifying specific problems and promoting effective solutions. As replicability is related to validity and may also affect generalizability and translation of findings, the implications of the present discussion reach far beyond the issue of replicability of mouse phenotypes but may be highly relevant throughout biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, contain a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast that functions to produce essential metabolic compounds. It was previously reported that several members of the Clp family of chaperones and proteases localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and in chloroplasts these proteins form complexes that degrade proteins in a proteasome-like manner to regulate key cellular processes, but their function in the apicoplast is completely unknown. In this study, we generated a conditional mutant of the P. falciparum apicoplast-targeted pfclpc gene and found that under normal conditions it localizes to the apicoplast. Knockdown of PfClpC results in growth inhibition and morphological defects, indicating that PfClpC is essential for parasite viability. Upon inhibition, PfClpC loses its apicoplast localization and appears in vesicle-like structures. Other apicoplast-targeted proteins also localize to these structures, suggesting that organelle integrity is compromised. Addition of isopentynyl pyrophosphate completely rescued the growth inhibition, indicating that the only essential function of PfClpC is related to the apicoplast. Moreover, cellular assays suggest that PfClpC inhibition interferes with the ability of the schizont-stage parasites to properly sort functional apicoplast organelles into daughter-merozoites. These data show that PfClpC is an essential gene that functions to maintain apicoplast integrity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe deadly human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contains a unique organelle called the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid that produces vital metabolites. Members of the prokaryotic-derived Clp family were previously reported to localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and plant chloroplasts, Clp homologs form a proteasome-like complex that degrade proteins but their function in parasite biology is unknown. Here we took a conditional knockdown approach to study an apicoplast localized Clp proteins, PfClpC, which we found to be essential for parasite viability. Inhibition of PfClpC results in a growth arrest phenotype that correlates with a reduced replication rate. We observed that PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast, however upon inhibition it is found dispersed in vesicle-like structures suggesting a complete breakdown of organelle integrity. Our ability to rescue the phenotype by adding an essential apicoplast-derived metabolite proved that the only essential function of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast function. Furthermore, we have found evidence supporting a role for PfClpC in apicoplast sorting into daughter cells. Therefore, we propose PfClpC as a potential drug target due to its essentiality, prokaryotic origin and absence from the human host.",

    "abstract": "SummaryAlthough protein design has been used to introduce new functions, designed variants generally only function as well as natural proteins after rounds of laboratory evolution. One possibility for this pattern is that designed mutants frequently sample nonfunctional conformations. To test this idea, we exploited advances in multiconformer modeling of room temperature X-ray data collection on redesigned ubiquitin variants selected for increasing binding affinity to the deubiquitinase USP7. Initial core mutations disrupt natural packing and lead to increased flexibility. Additional, experimentally selected mutations quenched conformational heterogeneity through new stabilizing interactions. Stabilizing interactions, such as cation-pi stacking and ordered waters, which are not included in standard protein design energy functions, can create specific interactions that have long range effects on flexibility across the protein. Our results suggest that increasing flexibility may be a useful strategy to escape local minima during initial directed evolution and protein design steps when creating new functions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how phenotypic differences between males and females arise from the sex-biased expression of nearly identical genomes can often reveal important insights into the biology and evolution of a species. Among Anopheles mosquito species, these phenotypic differences include vectorial capacity, as it is only females that blood feed and thus transmit human malaria. Here, we use RNA-seq data from multiple tissues of four vectors spanning the Anopheles phylogeny to explore the genomic and evolutionary properties of sex-biased genes. We find that in these mosquitoes, in contrast to what has been found in many other organisms, female-biased genes are more rapidly evolving in sequence, expression, and genic turnover, than male-biased genes. Our results suggests that this atypical pattern may be due to the combination of sex-specific life history challenges encountered by females, such as blood feeding. Furthermore, female propensity to only mate once in nature in male swarms likely diminishes sexual selection of post-reproductive traits related to sperm competition among males. We also develop a comparative framework to systematically explore tissue- and sex-specific splicing, to document its conservation throughout the genus and identify a set of candidate genes for future functional analyses of sex-specific isoform usage. Finally, our data reveals that the deficit of male-biased genes on the X chromosomes in Anopheles is a conserved feature in this genus and can be directly attributed to chromosome-wide transcriptional regulation that demasculinizes the X in male reproductive tissues.",

    "abstract": "Convergent evolution provides insight into the link between phenotype and genotype. Recently, large-scale comparative studies of convergent evolution have become possible, but researchers are still trying to determine the best way to design these types of analyses. One aspect of molecular convergence studies that has not yet been investigated is how taxonomic sample size affects inferences of molecular convergence. Here we show that increased sample size decreases the amount of inferred molecular convergence associated with the three convergent transitions to a marine environment in mammals. The sampling of more taxa--both with and without the convergent phenotype--reveals that alleles associated only with marine mammals in small datasets are actually more widespread, or are not shared by all marine species. The sampling of more taxa also allows finer resolution of ancestral substitutions, revealing that they are not in fact on lineages leading to solely marine species. We revisit a previous study on marine mammals and find that only 7 of the reported 43 genes with convergent substitutions still show signs of convergence with a larger number of background species. However, 4 of those 7 genes also showed signs of positive selection in the original analysis and may still be good candidates for adaptive convergence. Though our study is framed around the convergence of marine mammals, we expect our conclusions on taxonomic sampling are generalizable to any study of molecular convergence.",

    "abstract": "A decade after it was shown that the orientation of visual grating stimuli can be decoded from human visual cortex activity by means of multivariate pattern classification of BOLD fMRI data, numerous studies have investigated which aspects of neuronal activity are reflected in BOLD response patterns and are accessible for decoding. However, it remains inconclusive what the effect of acquisition resolution on BOLD fMRI decoding analyses is. The present study is the first to provide empirical ultra high-field fMRI data recorded at four spatial resolutions (0.8 mm, 1.4 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm isotropic voxel size) on this topic -- in order to test hypotheses on the strength and spatial scale of orientation discriminating signals. We present detailed analysis, in line with predictions from previous simulation studies, about how the performance of orientation decoding varies with different acquisition resolutions. Moreover, we also examine different spatial filtering procedures and its effects on orientation decoding. Here we show that higher-resolution scans with subsequent down-sampling or low-pass filtering yield no benefit over scans natively recorded in the corresponding lower resolution regarding decoding accuracy. The orientation-related signal in the BOLD fMRI data is spatially broadband in nature, includes both high spatial frequency components, as well as large-scale biases previously proposed in the literature. Moreover, we found above chance-level contribution from large draining veins to orientation decoding. Acquired raw data were publicly released to facilitate further investigation.",

We highlight the algorithmic features of these tools, as well as their potential issues and biases when utilizing any particular method.

    "abstract": "The standard axiomatic theory of rationality posits that agents order preferences according to the average utilities associated with different choices. Expected Utility Theory has repeatedly failed as a predictive theory of choice behavior, as reflected in a growing literature in behavioral economics. Evolutionary theorists have suggested that seemingly irrational behaviors in contemporary contexts may have once served important functions, but there has been little attempt to formalize the relationship between evolutionary fitness and choice behavior. Biological agents should optimize fitness, but fitness itself is not a reasonable value function for decision-making since its time-scale exceeds the lifespan of the decision-maker. Consequently, organisms use proximate motivational systems that work on appropriate time-scales and are amenable to feedback and learning. We develop an evolutionary principal-agent model in which individuals maximize a set of proximal choice variables (age-specific demographic rates), the interests of which are aligned with fitness. The solution to our model yields pessimistic probability weightings compatible with the Rank-Dependent Expected Utility family of choice models. The pessimistic probability weighting characteristic of these models emerges naturally in an evolutionary framework because of extreme intolerance to zeros in multiplicative growth processes.",

    "abstract": "Many parthenogenetically reproducing animals produce offspring not clonally but through different mechanisms collectively referred to as automixis. Here, meiosis proceeds normally but is followed by the fusion of meiotic products that restores diploidy. This mechanism typically leads to a reduction in heterozygosity among the offspring compared to the mother. Following a derivation of the rate at which heterozygosity is lost at one and two loci, depending on the number of crossovers between loci and centromere, a number of models are developed to gain a better understanding of basic evolutionary processes in automictic populations. Analytical results are obtained for the expected equilibrium neutral genetic diversity, mutation-selection balance, selection with overdominance, the rate of spread of beneficial mutations, and selection on crossover rates. These results are complemented by numerical investigations elucidating how associative overdominance (two off-phase deleterious mutations at linked loci behaving like an overdominant locus) can in some cases maintain heterozygosity for prolonged times, and how clonal interference affects adaptation in automictic populations. These results suggest that although automictic populations are expected to suffer from the lack of gene shuffling with other individuals, they are nevertheless in some respects superior to both clonal and outbreeding sexual populations in the way they respond to beneficial and deleterious mutations. Implications for related genetic systems such as intratetrad mating, clonal reproduction, selfing as well as different forms of mixed sexual and automictic reproduction are discussed.",

In the last two decades, cognitive neuroscientists have sought to elucidate this issue by exploring the common neural basis of the experience of beauty. Still, empirical evidence for such common neural basis of different forms of beauty is not conclusive. To address this question, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing neuroimaging studies of beauty appreciation of faces and visual art by non-expert adults (49 studies, 982 participants, meta-data are available at https://osf.io/s9xds/). We observed that perceiving these two forms of beauty activated distinct brain regions: while the beauty of faces convergently activated the left ventral striatum, the beauty of visual art convergently activated the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC). However, a conjunction analysis failed to reveal any common brain regions for the beauty of visual art and faces. The implications of these results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We develop a method to artificially select for rhizosphere microbiomes that confer salt-tolerance to the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. We differentially propagate microbiomes within the background of a non-evolving, highly-inbred plant population, and therefore only microbiomes evolve in our experiment, but not the plants. To optimize methods, we conceptualize artificial microbiome-selection as a special case of indirect selection: We do not measure microbiome properties directly, but we use host performance (e.g., biomass; seed set) as an indicator to infer association with rhizosphere microbiomes that confer salt-tolerance to a plant. We previously called this indirect-selection scheme host-mediated indirect selection on microbiomes (Mueller & Sachs 2015). Our methods aim to maximize evolutionary changes due to differential microbiome-propagation, while minimizing some (but not all) ecological processes affecting microbiome composition. Specifically, our methods aim to maximize microbiome perpetuation between selection-cycles and maximize response to artificial microbiome-selection by (a) controlling microbiome assembly when inoculating seeds at the beginning of each selection cycle; (b) using low-carbon soil to enhance host-control mediated by carbon secretions of plants during initial microbiome assembly and subsequent microbiome persistence; (c) fractionating microbiomes before transfer between plants to perpetuate and select only on bacterial and viral (but not fungal) microbiome components; and (d) ramping of salt-stress between selection-cycles to minimize the chance of over-stressing plants. Our selection protocol generates microbiomes that enhance plant fitness after only 1-3 rounds of artificial selection on rhizosphere microbiomes. Relative to fallow-soil control treatments, artificially-selected microbiomes increase plant fitness by 75% under sodium-sulfate stress, and by 38% under aluminum-sulfate stress. Relative to null control treatments, artificially-selected microbiomes increase plant fitness by 13% under sodium-sulfate stress, and by 12% under aluminum-sulfate stress. When testing microbiomes after nine rounds of differential microbiome propagation, the effect of bacterial microbiomes selected to confer tolerance to sodium-sulfate stress appears specific (these microbiomes do not confer tolerance to aluminum-sulfate stress), but the effect of microbiomes selected to confer tolerance to aluminum-sulfate stress appears non-specific (selected microbiomes ameliorate both sodium- and aluminum-sulfate stresses). Complementary metagenomic analyses of the artificially selected microbiomes will help elucidate metabolic properties of microbiomes that confer specific versus non-specific salt-tolerance to plants.",

A recent study identified the transmembrane receptor protein neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) as a substrate for aberrant extracellular binding of mutant GlyRS. Formation of the Nrp1/mutant GlyRS complex antagonises the interaction of Nrp1 with one of its main natural ligands, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), contributing to neurodegeneration. Reduced binding of Nrp1 to VEGF-A is known to disrupt blood vessel development and growth. We therefore analysed capillary architecture at early and later symptomatic time points in CMT2D mouse muscles, retina, and sciatic nerve, as well as in embryonic hindbrain. Assessing capillary diameter, density, and branching, we observed no differences between wild-type and mutant animals from embryonic development to three months, spanning the duration over which numerous sensory and neuromuscular phenotypes manifest. This work indicates that mutant GlyRS-mediated disruption of Nrp1/VEGF-A signalling is permissive to capillary maturation and maintenance in CMT2D mice.\\n\\nSummary StatementAlthough the multi-functional neuropilin 1/VEGF-A signalling pathway is impaired by dominant pathogenic GlyRS variants, the vascular system remains unperturbed in Gars mutant mice.",

At the functional level, the divisive normalization model (DNM, Heeger, 1992) has accounted for a wide range of single-cell recordings in terms of a combination of linear filtering, nonlinear rectification, and divisive normalization. We propose standardizing the formulation of the DNM and implementing it in software that takes static grayscale images as inputs and produces firing-rate responses as outputs. We also review a comprehensive suite of 30 empirical phenomena and report a series of simulation experiments that qualitatively replicate dozens of key experiments with a standard parameter set consistent with physiological measurements. This systematic approach identifies novel falsifiable predictions of the DNM. We show how the model simultaneously satisfies the conflicting desiderata of flexibility and falsifiability. Our key idea is that, while adjustable parameters are needed to accommodate the diversity across neurons, they must be fixed for a given individual neuron. This requirement introduces falsifiable constraints when this single neuron is probed with multiple stimuli. We also present mathematical analyses and simulation experiments that explicate some of these constraints.",

With paired local field potential (LFP) and intracellular recordings and controlled stimulus manipulations we directly tested this idea in the locust olfactory system. We found that inputs arriving in Kenyon cells (KCs) sum most effectively in a preferred window of the oscillation cycle. With a computational model, we found that the non-uniform structure of noise in the membrane potential helps mediate this process. Further experiments performed in vivo demonstrated that integration windows can form in the absence of inhibition and at a broad range of oscillation frequencies.

Aer is a receptor that, instead of responding to a specific chemoattractant, allows bacteria to sense cellular energy levels and move towards favourable environments. In Pseudomonas, the number of apparent Aer homologs differs between the only two species it had been characterized in, P. aeruginosa and P. putida. Here we combined bioinformatic approaches with deletional mutagenesis in P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 to further characterize Aer. It was determined that the number of Aer homologs varies between 0-4 throughout the Pseudomonas genus, and they were phylogenetically classified into 5 subgroups. We also used sequence analysis to show that these homologous receptors differ in their HAMP signal transduction domains. Genetic analysis also indicated that some Aer homologs have likely been subject to horizontal transfer. P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 was unique among species for having three Aer homologs as well as the receptors CttP and McpB. Phenotypic characterization in this species showed the most prevalent homolog of Aer was key, but not essential for energy-taxis.

    "abstract": "Deciphering how the one-dimensional information encoded in a genomic sequence is read out in three-dimensions is a pressing contemporary challenge. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) are two popular technologies that provide important links between genomic sequence and 3D chromosome organization. However, how to integrate views from 3C, or genome-wide Hi-C, and FISH is far from solved. We first discuss what each of these methods measure by reconsidering available matched experimental data for Hi-C and FISH. Using polymer simulations, we then demonstrate that contact frequency is distinct from average spatial distance. We show this distinction can create a seemingly-paradoxical relationship between 3C and FISH. Finally, we consider how the measurement of specific interactions between chromosomal loci might be differentially affected by the two technologies. Together, our results have implications for future attempts to cross-validate and integrate 3C and FISH, as well as for developing models of chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "In optogenetics, light signals are used to control genetically engineered photoreceptors, and in turn manipulate biological pathways with unmatched precision. Recently, evolved photoreceptors with diverse in vitro-measured wavelength and intensity-dependent photoswitching properties have been repurposed for synthetic control of gene expression, proteolysis, and numerous other cellular processes. However, the relationship between the input light spectrum and in vivo photoreceptor response dynamics is poorly understood, restricting the utility of these optogenetic tools. Here, we advance a classic in vitro two-state photoreceptor model to reflect the in vivo environment, and combine it with simplified mathematical descriptions of signal transduction and output gene expression through our previously engineered green/red and red/far red photoreversible bacterial two-component systems (TCSs). Additionally, we leverage our recent open-source optical instrument to develop a workflow of spectral and dynamical characterization experiments to parameterize the model for both TCSs. To validate our approach, we challenge the model to predict experimental responses to a series of complex light signals very different from those used during parameterization. We find that the model generalizes remarkably well, predicting the results of all categories of experiments with high quantitative accuracy for both systems. Finally, we exploit this predictive power to program two simultaneous and independent dynamical gene expression signals in bacteria expressing both TCSs. This multiplexed gene expression programming approach will enable entirely new studies of how metabolic, signaling, and decision-making pathways integrate multiple gene expression signals. Additionally, our approach should be compatible with a wide range of optogenetic tools and model organisms.\\n\\nSignificance statementLight-switchable signaling pathways (optogenetic tools) enable precision studies of how biochemical networks underlie cellular behaviors. We have developed a versatile mathematical model based on a two-state photoconversion mechanism that we have applied to the E. coli CcaSR and Cph8-OmpR optogenetic tools. This model enables accurate prediction of the gene expression response to virtually any light source or mixture of light sources. We express both optogenetic tools in the same cell and apply our model to program two simultaneous and independent gene expression signals in the same cell. This method can be used to study how biological pathways integrate multiple inputs and should be extensible to other optogenetic tools and host organisms.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that the allocation and synthesis of total cellular resources in microorganisms are uniquely determined by the growth conditions. Adaptation to a new physiological state leads to a change in cell size via reallocation of cellular resources. However, it has not been understood how cell size is coordinated with biosynthesis and robustly adapts to physiological states. We show that cell size in Escherichia coli can be predicted for any steady-state condition by projecting all biosynthesis into three measurable variables representing replication initiation, replication-division cycle, and the global biosynthesis rate. These variables can be decoupled by selectively controlling their respective core biosynthesis using CRISPR interference and antibiotics, verifying our predictions that different physiological states can result in the same cell size. We performed extensive growth inhibition experiments, and discovered that cell size at replication initiation per origin, namely the initiation mass or \\\"unit cell,\\\" is remarkably invariant under perturbations targeting transcription, translation, ribosome content, replication kinetics, fatty acid and cell-wall synthesis, cell division, and cell shape. Based on this invariance and balanced resource allocation, we explain why the total cell size is the sum of all unit cells. These results provide an overarching framework with quantitative predictive power over cell size in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Canadian Council on Animal Care and American Veterinary Medical Association classify intraperitoneal (IP) pentobarbital as an acceptable euthanasia method in rats. However, federal guidelines do not exist for a recommended dose or volume and IP euthanasia has been described as unreliable, with misinjections leading to variable success in ensuring a timely death. The aims of this study were to assess and improve efficacy and consistency of IP euthanasia.\\n\\nMethodsIn a randomized, blinded study, 51 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (170-495 g) received one of four treatments: low-dose low-volume (LL) IP pentobarbital (n = 13, 200 mg/kg pentobarbital), low-dose high-volume (LH) IP pentobarbital (n = 14, 200 mg/kg diluted 1:3 with phosphate buffered saline), high-dose high-volume (HH, n = 14, 800 mg/kg pentobarbital), or saline. Times to loss of righting reflex (LORR) and cessation of heartbeat (CHB) were recorded. To identify misinjections, necropsy examinations were performed on all rats. Video recordings of LL and HH groups were analyzed for pain-associated behaviors. Between-group comparisons were performed with 1-way ANOVA and Games-Howell post hoc tests. Variability for CHB was assessed by coefficient of variation (CV) calculation.\\n\\nResultsThe fastest euthanasia method (CHB) was HH (283.7 {+/-} 38 s), compared with LL (485.8 {+/-} 140.7 s, p = 0.002) and LH (347.7 {+/-} 72.0 s, p = 0.039). Values for CV were: HH, 13.4%; LH, 20.7%; LL, 29.0%. LORR time was longest in LL (139.5 {+/-} 29.6 s), compared with HH (111.6 {+/-} 19.7 s, p = 0.046) and LH (104.2 {+/-} 19.3 s, p = 0.01). Misinjections occurred in 15.7% (8/51) of euthanasia attempts. Pain-associated behavior incidence ranged from 36% (LL) to 46% (HH).\\n\\nConclusionThese data illustrate refinement of this euthanasia technique. Both dose and volume contribute to speed of death with IP pentobarbital and an increase in volume alone does not significantly reduce variability. The proportion of misinjections was similar to that of previous studies.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Many animals rely on vision to detect objects such as conspecifics, predators, and prey. Hypercomplex cells of the feline cortex and small target motion detectors of the dragonfly and hoverfly optic lobe demonstrate robust tuning for small objects with weak or no response to elongated edges or movement of the visual panorama [1-4]. However, the relationship between anatomical, molecular, and functional properties of object detection circuitry is not understood. Here, we characterize a previously identified lobula columnar neuron (LC11) in Drosophila [5]. By imaging calcium dynamics with two-photon excitation microscopy we show that LC11 responds to the non-directional motion of a small object darker than the background, with little or no responses to static flicker, elongated bars, or panoramic gratings. LC11 dendrites reside at the boundary between GABA-ergic and cholinergic layers of the lobula, each dendrite spans enough columns to sample 75-degrees of visual space, yet the functional receptive field is only 20-degrees wide, and shows robust responses to an object spanning less than one 5-degree facet of the compound eye. The dendrites of neighboring LC11s encode object motion retinotopically, but the axon terminals fuse into a glomerular structure in the central brain where retinotopy is lost. Blocking inhibitory ionic currents abolishes small object sensitivity and facilitates responses to elongated bars and gratings. Our results reveal high acuity small object motion detection in the Drosophila optic lobe.",

    "abstract": "Numerous advances in sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics through generating many types of genomic functional data. Statistical tools have been developed to analyze individual data types, but there lack strategies to integrate disparate datasets under a unified framework. Moreover, most analysis techniques heavily rely on feature selection and data preprocessing which increase the difficulty of addressing biological questions through the integration of multiple datasets. Here, we introduce FIDDLE (Flexible Integration of Data with Deep LEarning) an open source data-agnostic flexible integrative framework that learns a unified representation from multiple data types to infer another data type. As a case study, we use multiple Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic datasets to predict global transcription start sites (TSS) through the simulation of TSS-seq data. We demonstrate that a type of data can be inferred from other sources of data types without manually specifying the relevant features and preprocessing. We show that models built from multiple genome-wide datasets perform profoundly better than models built from individual datasets. Thus FIDDLE learns the complex synergistic relationship within individual datasets and, importantly, across datasets.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the integration of top-down and bottom-up signals is essential for the study of perception. Current accounts of predictive coding describe this in terms of interactions between state units encoding expectations or predictions, and error units encoding prediction error. However, direct neural evidence for such interactions has not been well established. To achieve this, we combined EEG methods that preferentially tag different levels in the visual hierarchy: Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP at 10Hz, tracking bottom-up signals) and Semantic Wavelet-Induced Frequency Tagging (SWIFT at 1.3Hz tracking top-down signals). Importantly, we examined intermodulation components (IM, e.g., 11.3Hz) as a measure of integration between these signals. To examine the influence of expectation and predictions on the nature of such integration, we constructed 50-second movie streams and modulated expectation levels for upcoming stimuli by varying the proportion of images presented across trials. We found SWIFT, SSVEP and IM signals to differ in important ways. SSVEP was strongest over occipital electrodes and was not modified by certainty. Conversely, SWIFT signals were evident over temporo- and parieto-occipital areas and decreased as a function of increasing certainty levels. Finally, IMs were evident over occipital electrodes and increased as a function of certainty. These results link SSVEP, SWIFT and IM signals to sensory evidence, predictions, prediction errors and hypothesis-testing - the core elements of predictive coding. These findings provide neural evidence for the integration of top-down and bottom-up information in perception, opening new avenues to studying such interactions in perception while constraining neuronal models of predictive coding.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThere is a growing understanding that both top-down and bottom-up signals underlie perception. But how do these signals interact? And how does this process depend on the signals probabilistic properties?  Predictive coding theories of perception describe this in terms how well top-down predictions fit with bottom-up sensory input. Identifying neural markers for such signal integration is therefore essential for the study of perception and predictive coding theories in particular. The novel Hierarchical Frequency Tagging method simultaneously tags top-down and bottom-up signals in EEG recordings, while obtaining a measure for the level of integration between these signals. Our results suggest that top-down predictions indeed integrate with bottom-up signals in a manner that is modulated by the predictability of the sensory input.",

    "abstract": "Despite the small size the folding of Ubiquitin (Ub), which plays an indispensable role in targeting proteins for degradation and DNA damage response, is complex. A number of experiments on Ub folding have reached differing conclusions regarding the relation between collapse and folding, and whether intermediates are populated. In order to resolve these vexing issues, we elucidate the denaturant-dependent thermodynamics and kinetics of Ub folding in low and neutral pH as a function of Guanidinium chloride and Urea using coarse-grained molecular simulations. The changes in the fraction of the folded Ub, and the radius of gyration (Rg) as a function of the denaturant concentration, [C], are in quantitative agreement with experiments. Under conditions used in experiments, Rg of the unfolded state at neutral pH changes only by {approx} 17% as the [GdmCl] decreases from 6 M to 0 M. We predict that the extent of compaction of the unfolded state increases as temperature decreases. A two-dimensional folding landscape as a function of Rg and a measure of similarity to the folded state reveals unambiguously that the native state assembly is preceded by collapse, as discovered in fast mixing experiments on several proteins. Analyses of the folding trajectories, under mildly denaturing conditions ([GdmCl]=1.0M or [Urea]=1.0M), shows that Ub folds by collision between preformed secondary structural elements involving kinetic intermediates that are primarily stabilized by long-range contacts. Our work explains the results of Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments on Ub quantitatively, and establishes that evolved globular proteins are poised to collapse. In the process, we explain the discrepancy between SAXS and single molecule fluorescent resonant energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, which have arrived at a contradicting conclusion concerning the collapse of polypeptide chains.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan genus Plasmodium causes malaria in dozens of mammal species, including humans, non-human primates, rodents, and bats. In humans, Plasmodium infections have caused hundreds of millions of documented deaths, imposing strong selection on certain populations and driving the emergence of several resistance alleles. Over the deep timescale of mammalian evolution, however, little is known about host adaptation to Plasmodium. In this work, we expand the collection of known Plasmodium-interacting-proteins (PIPs) in mammalian hosts from ~10 to 410, by manually curating thousands of scientific abstracts. We use comparative tests of adaptation to show that PIPs have experienced >3 times more positive selection than similar mammalian proteins, consistent with Plasmodium as a major and long-standing selective pressure. PIP adaptation is strongly linked to gene expression in the blood, liver, and lung, all of which are clinically relevant tissues in Plasmodium infection. Interestingly, we find that PIPs with immune functions are especially enriched for additional interactions with viruses or bacteria, which together drive a 3.7-fold excess of adaptation. These pleiotropic interactions with unrelated pathogens, along with pressure from other Plasmodium-like Apicomplexan parasites, may help explain the PIP adaptation we observe in all clades of the mammalian tree. As a case study, we also show that alpha-spectrin, the major membrane component of mammalian red blood cells, has experienced accelerated adaptation in domains known to interact specifically with Plasmodium proteins. Similar interactions with Plasmodium-like parasites appear to have driven substantial adaptation in hundreds of host proteins throughout mammalian evolution.",

A primary consideration was to make the mechanism accessible and affordable, and in doing so, lower the cases of Obstructive Sleep Apnea that go undiagnosed due to the cost and inconvenience associated with the traditional diagnosis method--a Polysomnogram. Bluetooth capability was an additional consideration so that the device would transmit data directly to an android smartphone, eliminating the need for an additional output mechanism. The total cost of the device, quite surprisingly, did not exceed $30, and therein rendered the device an accessible, affordable mechanism for diagnosis. Tests of the device on diagnosed patients yielded data consistent with the diagnosis, with a few false positives as a result of the excessive sensitivity of the sensors.",

    "abstract": "1.Interpretation of pathological gait has, for decades, offered insight into amputee anomalies and diseases such as cerebral palsy. Gait analysis has been actively used at the Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahatya Samiti for such purposes. The normative gait data used to compare data obtained from amputees, however, has been collected from laboratories under dissimilar conditions, skewing interpretation. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were extractedfrom 43 male Indian subjects using a 7.5m walkway and the BTS Bioengineering GAITLAB setup. Working under the hypothesis that a lack of cross-cultural validity was somewhat responsible for variations in normative gait, we attempted to develop a region-specific data set for use at the headquarters of the Jaipur Foot Organization Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahatya Samiti (BMVSS). Stratified random sampling was used to recruit subjects and measures were taken to ensure minimal effects of extraneous variables. Statistical analysis was performed on obtained data using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to gauge the effect age and ethnicity had on normative values of the parameters investigated. We found statistically significant p-values for a few spatiotemporal parameters in the analysis of variance for both age and ethnicity. While the results were much less significant than initially hypothesized, the study proved an efficient way to create a normative gait data set exclusively for use at the gait laboratory of the Jaipur Foot Organization, thereby eliminating potential erroneous interpretation of pathological gait when comparing said gait to normative gait data obtained in laboratories under dissimilar conditions.",

    "abstract": "Many viruses use a powerful terminase motor to pump their genome inside an empty procapsid shell during virus maturation. The large terminase (TerL) protein contains both enzymatic activities necessary for packaging in such viruses: the ATPase that powers DNA translocation and an endonuclease that cleaves the concatemeric genome both at initiation and completion of genome packaging. However, how TerL binds DNA during translocation and cleavage is still mysterious. Here we investigate DNA binding and cleavage using TerL from the thermophilic phage P74-26. We report the structure of the P74-26 TerL nuclease domain, which allows us to model DNA binding in the nuclease active site. We screened a large panel of TerL variants for defects in binding and DNA cleavage, revealing that the ATPase domain is the primary site for DNA binding, and is required for nucleolysis. The nuclease domain is dispensable for DNA binding but residues lining the active site guide DNA for cleavage. Kinetic analysis of nucleolysis suggests flexible tethering of the nuclease domains during DNA cleavage. We propose that interactions with the procapsid shell during DNA translocation conformationally restrict the nuclease domain, inhibiting cleavage; TerL release from the procapsid upon completion of packaging unlocks the nuclease domains to cleave DNA.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical techniques measure many individual properties of chromatin along the genome. These properties include DNA accessibility (measured by DNase-seq) and the presence of individual transcription factors and histone modifications (measured by ChIP-seq). Segway is software that transforms multiple datasets on chromatin properties into a single annotation of the genome that a biologist can more easily interpret. This protocol describes how to use Segway to annotate the genome, starting with reads from a ChIP-seq experiment. It includes pre-processing of data, training the Segway model, annotating the genome, assigning biological meanings to labels, and visualizing the annotation in a genome browser.",

    "abstract": "Combining genome-wide structural models with phenomenological data is at the forefront of efforts to understand the organizational principles regulating the human genome. Here, we use chromosome-chromosome contact data as knowledge- based constraints for large-scale three-dimensional models of the human diploid genome. The resulting models remain minimally entangled and acquire several functional features that are observed in vivo and that were never used as input for the model. We find, for instance, that gene-rich, active regions are drawn towards the nuclear center, while gene poor and lamina-associated domains are pushed to the periphery. These and other properties persist upon adding local contact constraints, suggesting their compatibility with non-local constraints for the genome organization. The results show that suitable combinations of data analysis and physical modelling can expose the unexpectedly rich functionally-related properties implicit in chromosome-chromosome contact data. Specific directions are suggested for further developments based on combining experimental data analysis and genomic structural modelling.",

    "abstract": "The pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a model organism able to synthesise industrially-relevant molecules. Large-scale monocultures are prone to bio-contamination, however, little is known about the identity of the invading organisms. To gain insight into the bacterial community associated with diatoms, we translated the complexity of a natural system into reproducible experiments where we investigated the microbiome of P. tricornutum cultures. The results revealed a dynamic bacterial community that changed over time and in differing media conditions. We propose a network of putative interactions between P. tricornutum and the main bacterial factions, which is translated into a set of ordinary differential equations constituting a computational dynamic model. The proposed mathematical model is able to capture the population dynamics, further supporting the hypothesised interactions. The interdisciplinary approach implemented provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of diatom-associated microbial communities, and provides a foundation for further systematic investigations of host-microbe interactions.",
