    "abstract": "The cerebellum has a well-established role in locomotion control, but how the cerebellar network regulates locomotion behaviour is still not well understood. We therefore characterized the activity of cerebellar neurons in awake mice engaged in a locomotion task, using high-density silicon electrode arrays. We characterized the activity of over 300 neurons in response to locomotion, finding tuning to speed of locomotion, turning, and phase of the step cycle. We found that the cerebellar neurons we recorded mainly encoded information about future locomotor activity. We were able to decode the speed of locomotion with a simple linear algorithm, needing relatively few well-chosen cells to provide an accurate estimate of locomotion speed. Our observation that cerebellar neuronal activity predicts locomotion in the near future, and encodes the required kinematic variables, points to this activity underlying the efference copy signal for vertebrate locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Continuing efforts from large international consortia have made genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptomic annotation data publicly available for a variety of cell and tissue types. However, synthesis of these datasets into effective summary metrics to characterize the functional non-coding genome remains a challenge. Here, we present GenoSkyline-Plus, an extension of our previous work through integration of an expanded set of epigenomic and transcriptomic annotations to produce high-resolution, single tissue annotations. After validating our annotations with a catalog of tissue-specific non-coding elements previously identified in the literature, we apply our method using data from 127 different cell and tissue types to present an atlas of heritability enrichment across 45 different GWAS traits. We show that broader organ system categories (e.g. immune system) increase statistical power in identifying biologically relevant tissue types for complex diseases while annotations of individual cell types (e.g. monocytes or B-cells) provide deeper insights into disease etiology. Additionally, we use our GenoSkyline-Plus annotations in an in-depth case study of late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). Our analyses suggest a strong connection between LOAD heritability and genetic variants contained in regions of the genome functional in monocytes. Furthermore, we show that LOAD shares a similar localization of SNPs to monocyte-functional regions with Parkinsons disease. Overall, we demonstrate that integrated genome annotations at the single tissue level provide a valuable tool for understanding the etiology of complex human diseases. Our GenoSkyline-Plus annotations are freely available at http://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoSkyline.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAfter years of community efforts, many experimental and computational approaches have been developed and applied for functional annotation of the human genome, yet proper annotation still remains challenging, especially in non-coding regions. As complex disease research rapidly advances, increasing evidence suggests that non-coding regulatory DNA elements may be the primary regions harboring risk variants in human complex diseases. In this paper, we introduce GenoSkyline-Plus, a principled annotation framework to identify tissue and cell type-specific functional regions in the human genome through integration of diverse high-throughput epigenomic and transcriptomic data. Through validation of known non-coding tissue-specific regulatory regions, enrichment analyses on 45 complex traits, and an in-depth case study of neurodegenerative diseases, we demonstrate the ability of GenoSkyline-Plus to accurately identify tissue-specific functionality in the human genome and provide unbiased, genome-wide insights into the genetic basis of human complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Converging lines of evidence indicate that the pain experience emerges from distributed cortical nodes that share nociceptive information. While the theory of a single pain center is still not falsifiable by current neuroimaging technology, the validation of distinct brain mechanisms for acute pain and its relief is ongoing and strongly dependent on the employed experimental design. In the current study including a total of 28 subjects, a recently presented, innovative experimental approach was adopted that is able to clearly differentiate painful from non-pain perceptions without changing stimulus strength and while recording brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Namely, we applied a repetitive and purely nociceptive stimulus to the tooth pulp with subsequent suppression of the nociceptive barrage via a regional nerve block. The study aims were 1) to replicate previous findings of acute pain demonstrating a fundamental role of the operculo-insular region and 2) to explore its functional connectivity during pain and subsequent relief. The brain activity reduction in the posterior insula (pINS) due to pain extinction was confirmed. In addition, the posterior S2 region (OP1) showed a similar activity pattern, thus confirming the relevance of the operculo-insular cortex in acute pain processing. Furthermore, the functional connectivity analysis yielded an enhanced positive coupling of the pINS with the cerebellar culmen during pain relief, whereas the OP1 demonstrated a positive coupling with the posterior midcingulate cortex during pain. The current results support the conceptual synthesis of localized specialization of pain processing with interactions across distributed neural targets.",

    "abstract": "The major component of complex genomes is repetitive elements, which remain recalcitrant to characterization. Using maize as a model system, we analyzed whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences for the two maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 using k-mer analysis to quantify the differences between the two genomes. Significant differences were identified in highly repetitive sequences, including centromere repeats, 45S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), knob, and telomere repeats. Previously unknown genotype specific 45S rDNA sequences were discovered. The B73-specific 45S rDNA is not only located on the nucleolus organizer region (NOR) on chromosome 6 but also dispersed on all the chromosomes in B73, indicating the relatively recent spread of 45S rDNA from the NOR. The B73 and Mo17 polymorphic k-mers were used to examine allele-specific expression of 45S rDNA. Although Mo17 contains higher copy number than B73, equivalent levels of overall 45S rDNA expression indicates that dosage compensation operates for the 45S rDNA in the hybrids. Using WGS sequences of B73xMo17 double haploids (DHs), genomic locations showing differential repetitive contents were genetically mapped. Analysis of WGS sequences of HapMap2 lines, including maize wild progenitor teosintes, landraces, and improved lines, decreases and increases in abundance of additional sets of k-mers associated with centromere repeats, 45S rDNA, knob, and retrotransposon sequences were found between teosinte and maize lines, revealing global evolutionary trends of genomic repeats during maize domestication and improvement.",

    "abstract": "Bean rust is a devastating disease of common bean in the Americas and Africa. The historically important Ur-3 gene confers resistance to many races of the highly variable bean rust pathogen that overcome all known rust resistance genes. Existing molecular markers tagging Ur-3 for use in marker assisted selection produce false results. We described here the fine mapping of Ur-3 for the development of highly accurate markers linked to this gene. An F2 population from Pinto 114 x Aurora was evaluated for its reaction to four different races of the bean rust pathogen. A bulked segregant analysis using the SNP chip BARCBEAN6K_3 positioned the approximate location of the Ur-3 locus to the lower arm of chromosome Pv11. Specific SSR and SNP markers and haplotype analysis of 18 sequenced bean lines led to position the Ur-3 locus to a 46.5 Kb genomic region. We discovered a KASP marker, SS68 that was tightly linked to the Ur-3 locus. Validation of SS68 on a panel of 130 diverse common bean lines and varieties containing all known rust resistance genes revealed that it was highly accurate producing no false results. The SS68 marker will be of great value to pyramid Ur-3 with other rust resistance genes. It will also reduce significantly time and labor associated with the current phenotypic detection of Ur-3. This is the first utilization of fine mapping to discover markers linked to a rust resistance in common bean.",

    "abstract": "The activation of the brain at rest is thought to be at the core of cognitive functions. There have been many attempts at characterizing the functional connectivity at rest from the structure. Recent attempts with diffusion kernel models point to the possibility of a single diffusion kernel that can give a good estimate of the functional connectivity. But our empirical investigations revealed that the hypothesis of a single scale best-fitting kernel across subjects is not tenable. Further, our experiments demonstrate that structure-function relationship across subjects seems to obey a multi-scale diffusion phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a multiple diffusion kernel model (MKL) along with a learning framework for estimating the optimal model parameters. We tested our hypothesis on 124 subjects data from publicly available NKI_Rockland database. The results establish the viability of the proposed model and also demonstrate several promising features as compared to the single kernel approach. One of the key strengths of the proposed approach is that it does not require hand-tuning of model parameters but actually learns them as part of the optimization process. The learned parameters may be suitable candidates for future investigation of their role in distinguishing health and disease.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate causal relationships between brain and behavior, investigators would like to guide brain stimulation using measurements of neural activity. Particularly promising in this context are electroen-cephalography (EEG) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), as they are linked by a reciprocity principle which, despite being known for decades, has not led to a formalism for relating EEG recordings to optimal stimulation parameters. Here we derive a closed-form expression for the TES configuration that optimally stimulates (i.e., targets) the sources of recorded EEG, without making assumptions about source location or distribution. We also derive a duality between TES targeting and EEG source localization, and demonstrate that in cases where source localization fails, so does the proposed targeting. Numerical simulations with realistic head models confirm these theoretical predictions and quantify the achieved stimulation in terms of focality and intensity. We show that constraining the stimulation currents automatically selects optimal montages that involve only a few (4-7) electrodes, with only incremental loss in performance. The proposed technique allows brain scientists and clinicians to rationally target the sources of observed EEG and thus overcomes a major obstacle to the realization of individualized or closed-loop brain stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Gene co-expression networks capture biologically important patterns in gene expression data, enabling functional analyses of genes, discovery of biomarkers, and interpretation of regulatory genetic variants. Most network analyses to date have been limited to assessing correlation between total gene expression levels in a single or small sets of tissues. Here, we have reconstructed networks that capture a much more complete set of regulatory relationships, specifically including regulation of relative isoform abundance and splicing, and tissue-specific connections unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA-sequencing data across 44 tissues in 449 individuals, we evaluated shared and tissue-specific network relationships. First, we developed a framework called Transcriptome Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse network, capturing the complex interplay between the regulation of splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for sixteen tissues, and found that hubs with isoform node neighbors in these networks were strongly enriched for splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome, and providing a set of candidate shared and tissue-specific regulatory hub genes. Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies network edges between genes with co-expression in a single tissue to reconstruct tissue-specific networks (TSNs) for 27 distinct GTEx tissues and for four subsets of related tissues. Using both TWNs and TSNs, we characterized gene co-expression patterns shared across tissues. Finally, we found genetic variants associated with multiple neighboring nodes in our networks, supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 33 genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription and splicing. Our networks provide an improved understanding of the complex relationships between genes in the human transcriptome, including tissue-specificity of gene co-expression, regulation of splicing, and the coordinated impact of genetic variation on transcription.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel statistical framework for integrating genetic data from molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping into genome-wide genetic association analysis of complex traits, with the primary objectives of quantitatively assessing the enrichment of the molecular QTLs in complex trait-associated genetic variants and the colocalizations of the two types of association signals. We introduce a natural Bayesian hierarchical model that treats the latent association status of molecular QTLs as SNP-level annotations for candidate SNPs for complex traits. We detail a computational procedure to seamlessly perform enrichment, fine-mapping and colocalization analyses, which is a distinct feature compared to the existing colocalization analysis procedures in the literature. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires only summary-level statistics. We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed computational approach through extensive simulation studies and the analysis of blood lipid data and the whole blood eQTL data from the GTEx project. In addition, a useful utility from our proposed method enables the computation of expected colocalization signals, which is analogous to the power calculation in genetic association studies. Using this utility, we further illustrate the importance of enrichment analysis on the ability of discovering colocalized signals and the potential limitations of currently available molecular QTL data.",
