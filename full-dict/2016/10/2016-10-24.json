    "abstract": "Consciousness never fades during wake. However, if awakened from sleep, sometimes we report dreams and sometimes no experiences. Traditionally, dreaming has been identified with REM sleep, characterized by a wake-like, globally  activated, high-frequency EEG. However, dreaming also occurs in NREM sleep, characterized by prominent low-frequency activity. This challenges our understanding of the neural correlates of conscious experiences in sleep. Using high-density EEG, we contrasted the presence and absence of dreaming within NREM and REM sleep. In both NREM and REM sleep, the presence of dreaming was associated with a local decrease in low-frequency activity in posterior cortical regions. High-frequency activity within these regions correlated with specific dream contents. Monitoring this posterior  hot zone predicted the presence/absence of dreaming during NREM sleep in real time, suggesting that it may constitute a core correlate of conscious experiences in sleep.",

Subsequently, six lines with contrasting phenotypes were selected for further characterization, including quantification of fungal colonization, mycorrhiza-mediated phosphorus uptake, and accumulation of transcripts encoding plant PHT1 family phosphate transporters.\\nC_LIO_LIThe relative growth of lines changed between non-inoculated and inoculated plants, indicative of variation in host capacity to profit from symbiosis.

    "abstract": "The visual system has the remarkable ability to integrate fragmentary visual input into a perceptually organized collection of surfaces and objects, a process we refer to as perceptual integration. Despite a long tradition of perception research, it is not known whether access to consciousness is required to complete perceptual integration. To investigate this question, we manipulated access to consciousness using the attentional blink. We show that behaviorally, the attentional blink impairs perceptual decisions about the presence of integrated surface structure from fragmented input. However, when applying a multivariate classifier to electroencephalogram (EEG) data, the ability to decode the presence of integrated percepts remains intact when conscious access is impaired. In contrast, when disrupting consciousness through masking, decisions about integrated percepts and decoding of integrated percepts are impaired in concert with each other, while leaving feedforward representations intact. Together, these data show a dissociation between access to consciousness and perceptual integration.\\n\\nSignificance statementOur brain constantly selects salient and/or goal-relevant objects from the visual environment, so that it can operate on neural representations of these objects. But what is the fate of objects that are not selected? Are these discarded, so that the brain only has an impoverished non-perceptual representation of them? Or does the brain construct perceptually rich representations, even when objects are not consciously accessed by our cognitive system? Here we answer that question by manipulating the information that enters into awareness, while simultaneously measuring cortical activity using EEG. We show that objects that do not enter consciousness can nevertheless have a neural signature that is indistinguishable from perceptually rich representations that occur for objects that do enter into conscious awareness.",

    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that some genes have originated de novo from previously non-coding genomic sequences. However, the processes underlying de novo gene birth are still enigmatic. In particular, the appearance of a new functional protein seems highly improbable unless there is already a pool of neutrally evolving peptides that can at some point acquire new functions. Here we show for the first time that such peptides do not only exist but that they are prevalent among the translation products of mouse genes that lack homologues in rat and human. The data suggests that the translation of these peptides is due to the chance occurrence of open reading frames with a favorable codon composition. Our approach combines ribosome profiling experiments, proteomics data and non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide polymorphism analysis. We propose that effectively neutral processes involving the expression of thousands of transcripts all the way down to proteins provide a basis for de novo gene evolution.",

    "abstract": "PREMISE OF THE STUDYNot only does leaf shape vary between Passiflora species, but between sequential nodes of the vine. The profound changes in leaf shape within Passiflora vines reflect the temporal development of the shoot apical meristem from which leaves are derived and patterned, a phenomenon known as heteroblasty.\\n\\nMETHODSWe perform a morphometric analysis of more than 3,300 leaves from 40 different Passiflora species using two different methods: homologous landmarks and Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs).\\n\\nKEY RESULTSChanges in leaf shape across the vine are first quantified in allometric terms; that is, changes in the relative area of leaf sub-regions expressed in terms of overall leaf area. Shape is constrained to strict linear relationships as a function of size that vary between species. Statistical analysis of leaf shape, using landmarks and EFDs, reveals that species effects are the strongest, followed by interaction effects, and negligible heteroblasty effects. The ability of different nodes to predictively discriminate species and the variability of landmark and EFD traits at each node is then analyzed. Heteroblastic trajectories, the changes in leaf shape between the first and last measured leaves in a vine, are then compared between species in a multivariate space.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONLeaf shape diversity among Passiflora species is expressed in a heteroblastic-dependent manner. Leaf shape is constrained by linear, allometric relationships related to leaf size that vary between species. There is a strong species x heteroblasty interaction effect for leaf shape, suggesting that different leaf shapes between species arise through changes in shape across nodes. The first leaves in the series are not only more like each other, but are also less variable across species. From this similar, shared leaf shape, subsequent leaves in the heteroblastic series follow divergent morphological trajectories. The disparate leaf shapes characteristic of Passiflora species arise from a shared, juvenile morphology.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDLeaf shape among Passiflora species is spectacularly diverse. Underlying this diversity in leaf shape are profound changes in the patterning of the primary vasculature and laminar outgrowth. Each of these aspects of leaf morphology--vasculature and blade--provides different insights into leaf patterning.\\n\\nRESULTSHere, we morphometrically analyze >3,300 leaves from 40 different Passiflora species collected sequentially across the vine. Each leaf is measured in two different ways: using 1) 15 homologous Procrustes-adjusted landmarks of the vasculature, sinuses, and lobes and 2) Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs), which quantify the outline of the leaf. The ability of landmarks, EFDs, and both datasets together are compared to determine their relative ability to predict species and node position within the vine. Pairwise correlation of x and y landmark coordinates and EFD harmonic coefficients reveals close associations between traits and insights into the relationship between vasculature and blade patterning.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSLandmarks, more reflective of the vasculature, and EFDs, more reflective of the blade contour, describe both similar and distinct features of leaf morphology. Landmarks and EFDs vary in ability to predict species identity and node position in the vine and exhibit a correlational structure (both within landmark or EFD traits and between the two data types) revealing constraints between vascular and blade patterning underlying natural variation in leaf morphology among Passiflora species.",

    "abstract": "Herbivore selection of plant hosts and plant responses to insect colonization have been subjects of intense investigations. A growing body of evidence suggests that for successful colonization to occur, (effector/virulence) proteins in insect saliva must modulate plant defense responses to the benefit of the insect. A range of insect saliva proteins that modulate plant defense responses have been identified, but there is no direct evidence that these proteins are delivered into specific plant tissues and enter plant cells. Aphids and other sap-sucking insects of the order Hemiptera use their specialized mouthparts (stylets) to probe plant mesophyll cells, until they reach the phloem cells for long-term feeding. Here we show by immunogold-labeling of ultrathin sections of aphid feeding sites that an immuno-suppressive aphid effector localizes in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells near aphid stylets, but not in cells further away from aphid feeding sites. In contrast, another aphid effector protein localizes in the sheaths composed of gelling saliva that surround the aphid stylets. Thus, insects deliver effectors directly into plant tissue. Moreover, different aphid effectors locate extracellularly in the sheath saliva or are introduced into the cytoplasm of plant cells.",

    "abstract": "The standard axiomatic theory of rationality posits that agents order preferences according to the average utilities associated with different choices. Expected Utility Theory has repeatedly failed as a predictive theory of choice behavior, as reflected in a growing literature in behavioral economics. Evolutionary theorists have suggested that seemingly irrational behaviors in contemporary contexts may have once served important functions, but there has been little attempt to formalize the relationship between evolutionary fitness and choice behavior. Biological agents should optimize fitness, but fitness itself is not a reasonable value function for decision-making since its time-scale exceeds the lifespan of the decision-maker. Consequently, organisms use proximate motivational systems that work on appropriate time-scales and are amenable to feedback and learning. We develop an evolutionary principal-agent model in which individuals maximize a set of proximal choice variables (age-specific demographic rates), the interests of which are aligned with fitness. The solution to our model yields pessimistic probability weightings compatible with the Rank-Dependent Expected Utility family of choice models. The pessimistic probability weighting characteristic of these models emerges naturally in an evolutionary framework because of extreme intolerance to zeros in multiplicative growth processes.",

One hypothesis states that oscillatory input creates cyclic integration windows: specific times in each oscillatory cycle when postsynaptic neurons become especially responsive to inputs. With paired local field potential (LFP) and intracellular recordings and controlled stimulus manipulations we directly tested this idea in the locust olfactory system. We found that inputs arriving in Kenyon cells (KCs) sum most effectively in a preferred window of the oscillation cycle. With a computational model, we found that the non-uniform structure of noise in the membrane potential helps mediate this process. Further experiments performed in vivo demonstrated that integration windows can form in the absence of inhibition and at a broad range of oscillation frequencies. Our results reveal how a fundamental coincidence-detection mechanism in a neural circuit functions to decode temporally organized spiking.",

We propose in this context, an ontology-based workflow extraction framework to acquire processual knowledge from texts. Our methodology extends classic NLP techniques to extract and disambiguate tasks in texts. Using a graph-based representation of workflows and a domain ontology, our extraction process uses a context-based approach to recognize workflow components : data and control flows.

An evaluation based on workflow semantic similarities on a gold standard proves that our approach provides promising results in the process extraction domain.

New specialized data skills need to be acquired by researchers in order to follow this development. Workflow Management Systems rise as an efficient way to automate tasks through abstract models in order to assist users during their problem solving tasks. However, current solutions could have several problems in reusing the developed models for given tasks. The large amount of heterogenous data and the lack of knowledge in using bioinformatics tools could mislead the users during their analyses. To tackle this issue, we propose an ontology-based workflow-mining framework generating semantic models of bioinformatic best practices in order to assist scientists. To this end, concrete workflows are extracted from scientific articles and then mined using a rich domain ontology.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we explore the specific topics of phylogenetic analyses. We annotated more than 300 recent articles using different ontological concepts and relations. Relative supports (frequencies) of discovered workflow components in texts show interesting results of relevant resources currently used in the different phylogenetic analysis steps. Mining concrete workflows from texts lead us to discover abstract but relevant patterns of the best combinations of tools, parameters and input data for specific phylogenetic problems.\\n\\nConclusionsExtracted patterns would make workflows more intuitive and easy to be reused in similar situations. This could provide a stepping-stone into the identification of best practices and pave the road to a recommender system.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAdvances in cloning and sequencing technology yielded a massive number of genome of virus strains. The classification and annotation of these genomes constitute important assets in the discovery of genomic variability, taxonomic characteristics and disease mechanisms. Existing classification methods are often designed for a well-studied virus. Thus, the viral comparative genomic studies could benefit from more generic, fast and accurate tools for classifying and typing newly sequenced strains of diverse virus families.\\n\\nResultsHere, we introduce a fast, accurate and generic virus classification platform, CASTOR, based on a machine learning approach. CASTOR is inspired by a well-known technique in molecular biology: Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). It simulates the restriction digestion of genomic material by different enzymes into fragments in-silico. It uses two metrics to construct feature vectors for machine learning algorithms in the classification step. We benchmark CASTOR for the classification of distinct datasets of Human Papillomaviruses (HPV), Hepatitis B Viruses (HBV) and Human Immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). Results reveal true positive rates of 99%, 99% and 98% for HPV Alpha species, HBV genotyping and HIV M group subtyping respectively. Furthermore, CASTOR shows a competitive performance compare to well-known HIV-specific classifier REGA and COMET on whole genome and pol fragments. With such prediction rates, genericity and robustness, as well as rapidity, such approach could constitute a reference in large-scale virus studies. Finally, we developed the CASTOR web platform for open access and reproducible viral machine learning classifiers.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://castor.bioinfo.uqam.ca\\n\\nContactdiallo.abdoulaye@uqam.ca",

    "abstract": "Type IVa pili are protein filaments essential for virulence in many bacterial pathogens; they extend and retract from the surface of bacterial cells to pull the bacteria forward with unprecedented force. They are used for attachment, swarming and twitching motility, biofilm formation, up-regulation of other virulence factors, and natural competence. The pilus is assembled by the motor subcomplex which consists of the inner membrane protein PilC and the cytoplasmic ATPase PilB. How PilB catalyzes this process is unknown, due in part to the lack of high-resolution structural information. Phylogenetic analysis of PilB-like ATPases, including GspE, PilT, BfpD, FlaI, and archaeal GspE2 revealed highly conserved residues essential for function in this family of ATPases. Here we report the structure of the core ATPase domains of Geobacter metalloreducens PilB bound to ADP and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, AMPPNP, at 3.4 and 2.3[A], respectively. Importantly, these structures were determined in non-saturating nucleotide conditions, revealing important differences in nucleotide binding between chains. Analysis of these differences revealed the sequential turnover of nucleotide by the chains, and the corresponding domain movements. Our data indicate a clockwise rotation of movement in PilB, which would support the assembly of a right-handed helical pilus. Conversely, our analysis suggests a counterclockwise rotation in PilT that would enable right-handed pilus disassembly. The proposed model provides insight into how this family of ATPases can power pilus extension and retraction with extraordinary forces.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is widely considered to be the neurobiological basis of learning and memory by neuroscientists and researchers in adjacent fields, though diverging opinions are increasingly being recognised. From the perspective of what we might call \\\"classical cognitive science\\\" it has always been understood that the mind/brain is to be considered a computational-representational system. Proponents of the information-processing approach to cognitive science have long been critical of connectionist or network approaches to (neuro-)cognitive architecture, pointing to the shortcomings of the associative psychology that underlies Hebbian learning as well as to the fact that synapses are practically unfit to implement symbols. Recent work on memory has been adding fuel to the fire and current findings in neuroscience now provide first tentative neurobiological evidence for the cognitive scientists doubts about the synapse as the (sole) locus of memory in the brain. This paper briefly considers the history and appeal of synaptic plasticity as a memory mechanism, followed by a summary of the cognitive scientists objections regarding these assertions. Next, a variety of tentative neuroscientific evidence that appears to substantiate questioning the idea of the synapse as the locus of memory is presented. On this basis, a novel way of thinking about the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory is proposed.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we demonstrated that miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) are constitutive and their expression profiles depend on tissue, tissue state, and disease subtype. We have now extended our isomiR studies to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository. Specifically, we studied whether isomiR profiles can distinguish amongst the 32 cancers. We analyzed 10,271 datasets from 32 cancers and found 7,466 isomiRs from 807 miRNA hairpin-arms to be expressed above threshold. Using the top 20% most abundant isomiRs, we built a classifier that relied on \\\"binary\\\" isomiR profiles: isomiRs were simply represented as  present or  absent and, unlike previous methods, all knowledge about their expression levels was ignored. The classifier could label tumor samples with an average sensitivity of 93% and a False Discovery Rate of 3%. Notably, its ability to classify well persisted even when we reduced the set of used features (=isomiRs) by a factor of 10. A counterintuitive finding of our analysis is that the isomiRs and miRNA loci with the highest ability to classify tumors are not the ones that have been attracting the most research attention in the miRNA field. Our results provide a framework in which to study cancer-type-specific isomiRs and explore their potential uses as cancer biomarkers",

    "abstract": "Selection for yellow and white grain types has been central to post-domestication improvement of maize. While genetic control of carotenoid biosynthesis in endosperm is attributed primarily to the Yellow1 (Y1) phytoene synthase gene, less is known about the role of the dominant white endosperm factor White Cap (Wc). We show that the Wc locus contains multiple, tandem copies of a Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (Ccd1) gene that encodes a carotenoid-degrading enzyme. A survey of 111 maize inbreds and landraces, together with 21 teosinte accessions reveals that Wc is exclusive to maize, where it is prevalent in white-grain (y1) varieties. Moreover, Ccd1 copy number varies extensively among Wc alleles (from 1 to 23 copies), and confers a proportional range of Ccd1 expression in diverse organs. We propose that this dynamic source of quantitative variation in Ccd1 expression was created in maize shortly after domestication by a two-step, Tam3L transposon-mediated process. First, a chromosome segment containing Ccd1 and several nearby genes duplicated at a position 1.9 Mb proximal to the progenitor Ccd1r locus on chromosome 9. Second, a subsequent interaction of Tam3L transposons at the new locus created a 28-kb tandem duplication, setting up expansion of Ccd1 copy number by unequal crossing over. In this way, transposon-mediated variation in copy number at the Wc locus created phenotypic variation that provided a foundation for breeding and selection of white grain color in maize.",

Eighteen percent of the tumors were p16 positive. and only 6% were both HPV DNA and RNA positive. Most tumors with relatively high-copy HPV DNA, and/or HPV RNA, but not with HPV DNA alone (irrespective of copy number), were wild-type for TP53 and CASP8 genes. In our study, p16 protein, HPV DNA and HPV RNA, either alone or in combinations, did not correlate with patient survival. Nine HPV-associated genes stratified the virus +ve from the -ve tumor group with high confidence (p<0.008) when HPV DNA copy number and/or HPV RNA were considered to define HPV positivity and not HPV DNA alone irrespective of their copy number (p < 0.2).\\n\\nConclusionsIn OSCC, the presence of both HPV RNA and p16 are rare.

The region shows high conservation between human and mouse and contains multiple MYC enhancers that are activated in tumor cells. However, the role of this region in normal development has not been addressed. Here we show that a 538 kb deletion of the entire MYC upstream super-enhancer region in mice results in 50 to 80% decrease in MYC expression in multiple tissues. The mice are viable and show no overt phenotype. However, they are resistant to tumorigenesis, and most normal cells isolated from them grow slowly in culture. Consistently, deletion of the 8q24 super-enhancer region perturbs Myc targets only in cultured cells, but not in vivo. These results reveal that only cells whose Myc activity is increased by serum or oncogenic driver mutations depend on the 8q24 super-enhancer region, and indicate that targeting the activity of this element is a promising strategy of cancer chemoprevention and therapy.",

Hypersensitivity to DNase I cleavage has long been used to gauge the accessibility of genomic DNA for transcription factor binding and as an indicator of regulatory genomic locations. An increasing amount of ChIP-seq data on a large number of TFs is being generated, mostly in a small number of cell types. DNase-seq data are being produced for hundreds of cell types. We aimed to develop a computational method that could combine ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data to predict TF binding sites in a wide variety of cell types. We trained and tested a logistic regression model, called LR-DNase, to predict binding sites for a specific TF using seven features derived from DNase-seq and genomic sequence. We calculated the area under the precision-recall curve at a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.5 for the LR-DNase model, a number of logistic regression models with fewer features, and several existing state-of-the-art TF binding prediction methods. The LR-DNase model outperformed existing unsupervised and supervised methods. Additionally, for many TFs, a model that uses only two features, DNase-seq reads and motif score, was sufficient to match the performance of the best existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Interpretation of high-throughput genomics data based on biological pathways constitutes a constant challenge, partly because of the lack of supporting pathway database. In this study, we created a functional genomics knowledgebase in mouse, which includes 33,261 pathways and gene sets compiled from 40 sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG, GeneSetDB, PANTHER, microRNA and transcription factor target genes, etc. In addition, we also manually collected and curated 8,747 lists of differentially expressed genes from 2,526 published gene expression studies to enable the detection of similarity to previously reported gene expression signatures. These two types of data constitute a Gene Set Knowledgebase (GSKB), which can be readily used by various pathway analysis software such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Using our knowledgebase, we were able to detect the correct microRNA (miR-29) pathway that was suppressed using antisense oligonucleotides and confirmed its role in inhibiting fibrogenesis, which might involve upregulation of transcription factor SMAD3. The knowledgebase can be queried as a source of published gene lists for further meta-analysis. Through meta-analysis of 56 published gene lists related to retina cells, we revealed two fundamentally different types of gene expression changes. One is related to stress and inflammatory response blamed for causing blindness in many diseases; the other associated with visual perception by normal retina cells. GSKB is available online at http://ge-lab.org/gs/, and also as a Bioconductor package (gskb, https://bioconductor.org/packages/gskb/).

The DI is the ratio between the number of TE insertions in a genome and its size, whereas the RRS is a conditional parameter designed to identify potential speciation bursts. Thus, by analyzing TEs insertions in mammals, we defined the genomes as \\\"hot\\\" (low DI) and \\\"cold\\\" (high DI). Then, comparing TEs activity among 16 intra-order pairs of mammalian species, 4 superorders of Eutheria and 29 taxonomical families of the whole Mammalia class, we showed that taxa with positive RRS correlate with \\\"hot\\\" genomes, whereas taxa with negative RRS correlate with \\\"cold\\\" genomes.

Here, we develop and validate QuickStitch, a tool that applies a recursive normalization algorithm to stitch large-scale immunofluorescence-based mosaics without incurring vignetting seams. We demonstrate how the tool works successfully for tissues of differing size, morphology, and fluorescence intensity. QuickStitch requires no specific information about the imaging system. It is provided as an open-source tool that is both user friendly and extensible, allowing straightforward incorporation into existing image processing pipelines.

We further argue that energy conservation is not a reliable measure of accuracy.

    "abstract": "When an item is predicted in a particular context but the prediction is violated, memory for that item is weakened (Kim et al., 2014). Here we explore what happens when such previously mispredicted items are later re-encountered. According to prior neural network simulations, this sequence of events - misprediction and subsequent restudy - should lead to differentiation of the item's neural representation from the previous context (on which the misprediction was based). Specifically, misprediction weakens connections in the representation to features shared with the previous context, and restudy allows new features to be incorporated into the representation that are not shared with the previous context. This cycle of misprediction and restudy should have the net effect of moving the item s neural representation away from the neural representation of the previous context. We tested this hypothesis using fMRI, by tracking changes in item-specific BOLD activity patterns in the hippocampus, a key structure for representing memories and generating predictions. In left CA2/3/DG, we found greater neural differentiation for items that were repeatedly mispredicted and restudied compared to items from a control condition that was identical except without misprediction. We also measured prediction strength in a trial-by-trial fashion and found that greater misprediction for an item led to more differentiation, further supporting our hypothesis. Thus, the consequences of prediction error go beyond memory weakening: If the mispredicted item is restudied, the brain adaptively differentiates its memory representation to improve the accuracy of subsequent predictions and to shield it from further weakening.\\n\\nSignificanceCompetition between overlapping memories leads to weakening of non-target memories over time, making it easier to access target memories. However, a non-target memory in one context might become a target memory in another context. How do such memories get re-strengthened without increasing competition again? Computational models suggest that the brain handles this by reducing neural connections to the previous context and adding connections to new features that were not part of the previous context. The result is neural differentiation away from the previous context. Here provide support for this theory, using fMRI to track neural representations of individual memories in the hippocampus and how they change based on learning.",

However, the precise means by which p53 dynamically interacts with TFIID to facilitate assembly on target gene promoters remains elusive. To address this key question, we have undertaken an integrated approach involving single molecule fluorescence microscopy, single particle cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemistry. Our real-time single molecule imaging demonstrates that TFIID alone binds poorly to native p53 target promoters. p53 unlocks TFIIDs ability to bind DNA by increasing TFIID contacts with both the core promoter and a region surrounding p53s response element (RE). Analysis of single molecule dissociation kinetics reveals that TFIID interacts with promoters via transient and prolonged DNA binding modes that are each regulated by p53. Importantly, our structural work reveals that TFIIDs conversion from a canonical form to a rearranged DNA-binding conformation is enhanced in the presence of DNA and p53. Notably, TFIIDs interaction with DNA induces p53 to rapidly dissociate, effectively liberating the RE on the promoter. Collectively, these findings indicate that p53 dynamically escorts and loads the basal transcription machinery onto its target promoters.",

    "abstract": "Populations of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) are typically structured into groups of closely related organisms or lineages, but it is not clear whether they are maintained by selection or neutral processes. Here, we attempt to address this question by applying a machine learning technique to SP whole genomes. Our results indicate that lineages evolved through immune selection on the groEL chaperone protein. The groEL protein is part of the groESL operon and enables a large range of proteins to fold correctly within the physical environment of the nasopharynx, thereby explaining why lineage structure is so stable within SP despite high levels of genetic transfer. SP is also antigenically diverse, exhibiting a variety of distinct capsular serotypes. Associations exist between lineage and capsular serotype but these can be easily perturbed, such as by vaccination. Overall, our analyses indicate that the evolution of SP can be conceptualized as the rearrangement of modular functional units occurring on several different timescales under different pressures: some patterns have locked in early (such as the epistatic interactions between groESL and a constellation of other genes) and preserve the differentiation of lineages, while others (such as the associations between capsular serotype and lineage) remain in continuous flux.",

    "abstract": "Studying the stem cell niche architecture is a crucial step for investigating the process of oncogenesis and obtaining an effective stem cell therapy for various cancers. Recently, it has been observed that there are two groups of stem cells in the stem cell niche collaborating with each other to maintain tissue homeostasis. One group comprises the border stem cells, which is responsible to control the number of non-stem cells as well as stem cells. The other group, central stem cells, regulates the stem cell niche. In the present study, we develop a bi-compartmental stochastic model for the stem cell niche to study the spread of mutants within the niche. The analytic calculations and numeric simulations, which are in perfect agreement, reveal that in order to delay the spread of mutants in the stem cell niche, a small but non-zero number of stem cell proliferations must occur in the central stem cell compartment. Moreover, the migration of border stem cells to the central stem cell compartment delays the spread of mutants. Furthermore, the fixation probability of mutants in the stem cell niche is independent of types of stem cell division as long as all stem cells do not divide fully asymmetrically. Additionally, the progeny of central stem cells have a much higher chance than the progeny of border stem cells to take over the entire niche.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition is a key aspect of neural dynamics playing a fundamental role for the emergence of neural rhythms and the implementation of various information coding strategies. Inhibitory populations are present in several brain structures and the comprehension of their dynamics is strategical for the understanding of neural processing. In this paper, we clarify the mechanisms underlying a general phenomenon present in pulse-coupled heterogeneous inhibitory networks: inhibition can induce not only suppression of the neural activity, as expected, but it can also promote neural reactivation. In particular, for globally coupled systems, the number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength of inhibition (neurons death). However, the random pruning of the connections is able to reverse the action of inhibition, i.e. in a sparse network a sufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote, rather than depress, the activity of the neurons (neurons rebirth). Thus the number of firing neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength. We show that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the neurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are effectively sub-threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current fluctuations. We explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic mean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active neurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics. The introduction of a synaptic time scale does not modify the main aspects of the reported phenomenon. However, for sufficiently slow synapses the transition becomes dramatic, the system passes from a perfectly regular evolution to an irregular bursting dynamics. In this latter regime the model provides predictions consistent with experimental findings for a specific class of neurons, namely the medium spiny neurons in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Phylodynamic models are widely used in infectious disease epidemiology to infer the dynamics and structure of pathogen populations. However, these models generally assume that individual hosts contact one another at random, ignoring the fact that many pathogens spread through highly structured contact networks. We present a new framework for phylodynamics on local contact networks based on pairwise epidemiological models that track the status of pairs of nodes in the network rather than just individuals. Shifting our focus from individuals to pairs leads naturally to coalescent models that describe how lineages move through networks and the rate at which lineages coalesce. These pairwise coalescent models not only consider how network structure directly shapes pathogen phylogenies, but also how the relationship between phylogenies and contact networks changes depending on epidemic dynamics and the fraction of infected hosts sampled. By considering pathogen phylogenies in a probabilistic framework, these coalescent models can also be used to estimate the statistical properties of contact networks directly from phylogenies using likelihood-based inference. We use this framework to explore how much information phylogenies retain about the underlying structure of contact networks and to infer the structure of a sexual contact network underlying a large HIV-1 sub-epidemic in Switzerland.",

Organogenesis often starts with the formation of characteristically shaped organ precursors. However, the cellular mechanisms driving organ precursor formation are often not clear. Here, using zebrafish, we investigate the epithelial rearrangements responsible for the development of the hemispherical retinal neuroepithelium (RNE), a part of the optic cup. We show that in addition to basal shrinkage of RNE cells, active migration of connected epithelial cells into the RNE is a crucial player in its formation. This cellular movement is driven by progressive cell-matrix contacts and actively translocates prospective RNE cells to their correct location before they adopt neuroepithelial fate. Failure of this migration during neuroepithelium formation leads to ectopic determination of RNE cells and consequently impairs optic cup formation. Overall, this study illustrates how spatiotemporal coordination between morphogenic movements and fate determination critically influences organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoiesis is one of the best characterized biological systems but the connection between chromatin changes and lineage differentiation is not yet well understood. We have developed a bioinformatic workflow to generate a chromatin space that allows to classify forty-two human healthy blood epigenomes from the BLUEPRINT, NIH ROADMAP and ENCODE consortia by their cell type. This approach let us to distinguish different cells types based on their epigenomic profiles, thus recapitulating important aspects of human hematopoiesis. The analysis of the orthogonal dimension of the chromatin space identify 32,662 chromatin determinant regions (CDRs), genomic regions with different epigenetic characteristics between the cell types. Functional analysis revealed that these regions are linked with cell identities. The inclusion of leukemia epigenomes in the healthy hematological chromatin sample space gives us insights on the healthy cell types that are more epigenetically similar to the disease samples. Further analysis of tumoral epigenetic alterations in hematopoietic CDRs points to sets of genes that are tightly regulated in leukemic transformations and commonly mutated in other tumors. Our method provides an analytical approach to study the relationship between epigenomic changes and cell lineage differentiation. Method availability: https://github.com/david-juan/ChromDet",

    "abstract": "All charismatic big cats including tiger (Panthera tigris), lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), snow leopard (Panthera uncial), and jaguar (Panthera onca) are grouped into the subfamily Pantherinae. Several mitogenomic approaches have been employed to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the Pantherine cats but the phylogeny has remained largely unresolved till date. One of the major reasons for the difficulty in resolving the phylogenetic tree of Pantherine cats is the small sample size. While previous studies included only 5-10 samples, we have used 43 publically available taxa to reconstruct Pantherine phylogenetic history. Complete mtDNA sequences were used from all individuals excluding the control region (15,489bp). A Bayesian MCMC approach was employed to investigate the divergence times among different Pantherine clades. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny generated a dendrogram: Neofelis nebulosa (Panthera tigris (Panthera onca (Panthera uncia (Panthera leo, Panthera pardus)))), grouping lions with leopards and placing snow leopards as an outgroup to this clade. The phylogeny revealed that lions split from their sister species leopard ~3 Mya and the divergence time between snow leopards and the clade including lions and leopards was estimated to be ~5 Mya. Our study revealed that the morphology-based subspecies designation for both lions and tigers is largely not valid. The estimated tMRCA of 2.9 Mya between Barbary lions and Sub-Saharan African lions depicts the restriction of female-mediated gene flow between the lion populations in the backdrop of the habitat fragmentation taking place from late Pliocene to early to mid-Pleistocene creating islands of forest refugia in central Africa.",

    "abstract": "The primary electrophysiological marker of feature-based selection is the N2pc, a lateralized posterior negativity emerging around 180-200 ms. As it relies on hemispheric differences, its ability to discriminate the locus of focal attention is severely limited. Here we demonstrate that multivariate analyses of raw EEG data provide a much more fine-grained spatial profile of feature-based target selection. When training a pattern classifier to determine target position from EEG, we were able to decode target positions on the vertical midline, which cannot be achieved using standard N2pc methodology. Next, we used a forward encoding model to construct a channel tuning function that describes the continuous relationship between target position and multivariate EEG in an eight-position display. This model can spatially discriminate individual target positions in these displays and is fully invertible, enabling us to construct hypothetical topographic activation maps for target positions that were never used. When tested against the real pattern of neural activity obtained from a different group of subjects, the constructed maps from the forward model turned out statistically indistinguishable, thus providing independent validation of our model. Our findings demonstrate the power of multivariate EEG analysis to track feature-based target selection with high spatial and temporal precision.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFeature-based attentional selection enables observers to find objects in their visual field. The spatiotemporal profile of this process is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological methods, which rely on activity differences between cerebral hemispheres. We demonstrate that multivariate analyses of EEG data can track target selection across the visual field with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using a forward model, we were able to capture the continuous relationship between target position and EEG measurements, allowing us to reconstruct the distribution of cortical activity for target locations that were never shown during the experiment. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a temporally and spatially precise EEG signal that can be used to study the neural basis of feature-based attentional selection.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth and division are processes vital to the proliferation and development of life. Coordination between these two processes has been recognized for decades in a variety of organisms. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this coordination or  size control appears as an inverse correlation between cell size and the rate of cell-cycle progression, routinely observed in G1 prior to cell division commitment. Beyond this point, cells are presumed to complete S/G2/M at similar rates and in a size-independent manner. As such, studies of dependence between growth and division have focused on G1. Moreover, coordination between growth and division has commonly been analyzed within the cycle of a single cell without accounting for correlations in growth and division characteristics between cycles of related cells. In a comprehensive analysis of three published time-lapse microscopy datasets, we analyze both intra-and inter-cycle dependencies between growth and division, revisiting assumptions about the coordination between these two processes. Interestingly, we find evidence (1) that S/G2/M durations are systematically longer in daughters than in mothers, (2) of dependencies between S/G2/M and size at budding that echo the classical G1 dependencies, and, (3) in contrast with recent bacterial studies, of negative dependencies between size at birth and size accumulated during the cell cycle. In addition, we develop a novel hierarchical model to uncover inter-cycle dependencies, and we find evidence for such dependencies in cells growing in sugar-poor environments. Our analysis highlights the need for experimentalists and modelers to account for new sources of cell-to-cell variation in growth and division, and our model provides a formal statistical framework for the continued study of dependencies between biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Given the limited effectiveness of strategies based solely on vector control to reduce dengue virus (DENV) transmission, it is expected that an effective vaccine could play a pivotal role in reducing the global disease burden of dengue. Of several dengue vaccines under development, Dengvaxia(R) from Sanofi Pasteur recently became the first to become licensed in select countries and to achieve WHO recommendation for use in certain settings, despite the fact that a number of uncertainties about its profile complicate projections of its public health impact. We used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission to perform simulations of the public health impact of dengue vaccines in light of two key uncertainties: (1) \\\"statistical uncertainty\\\" about the numerical value of the vaccines efficacy against disease, and (2) \\\"biological uncertainty\\\" about the extent to which its efficacy against disease derives from the amelioration of symptoms, blocking of DENV infection, or some combination thereof. Simulations of a generic dengue vaccine showed that the proportion of disease episodes averted following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year olds at 80% coverage was sensitive to both the numerical value of vaccine efficacy and to the extent to which efficacy derives from blocking of DENV infection. Simulations of a vaccine resembling Dengvaxia(R) took into account that vaccine trial results substantially reduced statistical uncertainty but did not address biological uncertainty, resulting in the proportion of disease episodes averted being more sensitive to biological uncertainty than to statistical uncertainty. Taken together, our results indicate limitations associated with the use of symptomatic disease as the primary endpoint of dengue vaccine trials and highlight the importance of considering multiple forms of uncertainty in projections of a vaccines public health impact.",
