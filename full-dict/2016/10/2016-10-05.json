    "abstract": "When visual features in the periphery are close together they become difficult to recognise: something is present but it is unclear what. This is called \\\"crowding\\\". Here we investigated sensitivity to features in highly familiar shapes (letters) by applying spatial distortions. In Experiment 1, observers detected which of four peripherally-presented (8 deg of retinal eccentricity) target letters was distorted (spatial 4AFC). The letters were presented either isolated or surrounded by four undistorted flanking letters, and distorted with one of two types of distortion at a range of distortion frequencies and amplitudes. The bandpass noise distortion (\\\"BPN\\\") technique causes spatial distortions in cartesian space, whereas radial frequency distortion (\\\"RF\\\") causes shifts in polar coordinates. Detecting distortions in target letters was more difficult in the presence of flanking letters, consistent with the effect of crowding. The BPN distortion type showed evidence of tuning, with sensitivity to distortions peaking at approximately 6.5 c/deg for un-flanked letters. The presence of flanking letters causes this peak to rise to approximately 8.5 c/deg. In contrast to the tuning observed for BPN distortions, RF distortion sensitivity increased as the radial frequency of distortion increased. In a series of follow-up experiments we found that sensitivity to distortions is reduced when flanking letters were also distorted, that this held when observers were required to report which target letter was undistorted, and that this held when flanker distortions were always detectable. The perception of geometric distortions in letter stimuli is impaired by visual crowding.",

    "abstract": "The opsin gene family encodes key proteins animals use to sense light and has expanded dramatically since it originated early in animal evolution. Understanding the origins of opsin diversity can offer clues to how separate lineages of animals have repurposed different opsin paralogs for different light-detecting functions. However, the more we look for opsins outside of eyes and from additional animal phyla, the more opsins we uncover, suggesting we still do not know the true extent of opsin diversity, nor the ancestry of opsin diversity in animals. To estimate the number of opsin paralogs present in both the last common ancestor of the Nephrozoa (bilaterians excluding Xenoacoelomorpha), and the ancestor of Cnidaria + Bilateria, we reconstructed a reconciled opsin phylogeny using sequences from 14 animal phyla, especially the traditionally poorly-sampled echinoderms and molluscs. Our analysis strongly supports a repertoire of at least nine opsin paralogs in the bilaterian ancestor and at least four opsin paralogs in the last common ancestor of Cnidaria + Bilateria. Thus, the kernels of extant opsin diversity arose much earlier in animal history than previously known. Further, opsins likely duplicated and were lost many times, with different lineages of animals maintaining different repertoires of opsin paralogs. This phylogenetic information can inform hypotheses about the functions of different opsin paralogs and be used to understand how and when opsins were incorporated into complex traits like eyes and extraocular sensors.",

    "abstract": "Speciation results from the progressive accumulation of mutations that decrease the probability of mating between parental populations, or reduce the fitness of hybrids - the so-called species barriers. The speciation genomic literature, however, is mainly a collection of case studies, each with its own approach and specificities, such that a global view of the gradual process of evolution from one to two species is currently lacking. Of primary importance is the prevalence of gene flow between diverging entities, which is central in most species concepts, and has been widely discussed in recent years. Here we explore the continuum of speciation thanks to a comparative analysis of genomic data from 61 pairs of populations/species of animals with variable levels of divergence. Gene flow between diverging gene pools is assessed under an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We show that the intermediate \\\"grey zone\\\" of speciation, in which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from 0.5% to 2% of net synonymous divergence, irrespective of species life-history traits or ecology. Thanks to appropriate modeling of among-loci variation in genetic drift and introgression rate, we clarify the status of the majority of ambiguous cases and uncover a number of cryptic species. Our analysis also reveals the high incidence in animals of semi-isolated species, when some but not all loci are affected by barriers to gene flow, and highlights the intrinsic difficulty, both statistical and conceptual, of delineating species in the grey zone of speciation.",

When auditory stimuli are absent, A1 becomes hyperactive, while A1 responses to auditory stimuli are reduced. Such activation pattern of A1 responses during auditory hallucination is consistent with aberrant gamma rhythms in schizophrenia observed during auditory tasks, raising the possibility that the pathology underlying abnormal gamma rhythms can account for auditory hallucination. Moreover, A1 receives top-down signals in the gamma frequency band from an adjacent association area (Par2), and cholinergic modulation regulates interactions between A1 and Par2. In this study, we utilized a computational model of A1 to ask if disrupted cholinergic modulation could underlie abnormal gamma rhythms in schizophrenia. Furthermore, based on our simulation results, we propose potential pathology by which A1 can directly contribute to auditory hallucination.",

Using data from young adults born with very low birth weight and coetaneous controls, it is demonstrated that the permutation-based non-parametric combination (NPC) of thickness and area is more sensitive than volume for studying joint effects on these two quantities, giving equal weight to variation in both. NPC can replace current analyses of cortical volume altogether, allowing a better characterisation of processes that can concomitantly influence brain anatomy, even when their effects are in opposite directions. The method is remarkably general and can be extended to other indices of brain structure and function.",

We therefore characterized the activity of cerebellar neurons in awake mice engaged in a locomotion task, using high-density silicon electrode arrays. We characterized the activity of over 300 neurons in response to locomotion, finding tuning to speed of locomotion, turning, and phase of the step cycle. We found that the cerebellar neurons we recorded mainly encoded information about future locomotor activity. We were able to decode the speed of locomotion with a simple linear algorithm, needing relatively few well-chosen cells to provide an accurate estimate of locomotion speed. Our observation that cerebellar neuronal activity predicts locomotion in the near future, and encodes the required kinematic variables, points to this activity underlying the efference copy signal for vertebrate locomotion.",

To better understand the colonization history and role that genetic diversity might have played in the founding and radiation of these new populations, we characterized ancestry and genetic diversity across latitude (39-48{degrees}S). Samples from four distant basins in Chile were genotyped for 13 microsatellite loci, and allocated, through probabilistic mixture models, to 148 potential donor populations in North America representing 46 distinct genetic lineages. Patagonian Chinook salmon clearly had a diverse and heterogeneous ancestry. Lineages from the Lower Columbia River were introduced for salmon open-ocean ranching in the late 1970s and 1980s, and were prevalent south of 43{degrees}S. In the north, however, a diverse assembly of lineages was found, associated with net-pen aquaculture during the 1990s. Finally, we showed that possible lineage admixture in the introduced range can confound allocations inferred from mixture models, a caveat previously overlooked in studies of this kind. While we documented high genetic and lineage diversity in expanding Patagonian populations, the degree to which diversity drives adaptive potential remains unclear. Our new understanding of diversity across latitude will guide future research.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel hybrid modelling framework that takes into account two aspects which have been largely neglected in previous models of spatial evolutionary games: random motion and chemotaxis. A stochastic individual-based model is used to describe the player dynamics, whereas the evolution of the chemoattractant is governed by a reaction-diffusion equation. The two models are coupled by deriving individual movement rules via the discretisation of a taxis-diffusion equation which describes the evolution of the local number of players. In this framework, individuals occupying the same position can engage in a two-player game, and are awarded a payoff, in terms of reproductive fitness, according to their strategy. As an example, we let individuals play the Hawk-Dove game. Numerical simulations illustrate how random motion and chemotactic response can bring about self-generated dynamical patterns that create favourable conditions for the coexistence of hawks and doves in situations in which the two strategies cannot coexist otherwise. In this sense, our work offers a new perspective of research on spatial evolutionary games, and provides a general formalism to study the dynamics of spatially-structured populations in biological and social contexts where individual motion is likely to affect natural selection of behavioural traits.",

    "abstract": "Driven by massively parallel sequencing and allied technologies, the scale of genetic predisposition testing is on a dramatic uptrend. While many patients are found to carry clinically actionable pathogenic sequence variants, testing also reveals enormous numbers of Unclassified Variants (UV), or Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), most of which are rare missense substitutions. Following IARC variant classification guidelines, quantitative methods have been developed to integrate multiple data types for clinical UV evaluation in BRCA1/2; results from these analyses are recorded in the BRCA gene Ex-UV database (hci-exlovd.hci.utah.edu). In variant classification, the rate-limiting step is often accumulation of patient observational data. Recently, functional assays evaluating BRCA1 RING domain and C-terminal substitutions have been calibrated, enabling variant classification through a two-component combination of sequence analysis-based predictions with functional assay results. This two-component classification was embedded in a decision tree with safeguards to avoid misclassification. For the two-component analysis, sensitivity is 87.5%, specificity is 100%, and the error rate 0.0%. Classification of a UV as likely pathogenic or likely neutral does not require certainty; the probabilistic definitions of the categories imply an error rate. Combining sequence analysis with functional assay data in two-component analysis added 146 BRCA1 variants to the Ex-UV database.",

    "abstract": "Saccadic eye movements cause rapid retinal-image shifts that go perceptually unnoticed several times per second. The mechanisms for perceptual saccadic suppression have been controversial, in part due to sparse understanding of neural substrates. Here we uncovered an unexpectedly specific neural locus for saccadic suppression in the primate superior colliculus (SC). We first developed a sensitive behavioral measure of perceptual suppression in two male macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), demonstrating known selectivity to low spatial frequencies. We then investigated visual responses in either purely visual SC neurons or anatomically-deeper visual-motor neurons, which are also involved in saccade generation commands. Surprisingly, visual-motor neurons showed the strongest visual suppression, and the suppression was dependent on spatial frequency like in perception. Most importantly, visual-motor neuron suppression selectivity was highly predictive of behavioral suppression effects in each individual animal, with our recorded population explaining up to ~74% of behavioral variance even on completely different experimental sessions. In contrast, purely visual SC neurons only had mild and unselective suppression (only explaining up to ~48% of behavioral variance). These results run contrary to a hypothesized SC mechanism for saccadic suppression, in which a motor command in the visual-motor and motor neurons is relayed to the more superficial purely visual neurons to suppress them, and to then potentially be fed back to cortex. Instead, our results indicate that an extra-retinal modulatory signal mediating perceptual suppression is already established in visual-motor neurons.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthySaccades, which repeatedly re-align the line of sight, introduce spurious signals in retinal images that normally go unnoticed. In part, this happens because of peri-saccadic suppression of visual sensitivity. Here we discovered that a specific sub-type of superior colliculus (SC) neurons may play a critical role in saccadic suppression. Curiously, it is the neurons that help mediate the saccadic command itself that exhibit perceptually-relevant changes in visual sensitivity, not the previously hypothesized purely visual neurons.",

    "abstract": "Various models describe asexual evolution by mutation, selection and drift. Some focus directly on fitness, typically modelling drift but ignoring or simplifying both epistasis and the distribution of mutation effects (travelling wave models). Others follow the dynamics of quantitative traits determining fitness (Fishers geometrical model), imposing a complex but fixed form of mutation effects and epistasis, and often ignoring drift. In all cases, predictions are typically obtained in high or low mutation rate limits and for long-term stationary regimes, thus loosing information on transient behaviors and the effect of initial conditions. Here, we connect fitness-based and trait-based models into a single framework, and seek explicit solutions even away from stationarity. The expected fitness distribution is followed over time via its cumulant generating function, using a deterministic approximation that neglects drift. In several cases, explicit trajectories for the full fitness distribution are obtained, for arbitrary mutation rates and standing variance. For non-epistatic mutation, especially with beneficial mutations, this approximation fails over the long term but captures the early dynamics, thus complementing stationary stochastic predictions. The approximation also handles several diminishing return epistasis models (e.g. with an optimal genotype): it can then apply at and away from equilibrium. General results arise at equilibrium, where fitness distributions display a  phase transition with mutation rate. Beyond this phase transition, in Fishers geometrical model, the full trajectory of fitness and trait distributions takes simple form, robust to details of the mutant phenotype distribution. Analytical arguments are explored for why and when the deterministic approximation applies.\\n\\nSignificance statementHow fast do asexuals evolve in new environments? Asexual fitness dynamics are well documented empirically. Various corresponding theories exist, to which they may be compared, but most typically describe stationary regimes, thus losing information on the shorter timescale of experiments, and on the impact of the initial conditions set by the experimenter. Here, a general deterministic approximation is proposed that encompasses many previous models as subcases, and shows surprising accuracy when compared to stochastic simulations. It can yield predictions over both short and long timescales, hopefully fostering the quantitative test of alternative models, using data from experimental evolution in asexuals.",

The field of mouse behavioral phenotyping was one of the first to raise this concern, and to relate it to other complicated methodological issues: the complex interaction between genotype and environment; the definitions of behavioral constructs; and the use of the mouse as a model animal for human health and disease mechanisms. In January 2015, researchers from various disciplines including genetics, behavior genetics, neuroscience, ethology, statistics and bioinformatics gathered in Tel Aviv University to discuss these issues. The general consent presented here was that the issue is prevalent and of concern, and should be addressed at the statistical, methodological and policy levels, but is not so severe as to call into question the validity and the usefulness of model organisms as a whole. Well-organized community efforts, coupled with improved data and metadata sharing, were agreed by all to have a key role to play in identifying specific problems and promoting effective solutions. As replicability is related to validity and may also affect generalizability and translation of findings, the implications of the present discussion reach far beyond the issue of replicability of mouse phenotypes but may be highly relevant throughout biomedical research.",

First, we used a bioinformatics pipeline to survey the predicted proteomes of nematode, fruitfly, mouse and human for extracellular proteins containing any of a list of motifs found in known guidance or connectivity molecules. Second, we performed clustering analyses on the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas data to identify genes encoding surface proteins expressed with temporal profiles similar to known guidance or connectivity molecules. In both cases, we then screened the resultant genes for selective expression patterns in the developing thalamus. These approaches identified 82 candidate connectivity labels in the developing thalamus. These molecules include many members of the Ephrin, Eph-receptor, cadherin, protocadherin, semaphorin, plexin, Odz/teneurin, Neto, cerebellin, calsyntenin and Netrin-G families, as well as diverse members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and leucine-rich receptor (LRR) superfamilies, receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, a variety of growth factors and receptors, and a large number of miscellaneous membrane-associated or secreted proteins not previously implicated in axonal guidance or neuronal connectivity. The diversity of their expression patterns indicates that thalamic nuclei are highly differentiated from each other, with each one displaying a unique repertoire of these molecules, consistent with a combinatorial logic to the specification of thalamic connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have tremendous potential for development of regenerative medicine, disease modelling and drug discovery. However, the processes of reprogramming, maintenance and differentiation are labour intensive and subject to inter-technician variability. To address these issues, we established and optimised protocols to allow for the automated maintenance of reprogrammed somatic cells into iPSCs to enable the large-scale culture and passaging of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) using a customized TECAN Freedom EVO. Generation of iPSCs was performed offline by nucleofection followed by selection of TRA-1-60 positive cells using a Miltenyi MultiMACS24 Separator. Pluripotency markers were assessed to confirm pluripotency of the generated iPSCs. Passaging was performed using an enzyme-free dissociation method. Proof of concept of differentiation was obtained by differentiating human PSCs into cells of the retinal lineage. Key advantages of this automated approach are the ability to increase sample size, reduce variability during reprogramming or differentiation, and enable medium to high-throughput analysis of human PSCs and derivatives. These techniques will become increasingly important with the emergence of clinical trials using stem cells.",

Simulations can be performed at single molecule and compartment spatial scales simultaneously. Molecules can diffuse and react in 1D (filament), 2D (membrane) and 3D (cytosol) compartments. The implications of crowded regions in the cell can be investigated because each diffusing molecule has spatial dimensions. Spatiocyte adopts multi-algorithm and multi-timescale frameworks to simulate models that simultaneously employ deterministic, stochastic and particle reaction-diffusion algorithms. Comparison of light microscopy images to simulation snapshots is supported by Spatiocyte microscopy visualization and molecule tagging features.

    "abstract": "Loss of hand function after stroke is a major cause of long-term disability. Hand function can be partitioned into strength and independent control of fingers (individuation). Here we developed a novel paradigm, which independently quantifies these two aspects of hand function, to track hand recovery in 54 patients with hemiparesis over the first year after their stroke. Most recovery of both strength and individuation occurred in the first three months after stroke. Improvement in strength and individuation were tightly correlated up to a strength level of approximately 60% of the unaffected side. Beyond this threshold, further gains in strength were not accompanied by improvements in individuation. Any observed improvements in individuation beyond the 60% threshold were attributable instead to a second independent stable factor. Lesion analysis revealed that damage to the hand area in motor cortex and the corticospinal tract (CST) correlated more with individuation than with strength. CST involvement correlated with individuation even after factoring out the strength-individuation correlation. The most parsimonious explanation for these behavioral and lesion-based findings is that most strength recovery, along with some individuation, can be attributed to descending systems other than the CST, whereas further recovery of individuation is CST dependent.",

    "abstract": "The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness richness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive way to measure human brain structure and activity that has been used for over 25 years. There are thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data analysis methods are being developed every year. The potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of existing and newly acquired data is hindered by difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for standardized input data. Here we propose to use container technology to make deployment of a wide range of data analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the existing data analysis tools to interface with data organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated progress in human neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Proper cell size is essential for cellular function (Hall et al., 2004). Nonetheless, despite more than 100 years of work on the subject, the mechanisms that maintain cell size homeostasis are largely mysterious (Marshall et al., 2012). Cells in growing populations maintain cell size within a narrow range by coordinating growth and division. Bacterial and eukaryotic cells both demonstrate homeostatic size control, which maintains population-level variation in cell size within a certain range, and returns the population average to that range if it is perturbed (Marshall et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2012; Amodeo and Skotheim, 2015). Recent work has proposed two different strategies for size control: budding yeast has been proposed to use an inhibitor-dilution strategy to regulate size at the G1/S transition (Schmoller et al., 2015), while bacteria appear to use an adder strategy, in which a fixed amount of growth each generation causes cell size to converge on a stable average, a mechanism also suggested for budding yeast (Campos et al., 2014; Jun and Taheri-Araghi, 2015; Taheri-Araghi et al., 2015; Tanouchi et al., 2015; Soifer et al., 2016). Here we present evidence that cell size in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is regulated by a third strategy: the size dependent expression of the mitotic activator Cdc25. The cdc25 transcript levels are regulated such that smaller cells express less Cdc25 and larger cells express more Cdc25, creating an increasing concentration of Cdc25 as cell grow and providing a mechanism for cell to trigger cell division when they reach a threshold concentration of Cdc25. Since regulation of mitotic entry by Cdc25 is well conserved, this mechanism may provide a wide spread solution to the problem of size control in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system provides unprecedented genome editing capabilities. However, off-target effects lead to sub-optimal usage and additionally are a bottleneck in development of therapeutic uses. Herein, we introduce the first machine learning-based approach to this problem, yielding a state-of-the-art predictive model for CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects which outperforms all other guide design services. Our approach, Elevation, consists of two inter-related machine learning models--one for scoring individual guide-target pairs and another which aggregates guide-target scores into a single, overall guide summary score. Through systematic investigation, we demonstrate that Elevation performs substantially better than competing approaches on both of these tasks. Additionally, we are the first to systematically evaluate approaches on the guide summary score problem; we show that the most widely-used method (and one re-implemented by several other servers) performs no better than random at times, whereas Elevation consistently outperformed it, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In our analyses, we also introduce a method to balance errors on truly active guides with those which are truly inactive, encapsulating a range of practical use cases, thereby showing that Elevation is consistently superior across the entire range. We thus contribute a new evaluation metric for benchmarking off-target modeling. Finally, because of the large computational demands of our tasks, we have developed a cloud-based service for end-to-end guide design which incorporates our previously reported on-target model, Azimuth, as well as our new off-target model, Elevation.",
