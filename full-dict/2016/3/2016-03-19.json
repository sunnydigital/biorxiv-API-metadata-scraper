    "abstract": "Targeted mass spectrometry comprises a set of methods able to quantify protein analytes in complex mixtures with high accuracy and sensitivity. These methods, e.g., Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) and SWATH MS, use specific mass spectrometric coordinates (assays) for reproducible detection and quantification of proteins. In this protocol, we describe how to analyze in a targeted manner data from a SWATH MS experiment aimed at monitoring thousands of proteins reproducibly over many samples. We present a standard SWATH MS analysis workflow, including manual data analysis for quality control (based on Skyline) as well as automated data analysis with appropriate control of error rates (based on the OpenSWATH workflow). We also discuss considerations to ensure maximal coverage, reproducibility and quantitative accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The association of Guillain-Barre syndrome with Zika virus infection raises suspicion of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of Zika associated disease. Using computational analysis to identify predicted B and T cell epitopes, we assessed whether antibodies elicited by B cell epitopes in Zika virus may also target B cell epitopes in the human proteome. We detected amino acid motifs predicted to be B cell epitopes in Zika virus proteins which are also present in human proteins, including pro-neuropeptide Y (proNPY), NAV2 and other proteins with interacting neurophysiologic function. We examine the predicted MHC binding of peptides likely to provide T cell help to the potential mimic epitopes. Some potential mimic epitopes in Zika virus envelope have apparently strong T cell help, likely facilitating immunoglobulin class switch. We also identify epitope mimic commonalities with dengue serotypes 1 and 3. We hypothesize that antibodies to Zika virus epitopes may contribute to the pathogenesis of Zika-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome, microcephaly, and ocular lesions, and may be a driver of autoimmunity. The risk associated with responses to potential epitope mimics must be addressed in the development of vaccines and therapeutics for Zika virus infections.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUsing computational immunologic analysis, we examine the possibility that anti-Zika antibodies are binding to mimic epitopes on human proteins and that this autoimmunity may be a driver for some of the clinical signs associated with Zika virus infection. These include Guillain Barre Syndrome, other neurophysiologic deficits, and the Zika Fetal Syndrome, including microcephaly. We identify specific proteins and epitopes to which anti-Zika antibodies may bind. The prospect that the pathogenesis of ZIKV may involve an antibody-mediated autoimmune component must be addressed in vaccine and therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify SNPs in the coding sequence of the leptin receptor gene and to test for their possible association with 20 economically advantageous traits in 15 generations of 2 selected (HBW and LBW) and a control of japanase quail. A 350-bp part of the leptin receptor coding region was amplified and sequenced and understood that the fragment contained 7 SNPs (GenBank: KP674322.1-KP674328.1) that were detected in 5 loci (T3216C, T3265C, T3265G, C3265G, T3303C, A3311G, and T3347C) in a total of 30 individuals. The T3216C and T3303C SNPs located at the end of the codon were synonymous and did not affect the presence of proline. However, phenylalanine, leucine and valine were produced when the T3265C, T3265G and C3265G SNPs, respectively, were present. Glutamine or arginine was produced when the A3311G SNP was A or G, respectively, and serine was produced when the T3347C SNP was C. Although codons and amino acid sequences changed due to the second SNP, the secondary protein structure was not changed. However, the fourth and fifth SNPs changed both the amino acid sequences and secondary protein structure.\\n\\nPairing the SNP loci with phenotypic traits created haplogroups. When all individuals were evaluated together, some of the differences between the haplogroups were statistically significant (p<0.05; p<0.01). These results showed that both the sequence and structure of the leptin receptor gene could be altered by long-term selection. However, to achieve a more precise understanding of the role of leptin, entire coding sequences of leptin and the leptin receptor should be studied.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process by which cells acquire invasive properties that enable escape from the primary tumor. Complete EMT, however, is not required for metastasis: circulating tumor cells exhibit hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal states, and genetic perturbations promoting partial EMT induce metastasis in vivo. An open question is whether and to what extent intermediate stages of EMT promote invasiveness. Here, we investigate this question, building on recent observation of a new invasive property. Migrating cancer cell lines and cells transduced with prometastatic genes slide around other cells on spatially-confined, fiber-like micropatterns. We show here that low-dosage/short-duration exposure to TGF{beta} induces partial EMT and enables sliding on narrower (26 {micro}m) micropatterns than untreated counterparts (41 {micro}m). High-dosage/long-duration exposure induces more complete EMT, including disrupted cell-cell contacts and reduced E-cadherin expression, and promotes sliding on the narrowest (15 {micro}m) micropatterns. These results demonstrate that EMT is a potent inducer of cell sliding, even under significant spatial constraints, and EMT-mediated invasive sliding is progressive, with partial EMT promoting intermediate sliding behavior. Our findings suggest a model in which fiber maturation and partial EMT work synergistically to promote invasiveness during cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Elizabethkingia anophelis is an emerging pathogen. Genomic analysis of strains from clinical, environmental or mosquito sources is needed to understand the epidemiological emergence of E. anophelis and to uncover genetic elements implicated in antimicrobial resistance, pathogenesis, or niche adaptation. Here, the genomic sequences of two nosocomial isolates that caused neonatal meningitis in Bangui, Central African Republic, were determined and compared with Elizabethkingia isolates from other world regions and sources. Average nucleotide identity firmly confirmed that E. anophelis, E. meningoseptica and E. miricola represent distinct genomic species and led to re-identification of several strains. Phylogenetic analysis of E. anophelis strains revealed several sublineages and demonstrated a single evolutionary origin of African clinical isolates, which carry unique antimicrobial resistance genes acquired by horizontal transfer. The Elizabethkingia genus and the species E. anophelis had pan-genomes comprising respectively 7,801 and 6,880 gene families, underlining their genomic heterogeneity. African isolates were capsulated and carried a distinctive capsular polysaccharide synthesis cluster. A core-genome multilocus sequence typing scheme applicable to all Elizabethkingia isolates was developed, made publicly available (http://bigsdb.web.pasteur.fr/elizabethkingia), and shown to provide useful insights into E. anophelis epidemiology. Furthermore, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus was uncovered in E. meningoseptica, E. miricola and in a few E. anophelis strains. CRISPR spacer variation was observed between the African isolates, illustrating the value of CRISPR for strain subtyping. This work demonstrates the dynamic evolution of E. anophelis genomes and provides innovative tools for Elizabethkingia identification, population biology and epidemiology.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEElizabethkingia anophelis is a recently recognized bacterial species involved in human infections and outbreaks in distinct world regions. Using whole-genome sequencing, we showed that the species comprises several sublineages, which differ markedly in their genomic features associated with antibiotic resistance and host-pathogen interactions. Further, we have devised high-resolution strain subtyping strategies and provide an open genomic sequence analysis tool, facilitating the investigation of outbreaks and tracking of strains across time and space. We illustrate the power of these tools by showing that two African healthcare-associated meningitis cases observed 5 years apart were caused by the same strain, providing evidence that E. anophelis can persist in the hospital environment.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is one of the best known bacterial endosymbionts affecting insects and nematodes. It is estimated that it infects 40% of insect species, so epidemiologically it may be considered a pandemic species. However, the mechanisms by which it is acquired from other species (horizontal transmission) or by which it coevolves with its hosts as a result of vertical transmission across generations are not known in detail. In fact, there are few systems in which the codivergence between host and bacterium has been described.\\n\\nThis study goes in deep in the Wolbachia infection in the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus. This well-known system allows us to investigate the mechanism of acquisition of various Wolbachia strains in a new host, and the bacterial genomic changes during bacterial-host codivergence: We describe the genetic diversity of Wolbachia strains infecting both subspecies of C. parallelus and analyse their phylogenetic relationship. We also show the emergence of new bacterial alleles resulting from recombination events in Wolbachia infecting hybrid hosts. Our data suggest that F strains detected in this grasshopper have co-diverged with its host, versus a more recent horizontal transmission of B strains. According with this, we discuss the potential role of Wolbachia in the dynamics of the grasshopper hybrid zone and in the divergence of the two grasshopper subspecies since the origin of their hybrid zone.",

These high-dimensional population snapshot techniques are complemented by low-dimensional time-resolved, microscopy-based monitoring methods. Both fronts of advance have exposed a rich heterogeneity of cell states within uniform cell populations in many biological contexts, producing a new kind of data that has stimulated a series of computational analysis methods for data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and cluster (subpopulation) identification. The next step is now to go beyond collecting data and correlating data points: to connect the dots, that is, to understand what actually underlies the identified data patterns. This entails interpreting the \\\"clouds of points\\\" in state space as a manifestation of the underlying molecular regulatory network. In that way control of cell state dynamics can be formalized as a quasi-potential landscape, as first proposed by Waddington. We summarize key methods of data acquisition and computational analysis and explain the principles that link the single-cell resolution measurements to dynamical systems theory.",

Changes in cell growth rate result in changes in rRNA and tRNA content, but the effect of cell growth rate on mRNA abundance is not known. We developed a new method for measuring absolute transcript abundances using RNA-seq, SPike in-based Absolute RNA Quantification (SPARQ), that does not assume a constant transcriptome size and applied it to the model eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), grown at different rates. We find that increases in cell growth rate result in increased absolute abundance of almost every transcript, with significant coordinated changes in abundances among functionally related transcripts. mRNA degradation and synthesis rates increase with increased growth rate, but to differing extents, resulting in the observed net increases in absolute abundance. We propose that regulation of ribosome abundance links environmental conditions to transcriptome amplification via nutrient-sensing pathways.",

    "abstract": "Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA) are members of a class of non-protein-coding RNA transcript that has recently been shown to contribute to gene regulatory processes and disease etiology. It has been hypothesized that lincRNAs influence disease risk through the regulation of mRNA transcription [88], possibly by interacting with regulatory proteins such as chromatin-modifying complexes [37, 50]. The hypothesis of the regulation of mRNA by lincRNAs is based on a small number of specific lincRNAs analyses; the cellular roles of lincRNAs regulation have not been catalogued genome-wide. Relative to mRNAs, lincRNAs tend to be expressed at lower levels and in more tissue-specific patterns, making genome-wide studies of their regulatory capabilities difficult [15]. Here we develop a method for Mendelian randomization leveraging expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that regulate the expression levels of lincRNAs (linc-eQTLs) to perform such a study across four primary tissues. We find that linc-eQTLs are largely similar to protein-coding eQTLs (pc-eQTLs) in cis-regulatory element enrichment, which supports the hypothesis that lincRNAs are regulated by the same transcriptional machinery as protein-coding RNAs [15, 80] and validates our linc-eQTLs. We catalog 74 lincRNAs with linc-eQTLs that are in linkage disequilibrium with TASs and are in protein-coding gene deserts; the putative lincRNA-regulated traits are highly enriched for adipose-related traits relative to mRNA-regulated traits.",

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is caused by deletion or mutation of the Survival Motor Neuron 1 gene (SMN1), but the mechanism whereby reduced levels of SMN protein lead to disease is unknown. SMN functions in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and potential splicing defects have been uncovered in various animal models of SMA. We used disruptions in Smn and two additional snRNP biogenesis genes, Phax and Ars2, to classify RNA processing differences as snRNP-dependent or Smn gene specific. Although more numerous, the processing changes in Ars2 mutants were mostly distinct from those identified in Phax and Smn animals. Phax and Smn null mutants exhibited comparable reductions in steady-state snRNA levels, and direct comparison of their transcriptomic profiles uncovered a shared set of alternative splicing changes. However, these RNA processing differences were largely absent in three different models of intermediate SMA. Instead, the three hypomorphic Smn point mutants displayed an activation of stress responsive transcripts that correlated with phenotypic severity. In summary, genome-wide analyses showed that mRNA expression and alternative splicing defects are not conserved between hypomorphic and complete loss-of-function Smn mutants. Because disease phenotypes are unlikely to result from global changes in RNA processing, additional hypotheses for the etiology of SMA should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Mincle is a C-type lectin known to play a role in innate immune responses to sterile inflammation, but its contribution to pathologies following an ischemic or traumatic injury is not well understood. In the current study we demonstrate a key role for Mincle in ischemic (i.e. transient middle cerebral artery occlusion) but not traumatic central nervous system injury; absence of Mincle also did not significantly alter the extent of tissue damage or functional outcome in peripheral models of ischemic tissue injury. In the stroke model mice lacking Mincle displayed significantly improved functional outcome from focal cerebral ischemia. The functional improvements in Mincle KO animals were accompanied by reduced infiltration of neutrophils and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in recruited peripheral blood cells. Bone marrow chimera experiments revealed that presence of Mincle in the central nervous system, but not peripheral immune cells, was the critical regulator of a poor outcome following transient focal cerebral ischemia, however we exclude a direct role for Mincle in microglia or neural activation. We demonstrate that Mincle lacks widespread expression in the brain, but is specifically associated with macrophages resident in the perivascular niche. These findings implicate Mincle in the initiation, extent and severity of local responses to ischemic injury in the brain, but not peripheral tissues. Mincle signalling therefore offers a novel therapeutic target in the quest to limit damage after stroke.\\n\\nSources of supportAustralian National Health & Medical Research Council [1057846, 1060538 and Fellowship to NAR], SpinalCure Australia (Career Development Fellowship to MJR), the Australian Research Council, the State Government of Victoria, the Australian Government and The University of Queensland.",

    "abstract": "The Philippines is one of the major producers of tilapia, the most cultured fish and widely consumed in the world. Although fishes in general is said to be adapted to various stressful conditions, the effect on several cellular immune parameters may be of interest to determine the capacity of the organism to withstand stressors. In this paper, the effect of unleaded petroleum on the splenic macrophage aggregate (MA) formation was studied. This was done to have an overview of the immune response of Tilapia or fishes in general when an oil spill, which almost occur annually at different parts of the world, happen. Histological analysis assessed the area occupied by splenic MA 24 hours after introduction of unleaded petroleum to the aquatic system. To determine whether Mabuhay balls, a technology that claims to be beneficial in terms of improving water quality, was added to one tank (T1) to be able to compare it with another tank (T2). There is a strong statistically significant difference between the groups at day1 (p=0.000) opposite the result of day 6 (p=0.155). Thus, unleaded petroleum increased MA formation, a sign that may indicate a high immune activity as an initial positive response to stress. Mabuhay ball have lessen the mortality but has no effect on splenic MA formation.",

    "abstract": "Bilateria constitute a monophyletic group of organisms comprising about 99% of all living animals. Since their initial radiation about 540Mya they have evolved a plethora of traits and body forms allowing them to conquer almost any habitat on earth. There are only few truly uniting and shared morphological features retained across the phylum. Unsurprisingly, also the genetic toolkit of bilateria is highly diverged.\\n\\nIn the light of this divergence we investigated if a set of Bilaterian-specific genes exists and, beyond this, if such genes are related with respect to function and expression patterns among organisms as distant as fly, worm and fish. Using a conservative pyramidal approach of orthology inference we first employed BLAST to extract a set of protein-coding genes which has orthologs in all major branches of Bilateria, but no homologs in non-Bilaterian species. To characterize the proteins with respect to function, we developed a new method for multi-species GO analysis and augmented it by a human-curated annotation based on an extensive literature search. Finally, we extracted characteristic developmental expression profiles for Bilateria from the detailed data available for three model organisms and we explored the relation between expression and function.\\n\\nWe find 85 clusters of pan-bilaterian proteins. Although some of these proteins belong to common developmental processes, they cover a wide range of biological components, from transcription factors to metabolic enzymes. The 85 groups include myoD, an important regulator of mesodermal cell fate and muscle development, and prospero and several other factors involved in nervous system development. They reveal a so far unknown connection between bilaterian key innovations (mesoderm, complex nervous system) and the emergence of new genes in the ancestor of bilaterians. In addition, the majority of these genes tends to be highly expressed when the adult body plan is constructed. These observations are compatible with the idea that bilaterians are characterized by the unfolding of an additional developmental phase, namely the transition of the larva to morphologically distinct adults.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBilateria represent by far the largest and morphologically most diverse clade of all extant animals. The bilaterian radiation dates back to the so-called Cambrian explosion of species. Although bilateria show a large variety of very distinct body plans, they are also characterized by several common developmental and morphological properties, upon which their monophyly is based. Here, we wanted to know whether these common phenotypic features may also have a common genetic basis, manifested by a set of bilaterian lineage-specific genes. To address this question we compared the proteomes of bilaterian and non-bilaterian species and extracted an initial set of a few hundred candidate proteins. Their underlying genes were further post-processed by means of orthology clustering, multi-species GO enrichment, expression analysis and extensive literature mining. This resulted in a set of 85 clusters of orthologous genes with roles in body morphology-, neuronal system-and muscle development, as well as in cell-cell signalling processes. These genes can be regarded as very promising candidates for further investigation of the genetic basis of a pan-bilaterian pheno-or morphotype and they should be highly interesting targets for functional studies in non-model organisms.",
