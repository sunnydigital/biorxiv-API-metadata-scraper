Understanding and unlocking this potential requires accurate evaluation of editing efficiency. We show that methodological decisions for analyzing sequencing data can significantly affect mutagenesis efficiency estimates and we provide a comprehensive R-based toolkit, CrispRVariants and accompanying web tool CrispRVariantsLite, that resolves and localizes individual mutant alleles with respect to the endonuclease cut site. CrispRVariants-enabled analyses of newly generated and existing genome editing datasets underscore how careful consideration of the full variant spectrum gives insight toward effective guide and amplicon design as well as the mutagenic process.",

This work aims to expand the diversity of known PHA synthases via functional metagenomics, and demonstrates the use of these novel enzymes in PHA production. Complementation of a PHA synthesis deficient Pseudomonas putida strain with a soil metagenomic cosmid library retrieved 27 clones expressing either Class I, Class II or unclassified PHA synthases, and many did not have close sequence matches to known PHA synthases. The composition of PHA produced by these clones was dependent on both the supplied growth substrates and the nature of the PHA synthase, with various combinations of SCL-and MCL-PHA. These data demonstrate the ability to isolate diverse genes for PHA synthesis by functional metagenomics, and their use for the production of a variety of PHA polymer and copolymer mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Illusions provide a great opportunity to study how perception is affected by both the observers expectations and the way sensory information is represented1,2,3,4,5. Recently, Jazayeri and Movshon6 reported a new and interesting perceptual illusion, demonstrating that the perceived motion direction of a dynamic random dot stimulus is systematically biased when preceded by a motion discrimination judgment. The authors hypothesized that these biases emerge because the brain predominantly relies on those neurons that are most informative for solving the discrimination task7, but then is using the same neural weighting profile for generating the percept. In other words, they argue that these biases are \\\"mistakes\\\" of the brain, resulting from using inappropriate neural read-out weights. While we were able to replicate the illusion for a different visual stimulus (orientation), our new psychophysical data suggest that the above interpretation is likely incorrect: Biases are not caused by a read-out profile optimized for solving the discrimination task but rather by the specific choices subjects make in the discrimination task on any given trial. We formulate this idea as a conditioned Bayesian observer model and show that it can explain the new as well as the original psychophysical data. In this framework, the biases are not caused by mistake but rather by the brains attempt to remain self-consistent in its inference process. Our model establishes a direct connection between the current perceptual illusion and the well-known phenomena of cognitive consistency and dissonance8,9.",

    "abstract": "During ecological speciation diverging populations are exposed to contrasting sensory and spatial information that present new behavioral and perceptive challenges. Here, we investigate how brain composition evolves during the early stages of speciation. The incipient species pair, Heliconius erato cyrbia and H. himera, have parapatric ranges across an environmental and altitudinal gradient. Despite continuing gene-flow, these species have divergent ecological, behavioral and physiological traits. We demonstrate that these incipient species also differ significantly in brain composition, especially in the size of sensory structures. H. erato has larger visual components whilst H. himera invests more heavily in olfaction. These differences are not explained by environmentally-induced plasticity, but reflect non-allometric shifts in brain structure. Our results suggest the adaptive evolution of brain structure and function play an important role in facilitating the emergence of ecologically distinct species, and imply that plasticity alone may be insufficient to meet the demands of novel environments.",

    "abstract": "What adaptive changes in brain structure and function underpin the evolution of increased cognitive performance in humans and our close relatives? Identifying the genetic basis of brain evolution has become a major tool in answering this question. Numerous cases of positive selection, altered gene expression or gene duplication have been identified that may contribute to the evolution of the neocortex, which is widely assumed to play a predominant role in cognitive evolution. However, the neocortex co-evolves with other, functionally inter-dependent, regions of the brain, most notably the cerebellum. The cerebellum is linked to a range of cognitive tasks and expanded rapidly during hominoid evolution, independently of neocortex size. Here we demonstrate that, across primates, genes with known roles in cerebellum development are just as likely to be targeted by selection as genes linked to cortical development. In fact, cerebellum genes are more likely to have evolved adaptively during hominoid evolution, consistent with phenotypic data suggesting an accelerated rate of cerebellar expansion in apes. Finally, we present evidence that selection targeted genes with specific effects on either the neocortex or cerebellum, not both. This suggests cortico-cerebellar co-evolution is maintained by selection acting on independent developmental programs.",

    "abstract": "One goal of human genetics is to understand the genetic basis of disease, a challenge for diseases of complex inheritance because risk alleles are few relative to the vast set of benign variants. Risk variants are often sought by association studies in which allele frequencies in cases are contrasted with those from population-based samples used as controls. In an ideal world we would know population-level allele frequencies, releasing researchers to focus on case subjects. We argue this ideal is possible, at least theoretically, and we outline a path to achieving it in reality. If such a resource were to exist, it would yield ample savings and would facilitate the effective use of data repositories by removing administrative and technical barriers. We call this concept the Universal Control Repository Network (UNICORN), a means to perform association analyses without necessitating direct access to individual-level control data. Our approach to UNICORN uses existing genetic resources and various statistical tools to analyze these data, including hierarchical clustering with spectral analysis of ancestry; and empirical Bayesian analysis along with Gaussian spatial processes to estimate ancestry-specific allele frequencies. We demonstrate our approach using tens of thousands of controls from studies of Crohns disease, showing how it controls false positives, provides power similar to that achieved when all control data are directly accessible, and enhances power when control data are limiting or even imperfectly matched ancestrally. These results highlight how UNICORN can enable reliable, powerful and convenient genetic association analyses without access to the individual level data.",

We have identified a novel role for septins in autophagy. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that localize at the bud-neck and are involved in cytokinesis in budding yeast2. We show that septins under autophagy prevalent conditions are majorly localized to the cytoplasm in the form of punctate structures. Further, we report that septins not only localize to pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) but also to autophagosomes in the form of punctate structures. Interestingly, septins also form small non-canonical rings around PAS during autophagy. Furthermore, we observed that in one of the septin Ts\\\" mutant, cdc10-5, the anterograde trafficking of Atg9 was affected at the non-permissive temperature (NPT). All these results suggest a role of septins in early stages of autophagy during autophagosome formation.",

Recent research has linked the process of bacterial adaptation to a niche to changes in the genome content and size, showing that many bacterial genomes reflect the constraints imposed by their habitat. However, some highly versatile bacteria are found in diverse niches that almost share nothing in common. Lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that is found in a large variety of niches. With the aim of unravelling the link between genome evolution and ecological versatility of L. plantarum, we analysed the genomes of 54 L. plantarum strains isolated from different environments. Phylogenomic analyses coupled with the study of genetic functional divergence and gene-trait matching analysis revealed a mixed distribution of the strains, which was uncoupled from their environmental origin. Our findings demonstrate the high complexity of L. plantarum evolution, revealing the absence of specific genomic signatures marking adaptations of this species towards the diverse habitats it is associated with. This suggests fundamentally similar and parallel trends of genome evolution in L. plantarum, which occur in a manner that is apparently uncoupled from ecological constraint and reflects the nomadic lifestyle of this species.",

    "abstract": "Here we use computational modeling of fast neural dynamics to explore the relationship between structural and functional coupling in a population of healthy subjects. We use DTI data to estimate structural connectivity and subsequently model phase couplings from band-limited oscillatory signals derived from multichannel EEG data. Our results show that about 23.4% of the variance in empirical networks of resting-state fast oscillations is explained by the underlying white matter architecture. By simulating functional connectivity using a simple reference model, the match between simulated and empirical functional connectivity further increases to 45.4%. In a second step, we use our modeling framework to explore several technical alternatives along the modeling path. First, we find that an augmentation of homotopic connections in the structural connectivity matrix improves the link to functional connectivity while a correction for fiber distance slightly decreases the performance of the model. Second, a more complex computational model based on Kuramoto oscillators leads to a slight improvement of the model fit. Third, we show that the comparison of modeled and empirical functional connectivity at source level is much more specific for the underlying structural connectivity. However, different source reconstruction algorithms gave comparable results. Of note, as the fourth finding, the model fit was much better if zero-phase lag components were preserved in the empirical functional connectome, indicating a considerable amount of functionally relevant synchrony taking place with near zero or zero-phase lag. The combination of the best performing alternatives at each stage in the pipeline results in a model that explains 54.4% of the variance in the empirical EEG functional connectivity. Our study shows that large-scale brain circuits of fast neural network synchrony strongly rely upon the structural connectome and simple computational models of neural activity can explain missing links in the structure-function relationship.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBrain imaging techniques are broadly divided into the two categories of structural and functional imaging. Structural imaging provides information about the static physical connectivity within the brain, while functional imaging provides data about the dynamic ongoing activation of brain areas. Computational models allow to bridge the gap between these two modalities and allow to gain new insights. Specifically, in this study, we use structural data from diffusion tractography recordings to model functional brain connectivity obtained from fast EEG dynamics. First, we present a simple reference procedure which consists of several steps to link the structural to the functional empirical data. Second, we systematically compare several alternative methods along the modeling path in order to assess their impact on the overall fit between simulations and empirical data. We explore preprocessing steps of the structural connectivity and different levels of complexity of the computational model. We highlight the importance of source reconstruction and compare commonly used source reconstruction algorithms and metrics to assess functional connectivity. Our results serve as an important orienting frame for the emerging field of brain network modeling.",

Additionally, lactoferrin possesses cationic protein domains that directly bind and inhibit diverse microbes. The implications for these dual functions on lactoferrin evolution and genetic conflicts with pathogens remain unclear. Here we show that lactoferrin has been subject to recurrent episodes of positive selection during primate divergence predominately at antimicrobial peptide surfaces consistent with long-term antagonism by pathogens. An abundant lactoferrin polymorphism in human populations and Neanderthals also exhibits signatures of positive selection across primates, linking ancient host-microbe conflicts to modern human genetic variation. Rapidly evolving sites in lactoferrin further correspond to molecular interfaces with pathogenic bacteria causing meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis. Because microbes actively target lactoferrin to acquire iron, we propose that the emergence of antimicrobial activity provided a pivotal mechanism of adaptation sparking evolutionary conflicts via acquisition of new protein functions.",

    "abstract": "Conservation ecologists have long argued over the best way of placing reserves across an environment to maximize population diversity. Many have studied the effect of protecting many small regions of an ecosystem vs. a single large region, with varied results. However, this research tends to ignore evolutionary dynamics under the rationale that the spatiotemporal scale required is prohibitive. We used the Avida digital evolution research platform to overcome this barrier and study the response of phenotypic diversity to eight different reserve placement configurations. The capacity for mutation,and therefore evolution, substantially altered the dynamics of diversity in the population. When mutations were allowed, reserve configurations involving a greater number of consequently smaller reserves were substantially more effective at maintaining existing diversity and generating new diversity. However, when mutations were disallowed, reserve configuration had little effect on diversity generation and maintenance. While further research is necessary before translating these results into policy decisions, this study demonstrates the importance of considering evolution when making such decisions and suggests that a larger number of smaller reserves may have evolutionary benefits.",

Functional genomics work has begun to identify a diverse array of dysregulated transcriptomic programs (e.g., synaptic, immune, cell cycle, DNA damage, WNT signaling, cortical patterning and differentiation) potentially involved in ASD brain abnormalities during childhood and adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether such diverse dysregulated pathways are independent of each other or instead reflect coordinated hierarchical systems-level pathology.\\n\\nMethodsTwo ASD cortical transcriptome datasets were re-analyzed using consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify common coexpression modules across datasets. Linear mixed-effect models and Bayesian replication statistics were used to identify replicable differentially expressed modules. Eigengene network analysis was then utilized to identify between-group differences in how co-expression modules interact and cluster into hierarchical meta-modular organization. Protein-protein interaction analyses were also used to determine whether dysregulated co-expression modules show enhanced interactions.\\n\\nResultsWe find replicable evidence for 10 gene co-expression modules that are differentially expressed in ASD cortex. Rather than being independent non-interacting sources of pathology, these dysregulated co-expression modules work in synergy and physically interact at the protein level. These systems-level transcriptional signals are characterized by downregulation of synaptic processes coordinated with upregulation of immune/inflammation, response to other organism, catabolism, viral processes, translation, protein targeting and localization, cell proliferation, and vasculature development. Hierarchical organization of meta-modules (clusters of highly correlated modules) is also highly affected in ASD.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings highlight that dysregulation of the ASD cortical transcriptome is characterized by the dysregulation of multiple coordinated transcriptional programs producing synergistic systems-level effects that cannot be fully appreciated by studying the individual component biological processes in isolation.",

    "abstract": "Parental exposure to an environmental challenge can induce phenotypes in offspring independent of the inherited DNA sequence. Whether such acquired traits can be inherited - i.e., can manifest in a generation beyond that exposed to the precipitating insult as germ cells - is unclear. Here we report a latent metabolic phenotype induced by paternal obesity that is inherited into a second generation, without germ cell exposure. Sons of obese male mice exhibit defects in glucose and lipid metabolism that are only unmasked by post-weaning dietary challenge, yet they transmit these defects to their own progeny (F2) in the absence of the challenge. F1 sperm exhibit changes in the abundance of several small RNA species, including diet responsive tRNA-derived fragments. These data suggest that induced metabolic phenotypes may be propagated for multiple generations through the actions of noncoding RNA.",
