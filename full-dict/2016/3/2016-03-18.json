    "abstract": "Primary neocortical sensory areas act as central hubs, distributing afferent information to numerous cortical and subcortical structures. However, it remains unclear whether each downstream target receives distinct versions of sensory information. We used in vivo calcium imaging combined with retrograde tracing to monitor visual response properties of three distinct subpopulations of projection neurons in primary visual cortex. While there is overlap across the groups, on average corticotectal (CT) cells exhibit lower contrast thresholds and broader tuning for orientation and spatial frequency in comparison to corticostriatal (CS) cells, while corticocortical (CC) cells have intermediate properties. Noise correlational analyses support the hypothesis that CT cells integrate information across diverse layer 5 populations, whereas CS and CC cells form more selectively interconnected groups. Overall, our findings demonstrate the existence of functional subnetworks within layer 5 that may differentially route visual information to behaviorally relevant downstream targets.",

    "abstract": "A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.",

    "abstract": "Humans efficiently grasp complex visual environments, making highly consistent judgments of entry-level category despite their high variability in visual appearance. How does the human brain arrive at the invariant neural representations underlying categorization of real-world environments? We here show that the neural representation of visual environments in scenes-selective human visual cortex relies on statistics of contour junctions, which provide cues for the three-dimensional arrangement of surfaces in a scene. We manipulated line drawings of real-world environments such that statistics of contour orientations or junctions were disrupted. Manipulated and intact line drawings were presented to participants in an fMRI experiment. Scene categories were decoded from neural activity patterns in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA) and other visual brain regions. Disruption of junctions but not orientations led to a drastic decrease in decoding accuracy in the PPA and OPA, indicating the reliance of these areas on intact junction statistics. Accuracy of decoding from early visual cortex, on the other hand, was unaffected by either image manipulation. We further show that the correlation of error patterns between decoding from the scene-selective brain areas and behavioral experiments is contingent on intact contour junctions. Finally, a searchlight analysis exposes the reliance of visually active brain regions on different sets of contour properties. Statistics of contour length and curvature dominate neural representations of scene categories in early visual areas and contour junctions in high-level scene-selective brain regions.",

We developed a program to automatically quantify outflow changes (R, package eye-canalogram, github.com) using a fluorescent tracer reperfusion technique. Trabecular meshwork (TM) ablation was demonstrated with fluorescent spheres in 6 eyes before formal outflow quantification with two dye reperfusion canalograms in 6 further eyes. Eyes were perfused with a central, intracameral needle at 15 mmHg. Canalograms and histology were correlated for each eye.\\n\\nResultsThe pig eye provided a model with high similarity to AIT in human patients. Histology indicated ablation of TM and unroofing of most Schlemms canal segments. Spheres highlighted additional circumferential and radial outflow beyond the immediate area of ablation. Differential canalograms showed that AIT caused an increase of outflow of 17{+/-}5 fold inferonasally (IN), 14{+/-}3 fold superonasally (SN) and also an increase in the opposite quadrants with a 2{+/-}1 fold increase superotemporally (ST) and 3{+/-}3 inferotemporally (IT). Perilimbal specific flow image analysis showed an accelerated nasal filling with an additional perilimbal flow direction into adjacent quadrants.\\n\\nConclusionA quantitative, differential canalography technique was developed that allows to quantify supraphysiological outflow enhancement by AIT.",

    "abstract": "Systems as diverse as the interacting species in a community, alleles at a genetic locus, and companies in a market are characterized by competition (over resources, space, capital, etc) and adaptation. Neutral theory, built around the hypothesis that individual performance is independent of group membership, has found utility across the disciplines of ecology, population genetics, and economics, both because of the success of the neutral hypothesis in predicting system properties and because deviations from these predictions provide information about the underlying dynamics. However, most tests of neutrality are weak, based on static system properties such as species-abundance distributions or the number of singletons in a sample. Time-series data provide a window onto a systems dynamics, and should furnish tests of the neutral hypothesis that are more powerful to detect deviations from neutrality and more informative about to the type of competitive asymmetry that drives the deviation.\\n\\nHere, we present a neutrality test for time-series data. We apply this test to several microbial time-series and financial time-series and find that most of these systems are not neutral. Our test isolates the covariance structure of neutral competition, thus facilitating further exploration of the nature of asymmetry in the covariance structure of competitive systems. Much like neutrality tests from population genetics that use relative abundance distributions have enabled researchers to scan entire genomes for genes under selection, we anticipate our time-series test will be useful for quick significance tests of neutrality across a range of ecological, economic, and sociological systems for which time-series data are available. Future work can use our test to categorize and compare the dynamic fingerprints of particular competitive asymmetries (frequency dependence, volatility smiles, etc) to improve forecasting and management of complex adaptive systems.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFrom fisheries and forestries to game parks and gut microbes, managing a community of organisms is much like managing a portfolio. Managers care about diversity, and calculations of risk - for extinction or financial ruin - require accurate models of the covariance between the parts of the portfolio.\\n\\nTo model the covariances in portfolios or communities, it helps to start simple with a null model assuming the equivalence of species or companies relative to one another (termed \\\"neutrality\\\") and letting the data suggest otherwise. Researchers in biology and finance have independently entertained and tested neutral models, but the existing tests have used snapshots of communities or the variance of fluctuations of individual populations, whereas tests of the covariances between species can better inform the development of alternative models.\\n\\nWe develop a covariance-based neutrality test for time-series data and use it to show that the human microbiome, North American birds, and companies in the S&P 500 all have a similar deviation from neutrality. Understanding and incorporating this non-neutral covariance structure can yield more accurate alternative models of community dynamics which can improve our management of \\\"portfolios\\\" of multi-species systems.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness, makes the development of safer and more effective treatment more urgent. Recently introduced microincisional glaucoma surgeries that enhance conventional outflow offer a favorable risk profile but can be unpredictable. Two paramount challenges are the lack of an adequate surgical training model for new surgeries and the absence of pre-or intraoperative guidance to sites of reduced flow. To address both, we developed an ex vivo training system and a differential, quantitative canalography method to assess outflow enhancement by trabecular micro-bypass (TMB) implantation or by ab interno trabeculectomy (AIT). TMB resulted in insignificant (p>0.05) outflow increases of 13{+/-}5%, 14{+/-}8%, 9{+/-}3%, and 24{+/-}9% in the inferonasal, superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants. AIT caused a 100{+/-}50% (p=0.002), 75{+/-}28% (p=0.002), 19{+/-}8%, and 40{+/-}21% increase in those quadrants. AIT eyes had a 7.5 (p=0.01), 5.7 (p=0.004), 2.3, and 1.8-fold greater outflow enhancement than matching quadrants of paired TMB-implanted eyes. Quantitative canalography demonstrated that TMB, when successful, provided focal outflow enhancements, while AIT achieved a more extensive access to outflow pathways including and beyond the surgical site itself.",

    "abstract": "Plants ameliorate heat stress by avoiding heat loading, reducing tissue temperature through evaporative cooling, and/or through tolerance, i.e. maintaining function at high temperature. Here Arabidopsis thaliana natural populations from two ends of an elevation gradient in NE Spain were used to ask: do plants from contrasting climates 1) show genetically based differences in heat stress damage and 2) adopt different avoidance-tolerance patterns? Four low-and four high-elevation populations were repeatedly exposed to high temperature (45{degrees}C) in a growth chamber at bolting stage. High temperature induced 23% more inflorescence branches, 25% longer total reproductive branch length, and 12% less root dry mass, compared with control. However summed fruit length, hence fitness, decreased by 15%, populations did not differ significantly in fitness reduction. High elevation populations showed more avoidance, i.e. lower rosette temperature at 45{degrees}C. Low elevation populations showed more tolerance, maintaining relatively higher photosynthetic rate at 45{degrees}C. Avoidance was associated with high transpiration rate and flat rosette leaf angle. Tolerance was negatively associated with heat shock protein 101 (Hsp101) and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation. The divergent avoidance-tolerance patterns for populations from thermally contrasting climates may indicate both constraints on the evolution and contrasting adaptive divergence regulated by local climates.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variation in stress response has been widely observed within species. This variation is an adaptive response to local climates and is controlled by gene sequence variation and especially by variation in expression at the transcriptome level. Plants from contrasting climates are thus expected to have different patterns in gene expression. Acclimation, a pre-exposure to sub-lethal temperature before exposing to extreme high temperature, is an important adaptive mechanism of plant survival. We are interested to evaluate the gene expression difference to heat stress for plants from contrasting climates and the role of acclimation in altering their gene expression pattern. Natural Arabidopsis thaliana plants from low elevation mediterranean and high elevation montane climates were exposed to two heat treatments at the bolting stage: a) 45{degrees}C: a direct exposure to 45{degrees}C heat; b) 38/45{degrees}C: an exposure to 45{degrees}C heat after a 38{degrees}C acclimation treatment. Variation in overall gene expression patterns was investigated. We also explored gene expression patterns for Hsp/Hsf pathway and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. In both heat treatments, high elevation plants had more differentially expressed (DE) genes than low elevation plants. In 45{degrees}C, only Hsp/Hsf pathway was activated in low elevation plants; both Hsp/Hsf and ROS pathways were activated in high elevation plants. Small Hsps had the highest magnitude of change in low elevation plants while Hsp70 and Hsp90 showed the largest magnitude of fold in high elevation plants. In 38/45{degrees}C, Hsp/Hsf and ROS pathways were activated in both low and high elevation plants. Low elevation plants showed up-regulation in all Hsps, especially small Hsps; high elevation plants showed down-regulation in all Hsps. Low elevation and high elevation also adopted different genes in the ROS pathway. We also observed genes that shifted expression in both low and high elevation plants but with opposite directions of change. This study indicates that low and high elevation plants have evolved adaptive divergence in heat stress response. The contrasting patterns of temperature variation in low and high elevation sites appears to have played a strong role in the evolution of divergent patterns to high temperature stress, both pre-acclimation and direct exposure gene expression responses.\\n\\nMolecular EcologyThe Plant Journal IF: 6.8 (TPJ welcomes functional genomics manuscripts when a scientific question, rather than the technology used, has driven the research)",

We tested the hypothesis that motor experience with an observed action changes how observers generated predictions about these actions by comparing the performance of naive and experienced observers on a task that required participants to predict the timing of particular critical points in a ongoing observed action. Crucially, we employed action and non-action stimuli with identical temporal dynamics, and we predicted that motor experience would enhance prediction accuracy specifically for actions and would have a reduced or negligible effect on enhancing prediction accuracy for non-action stimuli. Our results showed that motor experience did modulate prediction accuracy for action stimuli relative to non-action stimuli. No difference between conditions was observed for the naive observers.",

    "abstract": "Elevated intraocular pressure is the primary cause of open angle glaucoma. Outflow resistance exists within the trabecular meshwork but also at the level of Schlemms canal and further downstream within the outflow system. Viral vectors allow to take advantage of naturally evolved, highly efficient mechanisms of gene transfer, a process that is termed transduction. They can be produced at biosafety level 2 in the lab using protocols that have evolved considerably over the last 15 to 20 years. Applied by an intracameral bolus, vectors follow conventional as well as uveoscleral outflow pathways. They may affect other structures in the anterior chamber depending on their transduction kinetics which can vary among species when using the same vector. Not all vectors can express long-term, a desirable feature to address the chronicity of glaucoma. Vectors that integrate into the genome of the target cell can achieve transgene function for the life of the transduced cell but are mutagenic by definition. The most prominent long-term expressing vector systems are based on lentiviruses that are derived from HIV, FIV, or EIAV. Safety considerations make non-primate lentiviral vector systems easier to work with as they are not derived from human pathogens. Non-integrating vectors are subject to degradation and attritional dilution during cell division. Lentiviral vectors have to integrate in order to express while adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) often persist as intracellular concatemers but may also integrate. Adeno-and herpes viral vectors do not integrate and earlier generation systems might be relatively immunogenic. Nonviral methods of gene transfer are termed transfection with few restrictions of transgene size and type but often a much less efficient gene transfer that is also short-lived. Traditional gene transfer delivers exons while some vectors (lentiviral, herpes and adenoviral) allow transfer of entire genes that include introns. Recent insights have highlighted the role of non-coding RNA, most prominently, siRNA, miRNA and lncRNA. SiRNA is highly specific, miRNA is less specific, while lncRNA uses highly complex mechanisms that involve secondary structures and intergenic, intronic, overlapping, antisense, and bidirectional location. Several promising preclinical studies have targeted the RhoA or the prostaglandin pathway or modified the extracellular matrix. TGF-{beta} and glaucoma myocilin mutants have been transduced to elevate the intraocular pressure in glaucoma models. Cell based therapies have started to show first promise. Past approaches have focused on the trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemms canal while new strategies are concerned with modification of outflow tract elements that are downstream of the trabecular meshwork.",

In order to communicate and reproduce multi-step analysis workflows executed on datasets that contain data for dozens or hundreds of samples, it is crucial to be able to visualize the provenance graph at different levels of aggregation. Most existing approaches are based on node-link diagrams, which do not scale to the complexity of typical data provenance graphs. In our proposed approach we reduce the complexity of the graph using hierarchical and motif-based aggregation. Based on user action and graph attributes a modular degree-of-interest (DoI) function is applied to expand parts of the graph that are relevant to the user. This interest-driven adaptive provenance visualization approach allows users to review and communicate complex multi-step analyses, which can be based on hundreds of files that are processed by numerous workflows. We integrate our approach into an analysis platform that captures extensive data provenance information and demonstrate its effectiveness by means of a biomedical usage scenario.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGraphical models are often employed to interpret patterns of correlations observed in data through a network of interactions between the variables. Recently, Ising/Potts models, also known as Markov random fields, have been productively applied to diverse problems in biology, including the prediction of structural contacts from protein sequence data and the description of neural activity patterns. However, inference of such models is a challenging computational problem that cannot be solved exactly. Here we describe the adaptive cluster expansion (ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts models based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfitting by constructing a sparse network of interactions sufficient to reproduce the observed correlation data within the statistical error expected due to finite sampling. When convergence of the ACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine Learning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety of biological and artificial data sets and compare it to state-of-the-art approximate methods such as Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood inference.\\n\\nResultsWe show that ACE accurately reproduces the true parameters of the underlying model when they are known, and yields accurate statistical descriptions of both biological and artificial data. Models inferred by ACE have substantially better statistical performance compared to those obtained from faster Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood methods, which only precisely recover the structure of the interaction network.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe ACE source code, user manual, and tutorials with example data are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/johnbarton/ACE.\\n\\nContactsjpbarton@gmail.com, cocco@lps.ens.fr\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe dynamics of heterogeneous tumor cell populations competing with healthy cells is an important topic in cancer research with deep implications in biomedicine. Multitude of theoretical and computational models have addressed this issue, especially focusing on the nature of the transitions governing tumor clearance as some relevant model parameters are tuned. In this contribution, we analyze a mathematical model of unstable tumor progression using the quasispecies framework. Our aim is to define a minimal model incorporating the dynamics of competition between healthy cells and a heterogeneous population of cancer cell phenotypes involving changes in replication-related genes (i.e., proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes), in genes responsible for genomic stability, and in house-keeping genes. Such mutations or loss of genes result into different phenotypes with increased proliferation rates and/or increased genomic instabilities. Also, lethal phenotypes with mutations or loss of house-keeping genes are present in our model.\\n\\nResultsDespite bifurcations in the classical deterministic quasispecies model are typically given by smooth, continuous shifts (i.e., transcritical bifurcations), we here identify an novel type of abrupt transition causing tumor extinction. Such a bifurcation, named as trans-heteroclinic, is characterized by the exchange of stability between two distant fixed points (that do not collide) involving, respectively, tumor persistence and tumor clearance. The increase of mutation and/or the decrease of the replication rate of tumor cells involves this catastrophic shift of tumor cell populations. The transient times near bifurcation thresholds are also characterized, showing a power law dependence of exponent -1 of the transients as mutation is changed near the bifurcation value.\\n\\nConclusionsAn abrupt transition involving tumor clearance has been identified with a phenotypic quasispecies cancer model. This result is discussed in the context of targeted cancer therapy as a possible therapeutic strategy to force a catastrophic shift by delivering mutagenic and cytotoxic drugs inside tumor cells. Our model also reveals a novel mechanism causing a discontinuous transition given by the stability exchange of two distant fixed points, which we name as a trans-heteroclinic bifurcation.",

    "abstract": "The phase of prestimulus oscillations at 7-10 Hz has been shown to modulate perception of briefly presented visual stimuli. Specifically, a recent combined EEG-fMRI study suggested that a prestimulus oscillation at around 7 Hz represents open and closed windows for perceptual integration by modulating connectivity between lower order occipital and higher order parietal brain regions. We here utilized brief event-related transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to specifically modulate this prestimulus 7 Hz oscillation, and the synchrony between parietal and occipital brain regions. To this end we tested for a causal role of this particular prestimulus oscillation for perceptual integration. The EEG was acquired at the same time allowing us to investigate frequency specific after effects phase-locked to stimulation offset. On a behavioural level our results suggest that the tACS did modulate perceptual integration, however, in an unexpected manner. On an electrophysiological level our results suggest that brief tACS does induce oscillatory entrainment, as visible in frequency specific activity phase-locked to stimulation offset. Together, our results do not strongly support a causal role of prestimulus 7 Hz oscillations for perceptual integration. However, our results suggest that brief tACS is capable of modulating oscillatory activity in a temporally sensitive manner.",

    "abstract": "Plants are permanently exposed to rapidly changing environments, therefore it is evident that they had to evolve mechanisms enabling them to dynamically adapt to such fluctuations. Here we study how plants can be trained to enhance their photoprotection and elaborate on the concept of the short-term illumination memory in Arabidopsis thaliana. By monitoring fluorescence emission dynamics we systematically observe the extent of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) after previous light exposure to recognise and quantify the memory effect. We propose a simplified mathematical model of photosynthesis that includes the key components required for NPQ activation, which allows us to quantify the contribution to photoprotection by those components. Due to its reduced complexity, our model can be easily applied to study similar behavioural changes in other species, which we demonstrate by adapting it to the shadow-tolerant plant Epipremnum aureum. Our results indicate that a basic mechanism of short-term light memory is preserved. The slow component, accumulation of zeaxanthin, accounts for the amount of memory remaining after relaxation in darkness, while the fast one, antenna protonation, increases quenching efficiency. With our combined theoretical and experimental approach we provide a unifying framework describing common principles of key photoprotective mechanisms across species in general, mathematical terms.",

    "abstract": "Two-component signaling (TCS) is the primary means by which bacteria sense and respond to the environment. TCS involves two partner proteins working in tandem, which interact to perform cellular functions while limiting interactions with non-partners (i.e., \\\"cross-talk\\\"). We construct a Potts model for TCS that can quantitatively predict how mutating amino acid identities affect the interaction between TCS partners and non-partners. The parameters of this model are inferred directly from protein sequence data. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of exploring the sequence-space of TCS proteins. As a stringent test, we compare its predictions to a recent comprehensive mutational study, which characterized the functionality of 204 mutational variants of the PhoQ kinase in Escherichia coli. We find that our best predictions accurately reproduce the amino acid combinations found in experiment, which enable functional signaling with its partner PhoP. These predictions demonstrate the evolutionary pressure to preserve the interaction between TCS partners as well as prevent unwanted \\\"crosstalk\\\". Further, we calculate the mutational change in the binding affinity between PhoQ and PhoP, providing an estimate to the amount of destabilization needed to disrupt TCS.",
