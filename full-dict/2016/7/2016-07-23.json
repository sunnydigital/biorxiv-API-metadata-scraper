    "abstract": "Humans prioritize different semantic qualities of a complex stimulus depending on their behavioral goals. These semantic features are encoded in distributed neural populations, yet it is unclear how attention might operate across these distributed representations. To address this, we presented participants with naturalistic video clips of animals behaving in their natural environments while the participants attended to either behavior or taxonomy. We used models of representational geometry to investigate how attentional allocation affects the distributed neural representation of animal behavior and taxonomy. Attending to animal behavior transiently increased the discriminability of distributed population codes for observed actions in anterior intraparietal, pericentral, and ventral temporal cortices. Attending to animal taxonomy while viewing the same stimuli increased the discriminability of distributed animal category representations in ventral temporal cortex. For both tasks, attention selectively enhanced the discriminability of response patterns along behaviorally relevant dimensions. These findings suggest that behavioral goals alter how the brain extracts semantic features from the visual world. Attention effectively disentangles population responses for downstream read-out by sculpting representational geometry in late-stage perceptual areas.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic microbes are responsible for severe production losses in crops worldwide. The use of disease resistant crop varieties can be a sustainable approach to meet the food demand of the worlds growing population. However, classical plant breeding is usually laborious and time-consuming, thus hampering efficient improvement of many crops. With the advent of genome editing technologies, in particular the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) system, we are now able to introduce improved crop traits in a rapid and efficient manner. In this work, we genome edited durable disease resistance in tomato by modifying a specific gene associated with disease resistance. Recently, it was demonstrated that inactivation of a single gene called DMR6 (downy mildew resistance 6) confers resistance to several pathogens in Arabidopsis thaliana. This gene is specifically up-regulated during pathogen infection, and mutations in the dmr6 gene results in increased salicylic acid levels. The tomato SlDMR6-1 orthologue Solyc03g080190 is also up-regulated during infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Phytophthora capsici. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we generated tomato plants with small deletions in the SlDMR6-1 gene that result in frameshift and premature truncation of the protein. Remarkably, these mutants do not have significant detrimental effects in terms of growth and development under greenhouse conditions and show disease resistance against different pathogens, including P. syringae, P. capsici and Xanthomonas spp.",

    "abstract": "Although individual neurons can be highly selective to particular stimuli and certain upcoming actions, they can provide a complex representation of stimuli and actions at the level of population. The ability to dynamically allocate neural resources is crucial for cognitive flexibility. However, it is unclear whether cognitive flexibility emerges from changes in activity at the level of individual neurons, population, or both. By applying a combination of decoding and encoding methods to simultaneously recorded neural data, we show that while maintaining their stimulus selectivity, neurons in prefrontal cortex alter their correlated activity during various cognitive states, resulting in an enhanced representation of visual space. During a task with various cognitive states, individual prefrontal neurons maintained their limited spatial sensitivity between visual encoding and saccadic target selection whereas the population selectively improved its encoding of spatial locations far from the neurons' preferred locations. This 'encoding expansion' relied on high-dimensional neural representations and was accompanied by selective reductions in noise correlation for non-preferred locations. Our results demonstrate that through recruitment of less-informative neurons and reductions of noise correlation in their activity, the representation of space by neuronal ensembles can be dynamically enhanced, and suggest that cognitive flexibility is mainly achieved by changes in neural representation at the level of population of prefrontal neurons rather than individual neurons.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics (PGx) has the potential to personalize pharmaceutical treatments. Many relevant gene-drug associations have been discovered, but PGx guided treatment needs to be cost-effective as well as clinically beneficial to be incorporated into standard healthcare. Progress in this area can be assessed by reviewing economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of PGx testing versus standard treatment. We performed a review of economic evaluations for PGx associations listed in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labeling (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/Pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm). We determined the proportion of evaluations that found PGx guided treatment to be cost-effective or dominant over the alternative strategies, and we estimated the impact on this proportion of removing the cost of genetic testing. Of the 130 PGx associations in the FDA table, 44 economic evaluations, relating to 10 drugs, were identified. Of these evaluations, 57% drew conclusions in favour of PGx testing, of which 30% were cost-effective and 27% were dominant (cost-saving). If genetic information was freely available, 75% of economic evaluations would support PGx guided treatment, of which 25% would be cost-effective and 50% would be dominant. Thus, PGx guided treatment can be a cost-effective and even cost-saving strategy. Having genetic information readily available in the clinical health record is a realistic future prospect, and would make more genetic tests economically worthwhile. However, few drugs with PGx associations have been studied and more economic evaluations are needed to underpin the uptake of genetic testing in clinical practice.",

Here, we present Single cell Combinatorial Indexed Sequencing (SCI-seq) as a means of simultaneously generating thousands of low-pass single cell libraries for the purpose of somatic copy number variant detection. In total, we constructed libraries for 16,698 single cells from a combination of cultured cell lines, frontal cortex tissue from Macaca mulatta, and two human adenocarcinomas.

With advances in high resolution microscopy, the spatial location of different signaling molecules and the spatio-temporal dynamics of signaling microdomains are now widely acknowledged as key features of biochemical signal transduction. Reaction-diffusion mechanisms are commonly used to model such features, often with a heavy reliance on numerical simulations to obtain results. However, simulations are parameter dependent and may not be able to provide an understanding of the full range of the system responses. Analytical approaches on the other hand provide a framework to study the entire phase space. In this tutorial, we provide a largely analytical method for studying reaction-diffusion models and analyzing their stability properties.

    "abstract": "Once restricted to northern China and Mongolia, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) now enjoys a worldwide distribution due to the evolution of commensalism with humans. In contrast to black rats and the house mouse, which have tracked the regional and global development of human agricultural settlements, brown rats do not appear in the European historical record until the 1500s, suggesting their range expansion was a response to relatively recent increases in global trade and modern sea-faring. We inferred the global phylogeography of brown rats using 32k SNPs to reconstruct invasion routes from estimates of population divergence and admixture. Globally, we detected 13 evolutionary clusters within five expansion routes. One cluster arose following a southward expansion into Southeast Asia. Three additional clusters arose from two independent eastward expansions: one expansion from Russia to the Aleutian Archipelago, and a second to western North America. Rapid westward expansion resulted in the colonization of Europe from which subsequent colonization of Africa, the Americas, and Australasia occurred, and multiple evolutionary clusters were detected. An astonishing degree of fine-grained clustering found both between and within our sampling sites underscored the extent to which urban heterogeneity can shape the genetic structure of commensal rodents. Surprisingly, few individuals were recent migrants despite continual global transport, suggesting that recruitment into established populations is limited. Understanding the global population structure of R. norvegicus offers novel perspectives on the forces driving the spread of zoonotic disease, and yields greater capacity to develop targeted rat eradication programs.",

    "abstract": "Many structural and functional brain alterations accompany blindness. In normally sighted people, there is correlated individual variation in some visual pathway structures. Here we examined if the changes in brain anatomy produced by blindness alter this pattern of variation. We derived eight measures of central visual pathway anatomy from an MPRAGE image of the brain from 59 sighted and 53 blind people. These measures showed highly significant differences in mean size between the sighted and blind cohorts. When we examined the measurements across individuals within each group, we found three clusters of correlated variation, with V1 surface area and pericalcarine volume linked, and independent of the thickness of V1 cortex. These two clusters were in turn relatively independent of the volumes of the optic chiasm and lateral geniculate nucleus. This same pattern of variation in visual pathway anatomy was found in the sighted and the blind. Anatomical changes within these clusters were graded by the duration of blindness, with those subjects with a post-natal onset of blindness having alterations in brain anatomy that were intermediate to those seen in the sighted and congenitally blind. Many of the blind and sighted subjects also contributed BOLD fMRI measures of cross-modal responses within visual cortex, and a diffusion tensor imaging measure of fractional anisotropy within the optic radiations and the splenium of the corpus callosum. We again found group differences between the blind and sighted in these measures. The previously identified clusters of anatomical variation were also found to be differentially related to these additional measures: across subjects, V1 cortical thickness was related to cross-modal activation, and the volume of the optic chiasm and lateral geniculate was related to fractional anisotropy in the visual pathway. Our findings show that several of the structural and functional effects of blindness may be reduced to a smaller set of dimensions. It also seems that the changes in the brain that accompany blindness are on a continuum with normal variation found in the sighted.",

The Six/SO-family homeobox transcription factor UNC-39 governs lineage-specific neurogenesis to give rise to a neuron RID. RID bears the anatomic hallmarks of a specialized endocrine neuron: it harbors near-exclusive dense core vesicles that cluster periodically along the axon, and expresses multiple neuropeptides, including the FMRF-amide-related FLP-14. RID activity increases during forward movement. Ablating RID reduces the sustainability of forward movement, a phenotype partially recapitulated by removing FLP-14. Optogenetic depolarization of RID prolongs forward movement, an effect reduced in the absence of FLP-14. Together, these results establish the role of a neuroendocrine cell RID in sustaining a specific behavioral state in C. elegans.",
