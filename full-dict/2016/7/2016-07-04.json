    "abstract": "While cocoa plants regenerated from cryopreserved somatic embryos can demonstrate high levels of phenotypic variability, little is known about the sources of the observed variability. Previous studies have shown that the encapsulation-dehydration cryopreservation methodology imposes no significant extra mutational load since embryos carrying high levels of genetic variability are selected against during protracted culture. Also, the use of secondary rather than primary somatic embryos has been shown to further reduce the incidence of genetic somaclonal variation. Here, the effect of in vitro conservation, cryopreservation and post-cryopreservation generation of somatic embryos on the appearance of epigenetic somaclonal variation were comparatively assessed. To achieve this we compared the epigenetic profiles, generated using Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphisms, of leaves collected from the ortet tree and from cocoa somatic embryos derived from three in vitro conditions: somatic embryos, somatic embryos cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and somatic embryos generated from cryoproserved somatic embryos. Somatic embryos accumulated epigenetic changes but these were less extensive than in those regenerated after storage in LN. Furthermore, the passage of cryopreserved embryos through another embryogenic stage led to further increase in variation. Interestingly, this detected variability appears to be in some measure reversible. The outcome of this study indicates that the cryopreservation induced phenotypic variability could be, at least partially, due to DNA methylation changes.\\n\\nKey messagePhenotypic variability observed in cryostored cocoa somatic-embryos is epigenetic in nature. This variability is partially reversible, not stochastic in nature but a directed response to the in-vitro culture and cryopreservation.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brains specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.",

The use of predicted allele count for imputed SNPs as the dosage variable is known to produce valid score test for genetic association.\\n\\nMethodsIn this paper, we investigate how to best handle imputed SNPs in various modern complex tests for genetic association incorporating gene-environment interactions. We focus on case-control association studies where inference in an underlying logistic regression model can be performed using alternative methods that rely on varying degree on an assumption of gene-environment independence in the underlying population.

    "abstract": "Spatial cognition is an important model system with which to investigate how sensory signals are transformed into cognitive representations. Head direction cells, found in several cortical and subcortical regions, fire when an animal faces a given direction and express a global directional signal which is anchored by visual landmarks and underlies the \\\"sense of direction\\\". We investigated the interface between visual and spatial cortical brain regions and report the discovery that a population of neurons in the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex, which we co-recorded with classic head direction cells in a rotationally symmetrical two-compartment environment, were dominated by a local visually defined reference frame and could be decoupled from the main head direction signal. A second population showed rotationally symmetric activity within a single sub-compartment suggestive of an acquired interaction with the head direction cells. These observations reveal an unexpected incoherence within the head direction system, and suggest that dysgranular retrosplenial cortex may mediate between visual landmarks and the multimodal sense of direction. Importantly, it appears that this interface supports a bi-directional exchange of information, which could explain how it is that landmarks can inform the direction sense while at the same time, the direction sense can be used to interpret landmarks.",

Analysis of constitutive CME is complicated by the fact that initiation of endocytic events is unpredictable. When and where a clathrin-coated pit will form and what cargo it will contain are difficult to foresee. Here we describe a series of genetically encoded reporters that allow the initiation of CME on demand. This is achieved by inducibly tethering a clathrin \\\"hook\\\" to a plasma membrane \\\"anchor\\\". Our design incorporates temporal and spatial control of initiation using chemical and optical tools, and the cargo is defined. Since this system bypasses multiple steps in vesicle creation, we term it \\\"hot-wiring\\\". In this paper, we use hot-wired endocytosis to define the functional interactions between clathrin and the {beta}2 subunit of the AP2 complex. However, there are numerous applications for this new technology, which we hope will be broadly useful to the field.",

    "abstract": "Understanding protein-DNA binding affinity is still a mystery for many transcription factors (TFs). Although several approaches have been proposed in the literature to model the DNA-binding specificity of TFs, they still have some limitations. Most of the methods require a cut-off threshold in order to classify a K-mer as a binding site (BS) and finding such a threshold is usually done by handcraft rather than a science. Some other approaches use a prior knowledge on the biological context of regulatory elements in the genome along with machine learning algorithms to build classifier models for TFBSs. Noticeably, these methods deliberately select the training and testing datasets so that they are very separable. Hence, the current methods do not actually capture the TF-DNA binding relationship. In this paper, we present a threshold-free framework based on a novel ensemble learning algorithm in order to locate TFBSs in DNA sequences. Our proposed approach creates TF-specific classifier models using genome-wide DNA-binding experiments and a prior biological knowledge on DNA sequences and TF binding preferences. Systematic background filtering algorithms are utilized to remove non-functional K-mers from training and testing datasets. To reduce the complexity of classifier models, a fast feature selection algorithm is employed. Finally, the created classifier models are used to scan new DNA sequences and identify potential binding sites. The analysis results show that our proposed approach is able to identify novel binding sites in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.\\n\\nContactmonther.alhamdoosh@unimelb.edu.au, dh.wang@latrobe.edu.au\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://homepage.cs.latrobe.edu.au/dwang/DNNESCANweb",

Improving the accuracy and efficiency of motion correction can lead to further resolution improvement. Based on observations that the electron beam induces doming of the thin vitreous ice layer, we developed an algorithm to correct anisotropic image motion at the single pixel level across the whole frame, suitable for both single particle and tomographic images. Iterative, patch-based motion detection is combined with spatial and temporal constraints and dose weighting. The multi-GPU accelerated program, MotionCor2, is sufficiently fast to keep up with automated data collection. The result is an exceptionally robust strategy that can work on a wide range of data sets, including those very close to focus or with very short integration times, obviating the need for particle polishing. Application significantly improves Thon ring quality and 3D reconstruction resolution.",

We argue that urban plant communities assemble from a complex mix of horticultural and regional species pools and thus evaluate the homogenisation hypothesis by comparing cultivated and spontaneously occurring urban vegetation to natural area vegetation across seven major US cities. Urban yards were homogenised across cities in terms of their diversity, composition, and structure. First, cultivated and spontaneous yard flora had higher numbers of species than did natural areas but similar phylogenetic diversity, indicating that yard species were drawn from a relatively small number of lineages. Second, yards were compositionally more similar across regions than were natural areas. Finally, vegetation structure, specifically cultivated tree density, was less variable in yards than natural areas across cities. Biodiversity homogenisation likely reflects similar horticultural source pools, homeowner preferences, management practices, and environmental filters across US cities.",

In the present work, we explore the effect that the ordering of natural selection and population regulation in the life cycle has on the resulting population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model, especially for the evolution of one- and two-locus systems. With weak natural selection, the details of how to order natural selection and population regulation in the life cycle do not matter in the Wright-Fisher model and its diffusion approximation. By contrast, we show that when there is strong natural selection and the population is in linkage disequilibrium, there can be appreciable differences in the resulting population dynamics under the Wright-Fisher model, depending on whether natural selection occurs before or after population regulation in the life cycle. We argue that this effect may be of significance in natural populations subject to gene migration and local selection.\\n\\nF.Y. supported in part by EPSRC Grant EP/I028498/1.",

We present Tempus et Locus (TeL), a tool for extracting such sequences from a GenBank-formatted sequence database. TeL shows that 60% of viral sequences in GenBank have collection date fields, but that this varies considerably between species. Primate erythroparvovirus 1 (human parvovirus B19 or B19V) has only 40% of its sequences dated, of which only 112 are of more than 4 kb. 100 of these are from B19V sub-genotype 1a and were collected from a mere 6 studies conducted in 5 countries between 2002 and 2013. Nevertheless, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of this limited set gives a date for the common ancestor of sub-genotype 1a in 1990 (95% HPD 1981-1996) which is in reasonable agreement with estimates of previous studies where collection dates have been assembled by more laborious methods of literature search and direct enquiries to sequence submitters.
