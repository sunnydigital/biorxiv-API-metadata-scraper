    "abstract": "Environmental Gene Regulatory Influence Networks (EGRINs) coordinate the timing and rate of gene expression in response to environmental and developmental signals. EGRINs encompass many layers of regulation, which culminate in changes in the level of accumulated transcripts. Here we infer EGRINs for the response of five tropical Asian rice cultivars to high temperatures, water deficit, and agricultural field conditions, by systematically integrating time series transcriptome data (720 RNA-seq libraries), patterns of nucleosome-free chromatin (18 ATAC-seq libraries), and the occurrence of known cis-regulatory elements. First, we identify 5,447 putative target genes for 445 transcription factors (TFs) by connecting TFs with genes with known cis-regulatory motifs in nucleosome-free chromatin regions proximal to transcriptional start sites (TSS) of genes. We then use network component analysis to estimate the regulatory activity for these TFs from the expression of these putative target genes. Finally, we inferred an EGRIN using the estimated TFA as the regulator. The EGRIN included regulatory interactions between 4,052 target genes regulated by 113 TFs. We resolved distinct regulatory roles for members of a large TF family, including a putative regulatory connection between abiotic stress and the circadian clock, as well as specific regulatory functions for TFs in the drought response. TFA estimation using network component analysis is an effective way of incorporating multiple genome-scale measurements into network inference and that supplementing data from controlled experimental conditions with data from outdoor field conditions increases the resolution for EGRIN inference.",

    "abstract": "Despite an increasing number of studies documenting life-history evolution during range expansions or shifts, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the underlying physiological processes. In this explorative study, we used a metabolomics approach to study physiological changes associated with the recent range expansion of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae). Mite populations were sampled along a latitudinal gradient from range core to edge and reared under benign common garden conditions for two generations. Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), we obtained metabolic population profiles, which showed a gradual differentiation along the latitudinal gradient, indicating (epi)genetic changes in the metabolome in association with range expansion. These changes seemed not related with shifts in the mites energetic metabolism, but rather with differential use of amino acids. Particularly, more dispersive northern populations showed lowered concentrations of several essential and non-essential amino acids, suggesting a potential downregulation of metabolic pathways associated with protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Temporal asynchrony among species helps diversity to stabilize ecosystem functioning, but identifying the mechanisms that determine synchrony remains a challenge. Here, we refine and test theory showing that synchrony depends on three factors: species responses to environmental variation, interspecific interactions, and demographic stochasticity. We then conduct simulation experiments with empirical population models to quantify the relative influence of these factors on the synchrony of dominant species in five semiarid grasslands. We found that the average synchrony of per capita growth rates, which can range from 0 (perfect asynchrony) to 1 (perfect synchrony), was higher when environmental variation was present (0.62) rather than absent (0.43). Removing interspecific interactions and demographic stochasticity had small effects on synchrony. For the dominant species in these plant communities, where species interactions and demographic stochasticity have little influence, synchrony reflects the covariance in species responses to the environment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe daily gene expression oscillations that underlie mammalian circadian rhythms show striking tissue differences and involve post-transcriptional regulation. Both aspects remain poorly understood. We have used ribosome profiling to explore the contribution of translation efficiency to temporal gene expression in kidney, and contrasted our findings with liver data available from the same mice.\\n\\nRESULTSRhythmic translation of constantly abundant mRNAs affected largely non-overlapping transcript sets with distinct phase clustering in the two organs. Moreover, tissue differences in translation efficiency modulated the timing and amount of protein biosynthesis from rhythmic mRNAs, consistent with organ-specificity in clock output gene repertoires and rhythmicity parameters. Our comprehensive datasets provided insights into translational control beyond temporal regulation. Between tissues, many transcripts showed differences in translation efficiency, which were, however, of markedly smaller scale than mRNA abundance differences. Tissue-specific changes in translation efficiency were associated with specific transcript features and, intriguingly, globally counteracted and compensated transcript abundance variations, leading to higher similarity at the level of protein biosynthesis between both tissues.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe show that tissue-specificity in rhythmic gene expression extends to the translatome and contributes to define the identities, the phases and the expression levels of rhythmic protein biosynthesis. Moreover, translational compensation of transcript abundance divergence leads to overall higher similarity at the level of protein production across organs. The unique resources provided through our study will serve to address fundamental questions of post-transcriptional control and differential gene expression in vivo.",

    "abstract": "When spinal circuits generate rhythmic movements it is important that the neuronal activity remains within stable bounds to avoid saturation and to preserve responsiveness. In what dynamical regime does the neuronal population operate in order to achieve this? Here, we simultaneously record from hundreds of neurons in lumbar spinal circuits and establish the neuronal fraction that operates within either a  mean-driven or a  fluctuation-driven regime during generation of multiple motor behaviors. We find a rich diversity of firing rates across the neuronal population as reflected in a lognormal distribution and demonstrate that half of the neurons spend at least 50% of the time in the  fluctuation-driven regime regardless of behavior. Since neurons in this regime have a  supralinear input-output curve, which enhances sensitivity, whereas the mean-driven regime reduces sensitivity, this fraction may reflect a fine trade-off between stability and sensitivity in order to maintain flexibility across motor behaviors.",

Here we performed a genetic mapping study of the microbiome in two accessible upper airway sites, the nasopharynx and the nasal vestibule, during two seasons in 144 adult members of a founder population of European decent. We estimated the relative abundances (RAs) of genus level bacteria from 16S rRNA gene sequences and examined associations with 148,653 genetic variants (linkage disequilibrium [LD] r2 < 0.5) selected from among all common variants discovered in genome sequences in this population. We identified 37 microbiome quantitative trait loci (mbQTLs) that showed evidence of association with the RAs of 22 genera (q < 0.05), and were enriched for genes in mucosal immunity pathways. The most significant association was between the RA of Dermacoccus (phylum Actinobacteria) and a variant 8kb upstream of TINCR (rs117042385; p = 1.61[x]10-8; q = 0.002), a long non-coding RNA that binds to peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (PGLYRP3) mRNA, a gene encoding a known antimicrobial protein.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe 3D organization of the genome changes concomitantly with expression changes during hematopoiesis and immune activation. However, studies of this phenomenon have focused either on lamina-associated domains (LADs) or on topologically-associated domains (TADs), defined by preferential local chromatin interactions, and chromosome compartments, defined as higher-order interactions between TADs in functionally similar states. However, few studies have investigated how these affect one another. To address this, we mapped LADs using Lamin B1-DamID during Jurkat T-cell activation, finding significant genome re-organization at the nuclear periphery dominated by release of loci frequently important for T-cell function. To assess how these changes at the nuclear periphery influence wider genome organization, our DamID datasets were contrasted with TAD contact domains and compartments identified with high resolution in the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line. Features of specific repositioning events were then tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization. First, considerable overlap between TAD contact domains and LADs was observed and we found that the TAD repositioned as a unit during T-cell activation. Second, sub-compartments of the A compartment, termed A1 and A2, are segregated in 3D space through differences in proximity to LADs along chromosomes. Third, genes and a putative enhancer that occurred in LADs that were released from the periphery during T-cell activation tended to become associated particularly with A2 sub-compartments and were thus constrained to the relative proximity of the lamina. Thus, lamina-associations clearly influence internal nuclear organization while changes in LADs during T-cell activation may provide an important additional mode of gene regulation.",

It conditions the evolutionary trajectory of populations, as well as the rate of adaptive molecular evolution (). Inference of DFE and  from patterns of polymorphism (SFS) and divergence data has been a longstanding goal of evolutionary genetics. A widespread assumption shared by numerous methods developed so far to infer DFE and  from such data is that beneficial mutations contribute only negligibly to the polymorphism data. Hence, a DFE comprising only deleterious mutations tends to be estimated from SFS data, and  is only predicted by contrasting the SFS with divergence data from an outgroup. Here, we develop a hierarchical probabilistic framework that extends on previous methods and also can infer DFE and  from polymorphism data alone. We use extensive simulations to examine the performance of our method. We show that both a full DFE, comprising both deleterious and beneficial mutations, and  can be inferred without resorting to divergence data. We demonstrate that inference of DFE from polymorphism data alone can in fact provide more reliable estimates, as it does not rely on strong assumptions about a shared DFE between the outgroup and ingroup species used to obtain the SFS and divergence data. We also show that not accounting for the contribution of beneficial mutations to polymorphism data leads to substantially biased estimates of the DFE and . We illustrate these points using our newly developed framework, while also comparing to one of the most widely used inference methods available.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has become popular in studies involving intracranial and scalp EEG recordings in humans. It has been argued that some cases where CFC is mathematically present may not reflect an interaction of two distinct yet functionally coupled neural sources with different frequencies. Here we provide two empirical examples from intracranial recordings where CFC can be shown to be driven by the shape of a periodic waveform rather than by a functional interaction between distinct sources. Using simulations, we also present a generalized and realistic scenario where such coupling may arise. This scenario, which we term waveform-dependent CFC, arises when sharp waveforms (e.g., cortical potentials) occur in a periodic manner throughout parts of the data. Since the waveforms are repeated periodically, they constitute a slow wave that is inherently phase-aligned with the high-frequency component carried by the same waveforms. We submit that such behavior of the data, which seems to be present in various cortical signals, cannot be interpreted as reflecting functional modulation between distinct neural sources without additional evidence. In addition, we show that even low amplitude periodic potentials that cannot be readily observed or controlled for, are sufficient for significant CFC to occur.",

Two-photon scanning and parallel illumination strategies applied to ChR2- and C1V1-expressing neurons demonstrated reliable, in-depth generation of action potentials both in-vitro and in-vivo, but thus far lack the temporal precision necessary to induce precisely timed spiking events. Here, we show that efficient current integration enabled by two-photon holographic amplified laser illumination of Chronos, a highly light-sensitive and fast opsin, can evoke spikes with submillisecond precision and repeated firing up to 100 Hz. These results pave the way for optogenetic manipulation with the spatial and temporal sophistication necessary to mimic natural microcircuit activity.",

    "abstract": "We report the discovery that the locomotor trajectories generated by crawling fruit fly larvae follow the same power law relationship between speed and curvature previously found in the human motor control of hand-drawing, walking, eye movements and speech. Using high resolution behavioral tracking of individual flies in different sensory environments, we tested the power law by making maggots trace different trajectory types in naturalistic conditions, from reaching-like movements to scribbles. In all these conditions, we found that the law holds, and also that the exponent of the larval scaling law approaches 3/4, rather than the usual 2/3 exponent found in almost all human situations. This is consistent with recent findings on humans drawing ellipses on water, where dynamic effects related to medium viscosity have been shown to increase the exponent that would emerge from purely kinematic-geometric constraints. To our knowledge, the speed-curvature power law has only been studied in human and non-human primates, our work then being the first demonstration of the speed-curvature scaling principle in other species. As there are still different competing hypotheses for the origin of such law in humans (one invoking complex cortical computations in primates; another postulating its emergence from the coupling of viscoelastic muscle properties with simple central pattern generation) our findings in the larva demonstrate that the law is possible in an animal with a nervous system orders of magnitude simpler than that of humans, thus supporting the latter view. Given that our discovery is in Drosophila (amenable to precise genetic manipulations, electron microscopy reconstruction of neural circuits, imaging in behaving animals, electrophysiology, and other techniques) this opens great potential for uncovering the mechanistic implementation of the velocity-curvature power law. Such scaling laws might exist because natural selection favors processes that remain behaviorally efficient across a wide range of contexts in distantly related species. Our work is an effort to search for shared principles of animal behavior across phyla.",

The Mahalanobis distance has been widely used for this purpose, but has the major limitation of assuming that data follow a simple parametric distribution.

These metrics are implemented in the R package MINOTAUR, which also includes an interactive web-based application for visualizing outliers in high-dimensional datasets.

Standard normalization techniques fail to correct for these latent variables and leads to a substantial reduction in the power of common statistical tests for differential expression.

As a result, HINGE combines the error resilience of overlap-based assemblers with repeat-resolution capabilities of de Bruijn graph assemblers. HINGE was evaluated on the long-read bacterial datasets from the NCTC project. HINGE produces more finished assemblies than Miniasm and the manual pipeline of NCTC based on the HGAP assembler and Circlator. HINGE also allows us to identify 40 datasets where unresolvable repeats prevent the reliable construction of a unique finished assembly. In these cases, HINGE outputs a visually interpretable assembly graph that encodes all possible finished assemblies consistent with the reads, while other approaches such as the NCTC pipeline and FALCON either fragment the assembly or resolve the ambiguity arbitrarily.",

    "abstract": "Although the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is widely acknowledged to be a poor indicator of the quality of individual papers, it is used routinely to evaluate research and researchers. Here, we present a simple method for generating the citation distributions that underlie JIFs. Application of this straightforward protocol reveals the full extent of the skew of distributions and variation in citations received by published papers that is characteristic of all scientific journals. Although there are differences among journals across the spectrum of JIFs, the citation distributions overlap extensively, demonstrating that the citation performance of individual papers cannot be inferred from the JIF. We propose that this methodology be adopted by all journals as a move to greater transparency, one that should help to refocus attention on individual pieces of work and counter the inappropriate usage of JIFs during the process of research assessment.",

One of the main resources of such information is SABIO-RK, a curated database for kinetic data of biochemical reactions and their related information. Despite the importance for computational modelling there has been no simple solution to visualize the kinetic data from SABIO-RK.\\n\\nIn this work, I present cy3sabiork, an app for querying and visualization of kinetic data from SABIO-RK in Cytoscape. The kinetic information is accessible via a combination of graph structure and annotations of nodes, with provided information consisting of: (I) reaction details, enzyme and organism; (II) kinetic law, formula, parameters; (III) experimental conditions; (IV) publication; (V) additional annotations. cy3sabiork creates an intuitive visualization of kinetic entries in form of a species-reaction-kinetics graph, which reflects the reaction-centered approach of SABIO-RK. Kinetic entries can be imported in SBML format from either the SABIO-RK web interface or via web service queries. The app allows for easy comparison of kinetic data, visual inspection of the elements involved in the kinetic record and simple access to the annotation information of the kinetic record.\\n\\nI applied cy3sabiork in the computational modelling of galactose metabolism in the Human liver.",

    "abstract": "Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition. Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental, behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex, per se, from other factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first summarize the evolution, development and maintenance of ARTS. We then review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS, dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS. Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but it is perhaps time that they take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as \"immunocompetence\" and \"androgens\" might useful to develop a rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated. Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving deeper into physiology, seemingly at the cost of ignoring their organisms evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being increasingly recognized, including in species with ARTS, but we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.",

    "abstract": "In recombinant protein production, quantity and quality are the major challenges particularly for large scale and high-throughput production systems. The present study mainly focused on computational analysis and in silico systematic discovery of some key functional gene expression elements in microalgae Dunaliella salina as a case study which there is no or poor information in this regard. Among the key factors, we took a shot at matrix attachment regions (MARs), translation initiation sites (TIS), signal peptide (SP) sequences, gene optimization and transformation system. Computational analysis of MARs sequences provided enough information about the structure of these sequences and led us to design an artificial MAR sequence considering the essential motifs and underlain rules. As the consensus TIS, we revealed that A-3, G-6C-5C-4 and G+1C+2G+3 arrange the specific context in this microalgae which help in locating the ribosome at the correct reading frame. Bioinformatics studies unveiled the sequence of MASTRAPLLALLALLCAGSARA with the highest signal score as the specific SP for secretion systems. A multi-criteria optimization procedure was performed to redesign the coding sequence of the BAR selectable marker gene. The optimized version of the gene mainly covered the host codon preference, the less structured mRNA and exposure of TIS. As the intragenic factors, we selected an efficient promoter, a 5'-UTR and an intron from the closely related species (Chlamydomonas Sp.) to construct the specific expression vectors. The expression cassettes containing optimized genetic elements could be delivered into the microalgae cells and conferred the resistance to the transformants for at least 90 generations. The findings indicated that the MARs flanking the expression cassette along with the optimized expression elements particularly codon adaptation could potentially improve transformation efficiency and stability. The findings can be efficiently deployed as an empirical model for systematic discovery of the key expression elements and optimization of the cis/transgenes.",

    "abstract": "We assess the prospects for ending AIDS in South Africa using a dynamical model to fit data on time trends in HIV prevalence and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) coverage for adults. We estimate current and project future trends in HIV incidence, prevalence and AIDS related deaths, in ART coverage and incidence, and in TB notification rates. We consider two scenarios: constant effort under which people continue to be started on treatment at the current rate and expanded treatment and prevention under which testing rates are increased, everyone is started on treatment as soon as they are found to be infected with HIV, and voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis and condom distribution programmes are expanded.\\n\\nAs a result of the roll-out of ART the incidence of HIV has fallen from a peak of 2.3% per annum in 1996 to 0.65% in 2016, the AIDS related mortality from a peak of 1.4% per annum in 2006 to 0.37% p.a. in 2016 and both continue to fall at a relative rate of 17% p.a. Maintaining a policy of constant effort will lead to further declines in HIV incidence, AIDS related mortality and TB notification rates but will not end AIDS. Implementing a policy of expanded treatment and prevention in September 2016 should ensure that by 2020 new infections and deaths will be less than one per thousand adults and the UNAIDS Goal of Ending AIDS by 2030 will be reached. Scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis and condom availability will avert some new infections but will save relatively few lives. Nevertheless, equity demands that people at very high risk of infection including commercial sex-workers, men-who-have-sex-with-men and young women should have access to the best available methods of prevention.\\n\\nThe current cost to the health services of managing HIV and TB among adults in South Africa is about US$2.1 Bn p.a. (0.6% of GDP p.a.) and this will rise to a peak of US$2.7 Bn p.a. in 2018 (0.8% GDP p.a.). As treatment is scaled up and prevention made available to those at high risk, the cost will fall to US$ 1.8 Bn p.a. in 2030 and US$ 1.0 Bn p.a. in 2050 as those that are living with HIV on ART, die of natural causes. The cost of testing people for HIV is never more than about 8% of the total cost and since testing is the sine qua non of treatment it will be essential to invest sufficient resources in testing. The cost of treating tuberculosis is never more than about 10% of the total and since this is the major cause of AIDS related illness and deaths, efforts should be made to optimise TB treatment.\\n\\nEnding AIDS in the world will depend critically on what happens in South Africa which accounts for 20% of all people living with HIV. The increasing availability of ART has had a major impact on both HIV incidence and AIDS related mortality and universal access to ART is affordable. With the commitment to make treatment available to all those infected with HIV in September 2016, the South African government is well placed to eliminate HIV as a major threat to public health by 2020 and to end AIDS by 2030. Individuals at high risk of infection deserve access to the best available methods of protecting themselves and they will become increasingly important in the final stages of ending the epidemic.",

We show that affinity discrimination between B cells is driven by a competition between obtaining T cell help and removal of B cells from the light zone, either through apoptosis or by a return to the dark zone of germinal centers. We demonstrate that this mechanism also allows for the negative selection of self reactive B cells and maintenance of B cell tolerance during the germinal center reaction. Finally, we demonstrate that clonal expansion upon return to the germinal center dark zone amplifies differences in the antigen affinity of B cells that survive the light zone.",

Statistical modeling reveals protective HA imprinting to be the crucial explanatory factor, providing 75% protection against severe infection and 80% protection against death for both H5N1 and H7N9. Our results enable us to predict age distributions of severe disease for future pandemics and to demonstrate that a novel strains pandemic potential increases yearly when a group-mismatched HA subtype dominates seasonal influenza circulation.
