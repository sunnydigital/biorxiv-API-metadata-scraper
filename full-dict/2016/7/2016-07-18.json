    "abstract": "Hearing, vision, touch -- underlying all of these senses is stimulus selectivity, a robust information processing operation in which cortical neurons respond more to some stimuli than to others. Previous models assume that these neurons receive the highest weighted input from an ensemble encoding the preferred stimulus, but dendrites enable other possibilities. Non-linear dendritic processing can produce stimulus selectivity based on the spatial distribution of synapses, even if the total preferred stimulus weight does not exceed that of non-preferred stimuli. Using a multi-subunit non-linear model, we demonstrate that selectivity can arise from the spatial distribution of synapses. Moreover, we show that this implementation of stimulus selectivity increases the neuron's robustness to synaptic and dendritic failure. Contrary to an equivalent linear model, our model can maintain stimulus selectivity even when 50% of synapses fail or when more than 50% of dendrites fail. We then use a Layer 2/3 biophysical neuron model to show that our implementation is consistent with recent experimental observations, of a mixture of selectivities in dendrites, that can differ from the somatic selectivity, and of hyperpolarization broadening somatic tuning without affecting dendritic tuning. Our model predicts that an initially non-selective neuron can become selective when depolarized. In addition to motivating new experiments, the model's increased robustness to synapses and dendrites loss provides a starting point for fault-resistant neuromorphic chip development.",

    "abstract": "A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.",

    "abstract": "Complement is an important pathway in innate immunity, inflammation, and many disease processes. However, despite its importance, there are few validated mathematical models of complement activation. In this study, we developed an ensemble of experimentally validated reduced order complement models. We combined ordinary differential equations with logical rules to produce a compact yet predictive model of complement activation. The model, which described the lectin and alternative pathways, was an order of magnitude smaller than comparable models in the literature. We estimated an ensemble of model parameters from in vitro dynamic measurements of the C3a and C5a complement proteins. Subsequently, we validated the model on unseen C3a and C5a measurements not used for model training. Despite its small size, the model was surprisingly predictive. Global sensitivity and robustness analysis suggested complement was robust to any single therapeutic intervention. Only the simultaneous knockdown of both C3 and C5 consistently reduced C3a and C5a formation from all pathways. Taken together, we developed a validated mathematical model of complement activation that was computationally inexpensive, and could easily be incorporated into pre-existing or new pharmacokinetic models of immune system function. The model described experimental data, and predicted the need for multiple points of therapeutic intervention to fully disrupt complement activation.",

Yet, phylogenetic scale has never been formally conceptualized and its potential remains largely unexplored. Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields, and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions.\\n\\nMethodsWe summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography, and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale-dependence, scaling, and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be employed to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism, or species-abundance distributions.\\n\\nMain conclusionsExplicit consideration of phylogenetic scale can provide new and more complete insight into many longstanding questions across multiple fields (macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography, macroevolution). Building on the existing resources and isolated efforts across fields, future research centered on phylogenetic scale might enrich our understanding of the processes that together, but over different scales, shape the diversity of life.",

    "abstract": "What is the ultimate limiting nutrient in the ocean? The dominant theory, which was first proposed by Redfield and later formalized by Tyrrell[1, 2], states that despite the scarcity of fixed nitrogen (N) in the surface ocean, phosphorus (P) availability ultimately determines primary productivity. Two recent findings directly challenge the assumptions of the Redfield-Tyrrell paradigm: the discovery of systematic variations of phytoplankton cellular N:P:Fe and widespread iron-limitation of phytoplankton. Here we use a simple model of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron (Fe) cycling to show how the resource demand ratios and biogeography of phytoplankton interact with external resource supply ratios to govern nutrient cycling and primary productivity. We find that all three nutrients can limit global primary productivity, and that the ratio of geochemical supply to biological demand of each nutrient in each ocean region determines the limiting nutrients, with nitrogen N fixation providing a mechanism for the cycles to interact. These results have important consequences for our understanding of biogeochemical cycles, ocean-atmosphere interactions, marine ecology, and the response of ocean ecosystems to climate change. Our work demonstrates the importance of resource ratios and suggests that future studies of the physiological and geochemical regulation of these ratios are indispensable to building accurate theories and future predictions of nutrient cycling and primary productivity.",

    "abstract": "The ClC family of transmembrane proteins functions throughout nature to control the transport of Cl- ions across biological membranes. ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli is an antiporter, coupling the transport of Cl- and H+ ions in opposite directions and driven by the concentration gradients of the ions. Despite keen interest in this protein, the molecular mechanism of the Cl-/H+ coupling has not been fully elucidated. Here, we have used multiscale simulation to help identify the essential mechanism of the Cl-/H+ coupling. We find that the highest barrier for proton transport (PT) from the intra- to extracellular solution is attributable to a chemical reaction--the deprotonation of glutamic acid 148 (E148). This barrier is significantly reduced by the binding of Cl- in the \\\"central\\\" site (Cl-cen), which displaces E148 and thereby facilitates its deprotonation. Conversely, in the absence of Cl-cen E148 favors the \\\"down\\\" conformation, which results in a much higher cumulative rotation and deprotonation barrier that effectively blocks PT to the extracellular solution. Thus, the rotation of E148 plays a critical role in defining the Cl-/H+ coupling. As a control, we have also simulated PT in the ClC-ec1 E148A mutant to further understand the role of this residue. Replacement with a non-protonatable residue greatly increases the free energy barrier for PT from E203 to the extracellular solution, explaining the experimental result that PT in E148A is blocked whether or not Cl-cen is present. The results presented here suggest both how a chemical reaction can control the rate of PT and also how it can provide a mechanism for a coupling of the two ion transport processes.",

These proteins are important for formation of Spo11-catalyzed DSB, but their contribution to crossover recombination is undefined. By studying meiotic recombination initiated by the sequence-specific VMA1-derived endonuclease (VDE), we show that meiotic chromosome structure helps to determine the biochemical mechanism by which recombination intermediates are resolved to form crossovers. At a Hop1-enriched locus, most VDE-initiated crossovers required the MutL{gamma} resolvase, which forms most Spo11-initiated crossovers. In contrast, at a locus with lower Hop1 occupancy, most VDE-initiated crossovers were MutL{gamma}-independent. In pch2 mutants, the two loci displayed similar Hop1 occupancy levels, and also displayed similar MutL{gamma}-dependence of VDE-induced crossovers. We suggest that meiotic and mitotic recombination pathways coexist within meiotic cells, with features of meiotic chromosome structure partitioning the genome into regions where one pathway or the other predominates.",

    "abstract": "The concept of \\\"genetic bandwagoning\\\" is introduced. In genetic bandwagoning, a bandwagoning allele evaluates the outlook for lineage fitness of the individual holding the allele. If its holders lineage fitness figures to be low, the bandwagoning allele induces its holder to relinquish some, or all, of the holders own resources (e.g., food, territory, mates), which are then used by individuals that happen to be nearby. While some nearby individuals may not possess a copy of the bandwagoning allele, it is likely, if assortment is sufficiently positive, that numerous individuals do and most of those that do have a better lineage fitness outlook than that of the individual that was induced to forfeit the resources, since the inducement is contingent upon a poor lineage fitness outlook. Due to their better lineage fitness outlook, the nearby individuals make better usage of the resources than the forfeiting individuals would have and the ratio between the quantity of descendants nearby individuals produce with the resources and the quantity of descendants that would have been produced by the forfeiting individuals tends to increase with each generation due to multiple reasons examined in section 2. If assortment is sufficiently positive, more copies of the allele are produced over the ensuing generations than if the resources had not been forfeited, as the allele is selected by \\\"jumping on the bandwagon\\\" of these fit lineages that use the resources.\\n\\nTwo ways to bandwagon are introduced: resonation and reservation. In resonation, the bandwagoning allele accomplishes the two steps of bandwagoning--1) evaluating its holders lineage fitness outlook and 2) inducing a holder with a low (i.e., poor) outlook to relinquish resources--sequentially. The necessity for reservation occurs because a lineages fitness outlook can depend upon aspects of quality which are difficult to evaluate during a generation in which many individuals are able to avoid death or serious harm. In reservation, a bandwagoning allele solves this problem of evaluating quality by inducing its holder to reserve from (i.e., withhold) some of its ability to survive against one or more natural enemies, particularly predators or parasites: An individual that can remain healthy in spite of reserving from its ability to survive predators or parasites is likely to have genes that enable its descendants to survive when the predator or parasite threat is more severe; however, if the individual perishes or becomes sick as a result of reservation, its lineage fitness outlook is determined to be low and the relinquishment of resources occurs with this same perishing or sickness. That is, the individuals perishing or sickness due to reservation serves simultaneously: 1) to identify that individual as having a low lineage fitness outlook and 2) as the source of relinquishing the individuals resources on the basis of this low lineage fitness outlook.\\n\\nGenetic bandwagoning constitutes a novel mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Numerous paradoxes can be explained by the actions of bandwagoning alleles that use a combination of resonation and reservation, including the phenotypic cooccurrences of robust defenses against parasites and depressive symptoms; phenotypic cooccurrences of robust defenses against parasites and photosynthetic costs; phenotypic cooccurrences of susceptibility to parasites and androgenic benefits; the maintenance of honest signals when there are opportunities to cheat; the forfeiture of reproductive opportunities by functionally capable individuals; and the differential nurturing of offspring.",

Sensorimotor variability was measured in a laboratory setting by simple button depressions and scalp electrodes (electroencephalogram, EEG). The ms range trial-to-trial variability in button depression was directly proportional to the number of social touches and inversely proportional to non-social touches. Variability of the early tactile somatosensory potentials was also proportional to the number of social touches, but not to non-social touches. The number of Apps and the speed of touchscreen use also reflected this variability. We suggest that smartphone use affects elementary computations even in tasks not involving a phone and that social activities uniquely reconfigure the thumb to touchscreen use.\\n\\nImpact StatementUnconstrained behavior on a smartphone is a powerful predictor of neuronal functions measured in the laboratory and the details of the smartphone-neuronal association challenges the established ideas of brain plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Gompertz empirical law of mortality is often used in practical research to parametrize survival fraction as a function of age with the help of just two quantities: the Initial Mortality Rate (IMR) and the Gompertz exponent, inversely proportional to the Mortality Rate Doubling Time (MRDT). The IMR is often found to be inversely related to the Gompertz exponent, which is the dependence commonly referred to as Strehler-Mildvan (SM) correlation. In this paper, we address fundamental uncertainties of the Gompertz parameters inference from experimental Kaplan-Meier plots and show, that a least squares fit often leads to an ill-defined non-linear optimization problem, which is extremely sensitive to sampling errors and the smallest systematic demographic variations. Therefore, an analysis of consequent repeats of the same experiments in the same biological conditions yields the whole degenerate manifold of possible Gompertz parameters. We find that whenever the average lifespan of species greatly exceeds MRDT, small random variations in the survival records produce large deviations in the identified Gompertz parameters along the line, corresponding to the set of all possible IMR and MRDT values, roughly compatible with the properly determined value of average lifespan in experiment. The best fit parameters in this case turn out to be related by a form of SM correlation. Therefore, we have to conclude that the combined property, such as the average lifespan in the group, rather than IMR and MRDT values separately, may often only be reliably determined via experiments, even in a perfectly homogeneous animal cohort due to its finite size and/or low age-sampling frequency, typical for modern high-throughput settings. We support our findings with careful analysis of experimental survival records obtained in cohorts of C. elegans of different sizes, in control groups and under the influence of experimental therapies or environmental conditions. We argue that since, SM correlation may show up as a consequence of the fitting degeneracy, its appearance is not limited to homogeneous cohorts. In fact, the problem persists even beyond the simple Gompertz mortality law. We show that the same degeneracy occurs exactly in the same way, if a more advanced Gompertz-Makeham aging model is employed to improve the modeling. We explain how SM type of relation between the demographic parameters may still be observed even in extremely large cohorts with immense statistical power, such as in human census datasets, provided that systematic historical changes are weak in nature and lead to a gradual change in the mean lifespan.",

Benchmarking versus five state-of-art tools shows that FEELnc achieves similar or better classification performance on GENCODE and NONCODE datasets. The program also provides several specific modules that enable to fine-tune classification accuracy, to formalize the annotation of lncRNA classes and to annotate lncRNAs even in the absence of training set of noncoding RNAs. We used FEELnc on a real dataset comprising 20 new canine RNA-seq samples produced in the frame of the European LUPA consortium to expand the canine genome annotation and classified 10,374 novel lncRNAs and 58,640 new mRNA transcripts. FEELnc represents a standardized protocol for identifying and annotating lncRNAs and is freely accessible at https://github.com/tderrien/FEELnc.",

    "abstract": "Although the sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas, is the seventh most important crop in the world and the fourth most significant in China, its genome has not yet been sequenced. The reason, at least in part, is that the genome has proven very difficult to assemble, being hexaploid and highly polymorphic; it has a presumptive composition of two B1 and four B2 component genomes (B1B1B2B2B2B2). By using a novel haplotyping method based on de novo genome assembly, however, we have produced a half haplotype-resolved genome from [~]267Gb of paired-end sequence reads amounting to roughly 60-fold coverage. By phylogenetic tree analysis of homologous chromosomes, it was possible to estimate the time of two whole genome duplication events as occurring about 525,000 and 341,000 years ago. Our analysis also identified many clusters of genes for specialized compounds biosynthesis in this genome. This half haplotype-resolved hexaploid genome represents the first successful attempt to investigate the complexity of chromosome sequence composition directly in a polyploid genome, using direct sequencing of the polyploid organism itself rather than of any of its simplified proxy relatives. Adaptation and application of our approach should provide higher resolution in future genomic structure investigations, especially for similarly complex genomes.",

    "abstract": "Explorations of complex microbiomes using genomics greatly enhance our understanding about their diversity, biogeography, and function. The isolation of DNA from microbiome specimens is a key prerequisite for such examinations, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities required for certain sequencing approaches, achieving accurate genomic inference of microbiome composition, and facilitating comparability of findings across specimen types and sequencing projects. These aspects are particularly relevant for the genomics-based global surveillance of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance from different reservoirs. Here, we compare in a stepwise approach a total of eight commercially available DNA extraction kits and 16 procedures based on these for three specimen types (human feces, pig feces, and hospital sewage). We assess DNA extraction using spike-in controls, and different types of beads for bead-beating facilitating cell lysis. We evaluate DNA concentration, purity, and stability, and microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that inferred community composition was dependent on inherent specimen properties as well as DNA extraction method. We further show that bead-beating or enzymatic treatment can increase the extraction of DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Final DNA quantities could be increased by isolating DNA from a larger volume of cell lysate compared to standard protocols. Based on this insight, we designed an improved DNA isolation procedure optimized for microbiome genomics that can be used for the three examined specimen types and potentially also for other biological specimens. A standard operating procedure is available from: https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3475406.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESequencing-based analyses of microbiomes may lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the microbial world associate with humans, animals, and the environment. Such insight could further the development of innovative ecosystem management approaches for the protection of our natural resources, and the design of more effective and sustainable solutions to prevent and control infectious diseases. Genome sequence information is an organism- (pathogen-) independent language that can be used across sectors, space, and time. Harmonized standards, protocols, and workflows for sample processing and analysis can facilitate the generation of such actionable information. In this study, we assessed several procedures for the isolation of DNA for next-generation sequencing. Our study highlights several important aspects to consider in the design and conduction of sequence-based analysis of microbiomes. We provide a standard operating procedure for the isolation of DNA from a range of biological specimens particularly relevant in clinical diagnostics and epidemiology.",

Here we report that members of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family form structurally diverse hexameric rings and barrels with a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport. The E. coli MCE protein, MlaD, forms a ring as part of a larger ABC transporter complex in the inner membrane, and employs a soluble lipid-binding protein to ferry lipids between MlaD and an outer membrane protein complex. In contrast, EM structures of two other E. coli MCE proteins show that YebT forms an elongated tube consisting of seven stacked MCE rings, and PqiB adopts a syringe-like architecture. Both YebT and PqiB create channels of sufficient length to span the entire periplasmic space.

These combined technologies produced the most contiguous de novo mammalian assembly to date, with chromosome-length scaffolds and only 663 gaps. Our assembly represents a >250-fold improvement in contiguity compared to the previously published C. hircus assembly, and better resolves repetitive structures longer than 1 kb, supporting the most complete repeat family and immune gene complex representation ever produced for a ruminant species.",

    "abstract": "The detailed biophysical mechanisms through which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) activates cortical circuits are still not fully understood. Here we present a multi-scale computational model to describe and explain the activation of different cell types in motor cortex due to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Our model determines precise electric fields based on an individual head model derived from magnetic resonance imaging and calculates how these electric fields activate morphologically detailed models of different neuron types. We predict detailed neural activation patterns for different coil orientations consistent with experimental findings. Beyond this, our model allows us to predict activation thresholds for individual neurons and precise initiation sites of individual action potentials on the neurons complex morphologies. Specifically, our model predicts that cortical layer 3 pyramidal neurons are generally easier to stimulate than layer 5 pyramidal neurons, thereby explaining the lower stimulation thresholds observed for I-waves compared to D-waves. It also predicts differences in the regions of activated cortical layer 5 and layer 3 pyramidal cells depending on coil orientation. Finally, it predicts that under standard stimulation conditions, action potentials are mostly generated at the axon initial segment of corctial pyramidal cells, with a much less important activation site being the part of a layer 5 pyramidal cell axon where it crosses the boundary between grey matter and white matter. In conclusion, our computational model offers a detailed account of the mechanisms through which TMS activates different cortical cell types, paving the way for more targeted application of TMS based on individual brain morphology in clinical and basic research settings.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes can evolve during the evolution of genetic sex determination (GSD) from environmental sex determination (ESD). Despite theoretical attention, early mechanisms involved in the transition from ESD to GSD have yet to be studied in nature. No mixed ESD-GSD animal species have been reported, except for some species of Daphnia, small freshwater crustaceans in which sex is usually determined solely by the environment, but in which a dominant female sex-determining locus is present in some populations. This locus follows Mendelian single-locus inheritance, but has otherwise not been characterized genetically. We now show that the sex-determining genomic region maps to the same low-recombining peri-centromeric region of linkage group 3 (LG3) in three highly divergent populations of D. magna, and spans 3.6 Mb. Despite low levels of recombination, the associated region contains signs of historical recombination, suggesting a role for selection acting on several genes thereby maintaining linkage disequilibrium among the 36 associated SNPs. The region carries numerous genes involved in sex differentiation in other taxa, including transformer2 and sox9. Taken together, the region determining the NMP phenotype shows characteristics of a sex-related supergene, suggesting that LG3 is potentially an incipient W chromosome despite the lack of significant additional restriction of recombination between Z and W. The occurrence of the female-determining locus in a pre-existing low recombining region illustrates one possible form of recombination suppression in sex chromosomes. D. magna is a promising model for studying the evolutionary transitions from ESD to GSD and early sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Motor skills are required for activities of daily living. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied in association with motor skill learning has been investigated as a tool for enhancing training effects in health and disease. Here, we review the published literature investigating whether tDCS can facilitate the acquisition and retention of motor skills and adaptation. A majority of reports focused on the application of tDCS with the anode placed over the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor skill acquisition, while some evaluated tDCS applied over the cerebellum during adaptation of existing motor skills. Work in multiple laboratories is under way to develop a mechanistic understanding of tDCS effects on different forms of learning and to optimize stimulation protocols. Efforts are required to improve reproducibility and standardization. Overall, reproducibility remains to be fully tested, effect sizes with present techniques are moderate (up to d= 0.5) (Hashemirad, Zoghi, Fitzgerald, & Jaberzadeh, 2016) and the basis of inter-individual variability in tDCS effects is incompletely understood. It is recommended that future studies explicitly state in the Methods the exploratory (hypothesis-generating) or hypothesis-driven (confirmatory) nature of the experimental designs. General research practices could be improved with prospective pre-registration of hypothesis-based investigations, more emphasis on the detailed description of methods (including all pertinent details to enable future modeling of induced current and experimental replication) and use of post-publication open data repositories. A checklist is proposed for reporting tDCS investigations in a way that can improve efforts to assess reproducibility.",

Growth of bi-allelic mutants in urea led to a significant reduction in growth rate and cell size compared to growth in nitrate.\\n\\nConclusions: CRISPR-Cas can precisely and efficiently edit the genome of T. pseudonana. The use of Golden Gate cloning to assemble CRISPR-Cas constructs gives additional flexibility to the CRISPR-Cas method and facilitates modifications to target alternative genes or species.",
