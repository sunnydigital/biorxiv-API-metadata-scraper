    "abstract": "Oceanic microbial diversity covaries with physicochemical parameters. Temperature, for example, explains approximately half of global variation in surface taxonomic abundance. It is unknown, however, whether covariation patterns hold over narrower parameter gradients and spatial scales, and extending to mesopelagic depths. We collected and sequenced 45 epipelagic and mesopelagic microbial metagenomes on a meridional transect through the eastern Red Sea. We asked which environmental parameters explain the most variation in relative abundances of taxonomic groups, gene ortholog groups, and pathways--at a spatial scale of <2000 km, along narrow but well-defined latitudinal and depth-dependent gradients. We also asked how microbes are adapted to gradients and extremes in irradiance, temperature, salinity, and nutrients, examining the responses of individual gene ortholog groups to these parameters. Functional and taxonomic metrics were equally well explained (75-79%) by environmental parameters. However, only functional and not taxonomic covariation patterns were conserved when comparing with an intruding water mass with different physicochemical properties. Temperature explained the most variation in each metric, followed by nitrate, chlorophyll, phosphate, and salinity. That nitrate explained more variation than phosphate suggested nitrogen limitation, consistent with low surface N:P ratios. Covariation of gene ortholog groups with environmental parameters revealed patterns of functional adaptation to the challenging Red Sea environment: high irradiance, temperature, salinity, and low nutrients. Nutrient acquisition gene ortholog groups were anticorrelated with concentrations of their respective nutrient species, recapturing trends previously observed across much larger distances and environmental gradients. This dataset of metagenomic covariation along densely sampled environmental gradients includes online data exploration supplements, serving as a community resource for marine microbial ecology.",

    "abstract": "Background and RationalePost-marital residence patterns refer to where a couple lives after marriage, such as near or with husbands kin (patrilocality) or wifes kin (matrilocality). These patterns influence other aspects of social organization and behavior, and potentially reveal key parts of human nature. Since the 1860s, anthropologists have sought to characterize prehistoric hunter-gatherers post-marital residence patterns by extrapolating from modern hunter-gatherers and chimpanzees behavior. For many reasons, these extrapolations are invalid. I summarized direct evidence of residence patterns from prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains.\\n\\nMethodsI conducted a systematic review of strontium isotope and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies of prehistoric hunter-gatherers and extinct hominins. I also carried out a systematic review of the reliability of classifying prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals by sex. To evaluate assumptions underlying my analyses of residence patterns, I reviewed the ethnographic literature on hunter-gatherers mortuary practices as represented in the eHRAF World Cultures database.\\n\\nResultsThe archaeologic sites included in my review represent every inhabited continent except Australia, and their dates span almost the last 10,000 years. In the strontium isotope studies, most adults of both sexes were local, and women were slightly more likely to be local than men. Within sites, women and men had similar mtDNA distributions. Women in neighboring, contemporaneous communities had somewhat distinct mtDNA distributions from each other, while the mtDNA distributions of men in the different communities were less distinguishable. The statistical uncertainties for most summaries are fairly large. Taken together, the results indicate the burial communities were mostly endogamous and that exogamous marriages strained toward matrilocality. The very limited research on extinct hominins residence patterns is consistent with these findings. In addition, there was only a moderate correspondence between morphologic and genetic estimates of sex in adult prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals. When I corrected for this measurement error or relied on genetic estimates of sex only, the post-marital residence pattern results shifted in the direction of greater matrilocal tendencies. Modern hunter-gatherers burial practices were consonant with the assumptions underlying my analyses.\\n\\nConclusionsDirect evidence from prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains indicates very different post-marital residence patterns than those extrapolated from modern hunter-gatherers and chimpanzees behavior. In prehistoric hunter-gatherer settings, endogamy may be the outcome of humans long-term mating preferences. Endogamy may have inhibited bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in prehistory and enabled the evolution of altruism in humans.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"There is something fascinating about science.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation contributes to gene and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, and therefore has been hypothesized to facilitate the evolution of flexible traits such as sociality in insects. However, DNA methylation is sparsely studied in insects. Therefore, we documented patterns of DNA methylation across a wide diversity of insects. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the DNA methylation system will be associated with presence/absence of sociality among insects. We also predicted that underlying enzymatic machinery is concordant with patterns of DNA methylation. We found DNA methylation to be widespread, detected in all orders examined except Diptera (flies). Whole genome bisulfite sequencing showed that orders differed in levels of DNA methylation. Hymenopteran (ants, bees, wasps and sawflies) had some of the lowest levels, including several potential losses. Blattodea (cockroaches) show all possible patterns, including a potential loss of DNA methylation in a eusocial species whereas solitary species had the highest levels. Phylogenetically corrected comparisons revealed no evidence that supports evolutionary dependency between sociality and DNA methylation. Species with DNA methylation do not always possess the typical enzymatic machinery. We identified a gene duplication event in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that is shared by some hymenopteran, and paralogs have experienced divergent, non-neutral evolution. This diversity and non-neutral evolution of underlying machinery suggests alternative DNA methylation pathways may exist. Altogether, DNA methylation is highly variable in insects and is not a universal driver of social behavior. Future, functional studies are required to advance our understanding of DNA methylation in insects.",

    "abstract": "Considerable mechanistic insight has been gained into amyloid aggregation; however, a large class of non-amyloid protein aggregates are considered \\\"amorphous,\\\" and in most cases little is known about their mechanisms. Amorphous aggregation of {gamma}-crystallins in the eye lens causes a widespread disease of aging, cataract. We combined simulations and experiments to study the mechanism of aggregation of two {gamma}D-crystallin mutants, W42R and W42Q - the former a congenital cataract mutation, and the latter a mimic of age-related oxidative damage. We found that formation of an internal disulfide was necessary and sufficient for aggregation under physiological conditions. Two-chain all-atom simulations predicted that one non-native disulfide in particular, between Cys32 and Cys41, was likely to stabilize an unfolding intermediate prone to intermolecular interactions. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis experiments confirmed the presence of this bond in the aggregates and its necessity for oxidative aggregation under physiological conditions in vitro. Mining the simulation data linked formation of this disulfide to extrusion of the N-terminal {beta}-hairpin and rearrangement of the native {beta}-sheet topology. Specific binding between the extruded hairpin and a distal {beta}-sheet, in an intermolecular chain reaction similar to domain swapping, is the most probable mechanism of aggregate propagation.",

Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between self-renewal and lineage commitment in ES cells, the spatiotemporal integration of responsive signalling pathways with core transcriptional regulatory networks are complex and only partially understood. Moreover, measurements made on populations of cells reveal only average properties of the underlying regulatory networks, obscuring their fine detail. Here, we discuss the reconstruction of regulatory networks in individual cells using novel single cell transcriptomics and proteomics, in order to expand our understanding of the molecular basis of pluripotency, including the role of cell-cell variability within ES cell populations, and ways in which networks may be controlled in order to reliably manipulate cell behaviour.",

    "abstract": "At the high concentrations used in medicine, antibiotics exert strong selection on bacterial populations for the evolution of resistance. However, these lethal concentrations may not be representative of the concentrations bacteria face in soil, a recognition that has lead to questions of the role of antibiotics in soil environments as well as the dynamics of resistance evolution during sub-lethal challenge. Here we examine the evolution of resistance to sub-MIC concentrations of streptomycin in the filamentous soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. First, we show that spontaneous resistance to streptomycin causes an average fitness deficit of ~21% in the absence of drugs; however, these costs are eliminated at concentrations as low as 1/10 the MIC of susceptible strains. Using experimental evolution, we next show that resistance readily evolves at these non-lethal doses. More important, S. coelicolor resistance that evolves at sub-MIC streptomycin is cost-free. Whole-genome analyses reveal that sub-MIC evolved clones fix a distinct set of mutations to those isolated at high drug concentrations. Our results broaden the conditions under which resistance can evolve in nature and suggest that the long-term persistence of these strains is facilitated by the absence of pleiotropic fitness costs. Finally, our data cast doubt on arguments that low-concentration antibiotics in nature are signals, instead supporting models that resistance evolves in response to antibiotics used as weapons.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of sensory and decisional processes to perceptual decision making is still unclear, even in simple perceptual tasks. When a decision maker needs to select an action from a set of balanced alternatives, any tendency to choose one alternative more often- choice bias-is consistent with a bias in the sensory evidence, but also with a preference to select that alternative independently of the sensory evidence. To decouple sensory from decisional biases, here we asked humans to perform a simple perceptual discrimination task with two symmetric alternatives under two different task instructions. The instructions varied the response mapping between perception and the category of the alternatives. In two experiments, we found that 30 out of 32 participants exhibited sensory biases and 15 decisional biases. The decisional biases were consistent with a criterion change in a simple signal detection theory model. Perceptual decision making, thus, even in simple scenarios, is affected by sensory and decisional choice biases.",

    "abstract": "Injury triggers regeneration of axons and dendrites. Research identified factors required for axonal regeneration outside the CNS, but little is known about regeneration triggered by dendrotomy. Here we study neuronal plasticity triggered by dendrotomy and determine the fate of complex PVD arbors following laser surgery of dendrites. We find that severed primary dendrites grow towards each other and reconnect via branch fusion. Simultaneously, terminal branches lose self-avoidance and grow towards each other, meeting and fusing at the tips via an AFF-1-mediated process. Ectopic branch growth is identified as a step in the regeneration process required for bypassing the lesion site. Failure of reconnection to the severed dendrites results in degeneration of the distal end of the neuron. We discover pruning of excess branches via EFF-1 that acts to recover the original wild-type arborization pattern in a cell-autonomous process. In contrast, AFF-1 activity during dendritic auto-fusion is derived from the lateral seam cells and not autonomously from the PVD neuron. We propose a model in which AFF-1-vesicles derived from the epidermal seam cells fuse neuronal dendrites from without. Thus, EFF-1 and AFF-1 fusion proteins emerge as new players in neuronal arborization and maintenance of arbor connectivity following injury in C. elegans. Our results demonstrate that there is a genetically determined multi-step pathway to repair broken dendrites in which EFF-1 and AFF-1 act on different steps of the pathway. Intrinsic EFF-1 is essential for dendritic pruning after injury and extrinsic AFF-1 mediates dendrite fusion to bypass injuries.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeurons in the central nervous system have very limited regenerative ability, they fail to remodel following amputation and only in some invertebrates, axons can repair themselves by fusion. Some genetic pathways have been identified for axonal regeneration but few studies exist on dendrite regeneration following injury. To determine how neurons regenerate dendrites following injury we study the C. elegans PVD polymodal neurons that display an arborized pattern of repetitive menorah-like structures. We injure dendrites by laser microsurgery, follow their fate and show that broken primary dendrites often regenerate via fusion. We describe how PVD dendrites regenerate and present roles for EFF-1 and AFF-1 proteins in fusion and remodeling of menorahs. Menorahs lose self-avoidance and AFF-1 fuses them, bypassing the injury site. Branch sprouting, EFF-1-mediated pruning, and arbor simplification completes regeneration. When auto-fusion fails the distal arbor degenerates. Surprisingly, AFF-1 acts non-cell autonomously to mediate dendrite fusion. We propose that extracellular vesicles derived from the lateral epidermis fuse severed dendrites in a process reminiscent of enveloped virus-mediated cell fusion without infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt has been frequently argued that tissues evolved to suppress the accumulation of growth enhancing cancer inducing mutations. A prominent example is the hierarchical structure of tissues with high cell turnover, where a small number of tissue specific stem cells produces a large number of specialised progeny during multiple differentiation steps. Another well known mechanism is the spatial organisation of stem cell populations and it is thought that this organisation suppresses fitness enhancing mutations. However, in small populations the suppression of advantageous mutations typically also implies an increased accumulation of deleterious mutations. Thus, it becomes an important question whether the suppression of potentially few advantageous mutations outweighs the combined effects of many deleterious mutations.\\n\\nResultsWe argue that the distribution of mutant fitness effects, e.g. the probability to hit a strong driver compared to many deleterious mutations, is crucial for the optimal organisation of a cancer suppressing tissue architecture and should be taken into account in arguments for the evolution of such tissues.\\n\\nConclusionWe show that for systems that are composed of few cells reflecting the typical organisation of a stem cell niche, amplification or suppression of selection can arise from subtle changes in the architecture. Moreover, we discuss special tissue structures that can suppress most types of non-neutral mutations simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between parasites and their hosts is found in all kinds of species and plays an important role in understanding the principles of evolution and coevolution. Usually, the different genotypes of hosts and parasites oscillate in their abundances. The well-established theory of oscillatory Red Queen dynamics proposes an ongoing change in frequencies of the different types within each species. So far, it is unclear in which way Red Queen dynamics persists with more than two types of hosts and parasites. In our analysis, an arbitrary number of types within two species are examined in a deterministic framework with constant or changing population size. This general framework allows for analytical solutions for internal fixed points and their stability. For more than two species, apparently chaotic dynamics has been reported. Here we show that even for two species, once more than two types are considered per species, irregular dynamics in their frequencies can be observed in the long run. The nature of the dynamics depends strongly on the initial configuration of the system; the usual regular Red Queen oscillations are only observed in some parts of the parameter region.",

    "abstract": "To survive in their complex environment, primates must integrate information over time and adjust their actions beyond immediate events. The underlying neurobiological processes, however, remain unclear. Here, we assessed the contribution of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region important for value-based decision making. We recorded single VMPFC neurons in monkeys performing a task where obtaining fluid rewards required squeezing a grip. The willingness to perform the action was modulated not only by visual information about Effort and Reward levels, but also by contextual factors such as Trial Number (i.e fatigue and/or satiety) or behavior in recent trials. A greater fraction of VMPFC neurons encoded contextual information, compared to visual stimuli. Moreover, the dynamics of VMPFC firing was more closely related to slow changes in motivational states driven by these contextual factors rather than rapid responses to individual task events. Thus, the firing of VMPFC neurons continuously integrated contextual information and reliably predicted the monkeys willingness to perform the task. This function might be critical when animals forage in a complex environment and need to integrate information over time. Its relation with motivational states also resonates with the VMPFC implication in the default mode or in mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "The recent trend away from ANOVA-based analyses places experimental investigations into the neurobiology of cognition in more naturalistic and ecologically valid designs within reach. Using mixed-effects models for epoch-based regression, we demonstrate the feasibility of examining event-related potentials (ERPs), and in particular the N400, to study the neural dynamics of auditory language processing in a naturalistic setting. Despite the large variability between trials during naturalistic stimulation, we replicated previous findings from the literature: frequency, animacy, word order. This suggests a new perspective on ERPs, namely as a continuous modulation reflecting continuous model updates (cf. Friston, 2005) instead of a series of discrete and essentially sequential processes.",

    "abstract": "Foundation species uniquely control associated biodiversity through non-trophic effects, whereas dominant species are locally abundant but are replaceable in ecological systems. Long-term data on ant assemblages at the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment (HF-HeRE) and the Black Rock Future of Oak Forests Experiment (BRF-FOFE) provide insights into how ant assemblages change and reassemble following the loss of a foundation species (Tsuga canadensis) or a dominant genus (Quercus). At HF-HeRE, removal of T. canadensis trees resulted in taxonomic and functional shifts in ant assemblages relative to control stands. In contrast, ant assemblages at BRF-FOFE varied little regardless of whether oaks or non-oaks were removed from the canopy. Non-trophic effects of foundation species were stronger than indirect trophic effects on taxonomic and functional diversity of ant assemblages. In contrast, non-trophic effects of dominant species were weaker than indirect trophic effects on ant taxonomic diversity and some measures of ant functional diversity.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipA.M. Ellison and S. Record conceived the study. A.M. Ellison, T. 17 McCabe, and S. Record collected field data. T. McCabe and S. Record did the taxonomic diversity analyses. B. Baiser and S. Record did the functional diversity analyses.

    "abstract": "Burrows of the endangered giant kangaroorat, Dipodomys ingens, were found on the U.S. Department of Energys Naval Petroleum Reserves in Kern County, California. The majority of burrows (63%) were found in areas of low relief (4.3 {+/-} 0.5{degrees}, n=32) on valley floors but 28% were unexpectedly found on low relief areas (6.4 {+/-} 0.8{degrees}, n=39) in the uplands. Burrows were not distributed in proportion to the arealextend of the soil series, but were concentrated in deep alluvial sandy loams. Well pads were the most frequently observed (73% of 211) humandisturbance in the vicinity of burrows, but they were the most distant (150{+/-} 61m, n=150). Dirt roads were observed closer to burrows (50 {+/-} 10 m, n=28) but less frequently (4%).

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of Flaviviridae family, as other agents of clinical significance, such as dengue (DENV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses. ZIKV spread from Africa to Pacific and South American territories, emerging as an etiological pathogen of neurological disorders, during fetal development and in adulthood. Therefore, antiviral drugs able to inhibit ZIKV replication are necessary. Broad spectrum antivirals, such as interferon, ribavirin and favipiravir, are harmful for pregnant animal models and women. The clinically approved uridine nucleotide analog anti-HCV drug, sofosbuvir, has not been affiliated to teratogenicity. Sofosbuvir target the most conserved protein over the members of the Flaviviridae family, the viral RNA polymerase. We thus studied ZIKV susceptibility to sofosbovir. We initially characterized a Brazilian ZIKV strain for use in experimental assays. Sofosbuvir inhibits the Brazilian ZIKV replication in a dose-dependent manner, both in BHK-21 cells and SH-Sy5y, by targeting ZIKV RNA polymerase activity, with the involvement of conserved amino acid residues over the members of Flaviviridae family. The identification of clinically approved antiviral drugs endowed with anti-ZIKV could reduce the time frame in pre-clinical development. Altogether, our data indicates that sofosbuvir chemical structure is endowed with anti-ZIKV activity.",
