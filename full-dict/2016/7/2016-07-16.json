    "abstract": "Cortical networks exhibit intrinsic dynamics that drive coordinated, large-scale fluctuations across neuronal populations and create noise correlations that impact sensory coding. To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the wide variety of activity patterns in our recordings. Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations.",

    "abstract": "Advanced microscopy methods allow obtaining information on (dynamic) conformational changes in biomolecules via measuring a single molecular distance in the structure. It is, however, extremely challenging to capture the full depth of a three-dimensional biochemical state, binding-related structural changes or conformational cross-talk in multi-protein complexes using one-dimensional assays. In this paper we address this fundamental problem by extending the standard molecular ruler based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a two-dimensional assay via its combination with protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE). We show that donor brightness (via PIFE) and energy transfer efficiency (via FRET) can simultaneously report on e.g., the conformational state of dsDNA following its interaction with unlabelled proteins (BamHI, EcoRV, T7 DNA polymerase gp5/trx). The PIFE-FRET assay uses established labelling protocols and single molecule fluorescence detection schemes (alternating-laser excitation, ALEX). Besides quantitative studies of PIFE and FRET ruler characteristics, we outline possible applications of ALEX-based PIFE-FRET for single-molecule studies with diffusing and immobilized molecules. Finally, we study transcription initiation and scrunching of E. coli RNA-polymerase with PIFE-FRET and provide direct evidence for the physical presence and vicinity of the polymerase that causes structural changes and scrunching of the transcriptional DNA bubble.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is one of the defining parameters of an ecological niche. Most organisms thrive within a temperature range that rarely exceeds [~] 30{degrees}C, but the deep subsurface bacterium Kosmotoga olearia can grow over a temperature range of 59{degrees}C (20{degrees}C -79{degrees}C). To identify genes correlated with this flexible phenotype, we compared transcriptomes of K. olearia cultures grown at its optimal 65{degrees}C to those at 30{degrees}C, 40{degrees}C, and 77{degrees}C. The temperature treatments affected expression of 573 of 2,224 K. olearia genes. Notably, this transcriptional response elicits re-modeling of the cellular membrane and changes in metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism at high temperatures and up-regulation of amino acid metabolism at lower temperatures. At sub-optimal temperatures, many transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in mesophilic bacteria at physiologically low temperatures, including up-regulation of typical cold stress genes and ribosomal proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of additional Thermotogae genomes, indicate that one of K. olearia's strategies for low temperature growth is increased copy number of some typical cold response genes through duplication and/or lateral acquisition. At 77{degrees}C one third of the up-regulated genes are of hypothetical function, indicating that many features of high temperature growth are unknown.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning and decision-making (RLDM) provide a quantitative framework and computational theories, with which we can disentangle psychiatric conditions into basic dimensions of neurocognitive functioning. RLDM offer a novel approach to assess and potentially diagnose psychiatric patients, and there is growing enthusiasm on RLDM and Computational Psychiatry among clinical researchers. Such a framework can also provide insights into the brain substrates of particular RLDM processes as exemplified by model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG). However, many researchers often find the approach too technical and have difficulty adopting it for their research. Thus, there remains a critical need to develop a user-friendly tool for the wide dissemination of computational psychiatric methods. We introduce an R package called hBayesDM (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks), which offers computational modeling on an array of RLDM tasks and social exchange games. The hBayesDM package offers state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian modeling, where both individual and group parameters (i.e., posterior distributions) are estimated simultaneously in a mutually constraining fashion. At the same time, it is extremely user-friendly: users can perform computational modeling, output visualization, and Bayesian model comparisons-each with a single line of coding. Users can also extract trial-by-trial latent variables (e.g., prediction errors) required for model-based fMRI/EEG. With the hBayesDM package, we anticipate that anyone with minimal knowledge of programming can take advantage of cutting-edge computational modeling approaches and investigate the underlying processes of and interactions between multiple decision-making (e.g., goal-directed, habitual, and Pavlovian) systems. In this way, it is our expectation that the hBayesDM package will contribute to the dissemination of advanced modeling approaches and enable a wide range of researchers to easily perform computational psychiatric research within their populations.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the coding region of FOXP2 are known to cause speech and language impairment. Microdeletions involving the region downstream the gene have been also associated to speech and cognitive deficits. We recently described a girl harbouring a complex chromosomal rearrangement with one breakpoint downstream the gene that might affect her speech and cognitive abilities via physical separation of distant regulatory DNA elements. In this study, we have used highly efficient targeted chromosomal deletions induced by the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool to demonstrate the functionality of two enhancers, FOXP2-Eproximal and FOXP2-Edistal, located in the intergenic region between FOXP2 and its adjacent MDFIC gene. Deletion of any of these two functional enhancers in the neuroblastomic cell line SK-N-MC downregulates FOXP2 and decreases FOXP2 protein levels, conversely it upregulates MDFIC and increases MDFIC protein levels. This suggests that both regulatory elements may be shared between FOXP2 and MDFIC. We expect these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how FOXP2 and MDFIC are regulated to pace neuronal development supporting speech and language.",
