    "abstract": "Structural variation (SV) represents a major source of differences between individual human genomes and has been linked to disease phenotypes. However, the majority of studies provide neither a global view of the full spectrum of these variants nor integrate them into reference panels of genetic variation.\\n\\nHere, we analyse whole genome sequencing data of 769 individuals from 250 Dutch families, and provide a haplotype-resolved map of 1.9 million genome variants across 9 different variant classes, including novel forms of complex indels, and retrotransposition-mediated insertions of mobile elements and processed RNAs. A large proportion are previously under reported variants sized between 21 and 100bp. We detect 4 megabases of novel sequence, encoding 11 new transcripts. Finally, we show 191 known, trait-associated SNPs to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with SVs and demonstrate that our panel facilitates accurate imputation of SVs in unrelated individuals. Our findings are essential for genome-wide association studies.",

Despite their great promise, REE fractionation in early plant-microbe-rock systems has largely remained elusive. We tested the hypothesis that REE mass-partitioning during the incipient weathering of basalt, rhyolite, granite and schist depends on the activity of microbes, plant, and arbuscular mycorrhiza.\\n\\nPore-water element abundances reflected a rapid transition from abiotic to biotic weathering, the latter associated with lower aqueous loss and higher uptake. Abiotic dissolution contributed 38.6{+/-}19% to total denudation. Microbes incremented denudation, particularly in rhyolite, this effect associating with decreased bioavailable solid fractions in this rock. Total mobilization (aqueous+uptake) was ten times greater in planted treatments compared to abiotic control, REE masses in plant generally exceeding those in water. Plants of larger biomass further increased solid fractions, consistent with soil genesis. Mycorrhiza had a generally positive effect on total mobilization. The incipient REE weathering was dominated by inorganic dissolution enhanced by biotic respiration, the patterns of denudation largely dictated by mineralogy. A consistent biotic signature was observed in La:phosphate, mobilization:solid fraction in all rocks, as well as in the general pattern of denudation and uptake.",

    "abstract": "Perceiving the geometry of surrounding space is a multisensory process, crucial to contextualizing object perception and guiding navigation behavior. Auditory cues are informative about the shape and extent of large-scale environments: humans can make judgments about surrounding spaces from reverberation cues. However, how the scale of auditory space is represented neurally is unknown. Here, by orthogonally varying the spatial extent and sound source content of auditory scenes during magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording, we report a neural signature of auditory space size perception, starting ~145 ms after stimulus onset. Importantly, this neuromagnetic response is readily dissociable in form and time into representations of the source and its reverberant enclosing space: while the source exhibits an early and transient response, the neural signature of space is sustained and independent of the original source that produced it. Further, the space size response is robust to variations in sound source, and vice versa. The MEG decoding signal was distributed primarily across bilateral temporal sensor locations, significantly correlated with behavioral responses in a separate experiment. Together, our results provide the first neuromagnetic evidence for a robust auditory space size representation in the human brain, sensitive to reverberant decay, and reveal the temporal dynamics of how such a code emerges over time from the transformation of complex naturalistic auditory signals.",

    "abstract": "The organization of chromatin is a regulator of molecular processes including transcription, replication, and DNA repair. The structures within chromatin that regulate these processes span from the nucleosomal (10nm) to the chromosomal (>200nm) levels, with little known about the dynamics of chromatin structure between these scales due to a lack of quantitative imaging technique in live cells. Previous work using Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy, a quantitative imaging technique with sensitivity to macromolecular organization between 20-200nm, has shown that transformation of chromatin at these length scales is a fundamental event during carcinogenesis. As the dynamics of chromatin likely play a critical regulatory role in cellular function, it is critical to develop live-cell imaging techniques that can probe the real-time temporal behavior of the chromatin nano-architecture. Therefore, we developed a live cell PWS technique which allows high-throughput, label-free study of the causal relationship between nanoscale organization and molecular function in real-time. In this work, we employ live cell PWS to study the change in chromatin structure due to DNA damage and expand on the link between metabolic function and the structure of higher-order chromatin. In particular, we studied the temporal changes to chromatin during UV light exposure, show that live cell DNA binding dyes induce damage to chromatin within seconds, and demonstrate a direct link between higher-order chromatin structure and mitochondrial membrane potential. Since biological function is tightly paired with structure, live cell PWS is a powerful tool to study the nanoscale structure-function relationship in live cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementChromatin is one of the most critical structures within the cell because it houses most genetic information. Its structure is well understood at the nucleosomal (<20nm) and chromosomal (>200nm) levels, however, due to the lack of quantitative imaging modalities to study this organization, little is known about the higher-order structure between these length scales in live cells. We present a label-free technique, live cell Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy with sensitivity to structures between 20-200nm that can quantify the nano-architecture in live cells. With this technique, we can detect DNA fragmentation and expand on the link between metabolic function and higher-order chromatin structure. Live cell PWS allows high-throughput, label-free study of the causal relationship between nanoscale organization and molecular function in live cells.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the size and proportion of limbs and other structures have played a key role in the adaptive evolution of species. However, despite the ubiquity of these modifications, we have a very limited idea of how these changes occur on the genetic and molecular levels. To fill this gap, we studied a recent and extreme case of wing and pectoral skeleton size reduction leading to flightlessness in the Galapagos cormorant (Phalacrocorax harrisi). We sequenced and de novo assembled the genomes of four closely related cormorant species and applied a joint predictive and comparative genomics approach to find candidate variants. Here we report that function-altering variants in genes necessary for both the correct transcriptional regulation and function of the primary cilium contributed to the evolution of loss of flight in P. harrisi. Cilia are essential for Hedgehog signaling, and humans affected by skeletal ciliopathies suffer from premature arrest of bone growth, mirroring the skeletal features associated with loss of flight.",
