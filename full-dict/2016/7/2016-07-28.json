    "abstract": "The detection of genomic regions involved in local adaptation is an important topic in current population genetics. There are several detection strategies available depending on the kind of genetic and demographic information at hand. A common drawback is the high risk of false positives. In this study, we introduce two complementary methods for the detection of divergent selection from populations connected by migration. Both methods have been developed with the aim of being robust to false positives. The first method combines haplotype information with inter-population differentiation (FST). Evidence of divergent selection is concluded only when both the haplotype pattern and the FST value support it. The second method is developed for independently segregating markers i.e. there is no haplotype information at hand. In this case, the power to detect selection is attained by developing a new outlier test based on detecting a bimodal distribution. The test computes the FST outliers and then assumes that those of interest would have a different mode which is detected by a clustering algorithm. The utility of the two methods is demonstrated through simulations and the analysis of real data. The simulation results show power ranging from 60-94% in several of the scenarios whilst the false positive rate is controlled below the nominal level in every scenario. The analysis of real samples consisted of phased data from the HapMap project and unphased data from intertidal marine snail ecotypes. The software HacDivSel implements the methods explained in this manuscript.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for modeling multiple species distributions simultaneously using Dirichlet Process random effects to cluster species into guilds. Guilds are ecological groups of species that behave or react similarly to some environmental conditions. By modeling latent guild structure, we capture the cross-correlations in abundance or occurrence of species over surveys. In addition, ecological information about the community structure is obtained as a byproduct of the model. By clustering species into similar functional groups, prediction uncertainty of community structure at additional sites is reduced over treating each species separately. The method is illustrated with a small simulation demonstration, as well as an analysis of a mesopelagic fish survey from the eastern Bering Sea near Alaska. The simulation data analysis shows that guild membership can be extracted as the differences between groups become larger and if guild differences are small the model naturally collapses all the species into a small number of guilds which increases predictive efficiency by reducing the number of parameters to that which is supported by the data.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is one of the defining parameters of an ecological niche. Most organisms thrive within a temperature range that rarely exceeds [~] 30{degrees}C, but the deep subsurface bacterium Kosmotoga olearia can grow over a temperature range of 59{degrees}C (20{degrees}C -79{degrees}C). To identify genes correlated with this flexible phenotype, we compared transcriptomes of K. olearia cultures grown at its optimal 65{degrees}C to those at 30{degrees}C, 40{degrees}C, and 77{degrees}C. The temperature treatments affected expression of 573 of 2,224 K. olearia genes. Notably, this transcriptional response elicits re-modeling of the cellular membrane and changes in metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism at high temperatures and up-regulation of amino acid metabolism at lower temperatures. At sub-optimal temperatures, many transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in mesophilic bacteria at physiologically low temperatures, including up-regulation of typical cold stress genes and ribosomal proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of additional Thermotogae genomes, indicate that one of K. olearia's strategies for low temperature growth is increased copy number of some typical cold response genes through duplication and/or lateral acquisition. At 77{degrees}C one third of the up-regulated genes are of hypothetical function, indicating that many features of high temperature growth are unknown.",

However, despite these recent innovations, there are still needs for further improvement in sampling algorithms to more adequately sample protein motion relevant to protein-ligand binding. Here, we report our work identifying and studying such clear and remaining needs in the apolar cavity of T4 Lysozyme L99A. In this study, we model recent experimental results that show the progressive opening of the binding pocket in response to a series of homologous ligands.1 Even while using enhanced sampling techniques, we demonstrate that the predicted relative binding free energies (RBFE) are sensitive to the initial protein conformational state. Particularly, we highlight the importance of sufficient sampling of protein conformational changes and demonstrate how inclusion of three key protein residues in the  hot region of the FEP/REST simulation improves the sampling and resolves this sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd (Oxford, UK) have recently commercialized MinION, a small and low-cost single-molecule nanopore sequencer, that offers the possibility of sequencing long DNA fragments. The Oxford Nanopore technology is truly disruptive and can sequence small genomes in a matter of seconds. It has the potential to revolutionize genomic applications due to its portability, low-cost, and ease of use compared with existing long reads sequencing technologies. The MinION sequencer enables the rapid sequencing of small eukaryotic genomes, such as the yeast genome. Combined with existing assembler algorithms, near complete genome assemblies can be generated and comprehensive population genomic analyses can be performed. Here, we resequenced the genome of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain to evaluate the performance of nanopore-only assemblers. Then we de novo sequenced and assembled the genomes of 21 isolates representative of the S. cerevisiae genetic diversity using the MinION platform. The contiguity of our assemblies was 14 times higher than the Illumina-only assemblies and we obtained one or two long contigs for 65% of the chromosomes. This high continuity allowed us to accurately detect large structural variations across the 21 studied genomes. Moreover, because of the high completeness of the nanopore assemblies, we were able to produce a complete cartography of transposable elements insertions and inspect structural variants that are generally missed using a short-read sequencing strategy.",

Yet, traditional homology-directed genome editing is limited by the requirements for DNA cleavage, donor DNA template and the endogenous DNA break-repair machinery. Here we present programmable cytidine deaminases that enable site-specific cytidine to thymidine (C-to-T) genomic edits without the need for DNA cleavage. Our targeted deaminases are efficient and specific in Escherichia coli, converting a genomic C-to-T with 13% efficiency and 95% accuracy. Edited cells do not harbor unintended genomic abnormalities. These novel enzymes also function in human cells, leading to a site-specific C-to-T transition in 2.5% of cells with reduced toxicity compared with zinc-finger nucleases. Targeted deaminases therefore represent a platform for safer and effective genome editing in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, especially in systems where DSBs are toxic, such as human stem cells and repetitive elements targeting.",

Motility, and the production of colonization factors and cholera toxin, are fundamental for the establishment of disease. In the aquatic environment, V. cholerae persists by forming avirulent biofilms on zooplankton, phytoplankton and chitin debris. Here, we describe the formation of artificial, biofilm-like communities, driven by exposure of planktonic bacteria to synthetic polymers. This recruitment is extremely rapid and charge-driven, and leads to the formation of initial \\\"seed clusters\\\" which then recruit additional bacteria to extend in size. Bacteria that become entrapped in these \\\"forced communities\\\" undergo transcriptional changes in motility and virulence genes, and phenotypically mimic features of environmental biofilm communities by forming a matrix that contains polysaccharide and extracellular DNA. As a result of this lifestyle transition, pathogenicity and in vivo host colonization decrease. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic polymers to disarm pathogens by modulating their lifestyle, without creating selective pressure favoring the emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is an almost inevitable consequence of cancer therapy and ultimately proves fatal for the majority of patients. In many cases this is the consequence of specific gene mutations that have the potential to be targeted to re-sensitize the tumor. The ability to uniformly saturate the genome with point mutations without chromosome or nucleotide sequence context bias would open the door to identify all putative drug resistance mutations in cancer models. Here we describe such a method for elucidating drug resistance mechanisms using genome-wide chemical mutagenesis allied to next-generation sequencing. We show that chemically mutagenizing the genome of cancer cells dramatically increases the number of drug-resistant clones and allows the detection of both known and novel drug resistance mutations. We have developed an efficient computational process that allows for the rapid identification of involved pathways and druggable targets. Such a priori knowledge would greatly empower serial monitoring strategies for drug resistance in the clinic as well as the development of trials for drug resistant patients.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan actin is well conserved and clearly important during the parasite's life cycle. Several studies assert that its polymerization kinetics are unusual, permitting only short, unstable F-actin filaments. However, it has not been possible to study actin in vivo, so its physiological role has remained obscure. This has led to functional models which are mutually conflicting, incompatible with actin behavior from other eukaryotes, and cannot explain actin's importance during basic processes such as parasite replication and egress. Here we use a chromobody that specifically binds F-actin to demonstrate that Toxoplasma forms stable actin filaments in vivo. F-actin is not only important for parasite replication, but also forms an extensive network that connects individuals both within and between parasitophorous vacuoles, and allows vesicles to be exchanged between parasites within a vacuole. During host cell egress, prior to motility, this network collapses in a calcium-dependent manner. This study demonstrates unexpected roles of Toxoplasma actin during the asexual life cycle, and proves that formation of F-actin depends on a critical concentration of G-actin, implying a polymerization mechanism similar to mammalian actin.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryToxoplasma establishes a stable F-actin network that is essential for replication and material transport between individual parasites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA fundamental issue in bioscience is to understand the mechanism that underlies the dynamic control of genome-wide expression through the complex temporal-spatial self-organization of the genome to regulate the change in cell fate. We address this issue by elucidating a physically motivated mechanism of self-organization.\\n\\nPrincipal FindingsBuilding upon transcriptome experimental data for seven distinct cell fates, including early embryonic development, we demonstrate that self-organized criticality (SOC) plays an essential role in the dynamic control of global gene expression regulation at both the population and single-cell levels. The novel findings are as follows:\\n\\ni) Mechanism of cell-fate changes: A sandpile-type critical transition self-organizes overall expression into a few transcription response domains (critical states). A cell-fate change occurs by means of a dissipative pulse-like global perturbation in self-organization through the erasure of initial-state critical behaviors (criticality). Most notably, the reprogramming of early embryo cells destroys the zygote SOC control to initiate self-organization in the new embryonal genome, which passes through a stochastic overall expression pattern.\\n\\nii) Mechanism of perturbation of SOC controls: Global perturbations in self-organization involve the temporal regulation of critical states. Quantitative evaluation of this perturbation in terminal cell fates reveals that dynamic interactions between critical states determine the critical-state coherent regulation. The occurrence of a temporal change in criticality perturbs this between-states interaction, which directly affects the entire genomic system. Surprisingly, a sub-critical state, corresponding to an ensemble of genes that shows only marginal changes in expression and consequently are considered to be devoid of any interest, plays an essential role in generating a global perturbation in self-organization directed toward the cell-fate change.\\n\\nConclusion and Significance Whole-genome regulation of gene expression through self-regulatory SOC control complements gene-by-gene fine tuning and represents a still largely unexplored non-equilibrium statistical mechanism that is responsible for the massive reprogramming of genome expression.",

    "abstract": "In a constantly changing world, animals must account for environmental volatility when making decisions. To appropriately discount older, irrelevant information, they need to learn the rate at which the environment changes. We develop an ideal observer model capable of inferring the present state of the environment along with its rate of change. Key to this computation is updating the posterior probability of all possible changepoint counts. This computation can be challenging, as the number of possibilities grows rapidly with time. However, we show how the computations can be simplified in the continuum limit by a moment closure approximation. The resulting low-dimensional system can be used to infer the environmental state and change rate with accuracy comparable to the ideal observer. The approximate computations can be performed by a neural network model via a rate-correlation based plasticity rule. We thus show how optimal observers accumulates evidence in changing environments, and map this computation to reduced models which perform inference using plausible neural mechanisms.",

However, causal relationships between changes in TF binding, histone modifications, and gene expression during the response to extracellular stimuli are not well understood. Here, we analyzed the ordering of these events on a genome-wide scale in dendritic cells (DCs) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.\\n\\nResultsUsing a ChIP-seq time series dataset, we found that the LPS-induced accumulation of different histone modifications follow clearly distinct patterns. Increases in H3K4me3 appear to coincide with transcriptional activation. In contrast, H3K9K14ac accumulates early after stimulation, and H3K36me3 at later time points. Integrative analysis with TF binding data revealed potential links between TF activation and dynamics in histone modifications. Especially, LPS-induced increases in H3K9K14ac and H3K4me3 were associated with binding by STAT1/2, and were severely impaired in Stat1-/- cells.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile the timing of short-term changes of some histone modifications coincides with changes in transcriptional activity, this is not the case for others. In the latter case, dynamics in modifications more likely reflect strict regulation by stimulus-induced TFs, and their interactions with chromatin modifiers.",

How do daughter cells re-establish the original transcription program? Recent discoveries that a select set of TFs remain bound on mitotic chromosomes suggest a potential mechanism for maintaining transcriptional programs through the cell cycle termed mitotic bookmarking. Here we report instead that many TFs remain associated with chromosomes, and that the exclusion previously described is largely a fixation artifact. In particular, most TFs we tested are significantly enriched on mitotic chromosomes. Studies with Sox2 reveal that this mitotic interaction is more dynamic than in interphase and requires both DNA binding and nuclear import. Furthermore, this dynamic mode results from lack of transcriptional activation rather than decreased accessibility of underlying DNA sequences in mitosis. The nature of the cross-linking artifact prompts careful re-examination of the role of TFs in mitotic bookmarking.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMany transcription factors bind to mitotic chromosomes\\nC_LIO_LISox2 mitotic interaction is dynamic and requires DNA binding and nuclear import\\nC_LIO_LIDNA remains highly accessible in mitotic chromosomes\\nC_LIO_LIFormaldehyde-based cross-linking leads to mis-localization of TFs\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We use a data-driven global stochastic epidemic model to project past and future spread of the Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas. The model has high spatial and temporal resolution, and integrates real-world demographic, human mobility, socioeconomic, temperature, and vector density data. We estimate that the first introduction of ZIKV to Brazil likely occurred between August 2013 and April 2014 (90% credible interval). We provide simulated epidemic profiles of incident ZIKV infections for several countries in the Americas through February 2017. The ZIKV epidemic is characterized by slow growth and high spatial and seasonal heterogeneity, attributable to the dynamics of the mosquito vector and to the characteristics and mobility of the human populations. We project the expected timing and number of pregnancies infected with ZIKV during the first trimester, and provide estimates of microcephaly cases assuming different levels of risk as reported in empirical retrospective studies. Our approach represents an early modeling effort aimed at projecting the potential magnitude and timing of the ZIKV epidemic that might be refined as new and more accurate data from the region become available.",

    "abstract": "Genetic clustering algorithms, implemented in popular programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE, have been used extensively in the characterisation of individuals and populations based on genetic data. A successful example is the reconstruction of the genetic history of African Americans who are a product of recent admixture between highly differentiated populations. Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups which do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach (badMIXTURE, available at github.com/danjlawson/badMIXTURE) to assess the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry \\\"palettes\\\" estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated data and real case studies. Combining these complementary analyses with additional methods that are designed to test specific hypotheses allows a richer and more robust analysis of recent demographic history based on genetic data.",

    "abstract": "Long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can silence genes of matching sequence upon ingestion in many invertebrates and is therefore being developed as a pesticide. Such feeding RNA interference (RNAi) is best understood in the worm C. elegans, where it is thought that derivatives of ingested dsRNA, including short dsRNAs, move between cells and cause systemic silencing. Movement of short dsRNAs has been inferred using tissue-specific rescue of the long dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 by expressing it from repetitive transgenes. We found that the use of repetitive transgenes for the tissue-specific rescue of a gene could inhibit RNAi within that tissue and could result in misexpression of the gene in other tissues. Both inhibition and misexpression were not detectable when a single-copy transgene was used for tissue-specific rescue. In animals with single-copy rescue of RDE-4, RNAi was restricted to the tissue with RDE-4 expression. Thus, unlike previous observations using repetitive transgenes, these results suggest that binding of long dsRNA by RDE-4 in each silenced cell is required for systemic RNAi. Taken together with the requirement for long dsRNA to trigger RNAi in insects, these results suggest that the entry of long dsRNA is a necessary first step for feeding RNAi in animal cells.",

    "abstract": "Studies using multi-locus coalescent methods to infer species trees or historical demographic parameters usually require the assumption that the gene tree for each locus (or SNP) is genealogically independent from the gene trees of other sampled loci. In practice, however, researchers have used two different criteria to delimit independent loci in phylogenomic studies. The first criterion, which directly addresses the condition of genealogical independence of sampled loci, considers the long-term effects of homologous recombination and effective population size on linkage between two loci. In contrast, the second criterion, which only considers the single-generation effects of recombination in the meioses of individuals, identifies sampled loci as being independent of each other if they undergo Mendelian independent assortment. Methods that use these criteria to estimate the number of independent loci per genome as well as intra-chromosomal \\\"distance thresholds\\\" that can be used to delimit independent loci in phylogenomic datasets are reviewed. To compare the efficacy of each criterion, they are applied to two species (an invertebrate and vertebrate) for which relevant genetic and genomic data are available. Although the independent assortment criterion is relatively easy to apply, the results of this study show that it is overly conservative and therefore its use would unfairly restrict the sizes of phylogenomic datasets. It is therefore recommended that researchers only refer to genealogically independent loci when discussing the independent loci assumption in phylogenomics and avoid using terms that may conflate this assumption with independent assortment. Moreover, whenever feasible, researchers should use methods for delimiting putatively independent loci that take into account both homologous recombination and effective population size (i.e., long-term effective recombination).",

    "abstract": "Heritability is essential for understanding the biological causes of disease, but requires laborious patient recruitment and phenotype ascertainment. Electronic health records (EHR) passively capture a wide range of clinically relevant data and provide a novel resource for studying the heritability of traits that are not typically accessible. EHRs contain next-of-kin information collected via patient emergency contact forms, but until now, these data have gone unused in research. We mined emergency contact data at three academic medical centers and identified millions of familial relationships while maintaining patient privacy. Identified relationships were consistent with genetically-derived relatedness. We used EHR data to compute heritability estimates for 500 disease phenotypes. Overall, estimates were consistent with literature and between sites. Inconsistencies were indicative of limitations and opportunities unique to EHR research. These analyses provide a novel validation of the use of EHRs for genetics and disease research.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe demonstrate that next-of-kin information can be used to identify familial relationships in the EHR, providing unique opportunities for precision medicine studies.",
