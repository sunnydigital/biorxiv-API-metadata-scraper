    "abstract": "The extension of the sectional model of the spruce crowns dynamics into diapason (0, 1) of the fractal parameter  has demonstrated the existence of green biomass on branches of three orders in form of photosynthesizing (green) points. We investigated the growth of point sets on an interval as a model of the origin of proto-plants, which are formed due to endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria and protists. The fractal properties of the sets of evenly placed points and group sets were studied using the box-counting method. For the group sets, the character of dependence  on the growing total number of points changes radically differently depending on whether the number of the points per group or the number of groups was fixed. As the host does not have the initial infrastructure needed for an increase in cyanobacteria per group, the first path is implemented and  decreases from 1 to 0.25 when groups consist of two points per group. If and when the host develops necessary anatomical features (infrastructure), the second pathway is realized and  grows to 1. The combined trajectory of  initially demonstrates a slow growth of the size of the photosynthetic system and then an exponential growth after the development of the hosts infrastructure. Similar fractal peculiarity also characterizes trees and is an innate property of plants. Assumptions on the morphological recapitulation of proto-plant in higher plants ontogenesis (embryogenesis and seed germination) and also a possibility to fix the number of cyanobacteria per group are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The assembly and development of the gut microbiome in infants has important consequences for immediate and long-term health. Preterm infants represent an abnormal case for bacterial colonization because of early exposure to bacteria and frequent use of antibiotics. To better understand the assembly of the gut microbiota in preterm infants, fecal samples were collected from 32 very low birthweight preterm infants over the first six weeks of life. Infant health outcomes included healthy, late-onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We characterized the bacterial composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolome by untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Preterm infant fecal samples lacked beneficial Bifidobacterium and were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus due to the near uniform antibiotic administration. Most of the variance between the microbial community compositions could be attributed to which baby the sample came from (Permanova R2=0.48, p<0.001), while clinical status (healthy, NEC, or late-onset sepsis), and overlapping time in the NICU did not explain a significant amount of variation in bacterial composition. Fecal metabolomes were also found to be unique to the individual (Permanova R2=0.43, p<0.001) and weakly associated with bacterial composition (Mantel statistic r = 0.23 {+/-} 0.05 (p = 0.03 {+/-} 0.03). No measured metabolites were found to be associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis or a healthy outcome. Overall, preterm infants gut microbial communities were personalized and reflected antibiotic usage.\\n\\nImportancePreterm infants face health problems likely related to microbial exposures including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the role of the gut microbiome in preterm infant health is poorly understood. Microbial colonization differs from healthy term babies because it occurs in the NICU and is often perturbed by antibiotics. We measured bacterial compositions and metabolomic profiles of 77 fecal samples from thirty-two preterm infants to investigate the differences between microbiomes in health and disease. Rather than finding microbial signatures of disease, we found the preterm infant microbiome and metabolome were both personalized, and that the preterm infant gut microbiome is enriched in microbes that commonly dominate in the presence of antibiotics. These results contribute to the growing knowledge of the preterm infant microbiome and emphasize that a personalized view will be important to disentangling the health consequences of the preterm infant microbiome.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe three-dimensional organization of chromatin plays a critical role in gene regulation and disease. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture experiments such as Hi-C are used to obtain genome-wide maps of 3D chromatin contacts. However, robust estimation of data quality and systematic comparison of these contact maps is challenging due to the multi-scale, hierarchical structure of chromatin contacts and the resulting properties of experimental noise in the data. Measuring concordance of contact maps is important for assessing reproducibility of replicate experiments and for modeling variation between different cellular contexts.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a concordance measure called GenomeDISCO (DIfferences between Smoothed COntact maps) for assessing the similarity of a pair of contact maps obtained from chromosome conformation capture experiments. The key idea is to smooth contact maps using random walks on the contact map graph, before estimating concordance. We use simulated datasets to benchmark GenomeDISCOs sensitivity to different types of noise that affect chromatin contact maps. When applied to a large collection of Hi-C datasets, GenomeDISCO accurately distinguishes biological replicates from samples obtained from different cell types. GenomeDISCO also generalizes to other chromosome conformation capture assays, such as HiChIP.\\n\\nAvailabilitySoftware implementing GenomeDISCO is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/genomedisco.\\n\\nContactakundaje@stanford.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "We develop a novel importance sampler to compute the full likelihood function of a demographic or structural scenario given the site frequency spectrum (SFS) at a locus free of intra-locus recombination. This sampler, instead of representing the hidden genealogy of a sample of individuals by a labelled binary tree, uses the minimal level of information about such a tree that is needed for the likelihood of the SFS and thus takes advantage of the huge reduction in the size of the state space that needs to be integrated. We assume that the population may have demographically changed and may be non-panmictically structured, as reflected by the branch lengths and the topology of the genealogical tree of the sample, respectively. We also assume that mutations conform to the infinitely-many-sites model. We achieve this by a controlled Markov process that generates  particles in the hidden space of SFS histories which are always compatible with the observed SFS.\\n\\nTo produce the particles, we use Aldous Beta-splitting model for a one parameter family of prior distributions over genealogical topologies or shapes (including that of the Kingman coalescent) and allow the branch lengths or epoch times to have a parametric family of priors specified by a model of demography (including exponential growth and bottleneck models). Assuming independence across unlinked loci, we can estimate the likelihood of a population scenario based on a large collection of independent SFS by an importance sampling scheme, using the (unconditional) distribution of the genealogies under this scenario when the latter is available. When it is not available, we instead compute the joint likelihood of the tree balance parameter {beta} assuming that the tree topology follows Aldous Beta-splitting model, and of the demographic scenario determining the distribution of the inter-coalescence times or epoch times in the genealogy of a sample, in order to at least distinguish different equivalence classes of population scenarios leading to different tree balances and epoch times. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach with publicly available code.",

    "abstract": "Short AbstractTraveling waves describe diverse natural phenomena from crystal growth in physics to range expansions in biology. Two classes of waves exist with very different properties: pulled and pushed. Pulled waves are driven by high growth rates at the expansion edge, where the number of organisms is small and fluctuations are large. In contrast, fluctuations are suppressed in pushed waves because the region of maximal growth is shifted towards the population bulk. Although it is commonly believed that expansions are either pulled or pushed, we found an intermediate class of waves with bulk-driven growth, but exceedingly large fluctuations. These waves are unusual because their properties are controlled by both the leading edge and the bulk of the front.\\n\\nLong AbstractEpidemics, flame propagation, and cardiac rhythms are classic examples of reaction-diffusion waves that describe a switch from one alternative state to another. Only two types of waves are known: pulled, driven by the leading edge, and pushed, driven by the bulk of the wave. Here, we report a distinct class of semi-pushed waves for which both the bulk and the leading edge contribute to the dynamics. These hybrid waves have the kinetics of pushed waves, but exhibit giant fluctuations similar to pulled waves. The transitions between pulled, semi-pushed, and fully-pushed waves occur at universal ratios of the wave velocity to the Fisher velocity. We derive these results in the context of a species invading a new habitat by examining front diffusion, rate of diversity loss, and fluctuation-induced corrections to the expansion velocity. All three quantities decrease as a power law of the population density with the same exponent. We analytically calculate this exponent taking into account the fluctuations in the shape of the wave front. For fully-pushed waves, the exponent is -1 consistent with the central limit theorem. In semi-pushed waves, however, the fluctuations average out much more slowly, and the exponent approaches 0 towards the transition to pulled waves. As a result, a rapid loss of genetic diversity and large fluctuations in the position of the front occur even for populations with cooperative growth and other forms of an Allee effect. The evolutionary outcome of spatial spreading in such populations could therefore be less predictable than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroDatas MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ({approx}6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies--much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.",

    "abstract": "A spate of recent work demonstrates that humans seek to avoid the expenditure of cognitive effort, much like physical effort or economic resources. Less is clear, however, about the circumstances dictating how and when people decide to expend cognitive effort. Here we adopt a popular theory of opportunity costs and response vigor and to elucidate this question. This account, grounded in Reinforcement Learning, formalizes a trade-off between two costs: the harder work assumed necessary to emit faster actions and the opportunity cost inherent in acting more slowly (i.e., the delay that results to the next reward and subsequent rewards). Recent work reveals that the opportunity cost of time--operationalized as the average reward rate per unit time, theorized to be signaled by tonic dopamine levels, modulates the speed with which a person responds in a simple discrimination tasks. We extend this framework to cognitive effort in a diverse range of cognitive tasks, for which 1) the amount of cognitive effort demanded from the task varies from trial to trial and 2) the putative expenditure of cognitive effort holds measureable consequences in terms of accuracy and response time. In the domains of cognitive control, perceptual decision-making, and task-switching, we found that subjects tuned their level of effort exertion in accordance with the experienced average reward rate: when the opportunity cost of time was high, subjects made more errors and responded more quickly, which we interpret as a withdrawal of cognitive effort. That is, expenditure of cognitive effort appeared to be modulated by the opportunity cost of time. Further, and consistent with our account, the strength of this modulation was predicted by individual differences in efficacy of cognitive control. Taken together, our results elucidate the circumstances dictating how and when people expend cognitive effort.",

Rats were sacrificed at 3- and 8-weeks after injury for analyses. Analyses performed at each time-point included cellularity (Hematoxylin & Eosin), ECM deposition (Massons Trichrome), bone volume (micro-computed tomography; microCT), osteoclast activity (Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase; TRAP), and collagen fibril organization (Picrosirius Red). Injured and sham shoulders were compared at both 3- and 8-weeks using paired, two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures and Sidaks correction for multiple comparisons.\\n\\nResultsCellularity and ECM deposition increased at both 3- and 8-weeks compared to sham contralateral attachments. Bone volume decreased and osteoclast presence increased at both 3- and 8-weeks compared to sham contralateral limbs. Collagen fibril organization was reduced at 3-weeks after injury compared to 3-week sham attachments.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that a partial-width injury to the rotator cuff attachment does not fully regenerate the native structure of the healthy attachment. The injury model healed via scar-like fibrosis and did not propagate into a full-width tear after 8-weeks of healing.",

The binding of nPIST to actin through multiple actin binding regions facilitated actin filament stabilization in vitro. In vivo, nPIST localized actin in perinuclear region as a blotch when ectopically expressed.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsGeorgia has one of the highest hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence rates in the world, with >5% of the adult population (~150,000 people) chronically infected. In April 2015, the Georgian government, in collaboration with CDC and other partners, launched a national program to eliminate HCV through scaling up HCV treatment and prevention interventions, with the aim of achieving a 90% reduction in prevalence by 2020. We evaluate the interim impact of the HCV treatment program as of 31 October 2017, and assess the feasibility of achieving the elimination goal by 2020.\\n\\nMethodWe developed a dynamic HCV transmission model to capture the current and historical epidemic dynamics of HCV in Georgia, including the main drivers of transmission. Using the 2015 national sero-survey and prior surveys conducted among people who inject drugs (PWID) from 1997-2015, the model was calibrated to data on HCV prevalence by age, gender and PWID status, and the age distribution of PWID. We use the model to project the interim impact of treatment strategies currently being undertaken as part of the ongoing Georgia HCV elimination program, while accounting for treatment failure/loss to follow up, in order to determine whether they are on track to achieving their HCV elimination target by 2020, or whether strategies need to be modified to ensure success.\\n\\nResultsA treatment rate of 2,050 patients/month was required from the beginning of the national program to achieve a 90% reduction in prevalence by the end of 2020, with equal treatment rates of PWID and the general population. From May 2015 to October 2017, 40,420 patients were treated, an average of ~1,350 per month; although the treatment rate has recently declined from a peak of 4,500/month in September 2016 to 2100/month in November-December 2016, and 1000/month in August-October 2017, with a sustained virological response rate (SVR) of 98% per-protocol or 78% intent to treat. The model projects that the treatments undertaken up to October 2017 have reduced adult chronic prevalence by 26% (18-35%) to 3.7% (2.9-5.1%), reduced total incidence by 25% (15-35%), and prevented 1845 (751-3969) new infections and 93 (31-177) HCV-related deaths. If the treatment rate of 1000 patients initiated per month continues, prevalence will have halved by 2020, and reduce by 90% by 2026. In order to reach a 90% reduction by 2020, the treatment rate must increase 3.5-fold to 4000/month.\\n\\nConclusionThe Georgia HCV elimination program has accomplished an impressive scale up of treatment, which has already impacted on prevalence and incidence, and averted deaths due to HCV. However, extensive scale up is needed to achieve a 90% reduction in prevalence by 2020.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the real-world impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) on pneumonia mortality is critical, given the expectation that PCVs can substantially reduce the burden of pneumonia deaths in children under five years. However, surprisingly few post-vaccine introduction studies have estimated the benefit of PCVs for childhood mortality, and results have been inconsistent.\\n\\nMethodsWe investigated the long-term trends in child pneumonia mortality in Brazil (1980-present) and assessed the impact of PCV10 on childhood pneumonia mortality, both nationally and in municipalities stratified by socioeconomic status (SES), after the vaccine was introduced in Brazil in 2010.\\n\\nFindingsBetween 1980 and 2010, a period when Brazils Human Development Index (HDI) rose from 0.55 to 0.71, national pneumonia mortality in children under five decreased 10-fold. Despite rapid uptake of PCV10 following its introduction in 2010, our primary analytical method found no significant decline in national childhood pneumonia mortality, although a secondary analysis found a 10 percent decline in some but not all strata. However, at the municipal level we found significant reductions in childhood pneumonia mortality of up to 24% in low SES strata.\\n\\nInterpretationContrary to expectations, we found that PCV use led to at best modest savings in childhood pneumonia mortality at the national level in a middle-income country. In contrast, we found evidence that PCV led to larger reductions in low-income settings; a similar benefit might occur when PCVs are introduced in other low-SES settings. The long-term findings underscore that improvements in nutrition, hygiene, education, and healthcare play a major role in reducing pneumonia mortality.\\n\\nFundingThis work was funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1114733).

    "abstract": "Ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities are inexorably intertwined. The ecological state determines the fate of newly arising mutants, and mutations that increase in frequency can reshape the ecological dynamics. Evolutionary game theory and its extensions within adaptive dynamics (AD) have been the mathematical frameworks for understanding this interplay, leading to notions such as Evolutionary Stable States (ESS) in which no mutations are favored, and evolutionary branching points near which the population diversifies. A central assumption behind these theoretical treatments has been that mutations are rare so that the ecological dynamics has time to equilibrate after every mutation. A fundamental question is whether qualitatively new phenomena can arise when mutations are frequent. Here we describe an adaptive diversification process that robustly leads to complex ESS, despite the fact that such communities are unreachable through a step-by-step evolutionary process. Rather, the system as a whole tunnels between collective states over a short time scale. The tunneling rate is a sharply increasing function of the rate with which mutations arise in the population. This makes the emergence of ESS communities virtually impossible in small populations, but generic in large ones. Moreover, communities emerging through this process can spatially spread as single replication units that outcompete other communities. Overall, this work provides a qualitatively new mechanism for adaptive diversification and shows that complex structures can generically evolve even when no step-by-step evolutionary path exists.",

    "abstract": "A primary goal of the recent investment in sequencing is to detect novel genetic associations in health and disease improving the development of treatments and playing a critical role in precision medicine. While this investment has resulted in an enormous number of sequenced genomes, individual studies of complex traits are often smaller and underpowered to detect rare variant genetic associations. Existing genetic resources such as the Exome Aggregation Consortium (>60,000 exomes) and the Genome Aggregation Database (~140,000 sequenced samples) could be used as controls in these studies. Fully utilizing these and other existing sequencing resources has the potential to increase power and could be especially useful in studies where resources to sequence additional samples are limited. However, to date, these large, publicly available genetic resources remain underutilized, or even misused, in large part due to the lack of statistical methods that can appropriately use this summary level data. We present a new method to incorporate external controls in case-control analysis called ProxECAT (Proxy External Controls Association Test). ProxECAT estimates enrichment of rare variants within a gene region using internally sequenced cases and external controls. We evaluated ProxECAT in simulations and empirical analyses of obesity cases using both low-depth of coverage (7x) whole-genome sequenced controls and ExAC as controls. We find that ProxECAT maintains the expected type I error rate with increased power as the number of external controls increases. With an accompanying R package, ProxECAT enables the use of publicly available allele frequencies as external controls in case-control analysis.",

To study this, we used an array of molecular, physiological, and photostimulation techniques to examine nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in VTA glutamate neurons. VTA neurons positive for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2+) are responsive to acetylcholine (ACh) released from mesopontine cholinergic axons. VTA VGLUT2+ neurons express mRNA and protein subunits known to comprise typical heteromeric nAChRs. Electrophysiology, coupled with 2-photon microscopy and laser flash photolysis of a photoactivatable nicotine probe, was used to demonstrate nAChR functional activity in the somatodendritic subcellular compartment of VTA VGLUT2+ neurons. Finally, optogenetic isolation of intrinsic VTA glutamatergic microcircuits demonstrated that nicotine potently modulates excitatory transmission within the VTA. These results indicate that VTA glutamate neurons are modulated by cholinergic mechanisms and participate in the cascade of physiological responses to nicotine exposure.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti is the vector of some of the most important vector-borne diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and Yellow fever, affecting millions of people worldwide. The cellular processes that follow a blood meal in the mosquito midgut are directly associated with pathogen transmission. We studied the homeostatic response of the midgut against oxidative stress, as well as bacterial and dengue virus (DENV) infections, focusing on the proliferative ability of the intestinal stem cells (ISC). Inhibition of the peritrophic matrix (PM) formation led to an increase in ROS production by the epithelial cells in response to contact with the resident microbiota, suggesting that maintenance of low levels of ROS in the intestinal lumen is key to keep ISCs division in balance. We show that dengue virus infection induces midgut cell division in both DENV susceptible (Rockefeller) and refractory (Orlando) mosquito strains. However, the susceptible strain delays the activation of the regeneration process compared with the refractory strain. Impairment of the Delta/Notch signaling, by silencing the Notch ligand Delta using RNAi, significantly increased the susceptibility of the refractory strains to DENV infection of the midgut. We propose that this cell replenishment is essential to control viral infection in the mosquito. Our study demonstrates that the intestinal epithelium of the blood fed mosquito is able to respond and defend against different challenges, including virus infection. In addition, we provide unprecedented evidence that the activation of a cellular regenerative program in the midgut is important for the determination of the mosquito vectorial competence.",

    "abstract": "For many decades, researchers have studied how plants use bet-hedging strategies to insure against unpredictable, unfavorable conditions. We improve upon earlier analyses by explicitly accounting for how variable precipitation affects annual plant species bet-hedging strategies. We consider how the survival rates of dormant seeds (in a  seed bank) interact with precipitation responses to influence optimal germination strategies. Specifically, we incorporate how response to resource availability (i.e. the amount of offspring (seeds) generated per plant in response to variation in desert rainfall) influences the evolution of germination fractions. Using data from 10 Sonoran Desert annual plants, we develop models that explicitly include these responses to model fitness as a function of precipitation. For each of the species, we identify the predicted evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) for the fraction of seeds germinating each year and then compare our estimated ESS values to the observed germination fractions. We also explore the relative importance of seed survival and precipitation responses in shaping germination strategies by regressing ESS values and observed germination fractions against these traits. We find that germination fractions are lower for species with higher seed survival, with lower reproductive success in dry years, and with better yield responses in wet years. These results illuminate the evolution of bethedging strategies in an iconic system, and provide a framework for predicting how current and future environmental conditions may reshape those strategies.",

    "abstract": "Most active DNA replication origins are found within euchromatin, while origins within heterochromatin are often inactive or inhibited. In yeast, origin activity within heterochromatin is negatively controlled by the histone H4K16 deacetylase, Sir2, and at some heterochromatic loci also by the nucleosome binding protein, Sir3. The prevailing view has been that direct functions of Sir2 and Sir3 are confined to heterochromatin. However, growth defects in yeast mutants compromised for loading the MCM helicase, such as cdc6-4, are robustly suppressed by deletion of either SIR2 or SIR3. While this and other observations indicate that SIR2,3 can have a negative impact on at least some euchromatic origins, the genomic scale of this effect was unknown. It was also unknown whether this suppression resulted from direct functions of Sir2,3 within euchromatin, or was an indirect effect of their previously established roles within heterochromatin. Using both MCM ChIP-Seq and MNase-H4K16ac ChIP-Seq data, we show that a SIR2 deletion rescues MCM complex loading at ~80% of euchromatic origins in cdc6-4 cells. Therefore, Sir2 exhibits a pervasive effect at the majority of euchromatic origins. Importantly, in wild type (i.e. CDC6) cells, origin-adjacent nucleosomes were depleted for H4K16 acetylation in a SIR2-dependent manner. In addition, both Sir2 and Sir3 directly bound to nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins. The relative levels of each of these molecular hallmarks of yeast heterochromatin - SIR2-dependent H4K16 hypoacetylation, Sir2, and Sir3 - correlated with how strongly a SIR2 deletion suppressed the MCM loading defect in cdc6-4 cells. Finally, a screen for histone H3 and H4 mutants that could suppress the cdc6-4 growth defect identified amino acids that map to a surface of the nucleosome important for Sir3 binding. We conclude that heterochromatin proteins directly bind euchromatic DNA replication origins and modify their local chromatin environment.",

However, few studies have investigated whether adversity has time-dependent effects based on the age at exposure.\\n\\nMethodsUsing a two-stage structured life course modeling approach (SLCMA), we tested the hypothesis that there are sensitive periods when adversity induced greater DNAm changes. We tested this hypothesis in relation to two alternative explanations: an accumulation hypothesis, in which the effect of adversity on DNAm increases with the number of occasions exposed, regardless of timing, and a recency model, in which the effect of adversity is stronger for more proximal events. Data came from the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomics Studies (ARIES), a subsample of mother-child pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n=670-776).\\n\\nResultsAfter covariate adjustment and multiple testing correction, we identified 40 CpG sites that were differentially methylated at age 7 following exposure to adversity. Most loci (n=32) were predicted by the timing of adversity, namely exposures during infancy. Neither the accumulation nor recency of the adversity explained considerable variability in DNAm. A standard EWAS of lifetime exposure (vs. no exposure) failed to detect these associations.\\n\\nConclusionsThe developmental timing of adversity explains more variability in DNAm than the accumulation or recency of exposure.

    "abstract": "During chronic infection, HIV-1 engages in a rapid coevolutionary arms race with the hosts adaptive immune system. While it is clear that HIV exerts strong selection on the adaptive immune system, the characteristics of the somatic evolution that shape the immune response are still unknown. Traditional population genetics methods fail to distinguish chronic immune response from healthy repertoire evolution. Here, we infer the evolutionary modes of B-cell repertoires and identify complex dynamics with a constant production of better B-cell receptor mutants that compete, maintaining large clonal diversity and potentially slowing down adaptation. A substantial fraction of mutations that rise to high frequencies in pathogen engaging CDRs of B-cell receptors (BCRs) are beneficial, in contrast to many such changes in structurally relevant frameworks that are deleterious and circulate by hitchhiking. We identify a pattern where BCRs in patients who experience larger viral expansions undergo stronger selection with a rapid turnover of beneficial mutations due to clonal interference in their CDR3 regions. Using population genetics modeling, we show that the extinction of these beneficial mutations can be attributed to the rise of competing beneficial alleles and clonal interference. The picture is of a dynamic repertoire, where better clones may be outcompeted by new mutants before they fix.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of many retinal degenerations, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is punctuated by an ill-defined network of sterile inflammatory responses. The delineation of innate and adaptive immune milieu amongst the broad leukocyte infiltrate, and the gene networks which construct these responses, are poorly described in the eye. Using photo-oxidative damage in a rodent model of subretinal inflammation, we employed a novel RNA-sequencing framework to map the global gene network signature of retinal leukocytes. This revealed a previously uncharted interplay of adaptive immunity during subretinal inflammation, including prolonged enrichment of myeloid and lymphocyte migration, antigen presentation, and the alternative arm of the complement cascade involving Factor B. We demonstrate Factor B-deficient mice are protected against macrophage infiltration and subretinal inflammation. Suppressing the drivers of retinal leukocyte proliferation, or their capacity to elicit complement responses, may help preserve retinal structure and function during sterile inflammation in diseases such as AMD.",

    "abstract": "How multicellular organisms respond to and are impacted by severe hypothermic stress is largely unknown. From C. elegans screens for mutants abnormally responding to cold-warming stimuli, we identify a molecular genetic pathway comprising ISY-1, a conserved uncharacterized protein, and ZIP-10, a bZIP-type transcription factor. ISY-1 gatekeeps the ZIP-10 transcriptional program by regulating the microRNA mir-60. Downstream of ISY-1 and mir-60, zip-10 levels rapidly and specifically increase upon transient cold-warming response. Prolonged zip-10 up-regulation induces several protease-encoding genes and promotes stress-induced organismic death, or phenoptosis, of C. elegans. zip-10 deficiency confers enhanced resistance to prolonged cold-warming stress, more prominently in adults than larvae. We conclude that the ZIP-10 genetic program mediates cold-warming response and may have evolved to promote wild population kin selection under resource-limiting and thermal stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plastome studies have been the focus of research in plant molecular evolution and systematics. C. cretica L. (Convolvulaceae) is a halophyte, habitat in the ecologically challenged area with high salinity and drought. The complete physical map of plastome revealed that it is 141,419bp long, circular molecule. It contains typical quadripartite structure of large single copy region (LSC 94,808bp), small single copy region (SSC 32,527bp) separated by a pair of inverted repeat regions (IRs 7042bp). This plastome is compared with the complete plastomes of other members of Convolvulaceae showed notable distinctions. An exceptional shift in IRs to SC regions is experienced in C. cretica led to many genes shift in both SC regions and contraction in IRs. The size of IRs reduced to 2 to 4 times as compared to those of the Convolvulaceae members studied. The shifted IRs regions showed remarkable variation in nucleotides patterns. Further, the shift was from the IR boundaries and in between the IR regions led to segment IRs. It is concluded that the shift in IRs may be the strategic move for adaptation in the harsh environment.",

    "abstract": "Although recombination is known to occur in FMDV, it is considered only a minor determinant of virus sequence diversity. This is because recombination appears to be highly suppressed at phylogenetic scales; inter-serotypic recombination events are rare; and in those a mosaic structure is present whereby recombination only occurs almost exclusively in non-structural proteins. Here we show that co-inoculation of closely related strains in buffaloes results over time in extensive within-host recombination in the genomic region coding for structural proteins. This enables us to directly estimate recombination rates for the first time. Quite surprisingly, the effective recombination rate in VP1 during the acute infection phase turns out to be about 0.1 per base per year, i.e. comparable to the mutation/substitution rate. Thanks to the features of our experimental setup, we are also able to build a high-resolution map of effective within-host recombination in the capsid-coding region. We find that the linkage disequilibrium pattern inside VP1 points to a mosaic structure with two main genetic blocks. Positive epistatic interactions between co-evolved variants appear to be present both within and between blocks. These interactions are due to intra-host selection both at the RNA and protein level. Overall our findings show that during FMDV co-infections by closely related strains, capsid-coding genes recombine within the host at a much higher rate than expected, despite the presence of strong constraints dictated by the capsid structure. Although those intra-host results are not immediately transportable to a phylogenetic setting, they force us to reconsider the relevance of recombination and epistasis, suggesting that they must play a major and so far underappreciated role in the molecular evolution of the virus at all time scales.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRecombination in the capsid-coding region of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus genome is highly suppressed at phylogenetic scales. However, the role of recombination in the intra-host dynamics of the virus is not known. In our experiment, a co-infection of African buffaloes with closely related FMDV strains results in a population structure of the intra-host viral swarm, allowing us to detect recombination events. For structural protein-coding sequences, the swarm dynamics is driven by extensive within-host recombination. During the acute infection phase, we infer intra-host recombination rates of 0.1 per base per year, comparable to the typical mutation rate of the virus. The recombination map reveals two linkage blocks within the VP1 protein-coding sequence. Epistatic interactions between co-evolved mutations in VP1 are caused by intra-host selection at the RNA and protein level and are present both within and between blocks. Our findings support a major role for recombination and epistasis in the intra-host evolution of FMDV.",

    "abstract": "Emerging studies have implicated a close link between inositol phosphate (InsP) metabolism and cellular phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in eukaryotes; however, whether a common InsP species is deployed as an evolutionarily conserved metabolic messenger to mediate Pi signaling remains unknown. Here, using genetics and InsP profiling combined with Pi starvation response (PSR) analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana, we showed that the kinase activity of inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1), an enzyme required for phytate (inositol hexakisphosphates; InsP6) synthesis, is indispensable for maintaining Pi homeostasis under Pi-replete conditions, and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase 1 (ITPK1) plays an equivalent role. Although both ipk1-1 and itpk1 mutants exhibited decreased levels of InsP6 and diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-InsP5; InsP7), disruption of another ITPK family enzyme, ITPK4, which correspondingly caused depletion of InsP6 and InsP7, did not display similar Pi-related phenotypes, which precludes these InsP species as effectors. Notably, the level of D/L-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was concurrently elevated in both ipk1-1 and itpk1 mutants, which implies a potential role for InsP4 in regulating Pi homeostasis. However, the level of D/L-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is not responsive to Pi starvation that instead manifests a shoot-specific increase in InsP7 level. This study demonstrates a more nuanced picture of intersection of InsP metabolism and Pi homeostasis and PSR than has previously been elaborated, and additionally establishes intermediate steps to phytate biosynthesis in plant vegetative tissues.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRegulation of phosphate homeostasis and adaptive responses to phosphate limitation is critical for plant growth and crop yield. Accumulating studies implicate inositol phosphates as regulators of phosphate homeostasis in eukaryotes; however, the relationship between inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphate signaling in plants remain elusive. This study dissected the step where inositol phosphate metabolism intersects with phosphate homeostasis regulation and phosphate starvation responses.",

    "abstract": "Maladaptive cardiac remodeling (MCR) is a complex dynamic process common to many heart diseases. MCR is characterized as a temporal progression of global adaptive and maladaptive perturbations. The complex nature of this process clouds a comprehensive understanding of MCR, but greater insight into the processes and mechanisms has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. To provide a deeper understanding of this important cardiac process, we applied a new proteomic technique, PALM (Pulse Azidohomoalanine in Mammals), to quantitate the newly-synthesized protein (NSP) changes during the progression of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MCR in the mouse left ventricle. This analysis revealed a complex combination of adaptive and maladaptive alterations at acute and prolonged time points including the identification of proteins not previously associated with MCR. We also combined the PALM dataset with our published protein turnover rate dataset to identify putative biochemical mechanisms underlying MCR. The novel integration of analyzing NSPs together with their protein turnover rates demonstrated that alterations in specific biological pathways (e.g., inflammation and oxidative stress) are produced by differential regulation of protein synthesis and degradation.",
