    "abstract": "More than 200 years ago, von Humboldt reported decreases in tropical plant species richness with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Surprisingly, co-ordinated patterns in plant, bacterial and fungal diversity on tropical mountains are yet to be observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria and fungi can follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found co-ordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional-dissimilarity of communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of co-ordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi and plants. These findings suggest that, across landscape scales of relatively constant soil pH, inter-related patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers can occur, with large implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that conflict is common among gene trees in phylogenomic studies, and that less than one percent of genes may ultimately drive species tree inference in supermatrix analyses. Here, we examined two datasets where supermatrix and coalescent-based species trees conflict. We identified two highly influential \\\"outlier\\\" genes in each dataset. When removed from each dataset, the inferred supermatrix trees matched the topologies obtained from coalescent analyses. We also demonstrate that, while the outlier genes in the vertebrate dataset have been shown in a previous study to be the result of errors in orthology detection, the outlier genes from a plant dataset did not exhibit any obvious systematic error and therefore may be the result of some biological process yet to be determined. While topological comparisons among a small set of alternate topologies can be helpful in discovering outlier genes, they can be limited in several ways, such as assuming all genes share the same topology. Coalescent species tree methods relax this assumption but do not explicitly facilitate the examination of specific edges. Coalescent methods often also assume that conflict is the result of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here we explored a framework that allows for quickly examining alternative edges and support for large phylogenomic datasets that does not assume a single topology for all genes. For both datasets, these analyses provided detailed results confirming the support for coalescent-based topologies. This framework suggests that we can improve our understanding of the underlying signal in phylogenomic datasets by asking more targeted edge-based questions.",

Persistence has been attributed to viral replication in an ART sanctuary and long-lived and1or proliferating latently infected cells. Using ecological methods and existing data, we infer that >99% of infected cells are members of clonal populations after one year of ART. We reconcile our results with observations from the first months of ART, demonstrating mathematically how a \\\"fossil record\\\" of historic HIV replication permits observed viral evolution even while most new infected cells arise from proliferation. Together, our results imply cellular proliferation generates a majority of infected cells during ART. Therefore, reducing proliferation could decrease the size of the HIV reservoir and help achieve a functional cure.",

The multi-compartment protein p32 is overexpressed and present at cell surfaces in a variety of tumors, including TNBC, specifically in the malignant cells and endothelial cells, and in macrophages localized in hypoxic areas of the tumor. Herein we used polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone polymersomes that were affinity targeted with the p32-binding tumor penetrating peptide LinTT1 (AKRGARSTA) for imaging of TNBC lesions. A tyrosine residue was added to the peptide to allow for 124I labeling and PET imaging. In a TNBC model in mice, systemic LinTT1-targeted polymersomes accumulated in early tumor lesions more than twice as efficiently as untargeted polymersomes with up to 20% ID/cc at 24 h after administration. The PET-imaging was very sensitive, allowing detection of tumors as small as [~]20mm3. Confocal imaging of tumor tissue sections revealed a high degree of vascular exit and stromal penetration of LinTT1-targeted polymersomes and co-localization with tumor-associated macrophages. Our studies show that systemic LinTT1-targeted polymersomes can be potentially used for precision-guided tumor imaging and treatment of TNBC.",

    "abstract": "In the hippocampus, episodic memories are thought to be encoded by the formation of ensembles of synaptically coupled CA3 pyramidal cells driven by sparse but powerful mossy fiber inputs from dentate gyrus granule cells. Since CA3 network capacity is finite, a mechanism for enhancing memory encoding during important events would ensure greater efficiency, but the salient signal that might determine this memory selectivity filter is unknown. Using experimental and computational methods we show that the cholinergic system can operate as a memory selectivity filter by combining 3 separate mechanisms: disinhibition of feed-forward mossy fiber inhibition enables synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses; Increasing cellular excitability lowers the threshold for ensemble formation; Reduction of overall CA3-CA3 recurrent synapse strength allows for an increase in overlap between ensembles. Thus, we show that acetylcholine release enables the selective encoding of salient high-density episodic memories in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "We collected 60 age-dependent transcriptomes for C. elegans strains including four exceptionally long-lived mutants (mean adult lifespan extended up to 9.4-fold) and three examples of RNAi treatments that increased lifespan by 19 - 35%. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals aging as a transcriptomic drift along a single direction, consistent across the vastly diverse biological conditions and coinciding with the first principal component, a hallmark of the criticality of the underlying gene regulatory network. We, therefore, expected that the organisms aging state could be characterized by a single number closely related to vitality deficit or biological age. The \\\"aging trajectory\\\", i.e. the dependence of the biological age on chronological age, is then a universal stochastic function modulated by the network stiffness; a macroscopic parameter reflecting the network topology and associated with the rate of aging. To corroborate this view, we used publicly available datasets to define a transcriptomic biomarker of age and observed that the rescaling of age by lifespan simultaneously brings together aging trajectories of transcription and survival curves. In accordance with the theoretical prediction, the limiting mortality value at the plateau agrees closely with the mortality rate doubling exponent estimated at the cross-over age near the average lifespan. Finally, we used the transcriptomic signature of age to identify possible life-extending drug compounds and successfully tested a handful of the top ranking molecules in C. elegans survival assays and achieved up to a +30% extension of mean and median lifespan.",

Here, we assessed the contributions of multiple properties to scene representation by partitioning the variance explained in human behavioral and brain measurements by three feature models whose inter-correlations were minimized a priori through stimulus preselection. Behavioral assessments of scene similarity reflected unique contributions from a functional feature model indicating potential actions in scenes as well as high-level visual features from a deep neural network (DNN). In contrast, similarity of cortical responses in scene-selective areas was uniquely explained by mid- and high-level DNN features only, while an object label model did not contribute uniquely to either domain. The striking dissociation between functional and DNN features in their contribution to behavioral and brain representations of scenes indicates that scene-selective cortex represents only a subset of behaviorally relevant scene information.",

    "abstract": "In most systems, dispersal occurs despite clear fitness costs to dispersing individuals. Theory posits that spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality pushes dispersal rates to evolve towards zero, while temporal heterogeneity in habitat quality favours non-zero dispersal rates. One aspect of dispersal evolution that has received a great deal of recent attention is a process known as spatial sorting, which has been referred to as a \\\"shy younger sibling\\\" of natural selection. More precisely, spatial sorting is the process whereby variation in dispersal ability is sorted along density clines and will, in nature, often be a transient phenomenon. Despite this transience, spatial sorting is likely a general mechanism behind non-zero dispersal in spatiotemporally varying environments. While generally transient, spatial sorting is persistent on invasion fronts, where its effect cannot be ignored, causing rapid evolution of traits related to dispersal. Spatial sorting is described in several elegant models, yet these models require a high level of mathematical sophistication and are not accessible to most evolutionary biologists or their students. Here, we frame spatial sorting in terms of the classic haploid and diploid models of natural selection. We show that, on an invasion front, spatial sorting can be conceptualized precisely as selection operating through space rather than (as with natural selection) time, and that genotypes can be viewed as having both spatial and temporal aspects of fitness. The resultant model is strikingly similar to classic models of natural selection. This similarity renders the model easy to understand (and to teach), but also suggests that many established theoretical results around natural selection could apply equally to spatial sorting.",

    "abstract": "Effective use of semantic knowledge requires a set of conceptual representations and control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of this knowledge are retrieved and selected. It is well-established that levels of semantic knowledge increase across the lifespan. However, the effects of ageing on semantic control processes have not been assessed. I addressed this issue by comparing the performance profiles of young and older people on a verbal comprehension test. Two sets of variables were used to predict accuracy and RT in each group: (a) the psycholinguistic properties of words probed in each trial, (b) the performance on each trial by two groups of semantically-impaired neuropsychological patients. Young people demonstrated poor performance for low frequency and abstract words, suggesting that they had difficulty processing words with intrinsically weak semantic representations. Indeed, performance in this group was strongly predicted by the performance of patients with semantic dementia, who suffer from degradation of semantic knowledge. In contrast, older adults performed poorly on trials where the target semantic relationship was weak and distractor relationships strong - conditions which require high levels of controlled processing. Their performance was not predicted by the performance of semantic dementia patients, but was predicted by the performance of patients with semantic control deficits. These findings indicate that the effects of ageing on semantic cognition are more complex than has previously been assumed. While older people have larger stores of knowledge than young people, they appear to be less skilled at exercising control over the activation of this knowledge.",

The human gut, more than any other environment, encourages the maintenance of endospore formation, with recent culture-based work suggesting that over 50% of genera in the microbiome carry genes attributed to this trait. However, there has been limited work on the ecological role of endospores and other stress-resistant cellular states in the human gut. In fact, there is no data to indicate whether organisms with the genetic potential to form endospores actually form endospores in situ and how sporulation varies across individuals and over time. Here, we applied a culture-independent protocol to enrich for endospores and other stress-resistant cells in human feces to identify variation in these states across people and within an individual over time. We see that cells with resistant states are more likely than those without to be shared among multiple individuals, which suggests that these resistant states are particularly adapted for cross-host dissemination. Furthermore, we use untargeted fecal metabolomics in 24 individuals and within a person over time to show that these organisms respond to shared environmental signals, and in particular, dietary fatty acids, that likely mediate colonization of recently disturbed human guts.",

Unlike the MYCOTB plate, on which UKMYC5 is based, the plate included two new (bedaquiline and delamanid) and two repurposed (clofazimine and linezolid) compounds. UKMYC5 plates were tested by seven laboratories on four continents using a panel of 19 external quality assessment (EQA) strains, including H37Rv. To assess the optimal combination of reading method and incubation time, MICs were measured from each plate by two readers using three methods (mirrored-box, microscope and Vizion Digital viewing system) after 7, 10, 14 and 21 days incubation. In addition, all EQA strains were whole-genome sequenced and phenotypically characterized by 7H10/7H11 agar proportion method (APM) and MGIT960. We conclude that the UKMYC5 plate is optimally read using the Vizion system after 14 days incubation, achieving an inter-reader agreement of 97.9% and intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibilities of 95.6% and 93.1%, respectively. The mirrored-box had similar reproducibilities. Strains classified as resistant by APM, MGIT960 or the presence of mutations known to confer resistance consistently record elevated MICs compared with those strains classified as susceptible. Finally, the UKMYC5 plate records intermediate MICs for one strain which the APM measured MICs close the applied critical concentration, providing early evidence that the UKMYC5 plate can quantitatively measure the magnitude of resistance to anti-TB compounds due to specific genetic variation.",

Sustained commitment to a trying task is crucial, however, disengagement from one behavior to engage into another can be essential for optimal adaptation and survival. How neural circuits allow prioritizing perseverance over withdrawal based on the animals need is not understood. Using a single fly spherical treadmill, we show that hungry flies display increasing perseverance to track a food odor in the repeated absence of the predicted food reward. While this perseverance is mediated by a group of dopaminergic neurons, a subset of neurons expressing octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, provide reward feedback and counteract dopamine-motivated food seeking.

    "abstract": "The peptidoglycan cell wall provides an essential protective barrier in almost all bacteria, defining cellular morphology and conferring resistance to osmotic stress and other environmental hazards. The precursor to peptidoglycan, lipid II, is assembled on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, peptidoglycan polymerization occurs on the outer face of the plasma membrane, and lipid II must be flipped across the membrane by the MurJ protein prior to its use in peptidoglycan synthesis. Due to its central role in cell wall assembly, MurJ is of fundamental importance in microbial cell biology and is a prime target for novel antibiotic development. However, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms of MurJ function, and structural data are only available for MurJ from the extremophile Thermosipho africanus. Here, we report the crystal structure of substrate-free MurJ from the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, revealing an inward-open conformation. Taking advantage of the genetic tractability of E. coli, we performed high-throughput mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing to assess mutational tolerance at every amino acid in the protein, providing a detailed functional and structural map for the enzyme and identifying sites for inhibitor development. Finally, through the use of sequence co-evolution analysis we identify functionally important interactions in the outward-open state of the protein, supporting a rocker-switch model for lipid II transport.",

    "abstract": "Plants respond in a similar manner to aphid feeding as to pathogen attack. Diuraphis noxia is a specialist aphid, feeding only on selected grasses that include wheat, barley, and oats. The wheat-Diuraphis noxia interaction is characterized by very similar responses as seen in wheat-pathogen interactions with none of the underlying resistance pathways and genes characterized yet. From wheat harboring the Dn1 resistance gene, we have identified a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene containing two integrated domains (IDs). These are three C-terminus ankyrin repeat-domains and an N-terminus WRKY domain. The NLR core of the gene can be traced through speciation events within the grass family, with a recent WRKY domain integration that is Triticum specific. Virus induced gene silencing of the gene in resistant wheat lines resulted in the abolishment of localized cell death. Silenced plants supported a higher number of aphids similar to the susceptible NIL and the intrinsic rate of increase of the aphids matched that of aphids feeding on the susceptible NIL. The presence of the gene is necessary for Dn1 resistance and we have named the gene Associated with Dn resistance 1 (Adr1) to reflect this function.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of experimental data points to immunological and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we study the role of IL-23, the microbiome, and the diet in the development of colitis. To promote IL-23 expression in vivo, we generated a mouse model in which IL-23 was conditionally expressed by CX3CR1+ myeloid cells, upon cyclic administration of tamoxifen in a specific diet (diet 2019). IL-23 expression induced an intestinal inflammatory disease that resembled ulcerative colitis in humans with cycles of acute disease and remission. The relapses were caused by the diet switch from the conventional diet used in our facility (diet 5053) to the diet 2019, and were not dependent on tamoxifen after the first cycle. The switch in the diet modified the microbiota, but did not alter the levels of IL-23. Colitis induction depended on the microbiota and required CD4 T lymphocytes. Colitis-inducing CD4+ T cells were found in the mesenteric lymph node and large intestine during remission and were able to trigger disease when transferred to lymphopenic mice, but only upon diet modification. The CD4 TCR repertoire in the diseased recipient Rag-/- mice had reduced diversity associated with the expansion of dominant T cell clones. These findings reveal a critical role for IL-23 in generation of a CD4+ T cell population in mice that is sensitive to a modification of intestinal bacterial flora subsequent to a dietary manipulation. Dietary changes occurring in the context of altered IL-23 expression may contribute to the onset and progression of IBD.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFood security is a growing global concern. Farmers, plant breeders, and geneticists are hastening to address the challenges presented to agriculture by climate change, dwindling arable land, and population growth. Scientists in the field of plant phenomics are using satellite and drone images to understand how crops respond to a changing environment and to combine genetics and environmental measures to maximize crop growth efficiency. However, the terabytes of image data require new computational methods to extract useful information. Machine learning algorithms are effective in recognizing select parts of images, but they require high quality data curated by people to train them, a process that can be laborious and costly. We examined how well crowdsourcing works in providing training data for plant phenomics, specifically, segmenting a corn tassel - the male flower of the corn plant - from the often-cluttered images of a cornfield. We provided images to students, and to Amazon MTurkers, the latter being an on-demand workforce brokered by Amazon.com and paid on a task-by-task basis. We report on best practices in crowdsourcing image labeling for phenomics, and compare the different groups on measures such as fatigue and accuracy over time. We find that crowdsourcing is a good way of generating quality labeled data, rivaling that of experts.",

We report that functional human adipose tissue can be generated from mesenchymal progenitor cells in-vivo, providing an alternative approach to its therapeutic use. We leveraged previous findings that progenitor cells within the vasculature of human adipose tissue robustly proliferate in 3-dimensional culture under proangiogenic conditions. Implantation of these progenitor cells into immunocompromised mice results in differentiation towards non-adipocyte fates, incapable of generating a distinct tissue structure. However, priming of these progenitor cells in-vitro towards adipogenic differentiation results in formation of functional adipose tissue in-vivo. Mechanistically, priming induces the expression of genes encoding specific extracellular matrix and remodeling proteins, and induces extensive vascularization by host blood vessels. In comparison, grafts from adipose tissue obtained by liposuction undergo poor vascularization, adipocyte death, cyst formation, calcification and inefficient adiponectin secretion. Thus, primed mesenchymal adipose tissue progenitors reveal mechanisms of human adipose tissue development, and have potential to improve outcomes in reconstructive and regenerative medicine.",

To assess the biological relevance of this subtyping, we compared functional magnetic resonance imaging-based dynamic and static functional connectivity between subgroups in a subset of the total sample.\\n\\nResultsWe identified five subgroups with distinct symptom profiles, cutting across diagnostic boundaries and differing in terms of total severity, symptom patterns and centrality. For instance, inability to relax, fear of the worst, and feelings of guilt were among the most severe symptoms in subgroup 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These subgroups showed evidence of differential static brain connectivity patterns, in particular comprising a fronto-temporal network. In contrast, we found no significant associations with clinical sum scores, dynamic functional connectivity or global connectivity measures.\\n\\nConclusionAdding to the ongoing pursuit of individual-based treatment, the results show subtyping based on a dimensional conceptualization and unique constellations of anxiety and depression symptoms is supported by distinct brain static functional connectivity patterns.",

    "abstract": "The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany studies have examined how the spiking activity of single neurons can encode stimulus features, such the direction of motion of visual stimuli. However, majority of such studies to date have only recorded from a small number of neurons at the same time, meaning that one cannot adequately account for the trial-to-trial correlations in spiking activity between neurons. Using multi-channel recordings, we were able to measure the neuronal correlations, and their effects on population coding of stimulus features. Our results have implications on the way which neural populations must be readout in order to maximize information.",

    "abstract": "The direct-site hypothesis assumes general anesthetics bind ion channels to impact protein equilibrium and function, inducing anesthesia. Despite advancements in the field, a first-principle all-atom demonstration of this structure-function premise misses. We focus on clinically used sevoflurane interaction to anesthetic-sensitive Kv1.2 mammalian channel to resolve if sevoflurane binds the proteins well-characterized open and closed structures in a conformation-dependent manner to shift channel equilibrium. We employ an innovative approach relying on extensive docking calculations and free-energy perturbation and find sevoflurane binds open and closed structures at multiple sites under complex saturation and concentration effects. Results point to a non-trivial interplay of conformation-dependent modes of action involving distinct binding sites that increase channel open-probability at diluted ligand concentrations. Given the challenge in exploring more complex processes potentially impacting channel-anesthetic interaction, the result is reassuring as demonstrates that the process of multiple binding events alone may account for open-probability shifts recorded in measurements.",

Stem/progenitors were speculated to be involved in the regeneration of endometrial epithelial and pathogenesis of endometriosis. But the identity, microenvironment and regulatory mechanisms of the uterus epithelial stem/progenitors in vivo remain unclear. Here, we dissected the cell heterogeneities of the full-thickness human uterus epithelial cells (11 clusters), stroma cells (6 clusters), endothelial cells (5 clusters), smooth muscle cells (2 clusters), myofibroblasts (2 clusters) and immune cells (6 clusters) from 2735 single cell by single cell RNA-seq. Further analysis identified a unique ciliated epithelial cell cluster showing characteristics of stem/progenitors with properties of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that mainly localized in the upper functionalis of the endometrium. Ordering the cell subpopulations along the pseudo-space revealed cell clusters possess cellular states of stress, inflammation and apoptosis in the upper functionalis cellular ecosystem of the endometrium. Connectivity map between the human uterus subpopulations revealed potential inflammatory (cytokines and chemokines) and developmental (WNT, FGF, VEGF) signals within the upper functionalis cellular ecosystem of the endometrium, especially from other epithelial clusters, regulating cell plasticity of the EMT-epithelial clusters. This study reconstructed the heterogeneities, space-specific distribution and connectivity map of human uterus atlas, which would provide insight in the regeneration of uterus endometria and reference for the pathogenesis of uterus.",

Yet, the ability to quantify and profile sRNAs, specifically miRNAs, using high-throughput sequencing is especially challenging because of their small size and repetitive nature. We developed QsRNA-seq, a method for preparation of sRNA libraries for high-throughput sequencing that overcomes this difficulty by enabling separation of fragments shorter than 100nt long that differ only by 20nt in length. The method supports using unique molecular identifiers for quantification. We show that QsRNA-seq gives very accurate, comprehensive and reproducible results. Using QsRNA-seq to study the miRNA repertoire in C. elegans embryo and L4 larval developmental stages, enabled extending the list of miRNAs that are expressed in a developmental-specific manner. Interestingly, we found that miRNAs 23nt long are predominantly expressed in developmental stage L4, suggesting a possible connection between the length of miRNA and its developmental role.",

In this study, we re-assessed molecular adaptation of mammalian CRISPs through an analysis of larger sequence datasets that represent mammalian diversity. Our analyses show evidence of recent episodes of positive selection for all mammalian CRISPs. Intensity of positive selection was heterogeneous both among CRISP paralogs (being stronger in CRISP3 than in CRISP1 and CRISP2) and across functional domains (having more impact on CRD or PR-1 domain). Analysis of episodic selection did not yield strong signatures of adaptive evolution in any particular mammalian group, suggesting that positive selection was more pervasive on mammalian CRISPs. Our findings provide evidence of adaptive evolution in a family of reproduction-related proteins, and offer interesting insights regarding the role of mammalian CRISPs in fertility and speciation.",

The nucleosome is the basic packaging unit of DNA forming arrays that are suggested, by biochemical studies, to fold hierarchically into ordered higher-order structures of chromatin. This defined organization of chromatin has been recently questioned using microscopy techniques, proposing a rather irregular structure. To gain more insight into the principles of chromatin organization, we applied an in situ differential MNase-seq strategy and analyzed in silico the results of complete and partial digestions of human chromatin. We investigated whether different levels of chromatin packaging exist in the cell. Thus, we assessed the accessibility of chromatin within distinct domains of kb to Mb genomic regions by utilizing statistical data analyses and computer modelling. We found no difference in the degree of compaction between domains of euchromatin and heterochromatin or between other sequence and epigenomic features of chromatin. Thus, our data suggests the absence of differentially compacted domains of higher-order structures of chromatin. Moreover, we identified only local structural changes, with individual hyper-accessible nucleosomes surrounding regulatory elements, such as enhancers and transcription start sites. The regulatory sites per se are occupied with structurally altered nucleosomes, exhibiting increased MNase sensitivity. Our findings provide biochemical evidence that supports an irregular model of large-scale chromatin organization.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder. The etiology is not fully understood, but genetics plays an important role. Pathway analysis of genetic variants have suggested a central role for neuronal synaptic processes. Currently available antipsychotic medications successfully control positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) largely by inhibiting the dopamine D2 receptors; however, these drugs have more limited impact on negative symptoms (social withdrawal, flat affections, anhedonia) and cognitive deterioration. Drug development efforts have focused on a wide range of neurotransmitter systems and other agents, with conflicting or inconclusive results. New drug development paradigms are needed. A recent analysis, using common variant association results to match drugs based on their transcriptional perturbation signature, found drugs enriched in known antipsychotics plus novel candidates.\\n\\nWe followed a similar approach, but started our analysis from a synaptic gene network implicated by rare copy number loss variants. We found that a significant number of antipsychotics (p-value = 0.0002) and other psychoactive drugs (p-value = 0.0004) upregulate synaptic network genes. Based on global gene expression similarity, active drugs formed two main clusters: one with many known antipsychotics and antidepressants, the other with various drug categories including two nootropics. We specifically recommend further examination of nootropics with limited side effects (meclofenoxate, piracetam and vinpocetine) for combination therapy with antipsychotics to improve cognitive performance. Detailed experimental follow-up is required to further evaluate other candidate drugs lacking an official nervous system indication, although, for at least a few of these, psychoactive effects have been reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Cell type identification from an unknown sample can often be done by comparing its gene expression profile against a gene expression database containing profiles of a large number of cell-types. This type of compendium-based cell-type identification strategy is particularly successful for human and mouse samples because a large volume of data exists for these organisms. However, such rich data repositories often do not exist for most non-model organisms. This makes transcriptome-based sample classification in these species challenging. We propose to overcome this challenge by performing a cross-species compendium comparison. The key is to utilise a recently published cross-species gene set analysis (XGSA) framework to correct for biases that may arise due to potentially complex homologous gene mapping between two species. The framework is implemented as an open source R package called C3. We have evaluated the performance of C3 using a variety of public data in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. We also compared the functionality and performance of C3 against some similar gene expression profile matching tools. Our evaluation shows that C3 is a simple and effective method for cell type identification. C3 is available at https://github.com/VCCRI/C3.",

    "abstract": "Biological organisms are complex systems that are composed of functional networks of interacting molecules and macromolecules. Complex phenotypes are the result of orchestrated, hierarchical, heterogeneous collections of expressed genomic variants. However, the effects of these variants are the result of historic selective pressure and current environmental and epigenetic signals, and, as such, their co-occurrence can be seen as genome-wide correlations in a number of different manners. Biomass recalcitrance (i.e., the resistance of plants to degradation or deconstruction, which ultimately enables access to a plants sugars) is a complex polygenic phenotype of high importance to biofuels initiatives. This study makes use of data derived from the re-sequenced genomes from over 800 different Populus trichocarpa genotypes in combination with metabolomic and pyMBMS data across this population, as well as co-expression and co-methylation networks in order to better understand the molecular interactions involved in recalcitrance, and identify target genes involved in lignin biosynthesis/degradation. A Lines Of Evidence (LOE) scoring system is developed to integrate the information in the different layers and quantify the number of lines of evidence linking genes to lignin-related lignin-phenotypes across the network layers. The resulting Genome Wide Association Study networks, integrated with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) correlation, co-methylation and co-expression networks through the LOE scores are proving to be a powerful approach to determine the pleiotropic and epistatic relationships underlying cellular functions and, as such, the molecular basis for complex phenotypes, such as recalcitrance.",

    "abstract": "Point spread function (PSF) engineering is used in single emitter localization to measure the emitter position in 3D and possibly other parameters such as the emission color or dipole orientation as well. Advanced PSF models such as spline fits to experimental PSFs or the vectorial PSF model can be used in the corresponding localization algorithms in order to model the intricate spot shape and deformations correctly. The complexity of the optical architecture and fit model makes PSF engineering approaches particularly sensitive to optical aberrations. Here, we present a calibration and alignment protocol for fluorescence microscopes equipped with a spatial light modulator (SLM) with the goal of establishing a wavefront error well below the diffraction limit for optimum application of complex engineered PSFs. We achieve high-precision wavefront control, to a level below 20 m{lambda} wavefront aberration over a 30 minute time window after the calibration procedure, using a separate light path for calibrating the pixel-to-pixel variations of the SLM, and alignment of the SLM with respect to the optical axis and Fourier plane within 3 {micro}m (x/y) and 100 {micro}m (z) error. Aberrations are retrieved from a fit of the vectorial PSF model to a bead z-stack and compensated with a residual wavefront error comparable to the error of the SLM calibration step. This well-calibrated and corrected setup makes it possible to create complex  3D+{lambda} PSFs that fit very well to the vectorial PSF model. Proof-of-principle bead experiments show precisions below 10 nm in x, y, and{lambda} , and below 20 nm in z over an axial range of 1 {micro}m with 2000 signal photons and 12 background photons.",

A workflow allowing long time recordings of single Gag molecule localization, diffusion and effective energy maps was developed for robust quantitative analysis of HIV assembly and budding. Comparison of numerous cell plasma membrane assembling platforms in cells expressing wild type or assembly-defective Gag proteins showed that VLP formation last 15 minutes, with an assembly time of 5 minutes, and that the nucleocapsid domain is mandatory.

    "abstract": "Tetraploid cells, which are most commonly generated by errors in cell division, are genomically unstable and have been shown to promote tumorigenesis. Recent genomic studies have estimated that [~]40% of all solid tumors have undergone a genome-doubling event during their evolution, suggesting a significant role for tetraploidy in driving the development of human cancers. To safeguard against the deleterious effects of tetraploidy, non-transformed cells that fail mitosis and become tetraploid activate both the Hippo and p53 tumor suppressor pathways to restrain further proliferation. Tetraploid cells must therefore overcome these anti-proliferative barriers to ultimately drive tumor development. However, the genetic routes through which spontaneously arising tetraploid cells adapt to regain proliferative capacity remain poorly characterized. Here, we conducted a comprehensive, gain-of-function genome-wide screen to identify miRNAs that are sufficient to promote the proliferation of tetraploid cells. Our screen identified 23 miRNAs whose overexpression significantly promotes tetraploid proliferation. The vast majority of these miRNAs facilitate tetraploid growth by enhancing mitogenic signaling pathways (e.g. miR-191-3p); however, we also identified several miRNAs that impair the p53/p21 pathway (e.g. miR-523-3p), and a single miRNA (miR-24-3p) that potently inactivates the Hippo pathway via downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene NF2. Collectively, our data reveal several avenues through which tetraploid cells may regain the proliferative capacity necessary to drive tumorigenesis.",

Its Exo70 subunit functions as a spatiotemporal regulator by mediating numerous interactions with proteins and lipids. However, a molecular understanding of the exocyst functions remains challenging. Exo70B2 localized to dynamic foci at the plasma membrane and transited through Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive compartments, indicating that it participates in conventional secretion. Conversely, treatment with the immunogenic peptide flg22 or the salicylic acid (SA) defence hormone analogue Benzothiadiazole (BTH), induced Exo70B2 transport into the vacuole where it colocalized with autophagic markers AUTOPHAGY-RELATED PROTEIN 8 (ATG8) and NEIGHBOR OF BRCA1 GENE 1 (NBR1). According with its role in immunity, we discovered that Exo70B2 interacts with and is phosphorylated by the MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (MPK3). Mimicking phosphorylation inhibited Exo70B2 localization at sites of active secretion. By contrast, lines expressing phosphonull variants displayed higher Effector-Triggered Immunity and were hypersensitive to BTH, conditions known to induce the secretory pathway. Our results suggest a molecular mechanism by which phosphorylation of Exo70B2 regulates interaction with the plasma membrane, and couples the secretory pathway with cellular signalling.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress, associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, induces imbalance in ROS generation, impairs cellular antioxidant defences and finally triggers both neurons and astroglial cell death by apoptosis. Astrocytes specifically synthesize and release endozepines, a family of regulatory peptides, including the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). We have previously reported that ODN is a potent neuroprotective agent that prevents 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic neuronal death. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential glioprotective effect of ODN on 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress and cell death in cultured rat astrocytes. Incubation of astrocytes with graded concentrations of ODN (10-14 to 10-8 M) inhibited 6-OHDA-evoked cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In addition, ODN prevented the decrease of mitochondrial activity and caspase-3 activation induced by 6-OHDA. Toxin-treated cells exhibited high level of ROS associated with a generation of H2O2 and O2{degrees}-and a reduction of both SOD and catalase activities. Co-treatment of astrocytes with low concentrations of ODN dose dependently blocked 6-OHDA-evoked ROS production and inhibition of antioxidant enzymes activities. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ODN is a potent glioprotective agent that prevents 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death. ODN is thus a potential candidate to delay neuronal damages in various pathological conditions involving oxidative neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The monitoring of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and trafficking is of great importance because their imbalance leads to many pathologies. Reliable tools for cholesterol detection are in demand. This study presents the design and synthesis of fluorescent probes for cholesterol recognition and demonstrates their selectivity by a variety of methods. The construction of dedicated library of 14 probes was based on heterocyclic (pyridine)-sterol derivatives with various attached fluorophores. The most promising probe, a P1-BODIPY conjugate FP-5, was analyzed in detail and showed an intensive labeling of cellular membranes followed by intracellular redistribution into various cholesterol rich organelles and vesicles. FP-5 displayed a stronger signal, with faster kinetics, than the commercial TF-Chol probe. In addition, cells with pharmacologically disrupted cholesterol transport, or with a genetic mutation of cholesterol transporting protein NPC1, exhibited strong and fast FP-5 labeling in the endo/lysosomal compartment, co-localizing with filipin staining of cholesterol. Hence, FP-5 has high potential as a new probe for monitoring cholesterol trafficking and its disorders.\\n\\nSignificance statementCholesterol is a vital steroid molecule with many important functions in animal cells. Although its dysregulation is associated with an expanding list of clinically important pathologies, the study of its role is limited by a lack of reliable tools for live intracellular monitoring. This study demonstrates the applicability of a novel class of heterocyclic sterol probes. These probes exhibit fast cellular uptake with effective fluorescence labeling of sterol species in a variety of living cells, without a need for artificial carriers. When applied to Niemann-Pick disease type C1 cells, they identified massive accumulation of cholesterol in the endosome/lysosome compartment. Thus, several probes from the same series can also be used for visualizing lysosomal storage disorders and sterol transporting pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation in new environments depends on the amount and type of genetic variation available for evolution, and the efficacy by which natural selection discriminates among this variation to favour the survival of the fittest. However, whether some environments systematically reveal more genetic variation in fitness, or impose stronger selection pressures than others, is typically not known. Here, we apply enzyme kinetic theory to show that rising global temperatures are predicted to intensify natural selection systematically throughout the genome by increasing the effects of DNA sequence variation on protein stability. We tested this prediction by i) estimating temperature-dependent fitness effects of induced random mutations in seed beetles adapted to ancestral or warm temperature, and ii) calculating 100 paired selection estimates on mutations in benign versus stressful environments from a diverse set of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Environmental stress per se did not increase the mean strength of selection on de novo mutation, suggesting that the cost of adaptation does not generally increase in new environments to which the organism is maladapted. However, elevated temperature increased the mean strength of selection on genome-wide polymorphism, signified by increases in both mutation load and mutational variance at elevated temperature. The theoretical predictions and empirical data suggest that this increase may correspond to a doubling of genome-wide selection for a predicted 2-4{degrees}C climate warming scenario in ectothermic organism living at temperatures close to their thermal optimum. These results have important implications for global patterns of genetic diversity and the rate and repeatability of evolution under climate change.\n\nImpact StatementNatural environments are constantly changing so organisms must also change to persist. Whether they can do so ultimately depends upon the reservoir of raw genetic material available for evolution, and the efficacy by which natural selection discriminates among this variation to favour the survival of the fittest. Here, the biochemical properties of molecules and proteins that underpin the link between genotype and phenotype can exert a major influence over how the physical environment affects the expression of phenotypes and the fitness consequences of DNA sequence polymorphism. Yet, the constraints set by these molecular features are often neglected within eco-evolutionary theory trying to predict evolution in new environments. Here we combine predictions from existing biophysical models of protein folding and enzyme kinetics with experimental data from ectothermic organisms across the tree of life, to show that rising global temperatures are predicted to increase the mean strength of selection on DNA sequence variation in cold-blooded organisms. We also show that environmental stress per se generally does not increase the mean strength of selection on new mutations, suggesting that genome-wide natural selection is not stronger in new environments to which an organism is maladapted. Theoretical predictions and data suggest that an expected climate warming scenario of a 2-4{degrees}C temperature raise within the forthcoming century will result in roughly a doubling of genome-wide selection for organisms living close to their thermal optima. However, our results also point to substantial variability in the temperature-dependence of selection on different proteins within and between organisms, suggesting scope for compensatory adaptation to shape this relationship. These results bear witness to and extend the universal temperature dependence of biological rates and have important implications for global patterns of genetic diversity and the rate and repeatability of genome evolution under environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Policing occurs in insect, animal and human societies, where it is used as a conditional strategy to prevent cheating and enforce cooperation. Recently, it has been suggested that policing might even be relevant in enforcing cooperation in much simpler organisms such as bacteria. Here, we used individual-based modelling to develop an evolutionary concept for policing in bacteria, and identify the conditions under which it can be adaptive. We modelled interactions between cooperators, producing a beneficial public good, cheaters exploiting the public good without contributing to it, and public good producing policers that secrete a toxin to selectively target cheaters. We found that toxin-mediated policing is favored when (i) toxins are potent and durable, (ii) cheap to produce, (iii) cell and public good diffusion is intermediate, and (iv) toxins diffuse farther than the public good. Overall, we show that toxin-mediated policing can enforce cooperation, but the parameter space where it is beneficial seems quite narrow. Moreover, we found that policing decays when the genetic linkage between public good and toxin production breaks. This is because policing is itself a public good, offering protection to toxin-resistant mutants that still produce public goods, yet no longer invest in toxins. Our work suggests that very specific environmental conditions are required for genetically fixed policing mechanisms to evolve in bacteria, and offers empirically testable predictions for their evolutionary stability.",

Not much, however, is known about the neuropeptide complement of the sister group Xenacoelomorpha. This group is comprised of the three clades Xenoturbella, Nemertodermatida, and Acoela, which differ strongly in their nervous system anatomy. In order to reconstruct the ancestral bilaterian neuropeptide complement and gain insights into neuropeptide evolution within Xenacoelomorpha, we analyzed transcriptomes of 13 acoels, nemertodermatids, and Xenoturbella species. Together with motif searches, similarity searches, mass spectrometry and phylogenetic analyses of neuropeptide precursors and neuropeptide receptors, we reconstruct the xenacoelomorph neuropeptide complement. Our comparison of xenacoelomorph GPCRs with cnidarian and nephrozoan neuropeptide receptors shows that the neuropeptide signaling diversified into at least 20 ancestral peptidergic systems in the lineage to Bilateria. We find that Xenoturbella species possess many of the ancestral bilaterian peptidergic systems and only a few clade-specific neuropeptides. Nemertodermatids seem to have nearly the complete complement of ancestral bilaterian systems and several novel neuropeptides. Acoels show an extensive loss of conserved bilaterian systems, but gained the highest number of novel and group-specific neuropeptides. While it is difficult to correlate the emergence of the bilaterian neuropeptide complement with the evolution of centralized nervous systems, we find a correlation between nervous system novelties and the expansion of taxon-specific neuropeptides in Xenacoelomorpha.",

Especially in heterogeneous metapopulations, a tight coupling between dispersal, population dynamics and the evolution of local adaptation is expected. In this respect, current theory predicts dispersal to counteract ecological specialisation by redistributing locally selected phenotypes (i.e. migration load). However, in nature we observe that some specialists exhibit a strong dispersal capacity.\\n\\nHabitat choice following informed dispersal decisions, provides a possible mechanism for individuals to match the environment to their phenotype, thereby enabling the persistence of evolved ecological specialisation. How such informed decisions affect the evolution of dispersal and ecological specialisation and how these, in turn, influence metapopulation dynamics is yet to be determined.\\n\\nBy means of individual-based modelling, we show that informed decisions on both departure and settlement decouples the evolution of dispersal and generalism, favouring highly dispersive specialists. Choice at settlement decouples dispersal from ecological specialisation most effectively. Additionally, habitat choice stabilizes local and metapopulation demography because of the maintenance of ecological specialisation at all levels of dispersal propensity.\\n\\nWe advocate considering habitat choice in spatially structured ecological models to improve demographic predictions in the face of environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Species tree inference is fundamental to our understanding of the evolution of life on earth. However, species tree inference from molecular sequence data is complicated by gene duplication events that limit the availably of suitable data for phylogenetic reconstruction. Here we propose a novel method for species tree inference called STAG that is specifically designed to leverage data from multi-copy gene families. By application to 12 real species datasets sampled from across the eukaryotic domain we demonstrate that species trees inferred from multi-copy gene families are comparable in accuracy to species trees inferred from single-copy orthologues. We further show that the ability to utilise data from multi-copy gene families increases the amount of data available for species tree inference by an average of 8 fold. We reveal that on real species datasets STAG has higher accuracy than other leading methods for species tree inference; including concatenated alignments of protein sequences, ASTRAL & NJst. Finally we show that STAG is fast, memory efficient and scalable and thus suitable for analysis of large multispecies datasets.",

    "abstract": "Genetic changes in the dengue virus (DENV) genome affects viral fitness both clinically and epidemiologically. Even in the 3 untranslated region (3UTR), mutations could impact the formation of subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) and the specificity of sfRNA in inhibiting host proteins necessary for successful viral replication. Indeed, we have recently shown that mutations in the 3UTR of DENV2 affected its ability to inhibit TRIM25 E3 ligase activity to reduce interferon (IFN) expression, which potentially contributed to the emergence of a new viral clade during the 1994 dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico. However, whether differences in 3UTRs shaped DENV evolution on a larger scale remains incompletely understood. Herein, we combined RNA phylogeny with phylogenetics to gain insights on sfRNA evolution. We found that sfRNA structures are under purifying selection and highly conserved despite sequence divergence. Interestingly, only the second flaviviral Nuclease-resistant RNA (fNR2) structure of DENV-2 has undergone strong positive selection. Epidemiological reports also suggest that nucleotide substitutions in fNR2 may drive DENV-2 epidemiological fitness, possibly through sfRNA-protein interactions. Collectively, our findings indicate that 3UTRs are important determinants of DENV fitness in human-mosquito cycles.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDengue viruses (DENV) preserve RNA elements in their 3 untranslated region (UTR).\\nC_LIO_LISite-specific quantification of natural selection revealed positive selection on DENV2 sfRNA.\\nC_LIO_LIFlaviviral nuclease-resistant RNA (fNR) structures in DENV 3UTRs contribute to DENV speciation.\\nC_LIO_LIA highly evolving fNR structure appears to increase DENV-2 epidemiological fitness.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has become clear that phase separation represents an important class of subcellular compartmentalization. However, relatively little is known about how the formation or disassembly of such compartments is regulated. In zebrafish, the Balbiani body (Bb) and the germ plasm (Gp) are phase-separated structures essential for germ cell specification and home to many germ cell-specific mRNAs and proteins. Throughout development, these structures range from a single large aggregate (Bb), to a dispersed state and back to relatively large assemblies (Gp). Formation of the Bb requires Bucky ball (Buc), a protein with prion-like properties. We found that the multi-tudor domain-containing protein Tdrd6a interacts directly with Buc, affecting its mobility and aggregation properties. Importantly, lack of this regulatory interaction leads to significant defects in germ cell development. Our work presents a new mechanism for how prion-like protein-aggregations can be regulated and highlights the biological relevance of such regulatory events.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and, according to the prion model, transcellular propagation of pathological \\\"seeds\\\" may underlie its progression. Staging of NFT pathology with phospho-tau antibody is useful to classify AD and primary age-related tauopathy (PART) cases. The locus coeruleus (LC) shows the earliest phospho-tau signal, whereas other studies suggest that pathology begins in the transentorhinal/entorhinal cortices (TRE/EC). The relationship of tau seeding activity, phospho-tau pathology, and progression of neurodegeneration remains obscure. Consequently, we employed an established cellular biosensor assay to quantify tau seeding activity in fixed human tissue, in parallel with AT8 phospho-tau staining of immediately adjacent sections. We studied four brain regions from each of n=247 individuals across a range of disease stages. We detected the earliest and most robust seeding activity in the TRE/EC. The LC did not uniformly exhibit seeding activity until later NFT stages. We also detected seeding activity in the first temporal gyrus and visual cortex at stages before NFTs and/or AT8-immunopositivity were detectable. AD and putative PART cases exhibited similar patterns of seeding activity that anticipated histopathology across all NFT stages. Our findings are consistent with the prion model and suggest that pathological seeding activity begins in the TRE/EC rather than in the LC, and may offer an important addition to classical histopathology.",

To this end, we used both a sport-specific pseudo 3-D contextual cueing task and the original contextual cueing paradigm (Chun & Jiang, 1998). Contextual cueing was present in all groups. However, handball and action video game players did not differ in the strength of contextual cueing from the control group. Action video game players had shorter search times than controls in both experiments. In contrast, the handball players searched faster than controls in the sport-specific displays of Experiment 1 but not in the symbolic search task of Experiment 2. Thus, our findings provide no evidence that contextual cueing is a limiting factor for expert performance in the domain of team sports or action video game playing.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, hemispheric lateralization of alpha power has emerged as a neural mechanism thought to underpin spatial attention across sensory modalities. Yet, how healthy aging, beginning in middle adulthood, impacts the modulation of lateralized alpha power supporting auditory attention remains poorly understood. In the current electroencephalography (EEG) study, middle-aged and older adults (N = 29; ~40-70 years) performed a dichotic listening task that simulates a challenging, multi-talker scenario. We examined the extent to which the modulation of 8-12 Hz alpha power would serve as neural marker of listening success across age. With respect to the increase in inter-individual variability with age, we examined an extensive battery of behavioral, perceptual, and neural measures. Similar to findings on younger adults, middle-aged and older listeners' auditory spatial attention induced robust lateralization of alpha power, which synchronized with the speech rate. Notably, the observed relationship between this alpha lateralization and task performance did not co-vary with age. Instead, task performance was strongly related to an individuals attentional and working memory capacity. Multivariate analyses revealed a separation of neural and behavioral variables independent of age. Our results suggest that in age-varying samples as the present one, the lateralization of alpha power is neither a sufficient nor necessary neural strategy for an individuals auditory spatial attention, as higher age might come with increased use of alternative, compensatory mechanisms. Our findings emphasize that explaining inter-individual variability will be key to understanding the role of alpha oscillations in auditory attention in the aging listener.",

    "abstract": "We present the first-ever detailed models of pyramidal cells from human neocortex, including models on their excitatory synapses, dendritic spines, dendritic NMDA- and somatic/axonal- Na+ spikes that provided new insights into signal processing and computational capabilities of these principal cells. Six human layer 2 and layer 3 pyramidal cells (HL2/L3 PCs) were modeled, integrating detailed anatomical and physiological data from both fresh and post mortem tissues from human temporal cortex. The models predicted particularly large AMPA- and NMDA- conductances per synaptic contact (0.88 nS and 1.31nS, respectively) and a steep dependence of the NMDA-conductance on voltage. These estimates were based on intracellular recordings from synaptically-connected HL2/L3 pairs, combined with extra-cellular current injections and use of synaptic blockers. A large dataset of high-resolution reconstructed HL2/L3 dendritic spines provided estimates for the EPSPs at the spine head (12.7 {+/-} 4.6 mV), spine base (9.7 {+/-} 5.0 mV) and soma (0.3 {+/-} 0.1 mV), and for the spine neck resistance (50 - 80 M{Omega}). Matching the shape and firing pattern of experimental somatic Na+-spikes provided estimates for the density of the somatic/axonal excitable membrane ion channels, predicting that 134 {+/-} 28 simultaneously activated HL2/L3- HL2/L3 synapses are required for generating (with 50% probability) a somatic Na+ spike. Dendritic NMDA spikes were triggered in the model when 20 {+/-} 10 excitatory spinous synapses were simultaneously activated on individual dendritic branches. The particularly large number of basal dendrites in HL2/L3 PCs and the distinctive cable elongation of their terminals imply that ~25 NMDA- spikes could be generated independently and simultaneously in these cells, as compared to ~14 in L2/3 PCs from the rat temporal cortex. These multi-sites nonlinear signals, together with the large (~30,000) excitatory synapses/cell, equip human L2/L3 PCs with enhanced computational capabilities. Our study provides the most comprehensive model of any human neuron to-date demonstrating the biophysical and computational distinctiveness of human cortical neurons.",

Here we test the hypothesis that, while humans are sensitive to the noise present during early sensory processing, the \\\"optimality gap\\\" arises because they are blind to noise introduced by later cognitive integration of variable or discordant pieces of information. In six psychophysical experiments, human observers judged the average orientation of an array of contrast gratings. We varied the stimulus contrast (encoding noise) and orientation variability (integration noise) of the array. Participants adapted near-optimally to changes in encoding noise, but, under increased integration noise, displayed a range of suboptimal behaviours: they ignored stimulus base rates, reported excessive confidence in their choices, and refrained from opting out of objectively difficult trials. These overconfident behaviours were captured by a Bayesian model which is blind to integration noise. Our study provides a computationally grounded explanation of suboptimal cognitive inferences.",

A spatiotemporally fine-grained mixed effects multiple regression analysis revealed overlapping effects of predictability and plausibility on the N400, albeit with distinct spatiotemporal profiles. Our results challenge the view that the predictability-dependent N400 reflects the effects of either prediction or integration, and suggest that semantic facilitation of predictable words arises from a cascade of processes that activate and integrate word meaning with context into a sentence-level meaning.",

    "abstract": "Spatial or temporal aspects of neural organisation are known to be important indices of how cognition is organised. However, measurements and estimations are often noisy and many of the algorithms used are probabilistic, which in combination have been argued to limit studies exploring the neural basis of specific aspects of cognition. Focusing on static and dynamic functional connectivity estimations, we propose to leverage this variability to improve statistical efficiency in relating these estimations to behaviour. To achieve this goal, we use a procedure based on permutation testing that provides a way of combining the results from many individual tests that refer to the same hypothesis. This is needed when testing a measure whose value is obtained from a noisy process, which can be repeated multiple times, referred to as replications. Focusing on functional connectivity, this noisy process can be: (i) computational, e.g. when using an approximate inference algorithm for which different runs can produce different results or (ii) observational, if we have the capacity to acquire data multiple times, and the different acquired data sets can be considered noisy examples of some underlying truth. In both cases, we are not interested in the individual replications but on the unobserved process generating each replication. In this note, we show how results can be combined instead of choosing just one of the estimated models. Using both simulations and real data, we show the benefits of this approach in practice.",

However, the mechanisms underlying these metabolic effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate the lipoxygenase, ALOXE3, is a novel effector of the thepatic fasting response. We show that ALOXE3 is activated during fasting, glucose withdrawal, and trehalose/trehalose analogue treatment. Hepatocyte-specific ALOXE3 expression reduced weight gain and hepatic steatosis in dietaryand genetically obese (db/db) models. ALOXE3 expression moreover enhanced basal thermogenesis and abrogated insulin resistance in db/db diabetic mice. Targeted metabolomics demonstrated accumulation of the PPAR{gamma} ligand, 12-KETE in hepatocytes overexpressing ALOXE3. Strikingly, PPAR{gamma} inhibition reversed hepatic ALOXE3-mediated insulin sensitization, suppression of hepatocellular ATP production and oxygen consumption, and gene induction of PPAR{gamma} coactivator-1a (PGC1) expression. Moreover, hepatocyte-specific PPAR{gamma} deletion reversed the therapeutic effect of hepatic ALOXE3 expression on diet-induced insulin intolerance. ALOXE3 is therefore a novel effector of the hepatocellular fasting response that leverages both PPAR{gamma}-mediated and pleiotropic effects to augment hepatic and whole-host metabolism, and is thus a promising target to ameliorate metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "Plants differ from animals in their capability to easily regenerate fertile adult individuals from terminally differentiated cells [1]. This unique developmental plasticity is commonly observed in nature where many species can reproduce asexually through the ectopic initiation of organogenic or embryogenic developmental programs [2, 3]. However, it is not currently known if this developmental reprogramming is coupled to a global epigenomic resetting, or what impact it has on the phenotype of the clonal progeny. Here we show that plants asexually propagated via induction of a zygotic developmental program do not fully reset cell-specific epigenetic imprints. These imprints are instead inherited even over multiple rounds of sexual reproduction, becoming fixed in hybrids and resulting in heritable molecular and physiological phenotypes that depend on the founder cell used. Our results demonstrate how novel phenotypic variation in plants can be unlocked through the incomplete reprogramming of cell-specific epigenetic marks during asexual propagation.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry.The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package PhyDyn for the BEAST phylogenetics platform.",

It has been suggested that all membrane {beta}-barrels other than lysins are homologous. Here we suggest that {beta}-barrels of efflux pumps have converged on this fold as well. By grouping structurally-solved outer membrane {beta}-barrels (OMBBs) by sequence we find evidence that the membrane environment may have led to convergent evolution of the barrel fold. Specifically, the lack of sequence linkage to other barrels coupled with distinctive structural differences, such as differences in strand tilt and barrel radius, suggest that efflux pumps have evolutionarily converged on the barrel. Finally, we find a possible ancestor for the OMBB efflux pumps as they are related to periplasmic components of the same pumps.",

We hypothesized whether a mapping algorithm \\\"Ripple-mapping\\\" would be able to rapidly identify the areas of long-duration multicomponent electrograms which constitute the targets for ablation for an automated strategy.\\n\\nMethodsRipple-Mapping analysis was performed in all patients undergoing catheter ablation of Brugada syndrome in 2 centers. The activity propagation pattern determined by Ripple-Mapping was assessed, and areas of long duration potentials identified by visual inspection. The area of interest with long-duration potentials was correlated with the location of the ablation lesions.\\n\\nResultsDetection of long duration potentials was possible in all four patients in this analysis. Points marking the ablation area in 2 patients were a perfect match to abnormal areas identified by Ripple-mapping. However, in 2 patients Ripple-mapping identified additional sites of long duration potentials which were not ablated. Acute and mid-term normalization of the ECG pattern was observed in three patients, and all these were free from arrhythmia relapse during a 10.3{+/-}3.2 months follow-up. In one patient, who had no ECG normalization and had arrhythmia relapse, the ablated area corresponded to <25% of the Ripple-map region of interest.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study shows the potential use of Ripple-mapping for identifying areas of long duration multicomponent electrograms in patients with Brugada syndrome and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. This technique enables the rapid definition of an area of interest which should then be validated by the operator before performing ablation with an end-point of ECG normalisation.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that therapeutic sleep deprivation (SD) has rapid antidepressant effects in the majority of depressed patients. Investigation of factors preceding and accompanying these effects may facilitate the identification of the underlying biological mechanisms. This exploratory study aimed to examine clinical and genetic factors predicting response to SD and determine the impact of SD on illness course. Mood and tiredness during SD were also assessed via visual analogue scales (VAS). Depressed inpatients (n = 78) and healthy controls (n = 15) underwent ~36hrs of SD. Response to SD was defined as a score of [&le;]2 on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Global Improvement. Depressive symptom trajectories were evaluated for up to a month using self/expert ratings. Impact of genetic burden was calculated using polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder. 72% of patients responded to SD. Responders and nonresponders did not differ in baseline self/expert depression symptom ratings, but mood subjectively measured by VAS scale differed. Response was associated with lower age (p = 0.007) and later age at life-time disease onset (p = 0.003). Higher genetic burden of depression was observed in non-responders than healthy controls. Up to a month post-SD, depressive symptoms decreased in both patients groups, but more in responders, in whom effects were sustained. The present findings suggest that re-examining SD with a greater focus on biological mechanisms will lead to better understanding of mechanisms of depression.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing occurs in the context of chromatin, which is heterogeneous in structure and function across the genome. Chromatin heterogeneity is thought to affect genome editing efficiency, but this has been challenging to quantify due to the presence of confounding variables. Here, we develop a method that exploits the allele-specific chromatin status of imprinted genes in order to address this problem. Because maternal and paternal alleles of imprinted genes have identical DNA sequence and are situated in the same nucleus, allele-specific differences in the frequency and spectrum of Cas9-induced mutations can be attributed unequivocally to epigenetic mechanisms. We found that heterochromatin can impede mutagenesis, but to a degree that depends on other key experimental parameters. Mutagenesis was impeded by up to 7-fold when Cas9 exposure was brief and when intracellular Cas9 expression was low. Surprisingly, the outcome of mutagenic DNA repair was independent of chromatin state, with similar efficiencies of homology directed repair and deletion spectra on maternal and paternal chromosomes. Combined, our data show that heterochromatin imposes a permeable barrier that influences the kinetics, but not the endpoint of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, and suggest that therapeutic applications involving low-level Cas9 exposure will be particularly affected by chromatin status.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA analysis of three individuals dated to ~3000 years before present (BP) from Vanuatu and one ~2600 BP individual from Tonga has revealed that the first inhabitants of Remote Oceania (\\\"First Remote Oceanians\\\") were almost entirely of East Asian ancestry, and thus their ancestors passed New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands with minimal admixture with the Papuan groups they encountered [1]. However, all present-day populations in Near and Remote Oceania harbor 25-100% Papuan ancestry, implying that there must have been at least one later stream of migration eastward from Near Oceania. We generated genome-wide data for 14 ancient individuals from Efate and Epi Islands in Vanuatu ranging from 3,000-150 BP, along with 185 present-day Vanuatu individuals from 18 islands. We show that people of almost entirely Papuan ancestry had arrived in Vanuatu by 2400 BP, an event that coincided with the end of the Lapita cultural period, changes in skeletal morphology, and the cessation of long-distance trade between Near and Remote Oceania [2]. First Remote Oceanian ancestry subsequently increased via admixture but remains at 10-20% in most islands. Through a fine-grained comparison of ancestry profiles in Vanuatu and Polynesia with diverse groups in Near Oceania, we find that Papuan ancestry in Vanuatu is consistent with deriving from the Bismarck Archipelago instead of the geographically closer Solomon Islands. Papuan ancestry in Polynesia also shows connections to the ancestry profiles present in the Bismarck Archipelago but is more similar to Tolai from New Britain and Tutuba from Vanuatu than to the ancient Vanuatu individuals and the great majority of present-day Vanuatu populations. This suggests a third eastward stream of migration from Near to Remote Oceania bringing a different type of Papuan ancestry.",

We tested whether this applied to HD cells of the medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum, areas where the HD signal contributes to the periodic firing of grid cells. Manipulations of the visual landmarks surrounding freely-moving mice altered the tuning of HD cells. Importantly, these tuning modifications were often non-coherent across cells, refuting the notion that HD cells form a uniform population constrained by attractor-like dynamics. Instead, examination of theta rhythmicity 1revealed two types of HD cells, theta rhythmic and non-rhythmic cells. Larger tuning alterations were observed predominantly in non-rhythmic HD cells. Moreover, only non-rhythmic HD cells reorganized their firing associations in response to visual land-mark changes. These findings reveal a theta non-rhythmic HD signal whose malleable organization is controlled by visual landmarks.",

It was also found that gender and the size of the conference contributed significantly towards the speakers timing. Male speakers exceeded their allocated time more frequently than female speakers, especially at large conferences (60% vs 49%).

    "abstract": "This study presents data on average stone tool weights and the hardness of foods processed by the three known stone-tool-using primate species: Burmese long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis aurea), bearded capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus) and Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Each of these primates uses stone hammers to crack open nuts in the wild, making them suitable for inter-species behavioural comparison. This work draws on published results to identify a distinct difference in the tool weight/food hardness curve between chimpanzees and the two monkey taxa, with the latter reaching an asymptote in mean tool weight of just over 1 kg regardless of increasing food hardness. In contrast, chimpanzees rapidly increase their tool weight in response to increasing hardness, selecting average masses over 5 kg to process the hardest nuts. Species overlap in their preference for tools of 0.8-1 kg for opening foods of hardness 2-3 kN, suggesting that this conjunction may represent a primate stone-tool-use optimum.",

    "abstract": "Four young laboratory-born Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) looked at the photographs of familiar and unfamiliar persons presented at upright and inverted orientations by pressing the lever under the conjugate schedule of sensory reinforcement (successive preferential looking procedure). Three types of photographs were prepared: photographs with persons taken in front view, those taken in back, and those without persons. The monkeys looked longer when the face was upright than inverted only for the pictures containing unfamiliar person with front view. The other types of photographs did not cause inversion effect. Familiarity weakened the face-specific inversion effect in monkeys. This difference may be due to in part the lower preference for familiar faces and the difference in processing mode between familiar and unfamiliar faces.",

    "abstract": "The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples to the heterotrimeric G protein GS. Here we determine the structure by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of A2AR at pH 7.5 bound to the small molecule agonist NECA and coupled to an engineered heterotrimeric G protein, which contains mini-GS, the {beta}{gamma} subunits and nanobody Nb35. Most regions of the complex have a resolution of ~3.8 [A] or better. Comparison with the 3.4 [A] resolution crystal structure shows that the receptor and mini-GS are virtually identical and that the density of the side chains and ligand are of comparable quality. However, the cryo-EM density map also indicates regions that are flexible in comparison to the crystal structures, which unexpectedly includes regions in the ligand binding pocket. In addition, an interaction between intracellular loop 1 of the receptor and the {beta} subunit of the G protein was observed.",

    "abstract": "Among older Europeans grip strength has been found to be marked by a disadvantaged adulthood. Across the Channel, among older Britons gait speed as another measure of physical function has been found to be marked by disadvantaged childhood. Using the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (2004-2013), we studied whether childhood poverty led to Europeans aged 50 to 104 years having a weaker grip. We then drew their trajectories of repeatedly measured grip strength to discern a steeper decline among the childhood poor. Retrospective childhood poverty some four to nine decades in the past was treated as a latent construct following the above literature; attrition during repeated measurements is handled using inverse proportional to attrition weighting. The data showed the childhood poor to have a weaker grip for half a century in later life. However, they do not show a steeper decline. Most important, by contributing to levels of grip strength in later life, adult condition holds the potential to shape the strong and long arm of childhood condition. The results are another impetus to eliminate childhood poverty to ensure healthy ageing Europeans.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal waves of influenza display a complex spatiotemporal pattern resulting from the interplay of biological, socio-demographic, and environmental factors. At country level many studies characterized the robust properties of annual epidemics, depicting a typical season. Here we analyzed season-by-season variability, introducing a clustering approach to assess the deviations from typical spreading patterns. The classification is performed on the similarity of temporal configurations of onset and peak times of regional epidemics, based on influenza-like-illness time-series in France from 1984 to 2014. We observed a larger variability in the onset compared to the peak. Two relevant classes of clusters emerge: groups of seasons sharing similar recurrent spreading patterns (clustered seasons) and single seasons displaying unique patterns (monoids). Recurrent patterns exhibit a more pronounced spatial signature than unique patterns. We assessed how seasons shift between these classes from onset to peak depending on epidemiological, environmental, and socio-demographic variables. We found that the spatial dynamics of influenza and its association with commuting, previously observed as a general property of French influenza epidemics, applies only to seasons exhibiting recurrent patterns. The proposed methodology is successful in providing new insights on influenza spread and can be applied to incidence time-series of different countries and different diseases.",

    "abstract": "Predicting which novel microorganisms may spill over from animals to humans has become a major priority in infectious disease biology. However, there are few tools to help assess the zoonotic potential of the enormous number of potential pathogens, the majority of which are undiscovered or unclassified and may be unlikely to infect or cause disease in humans. We adapt a new biological machine learning technique - phylofactorization - to partition viruses into clades based on their non-human host range and whether or not there exist evidence they have infected humans. Our cladistic analyses identify clades of viruses with common within-clade patterns - unusually high or low propensity for spillover. Phylofactorization by spillover yields many clades of viruses containing few to no representatives that have spilled over to humans, including the families Papillomaviridae and Herpesviridae, and the genus Parvovirus. Removal of these non-zoonotic clades from previous trait-based analyses changed the relative significance of traits determining spillover due to strong associations of traits with non-zoonotic clades. Phylofactorization by host breadth yielded clades with unusually high host breadth, including the family Togaviridae. We identify putative life-history traits differentiating clades host breadth and propensities for zoonosis, and discuss how these results can prioritize sequencing-based surveillance of emerging infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation has been implicated in many diseases in later life of older Britons. Moreover, health outcomes in later life have also been markedly affected by childhood poverty. But no study has established whether childhood poverty has the effect of upregulating inflammation throughout later life. Using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2004 - 2013) life history information and longitudinal observations of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen as inflammatory biomarkers, we studied the association between childhood condition and trajectories of inflammation for people aged 50 to 97 years. Retrospective childhood poverty some four to eight decades in the past was treated as a latent construct; attrition in longitudinal observations is addressed using inverse proportional to attrition weighting. The analytis revealed significantly higher levels of both biomarkers throughout later life among those with a poor childhood, though there is no evidence of a steeper inflammation trajectory among them. We discussed possible epigenetic changes underlying this strong and long arm of childhood condition. The results suggest that eliminating child poverty can prove to be a wise investment with the prospect of a lifelong reward.",

    "abstract": "The spiral cleavage pattern is characteristic for Spiralia (Lophotrochozoa), a large assembly of marine invertebrates. In most cases, spiral cleavage produces freely swimming, trochophora-type larvae with a simple nervous system that controls ciliary locomotion. These larvae acquire bilateral symmetry, as manifested for example in the larval brain. The transition from the rotational symmetry of spiral cleavage into the bilateral adult body has not yet been understood. Here, we present the developmental cell lineage of the brain of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii from the zygote until the mid-trochophore stage (~30 hpf), in combination with a gene expression atlas for several embryonic and larval stages. Comparison of multiple embryos reveals a highly stereotypical development and an invariant cell lineage of the differentiated cell types. In addition, we observe a fundamental subdivision of the larval brain into a highly proliferative dorsolateral region and an early differentiating ventromedial region that gives rise to the apical nervous system. The transition from rotational to bilateral symmetry progresses gradually from the lateral to the central regions. Strikingly, the spiral-to-bilateral transition does not involve extensive cell migration. Rather, corresponding cells in different spiral quadrants acquire highly divergent identities in line with their bilateral position.",

    "abstract": "How diverse adult stem and progenitor populations regenerate tissue following damage to the CNS remains unknown across most neurogenic domains. To understand the role of quiescent radial-glial (qRG) stem cells during regeneration, we tested the hypothesis that qRG could be induced to proliferate and produce newborn neurons. We designed a stab lesion assay in the midbrain tectum of the adult zebrafish to target an isolated population of qRG, and investigated their proliferative behaviour, differentiation potential, and requirement of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling for the regenerative response. EdU-labelling showed that a small proportion of qRG transit to a proliferative state (pRG), but that progeny of pRG are restricted to a radial-glial fate. Lesion promoted upregulation of proliferation and neurogenesis from neuro-epithelial-like amplifying progenitors (NE-Ap) of the tectal marginal zone (TMZ). Homeostatic levels of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling persisted under lesioned conditions in the qRG/pRG population, whereby increased {beta}-catenin staining and axin2 expression was present in the NE-Ap progenitor zone. Attenuation of Wnt signalling using Dickkopf-1, demonstrated that proliferative responses post-injury appeared to be Wnt-independent. Our results align with the emerging view that adult stem/progenitor phenotypes are characterized by discrete, rather than mutual, regenerative programs and that different stem cell domains employ different modes of regeneration.",
