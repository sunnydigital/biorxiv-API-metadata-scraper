    "abstract": "Individuals with psychiatric disorders have elevated rates of autoimmune comorbidity and altered immune signaling. It is unclear whether these altered immunological states have a shared genetic basis with those psychiatric disorders. The present study sought to use existing summary-level data from previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to determine if commonly varying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are shared between psychiatric and immune-related phenotypes. We estimated heritability and examined pair-wise genetic correlations using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics (HESS) methods. Using LDSC, we observed significant genetic correlations between immune-related disorders and several psychiatric disorders, including anorexia nervosa, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, smoking behavior, and Tourette syndrome. Loci significantly mediating genetic correlations were identified for schizophrenia when analytically paired with Crohns disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. We report significantly correlated loci and highlight those containing genome-wide associations and candidate genes for respective disorders. We also used the LDSC method to characterize genetic correlations amongst the immune-related phenotypes. We discuss our findings in the context of relevant genetic and epidemiological literature, as well as the limitations and caveats of the study.",

    "abstract": "Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants probability of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions time, but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a \\\"stochastic satisficing\\\" (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen options thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence. We further tested and verified the predictions of this model in a second experiment. Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions. Finally, we discuss how the stochastic satisficing account of decision confidence serves psychological and social purposes associated with the evaluation, communication and justification of decision-making.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEvery day we make several choices under uncertainty, like choosing a queue in a supermarket. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such decisions remain unknown. For example, how does one choose between an option with unreliable high expected reward, like the volatile express queue, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward in the standard queue? Inspired by bounded rationality and the notion of  satisficing, i.e. settling for a good enough option, we propose that such decisions are made by comparing the likelihood of different actions to surpass an acceptability threshold. When facing uncertain decisions, our participants confidence ratings were not consistent with the expected outcomes rewards, but instead followed the satisficing heuristic proposed here. Using an acceptability threshold may be especially useful when evaluating and justifying decisions under uncertainty.",

In a recent paper, Kursel and Malik (February 2017; doi: 10.1093/molbev/msx091) reported that the Drosophila CenH3 homologue Cid underwent four independent duplication events during evolution. Particularly interesting is the duplication that took place in the common ancestor of the Drosophila subgenus and led to the subfunctionalization and high divergence of the Cid1 and Cid5 paralogs. Here, we describe another independent Cid duplication (Cid1 leading to Cid6) in the buzzatii cluster (repleta group) of the Drosophila subgenus. Moreover, we found that, in addition to the Cid1/Cid5 duplication, Cenp-C was also duplicated (Cenp-C1, Cenp-C2) in the common ancestor of the Drosophila subgenus. Analyses of expression and tests for positive selection indicate that both Cid5 and Cenp-C2 are male germline-biased and evolved adaptively, indicating subfunctionalization of the Cid and Cenp-C paralogs. Our findings further highlight the strong interdependence between CenH3 and Cenp-C, paving the way to new perspectives by which centromere function and evolution can be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Recent empirical evidence suggest that trade-off shapes can evolve, challenging the classical image of their high entrenchment. Here we model the evolution of the physiological mechanism that controls the allocation of a resource to two traits, by mutating the expression and the conformation of its constitutive hormones and receptors. We show that trade-off shapes do indeed evolve in this model through the combined action of genetic drift and selection, such that their evolutionarily expected curvature and length depend on context. In particular, a trade-offs shape should depend on the cost associated with the resource storage, itself depending on the traded resource and on the ecological context. Despite this convergence at the phenotypic level, we show that a variety of physiological mechanisms may evolve in similar simulations, suggesting redundancy at the genetic level. This model should provide a useful frame-work to interpret and link the overly complex observations of evolutionary endocrinology and evo-lutionary ecology.",

It showed excellent performance in estimating divergence times for both simulated and empirical molecular sequence datasets in which evolutionary rates varied extensively throughout the tree. RelTime is computationally efficient and scales well with increasing size of datasets. Until now, however, RelTime has not had a formal mathematical foundation. Here, we show that the basis of the RelTime approach is a relative rate framework (RRF) that combines comparisons of evolutionary rates in sister lineages with the principle of minimum rate change between an evolutionary lineage and its descendants. We present analytical solutions for estimating relative lineage rates and divergence times under RRF. We also discuss the relationship of RRF with other approaches, including the Bayesian framework. We conclude that RelTime will be also useful for phylogenies with branch lengths derived not only from molecular data, but also morphological and biochemical traits.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine for cancer involves identifying and targeting the somatic genome alterations (SGAs) that drive the development of an individual tumor. Much of current efforts at finding driver SGAs have involved identifying the genes that are mutated more frequently than expected among a collection of tumors. When these population-derived driver genes are altered (perhaps in particular ways) in a given tumor, they are posited as driver genes for that tumor. In this technical report, we introduce an alternative approach for identifying causative SGAs, also known as \\\"drivers\\\", by inferring causal relationships between SGAs and molecular phenotypes at the individual tumor level. Our tumor-specific causal inference (TCI) algorithm uses a Bayesian method to identify the SGAs in a given tumor that have a high probability of regulating transcriptomic changes observed in that specific tumor. Thus, the method is focused on identifying the tumor specific SGAs that are causing expression changes that are specific to the tumor. Those SGAs that have a high probability of regulating transcriptomic changes related to oncogenic processes are then designated to be the putative drivers of the tumor. In this paper, we describe in detail the TCI algorithm and its implementation.",

    "abstract": "It is important to assess the viability of eye-banked corneas prior to transplantation due to inherent senescence and known loss of endothelial cells during surgical manipulation. Corneal endothelial cells have a complex basal and paracellular shape making them challenging to accurately measure, particularly in oedematous ex vivo tissue. This study used calibrated centroidal Voronoi Diagrams to segment cells in images of these human corneas, in order to characterize endothelial geometry, topology, and phase.\\n\\nHexagonal cells dominated the endothelia, with most comprised of five different pleomorphs exhibiting self-similar topological coarsening through most of the endothelial cell density range. There was a linear relationship between cell size and shape, though cells with greater than six sides were present in larger proportions than cells with less. Hexagonal cell regularity was stable and largely independent of density.\\n\\nCell and tissue phase was also examined, using the cell shape index relative to the recently discovered  cell jamming phase transition boundary. Images showed fluid endothelia with a range of shape indices spanning the boundary, independent of density but dependent on hexagonal regularity. The cells showed a bimodal distribution centred at the boundary, with the largest proportion of cells on the fluid side. A shoulder at the boundary suggested phase switching via shape transformation across the energy barrier, with cells either side having distinctly different size and shape characteristics. Regular hexagonal cells were closest to the boundary.\\n\\nThis study showed the corneal endothelium acts as a glassy viscous foam characterized by well-established physical laws. Endothelial cell death transiently and locally increases cell fluidity, which is subsequently arrested by jamming of the pleomorphically diverse cell collective, via rearrangement and shape change of a small proportion of cells, which become locked in place by their neighbours and maintain endothelial function with little energy expenditure.",

We have previously reported one such population, marked by CD66, in cervical cancers. It is unclear what broad mechanisms regulate such migratory populations. Here, we describe the role of a Suv39H1-low heterochromatin state as a driver of cervical cancer migratory populations. Cervical cancer cells sorted based on migratory ability in vitro show low Suv39H1, and Suv39H1 knockdown enhances cell migration. Histopathology shows the emergence of migratory Suv39H1low populations in advanced carcinoma progression. Meta-analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that Suv39H1-low tumours show migration and CD66 expression signatures, and correlate with lower patient survival. Lastly, genome-wide profiling of migrated populations using RNA-Seq and H3K9me3 ChIP-Seq reveals Suv39H1-linked transcriptome alterations and a broad loss of H3K9me3, suggesting an increase in chromatin plasticity in migrated populations. The understanding of such chromatin based regulation in migratory populations may prove valuable in efforts to develop anti-metastatic strategies.",

A well characterized RNA aptamer, i. e., knowing its Kd and adaptive structural features, is an essential ingredient of the described design process. We exemplify the principles using the well-known theophylline aptamer throughout this work. The aptamer in its ligand-binding competent structure represents one structural conformation of the switch while an alternative fold that disrupts the binding-competent structure forms the other conformation. To keep it simple we do not incorporate any regulatory mechanism to control transcription or translation. We elucidate a commonly used design process by explicitly dissecting and explaining the necessary steps in detail. We developed a novel objective function which specifies the mechanistics of this simple, ligand-triggered riboswitch and describe an extensive in silico analysis pipeline to evaluate important kinetic properties of the designed sequences. This protocol and the developed software can be easily extended or adapted to fit novel design scenarios and thus can serve as a template for future needs.",

Information divergence between methylation levels from different groups, measured in terms of Hellinger divergence, provides discrimination power between control and treatment samples.

Ca2+ bursts appear within seconds and are restricted to individual target cells. Cell contraction reliably followed within a minute, to about half of the cross-sectional area. Increased Ca2+ levels and contraction were reversible and the target cells further participated in tissue morphogenesis. Cell contractions are paralleled with non-muscle myosin-II accumulation in the apico-medial cortex, indicating that Ca2+ bursts trigger non-muscle myosin II activation.

While the functions of the structured core domains in this pathway are understood, the role of abundant intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) is lacking. Here we reconstitute the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex containing a portion of the disordered C-terminus and show its activity is autoinhibited by linear interaction motifs. Enhancers of decapping (Edc) 1 and 3 cooperate to activate decapping by different mechanisms: Edc3 alleviates auto-inhibition by binding IDRs and destabilizing an inactive form of the enzyme, whereas Edc1 stabilizes the transition state for catalysis. Both activators are required to fully stimulate an autoinhibited Dcp1:Dcp2 as Edc1 alone cannot overcome the decrease in activity attributed to the C-terminal extension.

    "abstract": "Perturbations of sensory feedback evoke sensory prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory outcomes of movements), and reward prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted rewards and actual rewards). Sensory prediction errors result in obligatory remapping of the relationship between motor commands and predicted sensory outcomes. The role of reward prediction errors in sensorimotor adaptation is less clear. When moving towards a target, we expect to obtain the reward of hitting the target, and so we experience a reward prediction error if the perturbation causes us to miss it. These discrepancies between desired task outcomes and actual task outcomes, or \\\"task errors\\\", are thought to drive the use of strategic processes to restore success, although their role is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of task errors in sensorimotor adaptation: during target-reaching, we either removed task errors by moving the target mid-movement to align with cursor feedback of hand position, or enforced task error by moving the target away from the cursor feedback of hand position. Removing task errors not only reduced the rate and extent of adaptation during exposure to the perturbation, but also reduced the amount of post-adaptation implicit remapping. Hence, task errors contribute to implicit remapping resulting from sensory prediction errors. This suggests that the system which implicitly acquires new sensorimotor maps via exposure to sensory prediction errors is also sensitive to reward prediction errors.",

    "abstract": "MotivationParameter estimation methods for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of biological processes can exploit gradients and Hessians of objective functions to achieve convergence and computational efficiency. However, the computational complexity of established methods to evaluate the Hessian scales linearly with the number of state variables and quadratically with the number of parameters. This limits their application to low-dimensional problems.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce second order adjoint sensitivity analysis for the computation of Hessians and a hybrid optimization-integration based approach for profile likelihood computation. Second order adjoint sensitivity analysis scales linearly with the number of parameters and state variables. The Hessians are effectively exploited by the proposed profile likelihood computation approach. We evaluate our approaches on published biological models with real measurement data. Our study reveals an improved computational efficiency and robustness of optimization compared to established approaches, when using Hessians computed with adjoint sensitivity analysis. The hybrid computation method was more than two-fold faster than the best competitor.

    "abstract": "Human innate immunity employs cellular and humoral mechanisms to facilitate rapid killing of invading bacteria. The direct killing of bacteria by human serum is mainly attributed to the activity of the complement system that forms pores in Gram-negative bacteria. Although Gram-positive bacteria are considered resistant to serum killing, we here uncover that normal human serum effectively kills Enterococcus faecium. Comparison of a well-characterized collection of commensal and clinical E. faecium isolates revealed that human serum specifically kills commensal E. faecium strains isolated from normal gut microbiota, but not clinical isolates. Inhibitor studies show that the human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA), but not complement, is responsible for killing of commensal E. faecium strains in human normal serum. This is remarkable since hGIIA concentrations in  non-inflamed serum were considered too low to be bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies showed that serum hGIIA specifically causes permeabilization of commensal E. faecium membranes. Altogether, we find that a normal serum concentration of hGIIA effectively kills commensal E. faecium and that hGIIA resistance of clinical E. faecium could have contributed to the ability of these strains to become opportunistic pathogens in hospitalized patients.\\n\\nImportanceHuman normal serum contains antimicrobial components that effective kill invading Gram-negative bacteria. Although Gram-positive bacteria are generally considered resistant to serum killing, here we show that normal human effectively kills the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium strains that live as commensals in the gut of humans. In contrast, clinical E. faecium strains that are responsible for opportunistic infections in debilitated patients are resistant against human serum. The key factor in serum responsible for killing is group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) that effectively destabilizes commensal E. faecium membranes. We believe that hGIIA resistance by clinical E. faecium could have contributed to the ability of these strains to cause opportunistic infections in hospitalized patients. Altogether, understanding mechanisms of immune defense and bacterial resistance could aid in further development of novel anti-infective strategies against medically important multidrug resistant Gram-positive pathogens.",

Knowledge of this temperature is central to the study the organism, the thermal stability and temperature dependent activity of its genes, and the bioprospecting of its genome for thermally adapted proteins. While high throughput sequencing methods have dramatically increased the availability of genomic information, the growth temperatures of the source organisms are often unknown. This limits the study and technological application of these species and their genomes. Here, we present a novel method for the prediction of growth temperatures of prokaryotes using only genomic sequences. By applying the reverse ecology principle that an organisms genome includes identifiable adaptations to its native environment, we can predict a species optimal growth temperature with an accuracy of 4.69 {degrees}C root-mean-square error and a correlation coefficient of 0.908. The accuracy can be further improved for specific taxonomic clades or by excluding psychrophiles. This method provides a valuable tool for the rapid calculation of organism growth temperature when only the genome sequence is known.",

In these models, NETosis is triggered by exogenous massive inflammatory stimuli, and thus it remains unknown whether cancer hosts under physiologic inflammation-free conditions experience NETosis and consequent cancer metastasis. Here we show that plasma redox imbalance caused by albumin oxidation promotes inflammation-independent NETosis and cancer metastasis specifically in the lungs. Albumin is the major source of free thiol that maintains redox balance in vitro and in vivo. Oxidation of albumin-derived free thiol is sufficient to trigger NETosis via accumulation of reactive oxygen species within neutrophils. The resultant NETs are found predominantly within lungs where they contribute to the colonization of CTCs leading to pulmonary metastases in mouse models. These effects are abrogated by pharmacologic inhibition of NET formation. Moreover, albumin oxidation and the resultant decline of plasma free thiol are associated with pulmonary metastasis in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. These results implicate plasma redox balance as an endogenous and physiologic regulator of NETosis and pulmonary cancer metastasis, providing new therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities for combatting cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "To achieve genome stability cells must coordinate the action of various DNA transactions including DNA replication, repair, transcription and chromosome segregation. How transcription and RNA processing enable genome stability is only partly understood. Two predominant models have emerged: one involving changes in gene expression that perturb other genome maintenance factors, and another in which genotoxic DNA:RNA hybrids, called R-loops, impair DNA replication. Here we characterize genome instability phenotypes in a panel yeast splicing factor mutants and find that mitotic defects, and in some cases R-loop accumulation, are causes of genome instability. Genome instability in splicing mutants is exacerbated by loss of the spindle-assembly checkpoint protein Mad1. Moreover, removal of the intron from the -tubulin gene TUB1 restores genome integrity. Thus, while R-loops contribute in some settings, defects in yeast splicing predominantly lead to genome instability through effects on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The number of male gametes produced is critical for reproductive success and varies greatly between and within species1-3. Evolutionary reduction of male gamete production has been widely reported in plants as a hallmark of the selfing syndrome, as well as in humans. Such a reduction may simply represent deleterious decay4-7, but evolutionary theory predicts that breeding systems could act as a major selective force on male gamete number: while large numbers of sperm should be produced in highly promiscuous species because of male-male gamete competition1, reduced sperm numbers may be advantageous at lower outcrossing rates because of the cost of gamete production. Here we used genome-wide association study (GWAS) to show a signature of polygenic selection on pollen number in the predominantly selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The top associations with pollen number were significantly more strongly enriched for signatures of selection than those for ovule number and 107 phenotypes analyzed previously, indicating polygenic selection8. Underlying the strongest association, responsible for 20% of total pollen number variation, we identified the gene REDUCED POLLEN NUMBER 1 affecting cell proliferation in the male germ line. We validated its subtle but causal allelic effects using a quantitative complementation test with CRISPR-Cas9-generated null mutants in a nonstandard wild accession. Our results support polygenic adaptation underlying reduced male gamete numbers.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of mitochondrial metabolism and loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity are widely considered as evolutionarily conserved (public) mechanisms of ageing (Lopez-Otin et al. 2013). Human ageing is associated with loss in skeletal muscle mass and function (Sarcopenia), contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality. Muscle ageing is associated with loss of mtDNA integrity. In humans, clonally expanded mtDNA deletions co-localize with sites of fiber-breakage and atrophy in skeletal muscle. mtDNA deletions may therefore play an important, possibly causal role in sarcopenia. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also exhibits age-dependent decline in mitochondrial function and a form of sarcopenia. However, it is unclear if mtDNA deletions play a role in C. elegans ageing. Here we report identification of 266 novel mtDNA deletions in ageing nematodes. Analysis of the mtDNA mutation spectrum and quantification of mutation burden indicates that (1) mtDNA deletions in nematode is extremely rare, (2) there is no significant age-dependent increase in mtDNA deletions and (3) there is little evidence for clonal expansion driving mtDNA deletion dynamics. Thus, mtDNA deletions are unlikely to drive the age-dependent functional decline commonly observed in C. elegans. Computational modelling of mtDNA dynamics in C. elegans indicates that the lifespan of short-lived animals such as C. elegans is likely too short to allow for significant clonal expansion of mtDNA deletions. Together, these findings suggest that clonal expansion of mtDNA deletions is likely a private mechanism of ageing predominantly relevant in long-lived animals such as humans and rhesus monkey and possibly in rodents.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasensitive and selective detection and quantification of dopamine (DA) plays a key role in monitoring neurodegenerative diseases. However, the detection limit reported for DA detection is typically in the lower nM range. Pushing the detection limit to pM or lower for this particular target to cover the physiological levels (< 130 pM) is significant. Herein, DA DNA aptamer (DAAPT) gold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugate is utilized to enhance the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signal, which enables to detect and quantify DA in the femtomolar (200 fM) to picomolar range. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest detection limit achieved for SPR sensing of dopamine. The as-prepared 10 nm DAAPT-AuNP conjugate demonstrates strong binding affinity (Kd = 3.1 {+/-} 1.4 nM) to the complementary DNA (cDNA) probe on gold chip. The cDNA probe is immobilized to the chip via polydopamine surface chemistry, which allows the Michael addition of any primary amine-terminated biomolecules. By adjusting the concentration of the DAAPT-AuNP conjugate, two calibration curves are generated with dynamic ranges from 100 {micro}M to 2 mM, and from 200 fM to 20 nM, respectively. Both calibration curves have negative slopes, showing good agreement to a dose-response curve in an enzyme inhibition assay.

MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that can silence multiple genes, regulating several signalling pathways simultaneously. Therefore, synthetic microRNAs may have therapeutic potential in CRPC by regulating genes involved in taxane response and minimise compensatory mechanisms that cause taxane resistance. To identify microRNAs that can improve the efficacy of taxanes in CRPC, we performed a genome-wide screen of 1280 microRNAs in the CRPC cell lines PC3 and DU145 in combination with docetaxel or cabazitaxel treatment. Mimics of miR-217 and miR-181b-5p enhanced apoptosis significantly in PC3 cells in the presence of these taxanes. These mimics downregulated at least a thousand different transcripts, which were enriched for genes with cell proliferation and focal adhesion functions. Individual knockdown of a selection of 46 genes representing these transcripts resulted in toxic or taxane sensitisation effects, indicating that these genes may be mediating the effects of the microRNA mimics. A range of these genes are expressed in CRPC metastases, suggesting that these microRNA mimics may be functional in CRPC. With further development, these microRNA mimics may have therapeutic potential to improve taxane response in CRPC patients.",

These methods enable unprecedented studies of life at the microscale, but bring with them larger and more complex datasets. New image processing techniques are therefore called for to analyze the resulting images in an accurate and efficient manner. Convolutional neural networks are becoming the standard for classification of objects within images due to their accuracy and generalizability compared to traditional techniques. Their application to data derived from 3D imaging, however, is relatively new and has mostly been in areas of magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography.

    "abstract": "Humans and other animals constantly evaluate their decisions in order to learn and behave adaptively. Experimentally, such evaluation processes are accessed using metacognitive reports made after decisions, typically using verbally formulated confidence scales. When subjects report high confidence, it reflects a high certainty of being correct, but a low confidence might signify either low certainty about the outcome, or a high certainty of being incorrect. Hence, metacognitive reports might reflect not only different levels of decision certainty, but also two certainty directions (certainty of being correct and certainty of being incorrect). It is important to test if such bi-directional processing can be measured because, for decision-making under uncertainty, information about being incorrect is as important as information about being correct for guidance of subsequent behavior. We were able to capture implicit bi-directional certainty readouts by asking subjects to bet money on their perceptual decision accuracy using a six-grade wager scale (post-decision wagering, PDW). To isolate trial-specific aspects of metacognitive judgments, we used pre-decision wagering (wagering before the perceptual decision) to subtract, from PDW trials, influences resulting from non-trial-specific assessment of expected difficulty and psychological biases. This novel design allowed independent quantification of certainty of being correct and certainty of being incorrect, showing that subjects were able to read out certainty in a bi-directional manner. Certainty readouts about being incorrect were particularly associated with metacognitive sensitivity exceeding perceptual sensitivity (i.e. meta-d' > d'), suggesting that such enhanced metacognitive efficiency is driven by information about incorrect decisions. Readouts of certainty in both directions increased on easier trials, and both certainty directions were also associated with faster metacognitive reaction times, indicating that certainty of being incorrect was not confounded with low certainty. Finally, both readouts influenced the amount of money subjects earned through PDW, suggesting that bi-directional readouts are important for planning future actions when feedback about previous decisions is unavailable.",

    "abstract": "The recent beyond-exponential growth in diverse collections of deep sequencing datasets creates enormous opportunities for discovery, concomitant with new challenges for displaying and interpreting these data. Notably, the availability of scores of whole genome sequences in multiple species clades enables comparative studies of functional elements. However, current genome browsers do not permit effective visualization of multigenome experimental data. Here, we present CrossBrowse, a standalone desktop application for displaying and browsing cross-species genomic datasets. We utilize data standards and graphic representation of popular browsers, and incorporate an intuitive graphical visualization of genome synteny that facilitates and drives human interrogation of comparative data. Our platform permits users with minimal informatics capacity to select arbitrary sets of genomes for display, upload and configure multiple datasets, and interact with vertebrate-sized genomic datasets in real-time. We illustrate the utility of CrossBrowse with interrogation of comparative invertebrate and mammalian datasets that provide insights into diverse aspects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Of note, we show examplars of both preservation and divergence of functional elements that cannot be inferred from sequence alignments alone. Moreover, we demonstrate how inspection of primary data using CrossBrowse exposes an artifact in a typical strategy for assigning species-specific functional elements, and drives the implementation of an improved computational strategy. We anticipate that CrossBrowse will greatly foster user-based discovery within multispecies genomic datasets, and inform their bioinformatic interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Bevacizumab treatment of glioblastoma is limited by transient responses and acquired resistance. Because of the lengthy duration of treatment that can precede resistance in patients, in order to study changes underlying the evolution of bevacizumab resistance, we created a novel multigenerational xenograft model of acquired bevacizumab resistance. Glioblastoma xenografts were treated with bevacizumab or IgG, and the fastest growing tumor re-implanted into new mice, generating paired isogeneic responsive or resistant multigenerational xenografts. Microarray analysis revealed significant overexpression across generations of the mesenchymal subtype gene signature, paralleling results from patient bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas (BRGs) that exhibited increasing mesenchymal gene expression correlating with increased bevacizumab treatment duration. Key mesenchymal markers, including YKL-40, CD44, SERPINE1, and TIMP1 were upregulated across generations, with altered morphology, increased invasiveness, and increased neurosphere formation confirmed in later xenograft generations. Interestingly, YKL-40 levels were elevated in serum of patients with bevacizumab-resistant vs. bevacizumab-naive glioblastomas. Finally, despite upregulation of VEGF-independent pro-angiogenic genes across xenograft generations, immunostaining revealed increased hypoxia and decreased vessel density with increasing generation of treatment, mirroring our findings in patient BRGs and suggesting tumor growth despite effective devascularization caused by VEGF blockade. Besides identifying novel targets for preventing the evolution of resistance and offering a xenograft model for testing resistance inhibitors, our work suggests YKL-40 as a blood biomarker of bevacizumab resistance worthy of further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "A-to-I RNA editing is widespread in eukaryotic transcriptomes and plays an essential role in the creation of proteomic and phenotypic diversity. Loss of ADARs, the proteins responsible for A-to-I editing, results in lethality in mammals. In C. elegans, knocking out both ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, results in aberrant behavior and abnormal development. Studies have shown that ADR-2 can actively deaminate dsRNA while ADR-1 cannot. However, as most studies of C. elegans ADARs were performed on worms mutated in both ADAR genes, the effects observed cannot be attributed to a single ADAR or to the interactions between ADAR genes. Therefore, we set to study the effects of each C. elegans ADAR on RNA editing, gene expression, protein levels and the contribution of each of ADAR to the phenotypes observed in worms mutated in both genes, in order to elucidate their distinct functions. We found significant differences in the phenotypes observed in worms mutated in a single ADAR gene. Worms harboring adr-1 mutations have a significant reduction in their lifespan, while worms harboring adr-2 mutations have extended lifespan. We also observed severe abnormalities in vulva formation in adr-1 mutants, and we suggest that these phenotypes are a result of an RNA editing independent function of ADR-1. Mutations in each ADAR resulted in expressional changes in hundreds of genes, and a significant downregulation of edited genes. However, very few changes in the protein levels were observed. In addition, we found that ADR-1 binds many edited genes and primarily promotes editing at the L4 stage of development. While editing still occurs in the absence of ADR-1, most of the editing occurs in genes that are edited in wildtype worms, suggesting that ADR-1 does not prevent editing by binding to and protecting the RNA but rather enhances or promotes editing. Our results suggest that ADR-1 plays a significant role in the RNA editing process and by altering editing levels it causes the severe phenotypes that we observed. In contrast, a complete lack of RNA editing is less harmful to the worms. Furthermore, our results indicate that the effect of RNA editing on the protein content in the cell is minor and probably the main purpose of these modifications is to antagonize or enhance other gene regulatory mechanisms that act on RNA.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of RNA recombination to viral fitness and pathogenesis is poorly defined. Here, we isolate a recombination-deficient, poliovirus variant and find that, while recombination is detrimental to virus replication in tissue culture, recombination is important for pathogenesis in infected animals. Notably, recombination-defective virus exhibits severe attenuation following intravenous inoculation that is associated with a significant reduction in population size during intra-host spread. Because the impact of high mutational loads manifests most strongly at small population sizes, our data suggest that the repair of mutagenized genomes is an essential function of recombination and that this function may drive the long-term maintenance of recombination in viral species despite its associated fitness costs.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRNA recombination is a widespread but poorly understood feature of RNA virus replication. For poliovirus, recombination is involved in the emergence of neurovirulent circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, which has hampered global poliovirus eradication efforts. This emergence illustrates the power of recombination to drive major adaptive change; however, it remains unclear if these adaptive events represent the primary role of recombination in virus survival. Here, we identify a viral mutant with a reduced rate of recombination and find that recombination also plays a central role in the spread of virus within animal hosts.

    "abstract": "Depression is a debilitating condition with a high prevalence, but aetiology and pathophysiology are still unclear. Various reward-learning paradigms have been used to show impairments in depression. Both trait pessimism and neuroticism are associated with depression, but their link with the impairments in reward learning and decision-making have not been investigated. A Pavlovian conditioning task was performed by 32 subjects, 15 with depression. Participants had to estimate the probability of some fractal stimuli to be associated with a binary reward, based on a few observations. They then had to make a choice between one of the observed fractals and another target for which the reward probability was explicitly given. Computational modelling was used to succinctly describe participants behaviour. Patients performed worse than controls at the task. Computational modelling revealed that this was caused by behavioural impairments during both learning and decision phases. Neuroticism scores across participants were significantly correlated with participants inability to follow their internal value estimations. Our results demonstrate behavioural differences in probabilistic reward learning between depressed patients and healthy controls. Neuroticism was associated with the impaired ability to follow internal reward values and consequently with worse decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) influence learned behaviors and neuropsychiatric diseases including addiction. The stress peptide corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) contributes to relapse to drug and alcohol seeking following withdrawal, although the cellular actions are poorly understood. In this study, we show that presynaptic CRF type 1 receptors (CRF-R1) potentiate GABA release onto mouse VTA dopamine neurons via a PKC-Ca2+ signaling mechanism. In na1ve animals, activation of CRF-R1 by bath application of CRF or ethanol enhanced GABAA inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Following three days of withdrawal from four weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure, spontaneous IPSC frequency was enhanced while CRF- and ethanol-potentiation of IPSCs was intact. However, withdrawal for 3 weeks or more was associated with reduced spontaneous IPSC frequency and diminished CRF and ethanol responses. Long-term withdrawal was also accompanied by decreased sensitivity to the CB1 receptor agonist WIN55212 as well as greatly enhanced sensitivity to the CB1 antagonist AM-251. Inclusion of BAPTA in the internal recording solution restored the responsiveness to CRF or ethanol and reduced the potentiating actions of AM251. Together, these data suggest that GABAA inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons is regulated by presynaptic actions of CRF and endocannabinoids and that long-term withdrawal from CIE treatment enhances endocannabinoid mediated inhibition, thereby suppressing CRF facilitation of GABA release. Such findings have implications for understanding the impact of chronic alcohol on stress-related, dopamine-mediated alcohol seeking behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine addicts display increased sensitivity to drug-associated cues, due in part to pathological changes in the prelimbic cortex (PL-PFC). The cellular mechanisms underlying cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking remain unknown. Reinforcement learning for addictive drugs may produce persistent maladaptations in intrinsic excitability within sparse subsets of PFC pyramidal neurons. Using a male rat model of relapse to cocaine-seeking, we sampled over 600 neurons to examine spike frequency adaptation (SFA) and after-hyperpolarizations (AHPs), two systems that attenuate low frequency inputs to regulate neuronal synchronization. We observed that training to self-administer cocaine or nondrug (sucrose) reinforcers decreased SFA and AHPs in a sub-population of PL-PFC neurons, but only with cocaine did the resulting hyper-excitability persist through extinction training and increase during reinstatement. In neurons with intact SFA, dopamine enhanced excitability by inhibiting Kv7 potassium channels that mediate SFA. However, dopamine effects were occluded in neurons from cocaine-experienced rats, where SFA and AHPs were reduced. Pharmacological stabilization of Kv7 channels with retigabine restored SFA and Kv7 channel function in neuroadapted cells. When microinjected bilaterally into the PL-PFC 10 minutes prior to reinstatement testing, retigabine reduced cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Lastly, using cFos-GFP transgenic rats, we found that the loss of SFA correlated with the expression of cFos-GFP following both extinction and re-exposure to drug-associated cues. Taken together, these data suggest that cocaine self-administration desensitizes inhibitory Kv7 channels in a subpopulation of PL-PFC neurons. This sub-population of neurons may represent a persistent neural ensemble responsible for driving drug seeking in response to cues.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLong after the cessation of drug use, cues associated with cocaine still elicit drug-seeking behavior, in part by activation of the prelimbic cortex (PL-PFC). The underlying cellular mechanisms governing these activated neurons remain unclear. Using a rat model of relapse to cocaine seeking, we identified a population of PL-PFC neurons that become hyperexcitable following chronic cocaine self-administration. These neurons show persistent loss of spike frequency adaptation, reduced after-hyperpolarizations, decreased sensitivity to dopamine, and reduced Kv7 channel mediated inhibition. Stabilization of Kv7 channel function with retigabine normalized neuronal excitability, restored Kv7 channel currents, and reduced drug-seeking behavior when administered into the PL-PFC prior to reinstatement. These data highlight a persistent adaptation in a subset of PL-PFC neurons that may contribute to relapse vulnerability.",

However, not many studies have focused on differences in the network organization of SC and FC, and on how these differences may inform us about their mutual interaction. To explore this issue, we adopt a multi-layer framework, with SC and FC, constructed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the Human Connectome Project, forming a two-layer multiplex network. In particular, we examine whether node strength assortativity within and between the SC and FC layer may confer increased robustness against structural failure. We find that, in general, SC is organized assortatively, indicating brain regions are on average connected to other brain regions with similar node strengths. On the other hand, FC shows disassortative mixing. This discrepancy is apparent also among individual resting-state networks within SC and FC. In addition, these patterns show lateralization, with disassortative mixing within FC subnetworks mainly driven from the left hemisphere. We discuss our findings in the context of robustness to structural failure, and we suggest that discordant and lateralized patterns of associativity in SC and FC may explain laterality of some neurological dysfunctions and recovery.",

This nano-SAR profile allows visualizing the contributions of 7 basal properties of Fe2O3 to their diverse bio-effects. For instance, while surface reactivity is responsible for Fe2O3-induced cell migration, the inflammatory effects of Fe2O3 nanorods and nanoplates are determined by their aspect ratio and surface reactivity, respectively. We further discovered the detailed mechanisms, including NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 involved signaling. Both effects were further validated in animal lungs. Our findings provide substantial new insights at nano-bio interfaces, which may facilitate the tailored design of ENMs to endow them with desired bio-effects.",

    "abstract": "The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 is appreciated as a promising target for cancer therapy. However, conditional deletion of HIF-1 and HIF-1 target genes in cells of the tumor microenvironment can result in accelerated tumor growth, calling for a detailed characterization of the cellular context to fully comprehend HIF-1s role in tumorigenesis. We dissected cell type-specific functions of HIF-1 for intestinal tumorigenesis by lineage-restricted deletion of the Hif1a locus. Intestinal epithelial cell-specific Hif1a loss reduced activation of wnt/{beta}-catenin, tumor-specific metabolism and inflammation, significantly inhibiting tumor growth. Deletion of Hif1a in myeloid cells reduced the expression of fibroblast-activating factors in tumor-associated macrophages resulting in decreased abundance of tumor-associated fibroblasts and robustly reduced tumor formation. Interestingly, hypoxia was detectable only sparsely and without spatial association with nuclear HIF-1 in intestinal adenomas, pointing towards a functional importance of hypoxia-independent, i.e. non-canonical HIF-1 stabilization that has not been previously appreciated. This adds a further layer of complexity to the regulation of HIF-1 and suggests that hypoxia and HIF-1 stabilization can be uncoupled in cancer. Collectively, our data show that HIF-1 is a pivotal pro-tumorigenic factor for intestinal tumor formation, controlling key oncogenic programs in both the epithelial tumor compartment and the tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Motile cilia serve vital functions in development, homeostasis and regeneration. We recently demonstrated that TAp73 is an essential transcriptional regulator of respiratory motile multiciliogenesis. Here, we show that TAp73 is expressed in multiciliated cells (MCCs) of diverse tissues. Analysis of TAp73-/- animals revealed that TAp73 regulates Foxj1, Rfx2, Rfx3, axonemal dyneins Dnali1 and Dnai1, plays a pivotal role in the generation of MCCs in reproductive ducts, and contributes to fertility. However, in the brain the function of MCCs appears to be preserved upon loss of TAp73, and robust activity from cilia-related networks is maintained in TAp73-/-. Consistent with TAp73-/-, its target miR34bc was reduced, whereas strong and specific induction of miR449 was observed along with an increase in E2f4, that induced transcriptional response from miR449 genomic regions. Depletion of both TAp73 and miR449 resulted in defective multiciliogenesis in the brain and hydrocephalus, indicating that miR449 and potentially additional pro-ciliogenic factors cooperate with TAp73 to ensure brain multiciliogenesis and CP development.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral exposures can influence phenotypic expression in subsequent generations, which influence diverse biological processes ranging from phenotypic plasticity to obesity. Currently, most transgenerational studies work under the assumption of transgenerational response stability and reproducibility through time and across exposure differences, relying on short-term (i.e. 2-3 generations) single-exposure experiments. Yet, little evidence exists in the literature to validate this assumption, leaving the consistency and reliability of interpretations in question. Additionally, as most studies have focused on proximal mechanistic ( how) rather than ultimate evolutionary ( why) questions, the interpretations of observed responses and broader evolutionary implications remain unclear. In the current study, we begin to address these gaps by analyzing the transgenerational effects of three dietary sugar concentrations (i.e. no, low, and high) relative to controls on body composition (i.e. whole body fat and sugar concentrations) and reproduction (i.e. lifetime fitness) over five generations in both males and females. We found that the changes in ancestral diet led to complex transgenerational body composition and fitness fluctuations relative to control offspring responses, despite the conformity of the treatments to a control diet in the F1-F5 generations. Interestingly, the direction of response frequently changed from generation to generation, and as a function of ancestral exposures and sex. These fluctuating response findings have not been documented previously, and were broadly consistent in both our pilot and main experiments. Our results highlight the dynamic and multifaceted nature of transgenerational plasticity, and provide some of the first evidence that transgenerational response stability may not be universally valid.\\n\\nSummary StatementAlterations in ancestral dietary sugar transgenerationally influences body composition and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster, leading to fluctuating responses relative to controls over five generations following exposure.",

    "abstract": "Upon activation, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylates tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tail, which triggers the binding of Src Homology 2 (SH2) and Phosphotyrosine Binding (PTB) domains and initiates downstream signaling. The sequences flanking the tyrosine residues (referred to as phosphosites) must be compatible with phosphorylation by the EGFR kinase domain and the recruitment of adapter proteins, while minimizing phosphorylation that would reduce the fidelity of signal transmission. In order to understand how phosphosite sequences encode these functions within a small set of residues, we carried out high-throughput mutational analysis of three phosphosite sequences in the EGFR tail. We used bacterial surface-display of peptides, coupled with deep sequencing, to monitor phosphorylation efficiency and the binding of the SH2 and PTB domains of the adapter proteins Grb2 and Shc1, respectively. We found that the sequences of phosphosites in the EGFR tail are restricted to a subset of the range of sequences that can be phosphorylated efficiently by EGFR. Although efficient phosphorylation by EGFR can occur with either acidic or large hydrophobic residues at the -1 position with respect to the tyrosine, hydrophobic residues are generally excluded from this position in tail sequences. The mutational data suggest that this restriction results in weaker binding to adapter proteins, but also disfavors phosphorylation by the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases c-Src and c-Abl. Our results show how EGFR-family phosphosites achieve a trade-off between minimizing off-pathway phosphorylation while maintaining the ability to recruit the diverse complement of effectors required for downstream pathway activation.",

    "abstract": "We herein propose an atlas of 32 sentence-related areas based on a 3-step method combining the analysis of activation and asymmetry during multiple language tasks with hierarchical clustering of resting-state connectivity and graph analyses. 144 healthy right-handers performed fMRI runs based on language production, reading and listening, both with sentences and lists of over-learned words. Sentence minus word-list BOLD contrast and left-minus-right BOLD asymmetry for each task were computed in pairs of homotopic regions of interest (hROIs) from the AICHA atlas. Thirty-two hROIs were identified that were conjointly activated and leftward asymmetrical in each of the 3 language contrasts. Analysis of resting- state temporal correlations of BOLD variations between these 32 hROIs allowed the segregation of a core network, SENT_CORE including 18 hROIs. Resting-state graph analysis applied to SENT_CORE hROIs revealed that the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus were hubs based on their degree centrality, betweenness, and participation values, corresponding to epicentres of sentence processing. Positive correlations between DC and BOLD activation values for SENT_CORE hROIs were observed across individuals and across regions regardless of the task: the more a SENT_CORE area is connected at rest the stronger it is activated during sentence processing. DC measurements in SENT_CORE may thus be a valuable index for the evaluation of inter-individual variations in language areas functional activity in relation to anatomical or clinical patterns in large populations.

This study investigated patterns of recurrence after pancreatic surgery.\\n\\nMethodsRecurrence patterns were described in a series of resected pancreas cancers over a 2-year period and recurrence risk expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (C.I.). Survival was displayed by Kaplan-Meier curves.\\n\\nResultsOf 107 pancreas resections, 69 (65%) had pancreatic cancer. R0 resection was achieved in 21 of 69 (30.4%). Analysis was based on 66 patients who survived 30 days after surgery with median follow up 21 months. Recurrence developed in 41 (62.1%) patients with median time to first recurrence of 13.3 months (interquartile range 6.9, 20.8 months). Recurrence site was most frequently locoregional (n=28, 42%), followed by liver (n=23, 35%), lymph nodes (n=21, 32%), and lungs (n=13, 19%). In patients with recurrence, 9 of 41 had single site recurrence; the remaining 32 patients had more than one site of recurrence. Locoregional recurrence was associated with R+ resection (53% vs 25% for R+ vs R0, respectively; OR 3.5, 95% C.I. 1.1-11.2; P=0.034). Venous invasion was associated with overall recurrence risk (OR 3.3, 95% C.I. 1.1-9.4; P=0.025). In multivariable analysis, R-stage and adjuvant chemotherapy predicted longer survival.\\n\\nDiscussionThe predominant locoregional recurrence pattern, multiple sites of recurrence and a high R+ resection rate reflect the difficulty in achieving initial local disease control.",

Cyst nematodes are sexually dimorphic, with their differentiation into male or female strongly influenced by host environmental conditions. Under favorable conditions with plenty of nutrients, more females develop, whereas mainly male nematodes develop under adverse conditions such as in resistant plants. Here, we developed and validated a method to predict the sex of beet cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii) during the early stages of its parasitism in the host plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We collected root segments containing male-associated syncytia (MAS) or female-associated syncytia (FAS), isolated syncytial cells by laser microdissection, and performed a comparative transcriptome analysis. Genes belonging to categories of defense, nutrient deficiency, and nutrient starvation were overrepresented in MAS as compared to FAS. Conversely, gene categories related to metabolism, modification, and biosynthesis of cell walls were overrepresented in FAS. We used {beta}-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis, qRT-PCR, and loss-of-function mutants to characterize FAS- and MAS-specific candidate genes. Our results demonstrated that various plant-based factors, including immune response, nutrient availability, and structural modifications, influence the sexual fate sex determination of cyst the nematodes.",

Network motifs may also become pivotal in the rational design and engineering of complex biological systems underpinning the field of synthetic biology. Distinguishing true motifs from arbitrary substructures, however, remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that implicit assumptions present in mainstream methods for motif identification do not necessarily hold, with the ramification that motif studies using these mainstream methods are less able to effectively differentiate between spurious results and events of true statistical significance than is often presented. We show that these difficulties cannot be overcome without revising the methods of statistical analysis used to identify motifs. The implications of these findings are therefore far-reaching across diverse areas of biology.",

    "abstract": "Parasites can alter host and vector phenotype and thereby affect ecological processes in natural populations. Laboratory studies have shown that Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of human Lyme borreliosis, induces physiological alterations in its main tick vector in Europe, Ixodes ricinus, which increase its survival under challenging conditions. We hypothesise that these phenotypic alterations may allow I. ricinus to colonise marginal habitats, thereby fuelling the ongoing range expansion of I. ricinus towards higher elevations and latitudes induced by climate change. To explore the potential for such an effect under natural conditions, we studied the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in questing I. ricinus and its variation with elevation in the Swiss Alps. We screened for B. burgdorferi s.l. infection in questing nymphs of I. ricinus (N = 411) from 15 sites between 528 and 1774 m.a.s.l to test if B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence is higher at high elevations (i.e. in marginal habitats). We found that B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence in I. ricinus nymphs decreased linearly with increasing elevation and that it was 12.6% lower in I. ricinus nymphs collected at high elevations compared to nymphs in the core range. Thus, we found no evidence that the B. burgdorferi s.l.-induced alterations of I. ricinus phenotype facilitate the colonisation of marginal habitats in the wild. These findings have implications for a better understanding of eco-evolutionary processes in natural host-parasite systems, as well as the assessment of Lyme borreliosis risk in regions where I. ricinus is newly emerging.",

    "abstract": "The function of the human hippocampus is normally investigated by experimental manipulation of discrete events. Less is unknown about what triggers hippocampal activity during more naturalistic, continuous experience. We hypothesized that the hippocampus would be sensitive to the occurrence of event boundaries, i.e. moments in time identified by observers as a transition between events. To address this, we analysed functional MRI data from two groups: one (N=253, 131 female) who viewed an 8.5min film and another (N=15, 6 female) who viewed a 120min film. We observed a strong hippocampal response at boundaries defined by independent observers, which was modulated by boundary strength (the number of observers that identified each boundary). In the longer film, there were sufficient boundaries to show that this modulation remained after covarying out a large number of perceptual factors. The hippocampus was the only brain region whose response showed a significant monotonic increase with boundary strength in both films, suggesting that modulation by boundary strength is selective to the hippocampus. This hypothesis-driven approach was complemented by a data-driven approach, in which we identified hippocampal-events as moments in time with the strongest hippocampal activity: The correspondence between these hippocampalevents and event boundaries was highly-significant, revealing that the hippocampal response is not only sensitive, but also specific to event boundaries. We conclude that the hippocampus plays an important role in segmenting the continuous experience that is typical of naturalistic settings.\\n\\nSignificance statementRecent years have seen the field of human neuroscience research transitioning from experiments with simple stimuli to the study of more complex and naturalistic experience. Nonetheless, our understanding of the function of many brain regions, such as the hippocampus, is based primarily on the study of brief, discrete events. As a result, we know little of what triggers hippocampal activity in real-life settings, when we are exposed to a continuous stream of information. When does the hippocampus \\\"decide\\\" to respond during the encoding of naturalistic experience? We reveal here that hippocampal activity measured by fMRI during film-watching is both sensitive and specific to event boundaries, identifying a potential mechanism whereby event boundaries shape experience by modulation of hippocampal activity.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), knowledge of its neurophysiological mode of action is still incomplete. Recently, TMS has been proposed to synchronise neural oscillators, and to thereby increase the detectability of corresponding oscillations at the population level. As oscillations in the human brain are known to interact within nested hierarchies via phase-amplitude coupling, TMS might also be able to increase the macroscopic detectability of such coupling. In a concurrent TMS-electroencephalography study, we therefore examined the techniques influence on theta-gamma, alpha-gamma and beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling by delivering single-pulse TMS (sTMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the left motor cortex and right visual cortex of healthy participants. The rTMS pulse trains were of 5 Hz, 11 Hz and 23 Hz for the three coupling variations, respectively. Relative to sham stimulation, all conditions showed transient but significant increases in phase-amplitude coupling at the stimulation site. In addition, we observed enhanced coupling over various other cortical sites, with a more extensive propagation during rTMS than during sTMS. By indicating that scalp-recorded phase-amplitude coupling can be effectively probed with TMS, these findings open the door to the techniques application in manipulative dissections of such coupling during human cognition and behaviour in healthy and pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to provide a unified description of a comprehensive mathematical model of surface electromyographic (EMG) measurements and the corresponding force signal in skeletal muscles. The model comprises motor unit pool organization, recruitment and rate coding, intracellular action potential generation and the resulting EMG measurements, as well as the generated muscular force during voluntary isometric contractions. It consolidates and extends the results of several previous publications that proposed mathematical models for the individual model components. A parameterization of the electrical and mechanical components of the model is proposed that ensures a physiologically meaningful EMG-force relation in the simulated signals. Moreover, a novel nonlinear transformation of the excitation model input is proposed, which ensures that the model force output equals the desired target force. Finally, an alternative analytical formulation of the EMG model is proposed, which renders the physiological meaning of the model more clear and facilitates a mathematical proof that muscle fibers in this model at no point in time represent a net current source or sink.\\n\\nNeuromuscular physiology is a vibrant research field that has recently seen exciting advances. Many previous publications have focused on thorough analyses of particular aspects of neuromuscular physiology, yet an integration of the various novel findings into a single, comprehensive model is missing. A consistent description of a complete physiological model as presented here, including thorough justification of model component choices, will facilitate the use of these advanced models in future research. Results of a numerical simulation highlight the models capability to reproduce many physiological effects observed in experimental measurements, and to produce realistic synthetic data that are useful for the validation of signal processing algorithms. The model is based on recent advances in the understanding of muscular physiology and hence also applicable for analyzing the influence of various physiological and measurement setup parameters on the measured force and EMG signals.",

    "abstract": "iGluR gene family of a vertebrate, Rat and AtGLR gene family of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana [4] perform some common functionalities in neuro-transmission, which have been compared quantitatively. Our attempt is based on the chemical properties of amino acids [6, 7, 8] comprising the primary protein sequences of the aforesaid genes. 19 AtGLR genes of length varying from 808 amino acid (aa) to 1039 aa and 16 iGluR genes length varying from 902aa to 1482 aa have been taken as data sets. Thus, we detected the commonalities (conserved elements) during the long evolution of plants and animals from a common ancestor [4]. Eight different conserved regions have been found based on individual amino acids. Two different conserved regions are also found, which are based on chemical groups of amino acids. We have tried too to find different possible patterns which are common throughout the data set taken. 9 such patterns have been found with size varying from 2 to 5 amino acids at different regions in each primary protein sequences. Phylogenetic trees of AtGLR and iGluR families have also been constructed. This approach is likely to shed light on the long course of evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundObservational studies have begun to characterize the wide spectrum of phenotypes associated with Parkinsons disease (PD), but recruiting large numbers of PD cases and assaying a diversity of phenotypes has often been difficult. Here, we set out to systematically describe the PD phenome using a cross-sectional case-control design in a large database.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed the association between PD and 840 phenotypes derived from online surveys. For each phenotype, we ran a logistic regression using an average of 5,141 PD cases and 65,459 age- and sex-matched controls. We selected uncorrelated phenotypes, determined statistical significance after correcting for multiple testing, and systematically assessed the novelty of each significant association. We tested whether significant phenotypes were also associated with disease duration in PD cases.\\n\\nFindingsPD diagnosis was associated with 149 independent phenotypes. We replicated 32 known associations and discovered 49 associations that have not previously been reported. We found that migraine, obsessive-compulsive disorder, seasonal allergies, and anemia were associated with PD, but were not significantly associated with PD duration, and tend to occur decades before the average age of diagnosis for PD. Further work is needed to determine whether these phenotypes are PD risk factors or whether they share common disease mechanisms.\\n\\nInterpretationWe used a systematic approach in a single large dataset to assess the spectrum of traits that were associated with PD. Some of these traits may be risk factors for PD, features of the pre-diagnostic phase of disease, or manifestations of PD pathology. The model outputs from all 840 logistic regressions are available to the research community and may be used to generate hypotheses regarding PD etiology.\\n\\nFundingThe Michael J. Fox Foundation, Parkinsons UK, Barts Charity, National Institute on Aging, and 23andMe, Inc.\\n\\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe used PubMed to perform a MEDLINE database search for review articles published up to January 21st, 2018 that contained the keywords \\\"Parkinson\\\" and \\\"epidemiology\\\" in the title or abstract. We performed additional MEDLINE searches for each phenotype that was significantly associated with PD. Although dozens of phenotypes have been tested for an association with PD, only a few associations have been consistently repeatable (e.g. pesticide exposure, coffee consumption).\\n\\nAdded value of this studyWe systematically tested for an association between PD and 840 phenotypes using up to 13,546 cases and 1{middle dot}3 million controls, making this one of the largest PD epidemiology studies ever conducted. We discovered 49 novel associations that will need to be replicated or validated. We found 44 associations for phenotypes that have previously been studied in relation to PD, but for which an association has not been consistently demonstrated.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceTaken together with results from previous studies, this series of case-control analyses adds evidence for associations between PD and many phenotypes that are not currently thought to be part of the canonical PD phenome. This work paves the way for future studies to assess whether any of these phenotypes represent PD risk factors and whether any of these risk factors are modifiable.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume root nodules requires a steady supply of molybdenum for synthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase. This nutrient has to be provided by the host plant from the soil, crossing several symplastically disconnected compartments through molybdate transporters, including members of the MOT1 family. MtMOT1.2 is a Medicago truncatula MOT1 family member located in the endodermal cells in roots and nodules. Immunolocalization of a tagged MtMOT1.2 indicates that it is associated to the plasma membrane and to intracellular membrane systems, where it would be transporting molybdate towards the cytosol, as indicated in yeast transport assays. A loss-of-function mot1.2-1 mutant showed reduced growth compared to wild-type plants when nitrogen fixation was required, but not when nitrogen was provided as nitrate. While no effect on molybdenum-dependent nitrate reductase activity was observed, nitrogenase activity was severely affected, explaining the observed difference of growth depending on nitrogen source. This phenotype was the result of molybdate not reaching the nitrogen-fixing nodules, since genetic complementation with a wild-type MtMOT1.2 gene or molybdate-fortification of the nutrient solution, both restored wild-type levels of growth and nitrogenase activity. These results support a model in which MtMOT1.2 would mediate molybdate delivery by the vasculature into the nodules.",

In single-molecule assays, full-length BicD robustly activated dynein-dynactin only when both the mRNA binding protein Egalitarian (Egl), and K10 mRNA cargo were present. Electron microscopy showed that both Egl and mRNA were needed to disrupt an auto-inhibited, looped BicD conformation that sterically prevents dynein-dynactin binding. In vitro reconstituted messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes with two Egl molecules showed faster speeds and longer run lengths than mRNPs with one Egl, suggesting that cargo binding enhances dynein recruitment. Labeled dynein showed that BicD can recruit two dimeric dyneins to the mRNP, resulting in faster speeds and longer run lengths than with one dynein. The fully reconstituted mRNP provides a model for understanding how adaptor proteins and cargo cooperate to confer optimal transport properties to a dynein-driven transport complex.",

    "abstract": "IFN{beta} typically induces an antiviral and immunoregulatory transcriptional program through the activation of ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9) transcriptional complexes. The response to IFN{beta} is context-dependent and is prone to crosstalk with other cytokines, such as TNF IFN{beta} and TNF synergize to drive a specific delayed transcriptional program. Previous observation led to the hypothesis that an alternative STAT1-independent pathway involving STAT2 and IRF9 might be involved in gene induction by the combination of IFN{beta} and TNF. Using genome wide transcriptional profiling by RNASeq, we found that the costimulation with IFN{beta} and TNF induces a broad antiviral and immunoregulatory transcriptional program independently of STAT1. Additionally, STAT2 and IRF9 are involved in the regulation of only a subset of these STAT1-independent genes. Consistent with the growing literature, STAT2 and IRF9 act in concert to regulate a subgroup of these genes. Unexpectedly, STAT2 and IRF9 were also engaged in specific independent pathways to regulate distinct sets of IFN{beta} and TNF-induced genes. Altogether these observations highlight the existence of distinct previously unrecognized non-canonical STAT1-independent, but STAT2 and/or IRF9-dependent pathways in the establishment of a delayed antiviral and immunoregulatory transcriptional program in conditions where elevated levels of both IFN{beta} and TNF are present.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is an important cause of mortality and morbidity all over the world. After the initial injury there is a cascade of cellular and molecular events that ultimately lead to cell death. Therapies aim not only to counteract these mechanisms but also to replenish the lost cell population in order to achieve a better recovery. The adult mammal brain in not as plastic as the postnatal, but it has at least two neurogenic regions that maintains physiological functions in the brain; the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, which produces neurons that integrate locally, and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles, that produces neuroblasts that migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulbs. Brain injuries, as well as neurodegenerative diseases, induce the SVZ to respond by increasing cell proliferation and migration to the injured areas. Here we report that SVZ cells migrate to the injured cortex after traumatic brain injury in mice, and that the physiological RMS migration is not impaired. We also show that Prokineticin 2 (PROK2), a chemokine important for the olfactory bulb neurogenesis by promoting the directional migration of neuroblasts, is induced in the injured cortex. Using PROK2 receptor antagonist and recombinant PROK2 we show for the first time that PROK2 can directionally attract SVZ cells in vitro and in vivo. The data we present here links one more element of the inflammatory process, PROK2 secreted by microglia, to the attempt to regenerate an acutely injured mammalian cortex.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

In parallel, fluorescence activated cell sorting and RNA-Seq identified mRNAs sensitive to Dazl deletion in male germ cells. Despite binding a broad set of mRNAs, integrative analyses indicate that Dazl post-transcriptionally controls only a subset of its mRNA targets, namely those corresponding to a network of genes critical for germ cell proliferation and survival. Additionally, we provide evidence that polyA sequences have key roles in specifying Dazl-RNA interactions across the transcriptome. Altogether, our results reveal a mechanism for Dazl-RNA binding, and illustrate that Dazl functions as a master regulator of a post-transcriptional mRNA program essential for germ cell survival.",

    "abstract": "Regulators of chromatin dynamics and transcription are increasingly implicated in the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Haploinsufficiency of EHMT1, encoding a histone methyl-transferase, is associated with several NDDs, including Kleefstra syndrome, developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Using a mouse model of Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency (Ehmt1D6Cre/+), we examined a number of brain and behavioural endophenotypes of relevance to NDDs. Specifically, we show that Ehmt1D6Cre/+ mice have deficits in information processing, evidenced by abnormal sensory-motor gating, a complete absence of object recognition memory and a reduced magnitude of auditory evoked potentials in both paired-pulse inhibition and mismatch negativity (MMN). The electrophysiological experiments show that differences in magnitude response to auditory stimulus were associated with marked reductions in total and evoked beta- and gamma-band oscillatory activity, as well as significant reductions in phase synchronisation. The pattern of electrophysiological deficits in Ehmt1D6Cre/+ matches those seen in control mice following administration of the selective NMDA-R antagonist, ketamine. This, coupled with reduction of Grin1 mRNA expression in Ehmt1D6Cre/+ hippocampus, suggests that Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency may lead to disruption in NMDA-R. Taken together, these data indicate that reduced Ehmt1 dosage during forebrain development leads to abnormal circuitry formation, which in turn results in profound information processing deficits. Such information processing deficits are likely paramount to our understanding of the cognitive and neurological dysfunctions shared across the NDDs associated with EHMT1 haploinsufficiency.",

Experimental NOESY spectra are directly compared to a set of expectation spectra back-calculated across an arbitrary conformational space. Signal decomposition of the experimental spectrum then directly yields the relative populations of local conformational microstates. In this way, averaged descriptions of conformation can be eliminated. As the method quantitatively compares experimental and expectation spectra, it inherently delivers an R-factor expressing how well structural models explain the input data.

    "abstract": "BackgroundLung cancer is the leading cancer diagnosis worldwide and the number one cause of cancer deaths. Exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor in lung cancer, reduces epithelial barrier integrity and increases susceptibility to infections. Herein, we hypothesized that somatic mutations together with cigarette smoke generate a dysbiotic microbiota that is associated with lung carcinogenesis. Using lung tissue from controls (n=33) and cancer cases (n=143), we conducted 16S rRNA bacterial gene sequencing, with RNA-seq data from lung cancer cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (n=1112) serving as the validation cohort.\\n\\nResultsOverall, we demonstrate a lower alpha diversity in normal lung as compared to non-tumor adjacent or tumor tissue. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) specifically, a separate group of taxa were identified, in which Acidovorax was enriched in smokers (P =0.0013). Acidovorax temporans was identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization within tumor sections, and confirmed by two separate 16S rRNA strategies. Further, these taxa, including Acidovorax, exhibited higher abundance among the subset of SCC cases with TP53 mutations, an association not seen in adenocarcinomas (AD).\\n\\nConclusionsThe results of this comprehensive study show both a microbiome-gene and microbiome-exposure interactions in SCC lung cancer tissue. Specifically, tumors harboring TP53 mutations, which can damage epithelial function, have a unique bacterial consortia which is higher in relative abundance in smoking-associated SCC. Given the significant need for clinical diagnostic tools in lung cancer, this study may provide novel biomarkers for early detection.",

    "abstract": "Drug development is a time and cost-consuming long process. Conventionally, this involves the use of two-dimensional (2D) cell culture and animal testing. However, these methods often fail to mimic normal human physiology and drug metabolism, and sometimes complications may occur later because they do not appear in preclinical studies. With recent development of organ-on-a-chip devices, these biomimetic systems try to recapitulate human physiology more than other methods, and promise to largely replace animal studies and reduce costs and complications. Because gut is an important route for drug administration and absorption, gut-on-a-chip platform was developed. To develop a high throughput system, a recent work reported on using a multiplication array of several chip devices, demonstrating the efficiency in studying drug effect on gut barrier function as compared to conventional methods. Huge data was generated, and thus new multidisciplinary approach is needed where data collection, communication and analysis platforms need to be developed. This will enable validation of organ-on-a-chip approach and lay basis for its establishment as efficient and cost-effective tool in drug development. Because of the importance of the work, this commentary highlights important aspects of the topic and try to stimulate new the development of innovations in the field.\\n\\nDisclosureNo conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "Tissue homeostasis is a complex balance of developmental signals and environmental cues that dictate stem cell function. However, it remains poorly understood how nutrients interface with developmental pathways. Using the Drosophila midgut as a model we found that during the first four days of adult life, dietary lipids including cholesterol, determine how many enteroendocrine (ee) cells differentiate and persist in the posterior midgut where lipids are preferentially absorbed. The nuclear hormone receptor Hr96 which functions to control sterol trafficking, storage, and utilization, is required for sterol-mediated changes in ee number. Dietary cholesterol influences new intestinal epithelial cell differentiation from stem cells by altering the level and persistance of Notch signaling. Exogenous lipids modulate signaling by changing the stability of the Delta ligand and Notch intracellular domain and their trafficking in endosomal vesicles. Lipid-modulated Notch signaling occurs in other nutrient-dependent tissues such as the ovary, suggesting that Delta trafficking in many cells is sensitive to cellular sterol levels. These diet-mediated alterations in ee number in young animals contribute to a metabolic program adapted to the prevailing nutrient environment that persists after the diet changes. A low sterol diet also slows the proliferation of enteroendocrine tumors initiated by disruptions in the Notch pathway. These studies show that a specific dietary nutrient can modify a key intercellular signaling pathway to shift stem cell differentiation and cause lasting changes in tissue structure and physiology.",

    "abstract": "The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is preferentially found on fermenting fruits. The yeasts that dominate the microbial communities of these substrates are the primary food source for developing D. melanogaster larvae, and adult flies manifest a strong olfactory system-mediated attraction for the volatile compounds produced by these yeasts during fermentation. Although most work on this interaction has focused on the standard laboratory yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a wide variety of other yeasts naturally ferment fallen fruit. Here we address the open question of whether D. melanogaster preferentially associates with distinct yeasts in different, closely-related environments. We characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of Drosophila-associated fungi in Northern California wineries that use organic grapes and natural fermentation using high-throughput, short-amplicon sequencing. We found that there is nonrandom structure in the fungal communities that are vectored by flies both between and within vineyards. Within wineries, the fungal communities associated with flies in cellars, fermentation tanks, and pomace piles are distinguished by varying abundances of a small number of yeast species. To investigate the origins of this structure, we assayed Drosophila attraction to, oviposition on, larval development in, and longevity when consuming the yeasts that distinguish vineyard microhabitats from each other. We found that wild fly lines did not respond differentially to the yeast species that distinguish winery habitats in habitat specific manner. Instead, this subset of yeast shares traits that make them attractive to and ensure their close association with Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Ecological models of community dynamics fall into two main categories. The neutral theory of biodiversity correctly predicts various large-scale ecosystem characteristics such as the species abundance distributions. On a smaller scale, the niche theory of species competition explains population dynamics and interactions between two to a dozen species. Despite the successes of the two theories, they rely on two contradictory assumptions. In the neutral theory each species is competitively equivalent while in the niche theory every species is specialized to exploit a specific part of its environment. Here we propose a resolution to this contradiction using a game theory model of competition with an attractor hyperplane as its equilibrium solution. When the population dynamics shifts within the hyperplane, it is selectively neutral. However, any movement perpendicular to the hyperplane is subject to restoring forces similar to what is predicted by the niche theory. We show that this model correctly reproduces empirical species abundance distributions and is also compatible with species removal experiments.",

    "abstract": "Theory and empirical data showed that two processes can boost selection against deleterious mutations, thus facilitating the purging of the mutation load: inbreeding, by exposing recessive deleterious alleles to selection in homozygous form, and sexual selection, by enhancing the relative reproductive success of males with small mutation loads. These processes tend to be mutually exclusive because sexual selection is reduced under mating systems that promote inbreeding, such as self-fertilization in hermaphrodites. We estimated the relative efficiency of inbreeding and sexual selection at purging the genetic load, using 50 generations of experimental evolution, in a hermaphroditic snail (Physa acuta). To this end, we generated lines that were exposed to various intensities of inbreeding, sexual selection (on the male function) and nonsexual selection (on the female function). We measured how these regimes affected the mutation load, quantified through the survival of outcrossed and selfed juveniles. We found that juvenile survival strongly decreased in outbred lines with reduced male selection, but not when female selection was relaxed, showing that male-specific sexual selection does purge deleterious mutations. However, in lines exposed to inbreeding, where sexual selection was also relaxed, survival did not decrease, and even increased for self-fertilized juveniles, showing that purging through inbreeding can compensate for the absence of sexual selection. Our results point to the further question of whether a mixed strategy combining the advantages of both mechanisms of genetic purging could be evolutionary stable.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome-wide association studies have had great success in identifying human genetic variants associated with disease, disease risk factors, and other biomedical phenotypes. Many variants are associated with multiple traits, even after correction for trait-trait correlation. Discovering subsets of variants associated with a shared subset of phenotypes could help reveal disease mechanisms, suggest new therapeutic options, and increase the power to detect additional variants with similar pattern of associations. Here we introduce two methods based on a Bayesian framework, SNP And Pleiotropic PHenotype Organization (SAPPHO), one modeling independent phenotypes (SAPPHO-I) and the other incorporating a full phenotype covariance structure (SAPPHO-C). These two methods learn patterns of pleiotropy from genotype and phenotype data, using identified associations to discover additional associations with shared patterns.\\n\\nResultsThe SAPPHO methods, along with other recent approaches for pleiotropic association tests, were assessed using data from the Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of 8,000 individuals, whose gold-standard associations were provided by meta-analysis of 40,000 to 100,000 individuals from the CHARGE consortium. Using power to detect gold-standard associations at genome-wide significance (0.05 family-wise error rate) as a metric, SAPPHO performed best. The SAPPHO methods were also uniquely able to select the most significant variants in a parsimonious model, excluding other less likely variants within a linkage disequilibrium block. For meta-analysis, the SAPPHO methods implement summary modes that use sufficient statistics rather than full phenotype and genotype data. Meta-analysis applied to CHARGE detected 16 additional associations to the gold-standard loci, as well as 124 novel loci, at 0.05 false discovery rate. Reasons for the superior performance were explored by performing simulations over a range of scenarios describing different genetic architectures. With SAPPHO we were able to learn genetic structures that were hidden using the traditional univariate tests.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://bitbucket.org/baderlab/fast/wiki/Home.

In this study, the genome of seven field isolates of the virus ErelGV were deep sequenced and their inter-and intrapopulational sequence diversity were analyzed.\\n\\nResultsNo events of gene gain/loss or translocations were observed, and indels were mainly found within highly repetitive regions (direct repeats, drs). A naturally occurring isolate from Northern Brazil (Acre State, an Amazonian region) has shown to be the most diverse population, with a unique pattern of polymorphisms. Overall, non-synonymous substitutions were found all over the seven genomes, with no specific gathering of mutations on hotspot regions. Independently of their sizes, some ORFs have shown higher levels of non-synonymous changes than others. Non-core genes of known functions and structural genes were among the most diverse ones; and as expected, core genes were the least variable genes. We observed remarkable differences on diversity of paralogous genes, as in multiple copies of p10, fgf, and pep. Another important contrast on sequence diversity was found on genes encoding complex subunits and/or involved in the same biological processes, as late expression factors (lefs) and per os infectivity factors (pifs). Interestingly, several polymorphisms in coding regions lie on sequences encoding specific protein domains.\\n\\nConclusionsBy comparing and integrating information about inter-and intrapopulational diversity of viral isolates, we provide a detailed description on how evolution operates on field isolates of a betabaculovirus. Our results revealed that 35-41% of the SNPs of ErelGV lead to amino acid changes (non-synonymous substitutions). Some genes, especially non-core genes of unknown functions, tend to accumulate more mutations, while core genes evolve slowly and are more conserved. Additional studies would be necessary to understand the actual effects of such gene variations on viral infection and fitness.",

However, the rules by which parallel inputs are routed to different downstream targets is poorly understood. The superior colliculus mediates a set of innate behaviours, receiving input from ~30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviourally important targets including the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. Combining transsynaptic circuit tracing with in-vivo and ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings we observed a projection specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. Neurons projecting to the pulvinar or parabigeminal nucleus uniquely sampled 4 and 7 cell types, respectively. Four others innervated both pathways. The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings suggest that projection specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a mechanistic basis for the selective triggering of visually guided behaviours by the superior colliculus.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication is an important driver for the evolution of new genes and protein functions. Duplication of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) II subunits within plants led to the emergence of RNA Pol IV and V complexes, each of which possess unique functions necessary for RNA-directed DNA Methylation. Comprehensive identification of Pol V subunit orthologs across the monocot radiation revealed a duplication of the largest two subunits within the grasses (Poaceae), including critical cereal crops. These paralogous Pol subunits display sequence conservation within catalytic domains, but their carboxy terminal domains differ in length and character of the Ago-binding platform, suggesting unique functional interactions. Phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic region indicates positive selection on one paralog following duplication, consistent with retention via neofunctionalization. Positive selection on residue pairs that are predicted to interact between subunits suggests that paralogous subunits have evolved specific assembly partners. Additional Pol subunits as well as Pol-interacting proteins also possess grass-specific paralogs, supporting the hypothesis that a novel Pol complex with distinct function has evolved in the grass family, Poaceae.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/272708_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (32K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d3515org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16831d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19f99b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1253e70_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG Significance statementThe grass family is critically important for humans, as this group contains cereal grains such as rice, wheat, and corn that form the bulk of the human diet.

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentifying transcription factor binding sites is the first step in pinpointing non-coding mutations that disrupt the regulatory function of transcription factors and promote disease. ChIP-seq is the most common method for identifying binding sites, but performing it on patient samples is hampered by the amount of available biological material and the cost of the experiment. Existing methods for computational prediction of regulatory elements primarily predict binding in genomic regions with sequence similarity to known transcription factor sequence preferences. This has limited efficacy since most binding sites do not resemble known transcription factor sequence motifs, and many transcription factors are not even sequence-specific.\n\nResultsWe developed Virtual ChIP-seq, which predicts binding of individual transcription factors in new cell types using an artificial neural network that integrates ChIP-seq results from other cell types and chromatin accessibility data in the new cell type. Virtual ChIP-seq also uses learned associations between gene expression and transcription factor binding at specific genomic regions. This approach outperforms methods that predict TF binding solely based on sequence preference, pre-dicting binding for 36 transcription factors (Matthews correlation coefficient > 0.3).\n\nAvailabilityThe datasets we used for training and validation are available at https://virchip.hoffmanlab.org.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance remains a major threat to global health. Profiling the collective antimicrobial resistance genes within a metagenome (the \\\"resistome\\\") facilitates greater understanding of antimicrobial resistance gene diversity and dynamics. In turn, this can allow for gene surveillance, individualised treatment of bacterial infections and more sustainable use of antimicrobials. However, resistome profiling can be complicated by high similarity between reference genes, as well as the sheer volume of sequencing data and the complexity of analysis workflows. We have developed an efficient and accurate method for resistome profiling that addresses these complications and improves upon currently available tools.\\n\\nResultsOur method combines a variation graph representation of gene sets with an LSH Forest indexing scheme to allow for fast classification of metagenomic sequence reads using similarity-search queries. Subsequent hierarchical local alignment of classified reads against graph traversals enables accurate reconstruction of full-length gene sequences using a scoring scheme. We provide our implementation, GROOT, and show it to be both faster and more accurate than a current reference-dependent tool for resistome profiling. GROOT runs on a laptop and can process a typical 2 gigabyte metagenome in 2 minutes using a single CPU.\\n\\nConclusionWe present a method for resistome profiling that utilises a novel index and search strategy to accurately type resistance genes in metagenomic samples. The use of variation graphs yields several advantages over other methods using linear reference sequences. Our method is not restricted to resistome profiling and has the potential to improve current metagenomic workflows.

    "abstract": "Many proteins display complex dynamical properties that are often intimately linked to their biological functions. As the native state of a protein is best described as an ensemble of confor-mations, it is important to be able to generate models of native state ensembles with high accuracy. Due to limitations in sampling efficiency and force field accuracy it is, however, challenging to obtain accurate ensembles of protein conformations by the use of molecular simulations alone. Here we show that dynamic ensemble refinement, which combines an accurate atomistic force field with commonly available nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts and NOEs, can provide a detailed and accurate description of the conformational ensemble of the native state of a highly dynamic protein. As both NOEs and chemical shifts are averaged on timescales up to milliseconds, the resulting ensembles reflect the structural heterogeneity that goes beyond that probed e.g. by NMR relaxation order parameters. We selected the small protein domain NCBD as object of our study since this protein, which has been characterized experimentally in substantial detail, displays a rich and complex dynamical behaviour. In particular, the protein has been described as having a molten-globule like structure, but with a relatively rigid core. Our approach allowed us to describe the conformational dynamics of NCBD in solution, and to probe the structural heterogeneity resulting from both short- and long-time-scale dynamics by the calculation of order parameters on different time scales. These results illustrate the usefulness of our approach since they show that NCBD is rather rigid on the nanosecond timescale, but interconverts within a broader ensemble on longer timescales, thus enabling the derivation of a coherent set of conclusions from various NMR experiments on this protein, which could otherwise appear in contradiction with each other.",

    "abstract": "The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) provides a framework to predict how habitat modifications related to the distribution of resources over patches should impact the realized fitness of individuals and their optimal rate of movement (or patch residence times) across the habitat. Most MVT theory has focused on the consequences of changing the shape of the gain functions in some patches, describing for instance patch enrichment. However an alternative form of habitat modification is habitat conversion, whereby patches are converted from one existing type to another (e.g. closed habitat to open habitat). In such a case the set of gain functions existing in the habitat does not change, only their relative frequencies does. This has received comparatively very little attention in the context of the MVT. Here we analyze mathematically the consequences of habitat conversion under the MVT. We study how realized fitness and the average rate of movement should respond to changes in the frequency distribution of patch-types, and how they should covary. We further compare the response of optimal and non-plastic foragers. We find that the initial pattern of patch-exploitation in a habitat, characterized by the regression slope of patch yields over residence times, can help predict the qualitative responses of fitness and movement rate following habitat conversion. We also find that for some habitat conversion patterns, optimal and non-plastic foragers exhibit qualitatively different responses, and that adaptive foragers can have opposite responses in the early and late phases following habitat conversion. We suggest taking into account behavioral responses may help better understand the ecological consequences of habitat conversion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLarge-scale genomic studies of within-host evolution during Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) are needed to understanding bacterial adaptation underlying persistence and thus refining the role of genomics in management of SAB. However, available comparative genomic studies of sequential SAB isolates have tended to focus on selected cases of unusually prolonged bacteraemia, where secondary antimicrobial resistance has developed. To understand the bacterial genomic evolution during SAB more broadly, we applied whole genome sequencing to a large collection of sequential isolates obtained from patients with persistent or relapsing bacteraemia.\\n\\nResultsWe show that, while adapation pathways are heterogenous and episode-specific, isolates from persistent bacteraemia have a distinctive molecular signature, characterised by a low mutation frequency and high proportion of non-silent mutations. By performing an extensive analysis of structural genomic variants in addition to point mutations, we found that these often overlooked genetic events are commonly acquired during SAB. We discovered that IS256 insertion may represent the most effective driver of within-host microevolution in selected lineages, with up to three new insertion events per isolate even in the absence of other mutations. Genetic mechanisms resulting in significant phenotypic changes, such as increases in vancomycin resistance, development of small colony phenotypes, and decreases in cytotoxicity, included mutations in key genes (rpoB, stp, agrA) and an IS256 insertion upstream of the walKR operon.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides for the first time a large-scale analysis of within-host evolution during invasive S. aureus infection and describes specific patterns of adaptation that will be informative for both understanding S. aureus pathoadaptation and utilising genomics for management of complicated S. aureus infections.",

Yet a separate type of interaction, whereby one visual pattern changes the influence of another, known as modulation, has received much less attention in terms of its circuit mechanisms. Retinal amacrine cells are a diverse class of inhibitory interneurons that are thought to have modulatory effects, but we lack a general understanding of their functional types. Using dynamic causal experiments in the salamander retina perturbing amacrine cells along with an unsupervised computational framework, we find that amacrine cell modulatory effects cluster into two distinct types. One type controls ganglion cell sensitivity to individual visual features, and a second type controls the ganglion cells output gain, acting to gate all features. These results establish three separate general roles of amacrine cells - to generate primary visual features, to use context to select specific visual features and to gate retinal output.",

A Bicaudal-D (BicD) adaptor protein and the RNA-binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) are sufficient for long-distance mRNA transport by the dynein motor and its accessory complex dynactin, thus defining a minimal transport-competent RNP. Unexpectedly, the RNA is required for robust activation of dynein motility. We show that a cis-acting RNA localisation signal stabilises the interaction of Egl with BicD, which licenses the latter protein to recruit dynein and dynactin. Our data support a model for BicD activation based on RNA-induced occupancy of two Egl-binding sites on the BicD dimer.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary trajectory from cross-to self-fertilization is widely documented in nature, but results from several taxa also suggest that outcrossing may evolve in a formerly selfing population. Population genetic theory explains that selfing can evolve when its advantages overcome its immediate cost of inbreeding depression, but that this process will not run in reverse because a self-fertilizing population purges itself of inbreeding depression. That is, the primary short-term advantage of cross-fertilization over self-fertilization depends on the existence of deleterious alleles exposed upon inbreeding. Here, we explore whether outcrossing can evolve in selfing populations if allelic variation exists as divergence among populations. We consider two monomorphic populations of entirely self-fertilizing individuals, introduce a modifier allele that increases the rate of cross-fertilization, and investigate whether the heterosis among populations is sufficient for the modifier to invade and fix. We find that, despite an initial increase in the frequency of the outcrossing modifier, its fixation is possible only when populations harbor extremely large unique fixed genetic loads. These rare reversions to outcrossing become more likely as the load becomes more polygenic, or when the modifier appears on a rare background, such as by dispersal of an outcrossing genotype into a selfing population.",

Our results show that postdoctoral mentors were more instrumental to trainees success compared to graduate mentors. A trainees success in academia was predicted by the degree of intellectual synthesis with their mentors, resulting from fusing the influence of disparate advisors.

    "abstract": "Possessing spatial familiarity with their foraging landscape may enable animals to reduce foraging effort without compromising on foraging benefits. For animals inhabiting feature-rich landscapes, spatial familiarity can increase with increasing age/experience. To check whether this holds for individually foraging tropical social wasp Ropalidia marginata, we recorded the number and duration of all foraging trips, the identity of the materials brought to the nest (building material, water or food) and the directions of outbound and inbound flights (respective to their nests) of known-age foragers from three natural colonies, each for three consecutive days. The average trip duration and time spent daily in foraging increased rapidly until about first four weeks of their life, during which they rarely brought food to their nest, although many of them brought building material and water. Thereafter, their average as well as per day duration of foraging trip started decreasing gradually. Nevertheless, their foraging efficiency and success for food kept on increasing monotonically with age. These results suggest that older wasps were more efficient in foraging despite spending less time doing so. With increasing age, wasps developed individual preferences for the direction of their outbound flights, increased directionality of their inbound trips as well as the angular difference between their outbound and subsequent inbound flights, indicating development of spatial memory. We conclude that wasps acquire familiarity with their foraging landscape in their initial foraging phase and gradually develop robust memory for rewarding sites and routes to those sites, which enables them to increase their foraging capabilities.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTContrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, tropical social wasps invest weeks to get familiar with foraging landscapes during their early foraging lives. This eventually enables them to increase foraging gain with reduced effort.",

    "abstract": "--Rapid advancements in high-throughput technologies has resulted in genome-scale time series datasets. Uncovering the temporal sequence of gene regulatory events, in the form of time-varying gene regulatory networks (GRNs), demands computationally fast, accurate and scalable algorithms. The existing algorithms can be divided into two categories: ones that are time-intensive and hence unscalable; others that impose structural constraints to become scalable. In this paper, a novel algorithm, namely  an algorithm for reconstructing Time-varying Gene regulatory networks with Shortlisted candidate regulators (TGS), is proposed. TGS is time-efficient and does not impose any structural constraints. Moreover, it provides such flexibility and time-efficiency, without losing its accuracy. TGS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in true positive detection, on three benchmark synthetic datasets. However, TGS does not perform as well in false positive rejection. To mitigate this issue, TGS+ is proposed. TGS+ demonstrates competitive false positive rejection power, while maintaining the superior speed and true positive detection power of TGS. Nevertheless, main memory requirements of both TGS variants grow exponentially with the number of genes, which they tackle by restricting the maximum number of regulators for each gene. Relaxing this restriction remains a challenge as the actual number of regulators is not known a priori.\\n\\nReproducibilityThe datasets and results can be found at: https://github.com/aaiitg-grp/TGS.
