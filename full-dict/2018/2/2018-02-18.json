    "abstract": "The latent period is a crucial life history trait, particularly for polycyclic plant diseases, because it determines how many complete monocycles could theoretically occur during an epidemic. Many empirical studies have focused on the variation of the latent period with pathogen or host genotype, or changes in response to environmental factors. The focus on these aspects is unsurprising, as these factors classically form the three parts of the epidemiological triangle. Experiments in controlled conditions are generally used to assess pathogenicity and host susceptibility, and also provide the opportunity to measure the distribution of latent periods in epidemiological systems. Once estimated for one or several pairs of host-pathogen genotypes, the mean value of this important trait is usually considered to be fixed and is often used \\\"as is\\\" in epidemiological models. We show here that the latent period can display non-negligible variability over the course of a disease epidemic, and that this variability has multiple sources, some of which have complex, antagonistic impacts. We develop arguments for four sources of variation that challenge the implicit assumption that the latent period remains constant: daily fluctuations in leaf temperature, nature of inoculum, host stage or age of host tissues, intra-population competition and selection for aggressiveness traits. We focus on the wheat fungal disease Septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), making use of empirical datasets collected during the first authors own research projects and a targeted literature review. Such empirical epidemiological knowledge is new and potentially important for modelers. While some studies have demonstrated that the distribution of latent periods around the mean value has consequences for epidemiological dynamics, we show that it might also be important for epidemiological modelers to account for changes in this mean value during an annual epidemic. These results may be of critical importance for improving outbreak forecasting.",

    "abstract": "The ability to inhibit our responses voluntarily is an important case of cognitive control. The stop-signal paradigm is a popular tool to study response inhibition. Participants perform a response time task (go task) and, occasionally, the go stimulus is followed by a stop signal after a variable delay, indicating subjects to withhold their response (stop task). The main interest of modeling is in estimating the unobservable stop-signal processing time, that is, the covert latency of the stopping process as a characterization of the response inhibition mechanism. In the independent race model the stop-signal task is represented as a race between stochastically independent go and stop processes. Without making any specific distributional assumptions about the processing times, the model allows to estimate the mean time to cancel a response. However, neurophysiological studies on countermanding saccadic eye movements have shown that neural correlates of go and stop processes consist of networks of mutually interacting gaze-shifting and gaze-holding neurons. This poses a major challenge in formulating linking propositions between the behavioral and neural findings. Here we propose a dependent race model that postulates perfect negative stochastic dependence between go and stop activations. The model is consistent with the concept of interacting processes while retaining the simplicity and elegance of the distribution-free independent race model. For mean data, the dependent models predictions remain identical to those of the independent model. The resolution of this apparent paradox advances the understanding of mechanisms of response inhibition and paves the way for modeling more complex situations.",

    "abstract": "Allopolyploidy is generally perceived as a major source of evolutionary novelties and as an instantaneous way to create isolation barriers. However, we do not have a clear understanding of how two subgenomes evolve and interact once they have fused in an allopolyploid species and how isolated they are from their relatives. Here, we address these questions by analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data of allotetraploid Capsella bursa-pastoris in three differentiated populations, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. We phased the two subgenomes, one descended from the outcrossing and highly diverse Capsella grandiflora (Cg) and the other one from the selfing and genetically depauperate Capsella orientalis (Co). For each subgenome, we assessed its relationship with the diploid relatives, temporal change of effective population size Ne, signatures of positive and negative selection, and gene expression patterns. Introgression between C. bursa-pastoris and its diploid relatives was widespread and the two subgenomes were impacted differentially depending on geographic region. In all three regions, Ne of the two subgenomes decreased gradually and the Co subgenome accumulated more deleterious changes than Cg. Selective sweeps were more common on the Cg subgenome in Europe and the Middle East, and on the Co subgenome in Asia. In contrast, differences in expression were limited with the Cg subgenome slightly more expressed than Co in Europe and the Middle-East. In summary, after more than 100,000 generations of co-existence, the two subgenomes of C. bursa-pastoris still retained a strong signature of parental legacy and were differentially affected by introgression and selection.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFood security is a growing global concern. Farmers, plant breeders, and geneticists are hastening to address the challenges presented to agriculture by climate change, dwindling arable land, and population growth. Scientists in the field of plant phenomics are using satellite and drone images to understand how crops respond to a changing environment and to combine genetics and environmental measures to maximize crop growth efficiency. However, the terabytes of image data require new computational methods to extract useful information. Machine learning algorithms are effective in recognizing select parts of images, but they require high quality data curated by people to train them, a process that can be laborious and costly. We examined how well crowdsourcing works in providing training data for plant phenomics, specifically, segmenting a corn tassel - the male flower of the corn plant - from the often-cluttered images of a cornfield. We provided images to students, and to Amazon MTurkers, the latter being an on-demand workforce brokered by Amazon.com and paid on a task-by-task basis. We report on best practices in crowdsourcing image labeling for phenomics, and compare the different groups on measures such as fatigue and accuracy over time. We find that crowdsourcing is a good way of generating quality labeled data, rivaling that of experts.",

    "abstract": "Rod-shaped bacteria typically grow first via sporadic and dispersed elongation along their lateral walls, then via a combination of zonal elongation and constriction at the division site to form the poles of daughter cells. Although constriction comprises up to half of the cell cycle, its impact on cell size control and homeostasis has rarely been considered. To reveal the roles of cell elongation and constriction in bacterial size regulation during cell division, we captured the shape dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus with time-lapse structured illumination microscopy and used molecular markers as cell-cycle landmarks. We perturbed constriction rate using a hyperconstriction mutant or fosfomycin inhibition. We report that constriction rate contributes to both size control and homeostasis, by determining elongation during constriction, and by compensating for variation in pre-constriction elongation on a single-cell basis.",

However, due to the intricacy of biological systems, these methods were rarely utilized in bioengineering until recently. By developing advanced computers with the ability to cope with enormous calculations and extending our knowledge about biological systems, modeling-based approaches have been adopted to manipulate biological systems. While utilizing the models to investigate the behavior of a system has some advantages including lower cost and time consumption, such methods were used for tissue engineering scarcely. Exploiting modeling-based methods to tissue engineering field requires developing and utilizing efficient computational methods to model gene regulation and signaling networks, which determine cell response to environmental changes and cellular fate.\\n\\nIn the present work, a novel spatio-temporal method was proposed, predicated on locally uniform mesh refinement. A benchmark comparison was performed with the previously used method and the results indicated the better performance of the incipiently adopted method. Besides, the model was utilized to investigate the effect of a popular differentiating stimulator, namely electrical stimulation, on mesenchymal stem cells as a type of stem cells widely used in tissue engineering. The results of the simulations demonstrated the puissance of such computational models in analyzing and predicting the effect of biochemical and biophysical perturbations on the cells and hence, their potential utility in tissue engineering.",

The present experiment further explored the factor affecting the inversion effect observed in the previous experiments. Five young laboratory-born Japanese macaques looked at the photographs by pressing the lever under the conjugate schedule of sensory reinforcement, that is, successive preferential looking procedure. Photographs of macaques were scrambled and made up two types of the bizarre photographs: upright face with upright body (orientation consistent) and inverted face with upright body (orientation inconsistent). These two types of photographs were presented at upright and inverted orientations. The monkeys looked longer when the face was upright than inverted. Orientation of body and background had no effect on looking time duration. The present results strongly suggest that inversion effect found in macaques is face-specific.",

We report that functional human adipose tissue can be generated from mesenchymal progenitor cells in-vivo, providing an alternative approach to its therapeutic use. We leveraged previous findings that progenitor cells within the vasculature of human adipose tissue robustly proliferate in 3-dimensional culture under proangiogenic conditions. Implantation of these progenitor cells into immunocompromised mice results in differentiation towards non-adipocyte fates, incapable of generating a distinct tissue structure. However, priming of these progenitor cells in-vitro towards adipogenic differentiation results in formation of functional adipose tissue in-vivo. Mechanistically, priming induces the expression of genes encoding specific extracellular matrix and remodeling proteins, and induces extensive vascularization by host blood vessels. In comparison, grafts from adipose tissue obtained by liposuction undergo poor vascularization, adipocyte death, cyst formation, calcification and inefficient adiponectin secretion. Thus, primed mesenchymal adipose tissue progenitors reveal mechanisms of human adipose tissue development, and have potential to improve outcomes in reconstructive and regenerative medicine.",

However, there are significant challenges when dealing with NGS data. A huge number of bioinformatics tools exist and it is therefore challenging to design an analysis pipeline; NGS analysis is computationally intensive, requiring expensive infrastructure which can be problematic given that many medical and research centres do not have adequate high performance computing facilities and the use of cloud computing facilities is not always possible due to privacy and ownership issues. We have therefore developed a fast and efficient bioinformatics pipeline that allows for the analysis of DNA sequencing data, while requiring little computational effort and memory usage. We achieved this by exploiting state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools. DNAscan can analyse raw, 40x whole genome NGS data in 8 hours, using as little as 8 threads and 16 Gbs of RAM, while guaranteeing a high performance. DNAscan can look for SNVs, small indels, SVs, repeat expansions and viral genetic material (or any other organism). Its results are annotated using a customisable variety of databases including ClinVar, Exac and dbSNP, and a local deployment of the gene.iobio platform is available for an on-the-fly result visualisation.",

However, without proper parameterization, these methods are not suitable for ancient DNA. Quantifying somewhat dissimilar sequences by alignment methods is problematic, due to the need of fine-tuned thresholds, considering relaxed edit distances and the consequent increase of computational cost. Additionally, the choice of the thresholds poses the problem of how to quantify similarity without producing overestimated measures. We propose FALCON-meta, a compression-based method to infer metagenomic composition of next-generation sequencing samples. This unsupervised alignment-free method runs efficiently on FASTQ samples. FALCON-meta quickly learns how to give importance to the models that cooperate to predict similarity, incorporating parallelism and flexibility for multiple hardware characteristics. It shows substantial identification capabilities in ancient DNA without overestimation.

    "abstract": "Identifying selective sweeps in populations that have complex demographic histories remains a difficult problem in population genetics. We previously introduced a supervised machine learning approach, S/HIC, for finding both hard and soft selective sweeps in genomes on the basis of patterns of genetic variation surrounding a window of the genome. While S/HIC was shown to be both powerful and precise, the utility of S/HIC was limited by the use of phased genomic data as input. In this report we describe a deep learning variant of our method, diploS/HIC, that uses unphased genotypes to accurately classify genomic windows. diploS/HIC is shown to be quite powerful even at moderate to small sample sizes",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila genus is a unique group containing a wide range of species that occupy diverse ecosystems. In addition to the most widely studied species, Drosophila melanogaster, many other members in this genus also possess a well-developed set of genetic tools. Indeed, high-quality genomes exist for several species within the genus, facilitating studies of the function and evolution of cis-regulatory regions and proteins by allowing comparisons across at least 50 million years of evolution. Yet, the available genomes still fail to capture much of the substantial genetic diversity within the Drosophila genus. We have therefore tested protocols to rapidly and inexpensively sequence and assemble the genome from any Drosophila species using single-molecule sequencing technology from Oxford Nanopore. Here, we use this technology to present high-quality genome assemblies of 15 Drosophila species: 10 of the 12 originally sequenced Drosophila species (ananassae, erecta, mojavensis, persimilis, pseudoobscura, sechellia, simulans, virilis, willistoni, and yakuba), four additional species that had previously reported assemblies (biarmipes, bipectinata, eugracilis, and mauritiana), and one novel assembly (triauraria). Genomes were generated from an average of 29x depth-of-coverage data that after assembly resulted in an average contig N50 of 4.4 Mb. Subsequent alignment of contigs from the published reference genomes demonstrates that our assemblies could be used to close over 60% of the gaps present in the currently published reference genomes. Importantly, the materials and reagents cost for each genome was approximately $1,000 (USD). This study demonstrates the power and cost-effectiveness of long-read sequencing for genome assembly in Drosophila and provides a framework for the affordable sequencing and assembly of additional Drosophila genomes.",

We used a systems-level (scalp recordings) and a microcircuit-level (extracellular recordings) approach to investigate how aging affects the sensitivity to temporal envelopes of speech-like sounds in rats. Scalp-recorded potentials suggest an age-related increase in sensitivity to temporal regularity along the ascending auditory pathway. The underlying cellular changes in the midbrain were examined using extracellular recordings from inferior colliculus neurons. We observed an age-related increase in sensitivity to the sounds onset and temporal regularity (i.e., periodicity envelope) in the spiking output of inferior colliculus neurons, relative to their synaptic inputs (local field potentials). This relative enhancement for aged animals was most prominent for multi-unit (relative to single-unit) spiking activity. Spontaneous multi-unit, but not single-unit, activity was also enhanced in aged compared to young animals. Our results suggest that aging is associated with altered sensitivity to a sounds temporal regularities, and that these effects may be due to increased gain of neural network activity in the midbrain.",

Here we use narrative picture stimuli and a novel controlled presentation technique to identify the full extent of activation during naturalistic narrative scene comprehension. We then situate it with respect to topologically-mapped sensory and motor regions as well as cortical regions activated during naturalistic narrative reading comprehension. The data for all experiments was obtained from the same set of subjects, and analyzed using cortical surface based methods from start to finish. The results suggest that scene and reading activations are spread across occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal cortex, and largely aligned with each other. Within these regions, there were also sites uniquely activated when subjects were engaged in either narrative scene comprehension or in reading comprehension. Finally, the cortical activations for both scene and reading comprehension contrasts substantially overlap topological cortical maps, specifically retinotopic and tonotopic maps in occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal cortex.",

However, whether non-antibiotic, anti-microbial (NAAM) chemicals can directly induce antibiotic resistance is unclear. We aim to investigate whether the exposure to a NAAM chemical triclosan (TCS) has an impact on inducing antibiotic resistance on Escherichia coli. Here, we report that at a concentration of 0.2 mg/L TCS induces multi-drug resistance in wild-type Escherichia coli after 30-day TCS exposure. The oxidative stress induced by TCS caused genetic mutations in genes such as fabI, frdD, marR, acrR and soxR, and subsequent up-regulation of the transcription of genes encoding beta-lactamase and multi-drug efflux pump, together with down-regulation of genes related to membrane permeability. The findings advance our understanding of the potential role of NAAM chemicals in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in microbes, and highlights the need for controlling biocide applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the microbiome has an impact on gestational health and outcome. However, characterization of the pregnancy-associated microbiome has largely relied on 16S rRNA gene amplicon-based surveys. Here, we describe an assembly-driven, metagenomics-based, longitudinal study of the vaginal, gut, and oral microbiomes in 292 samples from ten subjects sampled every three weeks throughout pregnancy. 1.53 Gb of non-human sequence was assembled into scaffolds, and functional genes were predicted for gene-and pathway-based analyses. Vaginal assemblies were binned into 97 draft quality genomes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) of microbial community composition at all three body sites revealed gestational age to be a significant source of variation in patterns of gene abundance. In addition, health complications were associated with variation in community functional gene composition in the mouth and gut. The diversity of Lactobacillus iners-dominated communities in the vagina, unlike most other vaginal community types, significantly increased with gestational age. The genomes of co-occurring Gardnerella vaginalis strains with predicted distinct functions were recovered in samples from two subjects. In seven subjects, gut samples contained strains of the same Lactobacillus species that dominated the vaginal community of that same subject, and not other Lactobacillus species; however, these within-host strains were divergent. CRISPR spacer analysis suggested shared phage and plasmid populations across body sites and individuals. This work underscores the dynamic behavior of the microbiome during pregnancy and suggests the potential importance of understanding the sources of this behavior for fetal development and gestational outcome.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism for bacterial gliding is not understood. The gliding bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae is known to have an adhesin, SprB, that moves along the cell surface on a spiral track. When cells are sheared by passage of a suspension through thin tubing, they stop gliding but can be tethered by addition of an anti-SprB antibody. Tethered cells spin about 3 Hz. We labeled the Type 9 secretion system (T9SS) with a yellow-fluorescent-protein (YFP) fusion of GldL. When labeled cells were tethered, a yellow fluorescent spot was found near the rotation axis, which shows that the motor that drives the rotation localizes with the T9SS. The spiral track was labeled by following the motion of Cy3 attached to SprB via an antibody. The distance between the rotation axis and the track was determined by a measurement involving both labels, YFP and Cy3, yielding 90 nm. If a rotary motor spins a pinion of radius 90 nm 3 Hz, a spot on its periphery will move 1.5 m/s, the speed at which cells glide. We suggest that the pinion drives a flexible tread that carries SprB along a track fixed to the cell surface. Cells glide when such an adhesin adheres to the solid substratum.",

    "abstract": "New approaches to lineage tracking allow the study of cell differentiation over many generations of cells during development in multicellular organisms. Understanding the variability observed in these lineage trees requires new statistical methods. Whereas invariant cell lineages, such as that for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, can be described using a lineage map, defined as the fixed pattern of phenotypes overlaid onto the binary tree structure, the variability of cell lineages from higher organisms makes it impossible to draw a single lineage map. Here, we introduce lineage variability maps which describe the pattern of second-order variation throughout the lineage tree. These maps can be undirected graphs of the partial correlations between every lineal position or directed graphs showing the dynamics of bifurcated patterns in each subtree. By using the symmetry invariance of a binary tree to develop a generalized spectral analysis for cell lineages, we show how to infer these graphical models for lineages of any depth from sample sizes of only a few pedigrees. When tested on pedigrees from C. elegans expressing a marker for pharyngeal differentiation potential, the maps recover essential features of the known lineage map. When applied to highly-variable pedigrees monitoring cell size in T lymphocytes, the maps show how most of the phenotype is set by the founder naive T cell. Lineage variability maps thus elevate the concept of the lineage map to the population level, addressing questions about the potency and dynamics of cell lineages and providing a way to quantify the progressive restriction of cell fate with increasing depth in the tree.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMulticellular organisms develop from a single fertilized egg by sequential cell divisions. The progeny from these divisions adopt different traits that are transmitted and modified through many generations. By tracking how cell traits change with each successive cell division throughout the family, or lineage, tree, it has been possible to understand where and how these modifications are controlled at the single-cell level, thereby addressing questions about, for example, the developmental origin of tissues, the sources of differentiation in immune cells, or the relationship between primary tumors and metastases. Such lineages often show large variability, with apparently identical founder cells giving rise to different patterns of descendants. Fundamental scientific questions, such as about the range of possible cell types a cell can give rise to, are often about this variability. To characterize this variation, and thus understand the lineage at the population level, we introduce lineage variability maps. Using data from worm and mammalian cell lineages we show how these maps provide quantifiable answers to questions about any developing lineage, such as the potency of founder cells and the progressive restriction of cell fate at each stage in the tree.",

    "abstract": "Many cellular populations are tightly-packed, for example microbial colonies and biofilms [39, 10, 41], or tissues and tumors in multi-cellular organisms [11, 29]. Movement of one cell inside such crowded assemblages requires movement of others, so that cell displacements are correlated over many cell diameters [28, 6, 31]. Whenever movement is important for survival or growth [15, 34, 38, 9], such correlated rearrangements could couple the evolutionary fate of different lineages. Yet, little is known about the interplay between mechanical stresses and evolution in dense cellular populations. Here, by tracking deleterious mutations at the expanding edge of yeast colonies, we show that crowding-induced collective motion prevents costly mutations from being weeded out rapidly. Joint pushing by neighboring cells generates correlated movements that suppress the differential displacements required for selection to act. Such mechanical screening of fitness differences allows the mutants to leave more descendants than expected under non-mechanical models, thereby increasing their chance for evolutionary rescue [2, 5]. Our work suggests that mechanical interactions generally influence evolutionary outcomes in crowded cellular populations, which has to be considered when modeling drug resistance or cancer evolution [1, 22, 34, 30, 36, 42].",

    "abstract": "Platelets are anucleate and mostly ribosome-free cells within the bloodstream, derived from megakaryocytes within bone marrow and crucial for cessation of bleeding at sites of injury. Inherited thrombocytopenias are a group of disorders characterized by alow platelet count and are frequently associated with excessive bleeding. SLFN14 is one of the most recently discovered genes linked to inherited thrombocytopenia where several heterozygous missense mutations in SLFN14 were identified to cause defective megakaryocyte maturation and platelet dysfunction. Yet, SLFN14 was recently described as a ribosome-associated protein resulting in rRNA and ribosome-bound mRNA degradation in rabbit reticulocytes. To unveil the cellular function of SLFN14 and the link between SLFN14 and thrombocytopenia, we examined SLFN14 (WT/mutants) in in vitro models. Here, we show that all SLFN14 variants co-localize with ribosomes and mediate rRNA endonucleolytic degradation and ribosome clearance. Compare dto SLFN14 WT, expression of mutants is dramatically reduced as a result of post-translational degradation due to partial misfolding of the protein. Moreover, all SLFN14 variants tend to form oligomers. These findings could explain the dominant negative effect of heterozygous mutation on SLFN14 expression in patients platelets. Overall we suggest that SLFN14 could be involved in ribosome degradation during platelet formation and maturation.",

    "abstract": "In female Octopus maya the reproductive success has well-defined thermal limits; beyond which, spawning, number of eggs, fecundity, and the viability of the embryos are reduced. Observations of wild male O. maya suggest that temperatures below 27{degrees}C favour their reproductive performance. From these observations we hypothesize that, as in females, the temperature modulates the reproductive performance of adult O. maya males. The study was directed to evaluate the physiological condition, reproductive success, and histological damage in testis of male O. maya exposed to thermal stress, to determine the implications of ocean warming over their reproductive performance. High temperatures (28-30{degrees}C) negatively affect the growth and health of male O. maya. In octopuses maintained at 30{degrees}C, as a consequence of the thermal stress we observed an increment in the haemocytes number, a reduction in the oxygen consumption rate, and an inflammatory process in the testis. The number of spermatozoa per spermatophore was not affected by temperature, but higher spermatophores production was observed at 30{degrees}C. The paternity analysis showed that the offspring had multiple paternity with an average of 10 males contributing in a single spawn. The paternal contribution was affected by temperature with high, medium, or no paternal contribution in animals maintained at 24{degrees}C (control group), 28{degrees}C, and 30{degrees}C, respectively. The temperatures from 28{degrees}C to 30{degrees}C deeply affected the reproductive performance of Octopus maya males.",

    "abstract": "Soils contain microbial inhabitants that differ in sensitivity to anthropogenic modification. Soil reclamation relies on monitoring these communities to evaluate ecosystem functions recovery post-disturbance. DNA metabarcoding and soil enzyme assays provide information about microbial functional guilds and organic matter decomposition activities respectively. However bacterial communities, fungal communities, and enzyme activities may not be equally informative for monitoring reclaimed soils. We compared effects of disturbance regimes applied to forest soils on fungal community composition, bacterial community composition, and potential hydrolase activities (N-acetyl-{beta}-D-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase, and cellobiohydrolase) at two times (14 days and 5 months post-disturbance) and depths (LFH versus mineral soil). Using disturbance versus control comparisons allowed us to identify genus-level disturbance-indicators and shifts in hydrolase activity levels. We observed declines in disturbed LFH fungal biomass (ergosterol) and declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance across all disturbed samples, which prompted us to consider necromass-induced (fungal, root) saprotroph increases as disturbance indicators. Fungal community composition strongly shifted away from ecotmycorrhizal dominance to saprotroph dominance (i.e. increased Mortierella, and Umbelopsis) in disturbed plots at 5 months, while bacterial community composition did not shift to distinguish control plots from disturbed ones at either sampling time. Soil potential hydrolase data mainly indicated that mixing LFH material into mineral soil increases the measured activity levels compared to control and replaced mineral soil. Bacterial saprotrophs previously associated with mycelial necromass were detected across multiple regimes as disturbance indicators at 14 days post-disturbance. Our results confirm that ectomycorrhizal fungal genera are sensitive and persistently impacted by soil physical disturbances. Increases in saprotrophic bacterial genera are detectable 14 days pot-disturbance but only a few persist as disturbance indicators after several months. Potential hydrolase activities appear to be most useful for detecting the transfer of decomposition hotspots into mineral soils.",

    "abstract": "An explosion of high-throughput DNA sequencing in the past decade has led to a surge of interest in population-scale inference with whole-genome data. Recent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methods for relatively simple model classes, and few scalable general-purpose inference techniques exist for more realistic, complex models. To achieve this, two inferential challenges need to be addressed: (1) population data are exchangeable, calling for methods that efficiently exploit the symmetries of the data, and (2) computing likelihoods is intractable as it requires integrating over a set of correlated, extremely high-dimensional latent variables. These challenges are traditionally tackled by likelihood-free methods that use scientific simulators to generate datasets and reduce them to hand-designed, permutation-invariant summary statistics, often leading to inaccurate inference. In this work, we develop an exchangeable neural network that performs summary statistic-free, likelihood-free inference. Our frame-work can be applied in a black-box fashion across a variety of simulation-based tasks, both within and outside biology. We demonstrate the power of our approach on the recombination hotspot testing problem, outperforming the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "The ecological success of social insects is based on division of labour, not only between queens and workers, but also among workers. Whether a worker tends the brood or forages is strongly influenced by age, fertility and nutritional status, with brood carers being younger, more fecund and corpulent. Here, we experimentally disentangle behaviour from age and fertility in Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers and analyse how these parameters are linked to whole-body gene expression. Our transcriptome analysis reveals four times more genes associated with behaviour than with age and only few fertility-associated genes. Brood carers exhibited an upregulation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, whereas foragers invested in metabolism. Additional simulations revealed that the experimental disassociation of co-varying factors reduces transcriptomic noise, potentially explaining discrepancies between transcriptomic studies on worker behaviour in other social insects. Our study highlights the influence of nutritional status on task choice in ant workers.",

    "abstract": "Plant viral diseases are one of the major limitations in legume production within sub Saharan Africa (SSA), as they account for up to 100 % in production losses within smallholder farms. In this study, field surveys were conducted in the western highlands of Kenya with viral symptomatic leaf samples collected. Subsequently, next-generation sequencing was carried out. The main aim was to gain insights into the selection pressure and evolutionary relationships of Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) and Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV), within symptomatic common beans and cowpeas. Eleven near complete genomes of BCMNV and two for CABMV sequences were obtained from SSA. Bayesian phylogenomic analysis and tests for differential selection pressure within sites and across tree branches of the viral genomes was carried out. Three distinct well-supported clades were identified across the whole genome tree, and were in agreement with individual gene trees. Selection pressure analysis within sites and across phylogenetic branches suggested both viruses were evolving independently, but under strong purifying selection, with a slow evolutionary rate. These findings provide valuable insights on the evolution of BCMNV and CABMV genomes and their relationship to other viral genomes globally. These results will contribute greatly to the knowledge gap surrounding the phylogenomic relationship of these viruses, particularly for CABMV, for which there are few genome sequences available, and support the current breeding efforts towards resistance for BCMNV and CABMV.",

Genome-wide ancient DNA studies indicate predominantly Anatolian ancestry for continental Neolithic farmers, but also variable admixture with local Mesolithic hunter-gatherers1-9. Neolithic cultures first appear in Britain c. 6000 years ago (kBP), a millennium after they appear in adjacent areas of northwestern continental Europe. However, the pattern and process of the British Neolithic transition remains unclear10-15. We assembled genome-wide data from six Mesolithic and 67 Neolithic individuals found in Britain, dating from 10.5-4.5 kBP, a dataset that includes 22 newly reported individuals and the first genomic data from British Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Our analyses reveals persistent genetic affinities between Mesolithic British and Western European hunter-gatherers over a period spanning Britains separation from continental Europe. We find overwhelming support for agriculture being introduced by incoming continental farmers, with small and geographically structured levels of additional hunter-gatherer introgression. We find genetic affinity between British and Iberian Neolithic populations indicating that British Neolithic people derived much of their ancestry from Anatolian farmers who originally followed the Mediterranean route of dispersal and likely entered Britain from northwestern mainland Europe.",

    "abstract": "Spines, or modified hairs, have evolved multiple times in mammals, particularly in rodents. In this study, we investigated the evolution of spines in six rodent families. We first measured and compared the morphology and physical properties of hairs between paired spiny and non-spiny sister lineages. We found two distinct hair morphologies had repeatedly evolved in spiny rodents: hairs with a grooved cross-section and a second near cylindrical form. Compared to the ancestral elliptical-shaped hairs, spiny hairs had higher tension and stiffness, and overall, hairs with similar morphology had similar functional properties. To examine the genetic basis of this convergent evolution, we tested whether a single amino acid change (V370A) in the Ecdysoplasin A receptor (Edar) gene is associated with spiny hair, as this substitution causes thicker and straighter hair in East Asian human populations. We found that most mammals have the common amino acid valine at position 370, but two species, the kangaroo rat (non-spiny) and spiny pocket mouse (spiny), have an isoleucine. Importantly, none of the variants we identified are associated with differences in rodent hair morphology. Thus, the specific Edar mutation associated with variation in human hair does not seem to play a role in modifying hairs in wild rodents, suggesting that different mutations in Edar and/or other genes are responsible for variation in the spiny hair phenotypes we observed within rodents.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and comprehensive characterization of genetic variation is essential for deciphering the genetic basis of diseases and other phenotypes. A vast amount of genetic variation stems from large-scale sequence changes arising from the duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation of sequences. In the past 10 years, high-throughput short reads have greatly expanded our ability to assay sequence variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, a recent de novo assembly of a second Drosophila melanogaster reference genome has revealed that short read genotyping methods miss hundreds of structural variants, including those affecting phenotypes. While genomes assembled using high-coverage long reads can achieve high levels of contiguity and completeness, concerns about cost, errors, and low yield have limited widespread adoption of such sequencing approaches. Here we resequenced the reference strain of D. melanogaster (ISO1) on a single Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cell run for 24 hours. Using only reads longer than 1 kb or with at least 30x coverage, we assembled a highly contiguous de novo genome. The addition of inexpensive paired reads and subsequent scaffolding using an optical map technology achieved an assembly with completeness and contiguity comparable to the D. melanogaster reference assembly. Comparison of our assembly to the reference assembly of ISO1 uncovered a number of structural variants (SVs), including novel LTR transposable element insertions and duplications affecting genes with developmental, behavioral, and metabolic functions. Collectively, these SVs provide a snapshot of the dynamics of genome evolution. Furthermore, our assembly and comparison to the D. melanogaster reference genome demonstrates that high-quality de novo assembly of reference genomes and comprehensive variant discovery using such assemblies are now possible by a single lab for under $1,000 (USD).",

A further analysis revealed over 10 Mb of sequences absent from the human GRCh38 reference in each individual. Around 6 Mb of these novel sequences (NS) are shared with a Chinese personal genome. The NS are highly repetitive, have elevated GC-content and are primarily located in centromeric or telomeric regions. A BLAST search showed that 31% of the NS are different from any sequences deposited in nucleotide databases. The remaining NS correspond to human (62%) or primate (6%) nucleotide entries, while 1% of hits show the highest similarity to other species, including mouse and a few different classes of parasitic worms. Up to 1 Mb of NS can be assigned to chromosome Y, and large segments are missing from GRCh38 also at chromosomes 14, 17 and 21. Inclusion of these novel sequences into the GRCh38 reference radically improves the alignment and variant calling of whole-genome sequencing data at several genomic loci.

In addition, about 10,000 false positive SNV calls per individual were removed from the GRCh38 autosomes and sex chromosomes in the re-analysis, with some of them located in protein coding regions.",

This study aims to determine FMTs effectiveness in subjects with and without IBD, its impact on IBD activity, the level of microbiome engraftment, and predictors of CDI recurrence.\\n\\nMethodsSubjects with and without IBD who underwent FMT for recurrent or refractory CDI between 2013 and 2016 at The Mount Sinai Hospital were followed for up to 6 months.

    "abstract": "The Cape Verde islands are part of the African Sahelian arid belt that possesses an irregular rainy season between August and October. This erratic rain pattern has prompted the need for water reservoirs, now critical for the countrys sustainability. Worldwide, freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in frequency due to global climate change and eutrophication of water bodies, particularly in reservoirs. To date there have been no risk assessments of cyanobacterial toxin production in these man-made structures. We evaluated this potential risk using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and full metagenome sequencing in freshwater reservoirs of Cape Verde.\\n\\nOur analysis revealed the presence of several potentially toxic cyanobacterial genera in all sampled reservoirs (Poilao, Saquinho and Faveta). In Faveta Microcystis sp., a genus well known for toxin production and bloom-formation, dominated our samples, while a green algae of the genus Cryptomonas and Gammaproteobacteria dominated Saquinho and Poilao.\\n\\nTaking advantage of the dominance of Microcystis in the Faveta reservoir, we were able to reconstruct and assemble its genome, extracted from a metagenome of bulk DNA from Faveta water. We named it Microcystis cf. aeruginosa CV01, for which a phylogenetic analysis revealed to have a close relationship with other genomes from those taxa, as well as other continental African strains, suggesting geographical coherency. In addition, it revealed several clusters of known toxin-producing genes. This assessment of Cape Verdean freshwater microbial diversity and potential for toxin production reinforces the need to better understand the microbial ecology as a whole of water reservoirs on the rise.",

    "abstract": "Much our understanding of the activity of anthrax toxin is based on in-vitro systems, which delineate the interaction between B. anthracis toxins and the cell surface. These systems however, fail to account for the intimate association of B. anthracis with the circulatory system, including the contribution of serum proteins to the host response and processing of anthrax toxins. Using variety immunologic techniques to inhibit serum processing of B. anthracis Protective Antigen (PA) along with mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrate that serum digests PA via 2 distinct reactions. In the first reaction, serum cleaves PA83 into 2 fragments to produce PA63 and PA20 fragments, similar to that observed following furin digestion. This is followed by carboxypeptidase-mediated removal of the carboxy-terminal arginine and lysine residues from PA20.",

    "abstract": "Multifunctional human transcriptional positive co-activator 4 (PC4) is a bonafide non-histone component of the chromatin and plays a pivotal role in the process of chromatin compaction and functional genome organization. Knockdown of PC4 expression leads to a drastic open conformation of the chromatin and thereby altered nuclear architecture, defects in chromosome segregation and changed epigenetic landscape. Interestingly, these defects do not induce cellular death but result in enhanced cellular proliferation possibly through enhanced autophagic activity. PC4 depletion confers significant resistance to gamma irradiation. Exposure to gamma irradiation further induced autophagy in these cells. Inhibition of autophagy by small molecule inhibitors as well as by silencing of a critical autophagy gene drastically reduces the survivability PC4 knockdown cells. On the contrary, complementation with wild type PC4 could reverse this phenomenon, confirming the process of autophagy as the key mechanism for radiation resistance in absence of PC4. These data connect the unexplored role of chromatin architecture in regulating autophagy during a stress condition such as radiation.",

    "abstract": "Prior experience shapes sensory perception by enabling the formation of expectations with regards to the occurrence of upcoming sensory events. Especially in the visual modality, an increasing number of studies show that prediction-related neural signals carry feature-specific information about the stimulus. This is less established in the auditory modality, in particular without bottom-up signals driving neural activity. We studied whether auditory predictions are sharply tuned to even carry tonotopic specific information. For this purpose, we conducted a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment in which participants passively listened to sound sequences that varied in their regularity (i.e. entropy). Sound presentations were temporally predictable (3 Hz rate), but were occasionally omitted. Training classifiers on the random (high entropy) sound sequence and applying them to all conditions in a time-generalized manner, allowed us to assess whether and how carrier frequency specific information in the MEG signal is modulated according to the entropy level. We show that especially in an ordered (most predictable) sensory context neural activity during the anticipatory and omission periods contains carrier-frequency specific information. Overall our results illustrate in the human auditory system that prediction-related neural activity can be tuned in a tonotopically specific manner.",

We thus imaged experience-dependent long-term changes in spatial representations at the cellular level in the CA1 deep sublayer in mice learning to navigate in a virtual-reality environment. The maps were highly dynamic but gradually stabilized as over-representations for motivational (reward) and environmental (landmark) salience emerged in different time courses by selective consolidation of relevant spatial representations. Relocation of the reward extensively reorganized pre-formed maps by a mechanism involving rapid recruitment of cells from the previous location followed by their re-stabilization, indicating that a subset of neurons encode reward-related information. The distinct properties of these CA1 cells may provide a substrate by which salient experience forms lasting and adaptable memory traces.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of episodic memory is the phenomenon of mentally re-experiencing the details of past events, and a well-established concept is that the neuronal activity that mediates encoding is reinstated at retrieval. Evidence for reinstatement has come from multiple modalities, including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). These EEG studies have shed light on the time-course of reinstatement, but have been limited to distinguishing between a few categories and/or limited measures of memory strength. The goal of this work was to investigate whether recently developed experimental and technical approaches, namely an inverted encoding model applied to alpha oscillatory power in conjunction with sensitive tests of memory retrieval in a continuous space, can track and reconstruct memory retrieval of specific spatial locations. In Experiment 1, we establish that an inverted encoding model applied to multivariate alpha topography can track retrieval of precise spatial memories. In Experiment 2, we demonstrate that the pattern of multivariate alpha activity at study is similar to the pattern observed during retrieval. Finally, we observe that these encoding models predict memory retrieval behavior, including the accuracy and latency of recall. These findings highlight the broad potential for using encoding models to characterize long-term memory retrieval.",

Despite efforts within the field to address issues related to rigor and reproducibility, information about the RDM-related practices and perceptions of neuroimaging researchers remains largely anecdotal. To inform such efforts, we conducted an online survey of active MRI researchers that covered a range of RDM-related topics. Survey questions addressed the type(s) of data collected, tools used for data storage, organization, and analysis, and the degree to which practices are defined and standardized within a research group. Our results demonstrate that neuroimaging data is acquired in multifarious forms, transformed and analyzed using a wide variety of software tools, and that RDM practices and perceptions vary considerably both within and between research groups, with trainees reporting less consistency than faculty. Ratings of the maturity of RDM practices from ad-hoc to refined were relatively high during the data collection and analysis phases of a project and significantly lower during the data sharing phase. Perceptions of emerging practices including open access publishing and preregistration were largely positive, but demonstrated little adoption into current practice.",

In a recent study, we performed three distinct behavioral assays providing evidence that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans orients to earth-strength magnetic fields (Vidal-Gadea et al., 2015). In addition to these behavioral assays, we found that magnetic orientation in C. elegans depends on the AFD sensory neurons and conducted subsequent physiological experiments showing that AFD neurons respond to earth-strength magnetic fields. A new behavioral study by Landler et al. (2017) suggested that C. elegans does not orient to magnetic fields and raises issues that cast doubt on our study. Here we reanalyze Lander et al.s data to show how they appear to have missed observing positive results, and we highlight differences in experimental methods and interpretations that may explain our different results and conclusions. Moreover, we present new data from our labs together with replication by an independent lab to show how temporal and spatial factors influence the unique spatiotemporal trajectory that worms make during magnetotaxis. Together, these findings provide guidance on how to achieve robust magnetotaxis and reinforce our original finding that C. elegans is a suitable model system to study magnetoreception.",

Despite recent progress, the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for this dynamic system-level integration remain poorly understood. Here, we used multi-task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to examine the spatiotemporal architecture of cognition in the human brain. By investigating the spatial, dynamic and molecular signatures of system-wide neural activity across a range of cognitive tasks, we show that large-scale neuronal activity converges onto a low dimensional manifold that facilitates the dynamic execution of diverse task states. Flow within this attractor space is associated with dissociable cognitive functions, and with unique patterns of network-level topology and information processing complexity. The axes of the low-dimensional neurocognitive architecture align with regional differences in the density of neuromodulatory receptors, which in turn relate to distinct signatures of network controllability estimated from the structural connectome. These results advance our understanding of functional brain organization by emphasizing the interface between low dimensional neural activity, network topology, neuromodulatory systems and cognitive function.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA diverse set of neuromodulators facilitates the formation of a dynamic, low-dimensional integrative core in the brain that is recruited by diverse cognitive demands",

    "abstract": "Dyslexia is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects reading abilities and is predicted to be caused by a significant genetic component. Very few genetic susceptibility factors have been identified so far and amongst those, KIAA0319 is a key candidate. KIAA0319 is highly expressed during brain development but its function remains poorly understood. Initial RNA-interference studies in rats suggested a role in neuronal migration whereas subsequent work with double knock-out mouse models for both Kiaa0319 and its paralogue Kiaa0319-like reported effects in the auditory system but not in neuronal migration. To further understand the role of KIAA0319 during neurodevelopment, we carried out an expression study of the zebrafish orthologue at different embryonic stages. We report particularly high gene expression during the first few hours of development. At later stages, expression becomes localised in well-defined structures such as the eyes, the telencephalon and the notochord, supporting a role for kiaa0319 that is not restricted to brain development. Surprisingly, kiaa0319-like, which generally shows a similar expression pattern, was not expressed in the notochord suggesting a role specific to kiaa0319 in this structure. This study contributes to our understanding of KIAA0319 function during embryonic development which might involve additional roles in the visual system and in the notochord. Such a specific spatiotemporal expression pattern is likely to be under the controlled of tightly regulated sequences. Therefore, these data provide a framework to interpret the effects of the dyslexia-associated genetic variants that reside in KIAA0319 non-coding regulatory regions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the functional conservation of programmed cell death (PCD) across broad evolutionary distances, an understanding of the molecular machinery underpinning this fundamental program in plants remains largely elusive. This is despite its critical importance to development, homeostasis, and proper responses to stress. Progress in plant PCD has been hindered by the fact that many core regulators of animal PCD are absent in plant genomes. Remarkably, numerous studies have shown that the ectopic expression of animal anti-PCD genes in plants can suppress cell death imposed by many stresses. In this study, we capitalize on the ectopic expression of an insect inhibitor of apoptosis (SfIAP) to identify novel cell death regulators in plants. A yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted using SfIAP as bait to screen a tomato cDNA library. This screen identified several transcription factors of the SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein (SBP) family as potential SfIAP binding partners. We confirmed this interaction in vivo for our top two interactors, SlySBP8b and SlySBP12a, using coimmunoprecipitation. Interestingly, overexpression of SlySBP8b and SlySBP12a induced spontaneous cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Overexpression of these two transcription factors also induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and enhanced the growth of the necrotrophic pathogen Alternaria alternata. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the nuclear localization of both SlySBP8b and SlySBP12a, while SlySBP12a was also localized to the ER membrane. These results support a pro-death role for SlySBP8b and SlySBP12a and provide potential targets that can be utilized to improve stress tolerance in crop plants.\\n\\nHighlightsSBP transcription factors SlySBP8b and SlySBP12a from tomato interact with an insect inhibitor of apoptosis protein (SfIAP).

    "abstract": "We assessed temperature influence on flowering by incorporating temperature-responsive flowering mechanisms across developmental age into an existing model. Temperature influences both the leaf production rate and expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a photoperiodic flowering regulator, in leaves. The Arabidopsis Framework Model incorporated temperature influence on leaf growth but ignored the consequences of leaf growth on and direct temperature influence of FT expression. We measured FT production in differently aged leaves and modified the model, adding the mechanistic temperature influence on FT transcription, and linking FT to leaf growth. Our simulations suggest that in long days, the developmental timing (leaf number) at which the reproductive transition occurs is influenced by day length and temperature through FT, while temperature influences the rate of leaf production and the time (in days) the transition occurs. Further, we demonstrated that FT is mainly produced in the first 10 leaves in the Columbia ecotype, and that FT accumulation alone cannot explain flowering in conditions in which flowering is delayed. Our simulations supported our hypotheses that: 1) temperature regulation of FT, accumulated with leaf growth, is a component of thermal time, and 2) incorporating mechanistic temperature regulation of FT can improve model predictions in fluctuating temperatures.",

In addition to several population-averaged data, the model quantitatively recovers how growth fluctuations in single cells change across nutrient conditions. We develop a framework to analyse stochastic chemical reactions coupled with cell divisions and use it to identify sources of growth heterogeneity. By visualising cross-correlations we then determine how such initial fluctuations propagate to growth rate and affect other cell processes. We further study antibiotic responses and find that complex drug-nutrient interactions can both enhance and suppress heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "Birth-death-movement processes, modulated by interactions between individuals, are fundamental to many cell biology processes. A key feature of the movement of cells within in vivo environments are the interactions between motile cells and stationary obstacles. Here we propose a multi-species model of individual-level motility, proliferation and death. This model is a spatial birth-death-movement stochastic process, a class of individual-based model (IBM) that is amenable to mathematical analysis. We present the IBM in a general multi-species framework, and then focus on the case of a population of motile, proliferative agents in an environment populated by stationary, non-proliferative obstacles. To analyse the IBM, we derive a system of spatial moment equations governing the evolution of the density of agents and the density of pairs of agents. This approach avoids making the usual mean-field assumption so that our models can be used to study the formation of spatial structure, such as clustering and aggregation, and to understand how spatial structure influences population-level outcomes. Overall the spatial moment model provides a reasonably accurate prediction of the system dynamics, including important effects such as how varying the properties of the obstacles leads to different spatial patterns in the population of agents.",
