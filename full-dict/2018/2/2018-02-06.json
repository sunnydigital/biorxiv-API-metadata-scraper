    "abstract": "We aim to investigate the application of polygenic risk scoring within a family context. Polygenic risk profiles could aid in unraveling the role that common variation confers on disease risk within a pedigree that would have traditionally been viewed through the prism of monogenic inheritance only. We illustrate our discussion by analyzing polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder in a large pedigree (n~260) in which 30% of family members suffer from major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. We apply polygenic risk scores to study patterns of assortative mating and anticipation, whereby it appears increased polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders is contributed by affected individuals who married into the family, resulting in an increasing genetic risk over generations in the family. This may explain the observation of anticipation in mood disorders, whereby onset is earlier and the severity of a disease increases over the generations of a family. Joint analyses of both rare and common variation may be the most powerful way to understand the familial genetics of mood and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Microbes may maximize the number of daughter cells per time or per amount of nutrients consumed. These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in E. coli, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhen cells compete for nutrients, those that grow faster and produce more offspring per time are favored by natural selection. In contrast, when cells need to maximize the cell number at a limited nutrient supply, fast growth does not matter and an efficient use of nutrients (i.e. high biomass yield) is essential. This raises a basic question about metabolism: can cells achieve high growth rates and yields simultaneously, or is there a conflict between the two goals? Using a new modeling method called Enzymatic Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM), we predict cellular growth rates and find that growth rate/yield trade-offs and the ensuing preference for enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways are not universal, but depend on growth conditions such as external glucose and oxygen concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The long-term stability of microbiomes is crucial as the persistent occurrence of beneficial microbes and their associated functions ensure host health and well-being. Microbiomes are highly diverse and dynamic, making them challenging to understand. Because many natural systems work as temporal networks, we present an approach that allows identifying meaningful ecological patterns within complex microbiomes: the dynamic core microbiome. On the basis of six marine sponge species sampled monthly over three years, we study the structure, dynamics and stability of their microbiomes. What emerge for each microbiome is a negative relationship between temporal variability and mean abundance. The notion of the dynamic core microbiome allowed us to determine a relevant functional attribute of the microbiome: temporal stability is not determined by the diversity of a hosts microbial assemblages, but rather by the density of those microbes that conform its core microbiome. The core microbial interaction network consisted of complementary members interacting weakly with dominance of comensal and amensal interactions that suggests self-regulation as a key determinant of the temporal stability of the microbiome. These interactions have likely coevolved to maintain host functionality and fitness over ecological, and even evolutionary time scales.",

    "abstract": "The structural logic that define the functions of gene regulatory RNA molecules may be radically different from classic models of allostery, but the relevant structural correlations have remained elusive in even intensively studied RNA model systems. Here, we present a four-dimensional expansion of chemical mapping called lock-mutate-map-rescue (LM2R), which integrates multiple layers of mutation with nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping. This technique resolves the core mechanism of the adenine-responsive V. vulnificus add riboswitch including its gene expression platform, a paradigmatic system for which both Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) conformational selection models and non-MWC alternatives have been proposed. To discriminate amongst these models, we locked each functionally important helix through designed mutations and assessed formation or depletion of other helices via high-throughput compensatory rescue experiments. These LM2R measurements give strong support to the pre-existing correlations predicted by MWC models, disfavor alternative models, and reveal new structural heterogeneities that may be general across ligand-free riboswitches.",

    "abstract": "Introns can be extraordinarily large and they account for the majority of the DNA sequence in human genes. However, little is known about their population patterns of structural variation and their functional implication. By combining the most extensive maps of CNVs in human populations, we have found that intronic losses are the most frequent copy number variants (CNVs) in protein-coding genes in human, with more than 12,986 intronic deletions, affecting 4,147 genes (including 1,154 essential genes and 1,638 disease-related genes). These intronic length variation results in dozens of genes showing extreme population variability in size, with 40 genes with 10 or more different sizes and up to 150 allelic sizes. Intronic losses are frequent in evolutionarily ancient genes that are highly conserved at the protein sequence level. This result contrasts with losses overlapping exons, which are observed less often than expected by chance and almost exclusively affect primate-specific genes. An integrated analysis of CNVs and RNA-seq data showed that intronic loss can be associated with significant differences in gene expression levels in the population (CNV-eQTLs). These intronic CNV-eQTLs regions are enriched for intronic enhancers and can be associated with expression differences of other genes showing long distance intron-promoter 3D interactions. Our data suggests that intronic structural variation of protein-coding genes can exert an important role in maintaining the variability of gene expression and splicing in human populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMost human genes have introns that have to be removed after a gene is transcribed from DNA to RNA because they not encode information to translate RNA into proteins. As mutations in introns do not affect protein sequences, they are usually ignored when looking for normal or pathogenic genomic variation. However, introns comprise about half of the human non-coding genome and they can have important regulatory roles. We show that deletions of intronic regions appear more frequent than previously expected in the healthy population, with a significant proportion of genes with evolutionary ancient and essential functions carrying them. This finding was very surprising, as ancient genes tend to have high conservation of their coding sequence. However, we show that deletions of their non-coding intronic sequence can produce considerable changes in their locus length. We found that a significant number of these intronic deletions are associated with under- or over-expression of the affected genes or distant genes interacting in 3D. Our data suggests that the frequent gene length variation in protein-coding genes resulting from intronic CNVs might influence their regulation in different individuals.",

    "abstract": "In a recent development of the PORCN-WNT inhibitor ETC-1922159 for colorectal cancer, a list of down-regulated genes were recorded in a time buffer after the administration of the drug. The regulation of the genes were recorded individually but it is still not known which higher ([&ge;] 2) order interactions might be playing a greater role after the administration of the drug. In order to reveal the priority of these higher order interactions among the down-regulated genes or the likely unknown biological hypotheses, a search engine was developed based on the sensitivity indices of the higher order interactions that were ranked using a support vector ranking algorithm and sorted. For example, LGR family (Wnt signal enhancer) is known to neutralize RNF43 (Wnt inhibitor). After the administration of ETC-1922159 it was found that using HSIC (and rbf, linear and laplace variants of kernel) the rankings of the interaction between LGR5-RNF43 were 61, 114 and 85 respectively. Rankings for LGR6-RNF43 were 1652, 939 and 805 respectively. The down-regulation of LGR family after the drug treatment is evident in these rankings as it takes bottom priorities for LGR5-RNF43 interaction. The LGR6-RNF43 takes higher ranking than LGR5-RNF43, indicating that it might not be playing a greater role as LGR5 during the Wnt enhancing signals. These rankings confirm the efficacy of the proposed search engine design. Conclusion: Prioritized unknown biological hypothesis form the basis of further wet lab tests with the aim to reduce the cost of (1) wet lab experiments (2) combinatorial search and (3) lower the testing time for biologist who search for influential interactions in a vast combinatorial search forest. From in silico perspective, a framework for a search engine now exists which can generate rankings for nth order interactions in Wnt signaling pathway, thus revealing unknown/untested/unexplored biological hypotheses and aiding in understanding the mechanism of the pathway. The generic nature of the design can be applied to any signaling pathway or phenomena under investigation where a prioritized order of interactions among the involved factors need to be investigated for deeper understanding. Future improvements of the design are bound to facilitate medical specialists/oncologists in their respective investigations.\\n\\nSignificanceRecent development of PORCN-WNT inhibitor enantiomer ETC-1922159 cancer drug show promise in suppressing some types of colorectal cancer. However, the search and wet lab testing of unknown/unexplored/untested biological hypotheses in the form of combinations of various intra/ extracellular factors/genes/proteins affected by ETC-1922159 is not known. Currently, a major problem in biology is to cherry pick the combinations based on expert advice, literature survey or guesses to investigate a particular combinatorial hypothesis. A search engine has be developed to reveal and prioritise these unknown/untested/unexplored combinations affected by the inhibitor. These ranked unknown biological hypotheses facilitate in narrowing down the investigation in a vast combinatorial search forest of ETC-1922159 affected synergistic-factors.",

    "abstract": "As predicted by the notion that sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by entrapment of sister DNAs inside cohesin rings, there is a perfect correlation between co-entrapment of circular minichromosomes and sister chromatid cohesion in a large variety of mutants. In most cells where cohesin loads onto chromosomes but fails to form cohesion, loading is accompanied by entrapment of individual DNAs. However, cohesin with a hinge domain whose positively charged lumen has been neutralized not only loads onto and translocates along chromatin but also organizes it into chromatid-like threads, despite largely failing to entrap DNAs inside its ring. Thus, cohesin engages chromatin in a non-topological as well as a topological manner. Our finding that hinge mutations, but not fusions between Smc and kleisin subunits, abolish entrapment suggests that DNAs may enter cohesin rings through hinge opening. Lastly, mutation of three highly conserved lysine residues inside the Smc1 moiety of Smc1/3 hinges abolishes all loading without affecting cohesins initial recruitment to CEN loading sites or its ability to hydrolyze ATP. We suggest that loading and translocation are mediated by conformational changes in cohesins hinge driven by cycles of ATP hydrolysis.",

Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.",

Recent work has shown that the remodeling acto-myosin network modifies local membrane organization, but the molecular details are only partly understood due to difficulties with experimentally accessing the relevant time and length scales. Here, we use interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy to investigate a minimal acto-myosin network linked to a supported lipid bilayer membrane. Using the magnitude of the interferometric contrast, which is proportional to molecular mass, and fast acquisition rates, we detect, and image individual membrane attached actin filaments diffusing within the acto-myosin network and follow individual myosin II filament dynamics. We quantify myosin II filament dwell times and processivity as a function of ATP concentration, providing evidence for the predicted ensemble behavior of myosin head domains. Our results show how decreasing ATP concentrations lead to both increasing dwell times of individual myosin II filaments and a global change from a remodeling to a contractile state of the acto-myosin network.\n\nStatement of SignificanceHere, we show that interferometric scattering microscopy in combination with single particle tracking enables label-free, high contrast imaging of filament dynamics on surfaces, while distinguishing different species based on their mass.

However, little is known about the impact of attention during pre-sleep memory encoding on later memory performance. The current study aimed to address the question of whether attentional state prior to encoding, as indexed by alpha oscillatory activity, modulates the consolidation of images across periods of sleep and wake. 22 participants aged 18 - 41 years (mean age = 27.3) viewed 120 emotionally valenced images (positive, negative, neutral) before a 2hr afternoon sleep opportunity and an equivalent period of wake. Following the sleep and wake conditions, participants were required to distinguish between 120 previously seen (target) images and 120 new (distractor) images. Relative alpha power - adjusted according to participants individual alpha frequency - was computed to index attentional state prior to the learning phase. Generalised linear mixed-effects modelling revealed memory performance was modulated by attention, such that greater pre-encoding alpha power preferentially promoted memory consolidation during wake compared to sleep. There was no difference in memory performance between positive, negative and neutral stimuli. Modulations in alpha oscillatory activity may help to coordinate the flow of information between task-relevant cortical regions and a thalamo-cortical loop that preferentially subserves the formation of memory during times of wake relative to sleep.",

Inland terrestrial cyanolichens from Austria were also analysed as for the marine lichens to examine further the impact of habitat/lichen species on the associated bacterial communities.

The strictly marine lichens were dominated by the Bacteroidetes phylum accounting for 50% of the sequences, whereas Alphaproteobacteria, notably Sphingomonas, dominated the maritime and the inland terrestrial lichens. Bacterial communities associated with the two Lichina species were significantly different sharing only 33 core OTUs, half of which were affiliated to the Bacteroidetes genera Rubricoccus, Tunicatimonas and Lewinella, suggesting an important role of these species in the marine Lichina lichen symbiosis. Marine cyanolichens showed a higher abundance of OTUs likely affiliated to moderately thermophilic and/or radiation resistant bacteria belonging to the Phyla Chloroflexi, Thermi, and the families Rhodothermaceae and Rubrobacteraceae when compared to those of inland terrestrial lichens.

    "abstract": "Little is known about the phylogenetic variation of avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance in hot environments. We quantified thermoregulatory responses to high air temperature (Ta) in ~100-g representatives of three orders: African cuckoo (Cuculus gularis, Cuculiformes), lilac-breasted roller (Coracias caudatus, Coraciiformes), and Burchells starling (Lamprotornis australis, Passeriformes). All three species initiated respiratory mechanisms to increase evaporative heat dissipation when body temperature (Tb) approached 41.5{degrees}C in response to increasing Ta, with gular flutter observed in cuckoos and panting in rollers and starlings. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) increased by quantitatively similar magnitudes in all three species, although maximum rates of EWL were proportionately lower in starlings. Evaporative cooling efficiency [defined as the ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP)] generally remained below 2.0 in cuckoos and starlings, but reached a maximum of ~3.5 in rollers. The high value for rollers reveals a very efficient evaporative cooling mechanism, and is similar to EHL/MHP maxima for similarly sized columbids which very effectively dissipate heat via cutaneous evaporation. This unexpected phylogenetic variation among the orders tested in the physiological mechanisms of heat dissipation is an important step toward determining the evolution of heat tolerance traits in desert birds.\\n\\nSummary statementWe show that avian evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance display substantial taxonomic variation that are, unexpectedly, not systematically related to the use of panting versus gular flutter processes.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of RNA structure from nucleotide sequence remains an unsolved grand challenge of biochemistry and requires distinct concepts from protein structure prediction. Despite extensive algorithmic development in recent years, modeling of noncanonical base pairs of new RNA structural motifs has not been achieved in blind challenges. We report herein a stepwise Monte Carlo (SWM) method with a unique add-and-delete move set that enables predictions of noncanonical base pairs of complex RNA structures. A benchmark of 82 diverse motifs establishes the methods general ability to recover noncanonical pairs ab initio, including multistrand motifs that have been refractory to prior approaches. In a blind challenge, SWM models predicted nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping and compensatory mutagenesis experiments for three in vitro selected tetraloop/receptors with previously unsolved structures (C7.2, C7.10, and R1). As a final test, SWM blindly and correctly predicted all noncanonical pairs of a Zika virus double pseudoknot during a recent community-wide RNA-puzzle. Stepwise structure formation, as encoded in the SWM method, enables modeling of noncanonical RNA structure in a variety of previously intractable problems.",

Available implementations, however, are usually optimized for a particular task and difficult to reuse. To enable researchers to utilize these networks more easily we implemented pysster, a Python package for training CNNs on biological sequence data. Sequences are classified by learning sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize learned motifs along with information about their positional and class enrichment. The package runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU and provides a simple interface to train and evaluate a network with a handful lines of code. Using an RNA A-to-I editing data set and CLIP-seq binding site sequences we demonstrate that pysster classifies sequences with higher accuracy than other methods and is able to recover known sequence and structure motifs.\\n\\nAvailabilitypysster is freely available at https://github.com/budach/pysster.\\n\\nContactbudach@molgen.mpg.de, marsico@molgen.mpg.de",

    "abstract": "Shifts of attention within mental representations based on retroactive cues (retro-cues) facilitate performance in working memory tasks. It was suggested that this retro-cue benefit is related to the concentration of working memory resources on a subset of representations, thereby improving storage and retrieval at the cost of non-cued items. However, the attentional mechanisms underlying this updating of working memory representations remain unknown. Here, we present EEG data for distinguishing between target enhancement and distractor suppression processes in the context of retroactive attentional orienting. Therefore, we used a working memory paradigm with retro-cues indicating a shift of attention to either a lateralized or non-lateralized item. There was an increase of posterior alpha power contralateral compared to ipsilateral to the irrelevant item when a non-lateralized mental representation was cued and a contralateral suppression of posterior alpha power when a lateralized item had to be selected. This suggests that both inhibition of the non-cued information and enhancement of the target representation are important features of attentional orienting within working memory. By further presenting cues to either remember or to forget a working memory representation, we give a first impression of these retroactive attentional sub-processes as two separable cognitive mechanisms.",

In simplifying the contact process, we ignore the heterogeneities in host movements that complicate the real world, and overlook their impact on spatiotemporal patterns of disease burden. Movement ecology offers a set of tools that help unpack the transmission process, letting researchers more accurately model how animals within a population interact and spread pathogens. Analytical techniques from this growing field can also help expose the reverse process: how infection impacts movement behaviors, and therefore other ecological processes like feeding, reproduction, and dispersal. Here, we synthesize the contributions of movement ecology in disease research, with a particular focus on studies that have successfully used movement-based methods to quantify individual heterogeneity in exposure and transmission risk. Throughout, we highlight the rapid growth of both disease and movement ecology, and comment on promising but unexplored avenues for research at their overlap. Ultimately, we suggest, including movement empowers ecologists to pose new questions expanding our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics, and improving our predictive capacity for wildlife and even human diseases.",

Here, we describe a holistic mechanism that integrates cortical actomyosin dynamics with apical matrix remodeling to pattern C. elegans cuticles. Therein, axial AFBs appear near the surface of lateral epidermal syncytia during an interval of transverse apical constriction (AC). AC gives rise to three temporary semi-circular cellular protrusions beneath a provisional matrix (sheath). In turn, sheath components pattern durable ridges along the midline of adult cuticles (alae). We propose that forces generated by AC are relayed via the sheath to sculpt the the acellular adult cuticle manifest several hours later. Furthermore, we provide evidence that circumferential actin filament bundles (CFBs) near the surface of the adjacent syncytia (hyp7) are largely dispensable for the propagation of annular cuticle structures from one larval stage to the next. Rather, the temporary CFBs extend from actin bundles overlying body wall muscles, which are situated between Ce. hemidesmosomes. Similar mechanisms may contribute to the morphogenesis of integumentary organs in higher metazoans.",

    "abstract": "Consumer genomics enables genetic discovery on an unprecedented scale by linking very large databases of personal genomic data with phenotype information voluntarily submitted via web-based surveys1. These databases are having a transformative effect on human genomic research, yielding insights on increasingly complex traits, behaviors, and disease by including many thousands of individuals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)2, 3. The promise of consumer genomic data is not limited to human research, however. Genomic tools for dogs are readily available, with hundreds of causal Mendelian variants already characterized4-6, because selection and breeding have led to dramatic phenotypic diversity underlain by a simple genetic structure7, 8. Here, we report the results of the first consumer genomics study ever conducted in a non-human model: a GWAS of blue eyes based on more than 3,000 customer dogs with a validation panel of nearly 3,000 more, the largest canine GWAS to date. We discovered a novel association with blue eyes on chromosome 18 (P = 1x10-65) and used both sequence coverage and microarray probe intensity data to identify the putative causal variant: a 98.6-kb duplication directly upstream of the hox gene ALX4, which plays an important role in mammalian eye development9, 10. This duplication was largely restricted to Siberian Huskies and is highly, but not completely, penetrant. These results underscore the power of consumer-data-driven discovery in nonhuman species, especially dogs, where there is intense owner interest in the personal genomic information of their pets, a high level of engagement with web-based surveys, and an underlying genetic architecture ideal for mapping studies.",

    "abstract": "Amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) has been recently proposed as a possible solution to overcome the pronounced stimulation artifact encountered when recording brain activity during tACS. In theory, AM-tACS does not entail power at its modulating frequency, thus avoiding the problem of spectral overlap between brain signal of interest and stimulation artifact. However, the current study demonstrates how weak non-linear transfer characteristics inherent in stimulation and recording hardware can reintroduce spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency. The input-output transfer functions (TFs) of different stimulation setups were measured. The setups included basic recordings of signal-generator and stimulator outputs as well as M/EEG phantom measurements. 6th-degree polynomial regression models were fitted to model the input-output TFs of each setup. The resulting TF models were applied to digitally generated AM-tACS signals to predict the location of spurious artifacts in the spectrum. All four setups measured for the study exhibited low-frequency artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics when recording AM-tACS. Fitted TF models showed non-linear contributions significantly different from zero (all p < .05) and successfully predicted the frequency of artifacts observed in AM-signal recordings. Results suggest that even weak non-linearities of stimulation and recording hardware can lead to spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics. Thus, findings emphasize the need for more linear stimulation devices for AM-tACS and careful analysis procedures, which take into account these low-frequency artifacts to avoid confusion with effects of AM-tACS on the brain.",

Here we demonstrate in Jurkat T cells and HEK293 cells that TMEM16F activation triggers large-scale surface membrane expansion in parallel with lipid scrambling. Following TMEM16F mediated scrambling and surface expansion, cells undergo extensive membrane shedding. The membrane compartment that expands the cell surface does not involve endoplasmic reticulum or acidified lysosomes. Surprisingly, T cells lacking TMEM16F expression not only fail to expand surface membrane, but instead rapidly internalize membrane via massive endocytosis (MEND). The T cell co-receptor PD-1 is selectively shed when TMEM16F triggers membrane expansion, while it is selectively internalized in the absence of TMEM16F. Its participation in this trafficking is determined by its single transmembrane domain. Thus, we establish a fundamental role for TMEM16F as a regulator of Ca2+-activated membrane trafficking.",

We investigate here whether natural eye movements during joystick-based navigation of wheel-chairs follow identifiable patterns that are predictive of joystick actions. To place eye movements in context with driving intentions, we combine our eye tracking with a 3D depth camera system, which allows us to identify which eye movements have the floor as gaze target and distinguish them from other non-navigation related eye movements. We find consistent patterns of eye movements on the floor predictive of steering commands issued by the driver in all subjects. Based on this empirical data we developed two gaze decoders using supervised machine learning techniques and enabled each of these drivers to then steer the wheelchair by imagining they were using a joystick to trigger appropriate natural eye movements via motor imagery. We show that all subjects are able to navigate their wheelchair \\\"by eye\\\" learning it within a short time span of minutes. Our work shows that simple gaze-based decoding without need for artificial user interfaces suffices to restore mobility and increasing participation in daily life.",

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a preferred organism for industrial use but has natively a very poor capacity of TAG production and storage. Here, we engineered S. cerevisiae for accumulation of high TAG levels through the use of structural and physiological factors that influence assembly and biogenesis of lipid droplets. First, human and fungal perilipin genes were expressed, increasing TAG content by up to 36% when expressing the human perilipin gene PLIN3. Secondly, expression of the FIT2 homologue YFT2 resulted in a 26% increase in TAG content. Lastly, the genes ERD1 and PMR1 were deleted in order to induce an ER stress response and stimulate lipid droplet formation, increasing TAG content by 72% for {Delta}erd1, with an additive effect for both YFT2 and PLIN3 expression. These new approaches were implemented in previously engineered strains that carry high flux of fatty acid biosynthesis and conversion of acyl-CoA into TAG, resulting in improvements of up to 138% over those high-producing strains without any substantial growth effects or abnormal cell morphology. We find that these approaches are not only a major advancement in engineering S. cerevisiae for TAG production, but also highlight the importance of lipid droplet dynamics for high lipid accumulation in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number, has been linked to aging and age-associated diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Supported by direct live-cell imaging of young, middle-aged and old-aged primary human dermal fibroblasts, we found that aneuploidy increases with aging due to general dysfunction of the mitotic machinery. Increased chromosome segregation defects in elderly mitotic cells correlated with an early senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and repression of Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1), the transcription factor that drives expression of most G2/M genes. By restoring FoxM1 levels in elderly and Hutchison-Gilford Progeria Syndrome fibroblasts we prevented aneuploidy and, importantly, ameliorated cellular phenotypes associated with aging. Moreover, senescent fibroblasts isolated from elderly donors cultures were mostly aneuploid, suggesting that aneuploidy is a key player in the progression into full senescence phenotypes. Based on this feedback loop between cellular aging and aneuploidy, we propose modulation of mitotic efficiency through FoxM1 as a potential strategy against aging and progeria syndromes.",

However, the circularity of these putative RNA circles has not been experimentally validated due to limited methodologies currently available. We reported here that the template-switching capability of commonly used reverse transcriptases (e.g., SuperScript II) leads to the formation of artificial junction sequences, and consequently misclassification of large linear RNAs as RNA circles. Use of reverse transcriptases without terminal transferase activity (e.g., MonsterScript) for cDNA synthesis is critical for the identification of physiological circular RNAs. We also report two methods, MonsterScript junction PCR and high-resolution melting curve analyses, which can reliably distinguish circular RNAs from their linear forms and thus, can be used to discover and validate true circular RNAs.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe vast majority of circular RNAs were identified through computational detection of junction sequences in the deep sequencing reads because these unique fusion sequences represent back-splicing events. We found that artificial junction sequences could be formed through template switching (TS) when MMLV-derived reverse transcriptases, e.g., SuperScript II, are used to synthesize cDNAs. Thus, many of the reported circular RNAs may not be RNA circles, but rather experimental artifacts.

Specifically, processes during wheat leaf, flower and seed development and photosynthesis, which all contribute to the yield of this crop, are affected by high temperature. While this has to some extent been investigated on physiological, developmental and molecular levels, very little is known about early signalling events associated with an increase in temperature. Phosphorylation-mediated signalling mechanisms, which are quick and dynamic, are associated with plant growth and development, also under abiotic stress conditions. Therefore, we probed the impact of a short-term increase in temperature on the wheat leaf and spikelet phosphoproteome. The resulting data set provides the scientific community with a first large-scale plant phosphoproteome under the control of higher ambient temperature, which will be valuable for future studies. Our analyses also revealed a core set of common proteins between leaf and spikelet, suggesting some level of conserved regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, we observed temperature-regulated interconversion of phosphoforms, which likely impacts protein activity.",

Adaptive stimulus selection methods seek to select stimuli that are maximally informative about the PF given data observed so far in an experiment and thereby reduce the number of trials required to estimate the PF. Here we develop new adaptive stimulus selection methods for flexible PF models in tasks with two or more alternatives. We model the PF with a multinomial logistic regression mixture model that incorporates realistic aspects of psychophysical behavior, including lapses and multiple alternatives for the response. We propose an information-theoretic criterion for stimulus selection and develop computationally efficient methods for inference and stimulus selection based on semi-adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We apply these methods to data from macaque monkeys performing a multi-alternative motion discrimination task, and show in simulated experiments that our method can achieve a substantial speed-up over random designs. These advances will reduce the data needed to build accurate models of multi-alternative PFs and can be extended to high-dimensional PFs that would be infeasible to characterize with standard methods.",

    "abstract": "Detection of copy number variation (CNVs) is a challenging but highly valuable application of exome and targeted high throughput sequencing (HTS) data. While there are dozens of CNV detection methods available, using these methods remains challenging due to variable accuracy both across different data sets and within the same data set with different methods. We propose that extracting good results from CNV detection on HTS data requires a systematic approach involving rigorous quality control, adjustment of method parameters and calibration of confidence measures for filtering results. We present Ximmer, a tool which supports an end to end process for applying these procedures including a simulation framework, CNV detection analysis pipeline, and a visualisation and curation tool which enables interactive exploration of CNV results. We apply Ximmer to perform a comprehensive evaluation of CNV detection on four data sets using four different detection methods, representing one of the most comprehensive evaluations to date. Ximmer is open source and freely available at http://ximmer.org (example results are viewable at http://example.ximmer.org).",

    "abstract": "Learning algorithms have been proposed as a non-selective mechanism capable of creating complex adaptive systems in life. Evolutionary learning however has not been demonstrated to be a plausible cause for the origin of a specific molecular system. Here we show that genetic codes as optimal as the Standard Genetic Code (SGC) emerge readily by following a molecular analog of the Hebbs rule (\\\"neurons fire together, wire together\\\"). Specifically, error-minimizing genetic codes are obtained by maximizing the number of physio-chemically similar amino acids assigned to evolutionarily similar codons. Formulating genetic code as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with amino acids as \\\"cities\\\" and codons as \\\"tour positions\\\" and implemented with a Hopfield neural network, the unsupervised learning algorithm efficiently finds an abundance of genetic codes that are more error-minimizing than SGC. Drawing evidence from molecular phylogenies of contemporary tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, we show that co-diversification between gene sequences and gene functions, which cumulatively captures functional differences with sequence differences and creates a genomic \\\"memory\\\" of the living environment, provides the biological basis for the Hebbian learning algorithm. Like the Hebbs rule, the locally acting phylogenetic learning rule, which may simply be stated as increasing phylogenetic divergence for increasing functional difference, could lead to complex and robust life systems. Natural selection, while essential for maintaining gene function, is not necessary to act at system levels. For molecular systems that are self-organizing through phylogenetic learning, the TSP model and its Hopfield network solution offer a promising framework for simulating emerging behavior, forecasting evolutionary trajectories, and designing optimal synthetic systems.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria produce a variety of surface-exposed polysaccharides important for cell integrity, biofilm formation, and evasion of the host immune response. Synthesis of these polymers often involves the assembly of monomer oligosaccharide units on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl-phosphate at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. For many polymers, including cell wall peptidoglycan, the lipid-linked precursors must be transported across the membrane by flippases to facilitate polymerization at the membrane surface. Flippase activity for this class of polysaccharides is most often attributed to MOP (Multidrug/Oligosaccharidyllipid/Polysaccharide) family proteins. Little is known about how this ubiquitous class of transporters identifies and translocates its cognate precursor over the many different types of lipid-linked oligosaccharides produced by a given bacterial cell. To investigate the specificity determinants of MOP proteins, we selected for variants of the WzxC flippase involved in Escherichia coli capsule (colanic acid) synthesis that can substitute for the essential MurJ MOP-family protein and promote transport of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors. Variants with substitutions predicted to destabilize the inward-open conformation of WzxC lost substrate specificity and supported both capsule and peptidoglycan synthesis. Our results thus suggest that specific substrate recognition by a MOP transporter normally destabilizes the inward-open state, promoting transition to the outward-open conformation and concomitant substrate translocation. Furthermore, the ability of WzxC variants to suppress MurJ inactivation provides strong support for the designation of MurJ as the flippase for peptidoglycan precursors, the identity of which has been controversial.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEFrom cell walls in bacteria to protein glycosylation in eukaryotes, surface exposed polysaccharides are built on polyprenol-phosphate lipid carriers. Monomer units are typically assembled at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane and require translocation to the cell surface for polymerization/assembly. MOP-family proteins are a major class of transporters associated with this flippase activity. Despite their ubiquity and importance for cell surface biology, little is known about their transport mechanism. Here, we investigated substrate recognition by MOP transporters in bacteria. We present evidence that transport proceeds via destabilization of the inward-open state of the transporter by specific substrate binding thereby promoting a transition to the outward-open state and substrate release on the opposite face of the membrane.",

By applying this novel method to a perceptual template-matching task, we tracked representational brain states associated with the cascade of neural processing, from early sensory areas to higher-order areas that are involved in integration and decision-making. We address a major limitation of the traditional decoding approach: that it relies on consistent timing of these processes over trials. Using a temporally unconstrained decoding analysis approach, we found that the timing of the cognitive processes involved in perceptual judgements can vary considerably over trials. This revealed that the sequence of processing states was consistent for all subjects and trials, even when the timing of these states varied. Furthermore, we found that the specific timing of states on each trial was related to the quality of performance over trials.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of brain pH is a critical homeostatic process and changes in brain pH modulate various ion channels and receptors and thus neuronal excitability. Tissue acidosis, resulting from hypoxia or hypercapnia, can activate various proteins and ion channels, among which acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) a family of primarily Na+ permeable ion channels, which alongside classical excitotoxicity causes neuronal death. Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are long-lived, fossorial, eusocial rodents that display remarkable behavioral/cellular hypoxia and hypercapnia resistance. In the central nervous system, ASIC subunit expression is similar between mouse and NMR with the exception of much lower expression of ASIC4 throughout the NMR brain. However, ASIC function and neuronal sensitivity to sustained acidosis has not been examined in the NMR brain. Here, we show with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of cultured NMR and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons that NMR neurons have smaller voltage-gated Na+ channel currents and more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. We further demonstrate that acid-mediated currents in NMR neurons are of smaller magnitude than in mouse, and that all currents in both species are fully blocked by the ASIC antagonist benzamil. We further demonstrate that NMR neurons show greater resistance to acid-induced cell death than mouse neurons. In summary, NMR neurons show significant cellular resistance to acidotoxicity compared to mouse neurons, contributing factors likely to be smaller ASIC-mediated currents and reduced NaV activity.\\n\\nAbbreviationsASIC, acid-sensing ion channel; CNS, central nervous system; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; NaV, voltage-gated Na+ channel; NMR, naked mole-rat; TTX, tetrodotoxin",

Yet, whether individuals differ consistently in their foraging success across environments, and which individual and population-level traits might drive such differences, is largely unknown. We addressed this question in a field experiment, conducting over 1,100 foraging trials with nine subpopulations of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, translocating them across environments in the wild. A-priori, we determined the individual social phenotypes. We show that individuals consistently differed in reaching food, but not control, patches across environments. Social individuals reached more food patches than less social ones and males reached more food patches than females. Overall, individuals were, however, more likely to join females at patches than males, which explains why individuals in subpopulations with relatively more females reached, on average, more food patches. Our results provide rare evidence for individual differences in foraging success across environments, driven by individual and population level (sex ratio) traits.",

Specifically, we integrate differential expression of each gene and mutual information of gene pairs in a Bayesian framework and use Metropolis sampling to identify functional interactions. During the sampling process, a conditional probability is calculated given a randomly selected gene to control the network state transition. Our method provides global statistics of all genes and their interactions, and finally achieves a global optimal sub-network. We apply MSIGNET to simulated data and have demonstrated its superior performance over comparable network identification tools. Using a validated Parkinson data set we show that the network identified using MSIGNET is consistent to previously reported results but provides more biology meaningful interpretation of Parkinsons disease. Finally, to study networks related to ovarian cancer recurrence, we investigate two patient data sets. Identified networks from independent data sets show functional consistence. And those common genes and interactions are well supported by current biological knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges.\\n\\nTherefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package landsepi, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters.\\n\\nThis article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus Puccinia. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThere are many recent examples which demonstrate the evolutionary potential of plant pathogens to overcome the resistances deployed in agricultural landscapes to protect our crops. Increasingly, it is recognised that how resistance is deployed spatially and temporally can impact on rates of pathogen evolution and resistance breakdown. Such deployment strategies are mainly based on the combination of several sources of resistance at different spatiotemporal scales. However, comparison of these strategies in a predictive sense is not an easy task, owing to the logistical difficulties associated with experiments involving the spread of a pathogen at large spatio-temporal scales. Moreover, both the durability of a strategy and the epidemiological protection it provides to crops must be assessed since these evaluation criteria are not necessarily correlated. Surprisingly, no current simulation model allows a thorough comparison of the different options. Here we describe a spatio-temporal model able to simulate a wide range of deployment strategies and resistance sources. This model, implemented in the R package landsepi, facilitates assessment of both epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes across simulated scenarios. In this work, the model is used to investigate the combination of different sources of resistance against fungal diseases such as rusts of cereal crops.",

Here we present the taxonomic identification of BSHs in human microbiota and elucidate the abundance and activity differences of various bacterial BSHs among 11 different populations. For the first time, we have revealed BSH are distributed in 154 intestinal bacterial strains within 33 genera in human microbiota. However, these BSHs present obviously differentiation for the sequence identity being from 28.6% to 100%, and the 32.7% bacteria strains having more than one paralogs of BSHs with dissimilarity. Therefore, we reclassified the BSHs from the different genera into 6 phylotypes basing on their phylogenetic tree, and demonstrate the significant abundance patterns of BSH phylotypes among different populations. From the enzyme activity comparison, the representative sequence of BSH-T3 was shown highest enzyme activity in 6 phylotypes. Meanwhile, BSH-T3 sequences which all distributed in Lactobacillus show highest abundance in Chinese and Austrian. The information illustrated by this study is useful for investigating the population differences of bile acid metabolism related diseases, and further giving a new suggestion on selection of probiotics or development of pharmaceutical proteins based upon the activity of BSH phylotypes to regulate host metabolism and maintain fitness.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that memories about experienced stimuli are represented by groups of highly interconnected neurons called cell assemblies. This requires allocating and storing information in the neural circuitry, which happens through synaptic weight adaptation. It remains, however, largely unknown how memory allocation and storage can be achieved and coordinated to allow for a faithful representation of multiple memories without disruptive interference between them. In this theoretical study, we show that the interplay between conventional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling organizes synaptic weight adaptations such that a new stimulus forms a new memory and where different stimuli are assigned to distinct cell assemblies. The resulting dynamics can reproduce experimental in-vivo data, focusing on how diverse factors as neuronal excitability and network connectivity, influence memory formation. Thus, the here presented model suggests that a few fundamental synaptic mechanisms may suffice to implement memory allocation and storage in neural circuitry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSince their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10-12Hz), and followed by fast spindles (12-16Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (n=10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (n=3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TB) centered at 5-8Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage N2 compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are  downstates, periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and  spindles, oscillations at about twelve times a second lasting for about a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave:  theta bursts, a brief oscillation at about six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the human scalp, that theta bursts precede, and spindles follow downstates. Theta bursts may help trigger downstates in some circumstances, and organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is an age-related detrimental dementia. Amyloid beta peptides (A{beta}) play a crucial role in the pathology of AD. In familial AD, A{beta} is generated from the full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) via dysregulated proteolytic processing. However, A{beta} biogenesis in case of sporadic AD remains so far elusive. circRNAs are a class of transcripts, which are preferentially expressed in brain. Here, we identified a circRNA (circA{beta}-a) derived from the A{beta}-coding region of the APP gene. circA{beta}-a is expressed in brains of AD and nondementia controls. With the aid of our recently established approach for analysis of circRNA functions, we demonstrated that circA{beta}-a is efficiently translated into a novel A{beta}-related A{beta}175 protein in living cells. Importantly, A{beta}175 was further processed to A{beta} peptides, the hallmark of AD. In summary, our analysis revealed alternative route of A{beta} biogenesis. circA{beta}-a and its corresponding protein might represent novel therapeutic targets for AD treatment.",

Individualization has practical implications in clinical setting, where subtle differences between patients are often decisive for the success of an intervention, yet there has been no suitable animal model to study its underlying biological mechanisms. Here we show that enriched environment (ENR) can serve as a model of brain individualization. We kept 40 isogenic mice for 3 months in ENR and compared the effects on a wide range of phenotypes on both mean and variance to an equally sized group of standard-housed control animals. While ENR influenced multiple parameters and restructured correlation patterns between them, it only increased differences among individuals in traits related to brain and behavior (adult hippocampal neurogenesis, motor cortex thickness, open field and object exploration, rotarod performance), in agreement with the hypothesis of a specific activity-dependent development of brain individuality.",

    "abstract": "Myoelectric prosthetic devices are commonly used to help upper limb amputees perform activities of daily living, however amputees still lack the sensory feedback required to facilitate reliable and precise control. Augmented feedback may play an important role in affecting both short-term performance, through real-time regulation, and long-term performance, through the development of stronger internal models. In this work, we investigate the potential tradeoff between controllers that enable better short-term performance and those that provide sufficient feedback to develop a strong internal model. We hypothesize that augmented feedback may be used to mitigate this tradeoff, ultimately improving both short and long-term control. We used psychometric measures to assess the internal model developed while using a filtered myoelectric controller with augmented audio feedback, imitating classification-based control but with augmented regression-based feedback. In addition, we evaluated the short-term performance using a multi degree-of-freedom constrained-time target acquisition task. Results obtained from 24 able-bodied subjects show that an augmented feedback control strategy using audio cues enables the development of a stronger internal model than the filtered control with filtered feedback, and significantly better path efficiency than both raw and filtered control strategies. These results suggest that the use of augmented feedback control strategies may improve both short-term and long-term performance.",

General linear mixed effect models have become the standard workhorse for statistical analysis of data from longitudinal study designs. However, analysis of longitudinal data can be complicated for both practical and theoretical reasons, including difficulties in modelling, correlated outcome values, functional (time-varying) covariates, nonlinear effects, and model inference.\\n\\nResultsWe present LonGP, an additive Gaussian process regression model for analysis of experimental data from longitudinal study designs. LonGP implements a flexible, non-parametric modelling framework that solves commonly faced challenges in longitudinal data analysis. In addition to inheriting all standard features of Gaussian processes, LonGP can model time-varying random effects and non-stationary signals, incorporate multiple kernel learning, and provide interpretable results for the effects of individual covariates and their interactions. We develop an accurate Bayesian inference and model selection method, and implement an efficient model search algorithm for our additive Gaussian process model. We demonstrate LonGPs performance and accuracy by analysing various simulated and real longitudinal -omics datasets.

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important modifier of human disease. Genetic variation in genes involved in the ER stress response has been linked to inter-individual differences in this response. However, the mechanisms and pathways by which genetic modifiers are acting on the ER stress response remain unclear. In this study, we characterize the role of the long chain fatty acid elongase Baldspot (ELOVL6) in modifying the ER stress response and disease. We demonstrate that loss of Baldspot rescues degeneration and reduces IRE1 and PERK signaling and cell death in a Drosophila model of retinitis pigmentosa and ER stress (Rh1G69D). Dietary supplementation of stearate bypasses the need for Baldspot activity. Finally, we demonstrate that Baldspot regulates the ER stress response across different tissues and induction methods. Our findings suggest that ELOVL6 is a promising target in the treatment of not only retinitis pigmentosa, but a number of different ER stress-related disorders.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDifferences in genetic background drives disease variability, even among individuals with identical, causative mutations. Identifying and understanding how genetic variation impacts disease expression could improve diagnosis and treatment of patients. Previous work has linked the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway to disease variability. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the ER stress response returns the cell to its normal state. Chronic ER stress leads to massive amounts of cell death and tissue degeneration. Limiting tissue loss by regulating the ER stress response has been a major focus of therapeutic development. In this study, we characterize a novel regulator of the ER stress response, the long chain fatty acid elongase Baldspot/ELOVL6. In the absence of this enzyme, cells undergoing ER stress display reduced cell death, and degeneration in a Drosophila disease model. Feeding of excess fatty acids increases degeneration to original disease levels, linking the regulatory activity of Baldspot to its enzymatic activity. Finally, we demonstrate that Baldspot can alter the ER stress response under a variety of other ER stress conditions. Our studies demonstrate that Baldspot/ELOVL6 is a ubiquitous regulator of the ER stress response and is a good candidate therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 5% of children, and persisting in 1% of adults. Promoting lasting fluency improvement in adults who stutter is a particular challenge. Novel interventions to improve outcomes are required, therefore. Previous work in patients with acquired motor and language disorders reported enhanced benefits of behavioural therapies when paired with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Here, we report the results of the first trial investigating whether tDCS can improve speech fluency in adults who stutter. Thirty adult men who stutter completed a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of anodal tDCS over left inferior frontal cortex. Fifteen men received 20 minutes of 1-mA tDCS on five consecutive days while speech fluency was temporarily induced using choral and metronome-timed speech. The other 15 men received the same speech fluency intervention with sham stimulation. We predicted that applying anodal tDCS to the left inferior frontal cortex during speech production with temporary fluency inducers would result in longer-lasting fluency improvements. Speech fluency during reading and conversation was assessed at baseline, before and after the stimulation on each day of the five-day intervention, and at 1 and 6 weeks after the end of the intervention. TDCS combined with speech fluency training significantly reduced the percentage of disfluent speech measured 1 week after the intervention compared with fluency intervention alone. At 6 weeks after the intervention, this improvement was maintained during reading but not during conversation. Outcome scores at both post-intervention time points on a clinical assessment tool (the Stuttering Severity Instrument - version 4) also showed significant improvement in the group receiving tDCS compared with the sham group, in whom fluency was unchanged from baseline. We conclude that tDCS combined with behavioural fluency intervention has the capacity to improve fluency in adults who stutter. tDCS thereby offers a potentially useful adjunct to future speech therapy interventions for this population, for whom therapy outcomes are currently limited.",

    "abstract": "In Hebbian plasticity, neural circuits adjust their synaptic weights depending on patterned firing of action potential on either side of the synapse. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is an experimental implementation of Hebbs postulate that relies on the precise order and the millisecond timing of the paired activities in pre- and postsynaptic neurons. In recent years, STDP has attracted considerable attention in computational and experimental neurosciences. However, canonical STDP is assessed with deterministic (constant) spike timings and time intervals between successive pairings, thus exhibiting a regularity that strongly differs from the biological variability. Hence, the emergence of STDP from noisy neural activity patterns as expected in in vivo-like firing remains unresolved. Here, we used noisy STDP stimulations where the spike timing and/or the interval between successive pairings were jittered. We explored with a combination of experimental neurophysiology and mathematical modeling, the impact of jittering on three distinct forms of STDP at corticostriatal synapses: NMDAR-mediated tLTP, endocannabinoid-mediated tLTD and endocannabinoid-mediated tLTP. As the main result, we found a differential sensitivity to jittered spike timing: NMDAR-tLTP was highly fragile whereas endocannabinoid-plasticity (tLTD and tLTP) appeared more resistant. Moreover, when the frequency or the number of pairings was increased, NMDAR-tLTP became more robust and could be expressed despite strong jittering of the spike timing. Taken together, our results identify endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity as a robust form of STDP while the sensitivity to jitter of NMDAR-tLTP varies with activity frequency. This provides new insights into the mechanisms at play during the different phases of learning and memory and the emergence of Hebbian plasticity in in vivo-like firing.",

Structural neuroimaging studies have indicated that these disorders can be related to differences in white matter integrity, although findings remain disparate. In this study, we used a unique design composed of individuals with dyslexia, dyscalculia, both disorders and controls, to systematically explore differences in fractional anisotropy across groups using diffusion tensor imaging. Specifically, we focused on the corona radiata and the arcuate fasciculus, two tracts associated with reading and mathematics in a number of previous studies. Using Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that the present data favor the null model of no differences between groups for these particular tracts--a finding that seems to go against the current view but might be representative of the disparities within this field of research. Together, these findings suggest that structural differences associated with dyslexia and dyscalculia might not be as reliable as previously thought, with potential ramifications in terms of remediation.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector borne-disease in the US. While the majority of the Lyme disease patients can be cured with 2-4 week antibiotic treatment, about 10-20% of patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms. While the cause of this condition is unclear, persistent infection was proposed as one possibility. It has recently been shown that B. burgdorferi develops dormant persisters in stationary phase cultures that are not killed by the current Lyme antibiotics, and there is interest to identify novel drug candidates that more effectively kill such forms. We previously evaluated 34 essential oils and identified some highly active candidates with excellent activity against biofilm and stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Here we screened another 35 essential oils and found 10 essential oils (garlic, allspice, cumin, palmarosa, myrrh, hedycheim, amyris, thyme white, litsea cubeba, lemon eucalyptus) and the active component of cinnamon bark cinnamaldehyde (CA) at a low concentration of 0.1% to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. At a very low 0.05% concentration, garlic, allspice, palmarosa and CA still exhibited strong activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi. CA also showed strong activity against replicating B. burgdorferi, with a MIC of 0.02% (or 0.2 g/mL). In subculture studies, the top 5 hits garlic, allspice, myrrh, hedycheim, and litsea cubeba completely eradicated all B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells at 0.1%, while palmarosa, lemon eucalyptus, amyris, cumin, and thyme white failed to do so as shown by visible spirochetal growth after 21-day subculture. At 0.05% concentration, only garlic essential oil and CA sterilized the B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture as shown by no regrowth during subculture, while allspice, myrrh, hedycheim and litsea cubeba all had visible growth during subculture. Future studies are needed to determine if these highly active essential oils could eradicate persistent B. burgdorferi infection in vivo.",
