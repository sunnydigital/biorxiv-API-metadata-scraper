    "abstract": "The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) has carried out extensive rodent toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) at frequencies and modulations used in the U.S. telecommunications industry. This report presents partial findings from these studies. The occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed to RFR, malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were considered of particular interest and are the subject of this report. The findings in this report were reviewed by expert peer reviewers selected by the NTP and National Institutes of Health (NIH). These reviews and responses to comments are included as appendices to this report, and revisions to the current document have incorporated and addressed these comments. When the studies are completed, they will undergo additional peer review before publication in full as part of the NTP's Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Technical Reports Series. No portion of this work has been submitted for publication in a scientific journal. Supplemental information in the form of four additional manuscripts has or will soon be submitted for publication. These manuscripts describe in detail the designs and performance of the RFR exposure system, the dosimetry of RFR exposures in rats and mice, the results to a series of pilot studies establishing the ability of the animals to thermoregulate during RFR exposures, and studies of DNA damage.

These studies found low incidences of malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart of male rats exposed to RFR of the two types [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)] currently used in U.S. wireless networks. Potentially preneoplastic lesions were also observed in the brain and heart of male rats exposed to RFR.\\n\\nThe review of partial study data in this report has been prompted by several factors. Given the widespread global usage of mobile communications among users of all ages, even a very small increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to RFR could have broad implications for public health. There is a high level of public and media interest regarding the safety of cell phone RFR and the specific results of these NTP studies. Lastly, the tumors in the brain and heart observed at low incidence in male rats exposed to GSM-and CDMA-modulated cell phone RFR in this study are of a type similar to tumors observed in some epidemiology studies of cell phone use. These findings appear to support the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic potential of RFR.2\\n\\nIt is important to note that this document reviews only the findings from the brain and heart and is not a complete report of all findings from the NTPs studies. Additional data from these studies in Hsd:Sprague Dawley(R) SD(R) (Harlan) rats and similar studies conducted in B6C3F1/N mice are currently under evaluation and will be reported together with the current findings in two forthcoming NTP Technical Reports.",

    "abstract": "Microbial methanogenesis may have been a major component of Earths carbon cycle during the Archaean Eon, generating a methane greenhouse that increased global temperatures enough for a liquid hydrosphere, despite the suns lower luminosity at the time. Evaluation of potential solutions to the \\\"faint young sun\\\" hypothesis by determining the age of microbial methanogenesis was limited by ambiguous geochemical evidence, and the absence of a diagnostic fossil record. To overcome these challenges, we utilize a temporal constraint: a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event from within archaeal methanogens to the ancestor of Cyanobacteria, one of the few microbial clades with recognized crown group fossils. Results of molecular clock analyses calibrated by this HGT-propagated constraint show methanogens diverging within Euryarchaeota no later than 3.51 Ga, with methanogenesis itself likely evolving earlier. This timing provides independent support for scenarios wherein microbial methane production was important in maintaining temperatures on the early Earth.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations in the human CaV2.1 gene CACNA1A cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). To characterize cellular problems potentially triggered by CaV2.1 gains of function, we engineered mutations encoding FHM1 amino-acid substitutions S218L (SL) and R192Q (RQ) into transgenes of Drosophila melanogaster CaV2/cacophony. We expressed the transgenes pan-neuronally. Phenotypes were mild for RQ-expressing animals. By contrast, single mutant SL- and complex allele RQ,SL-expressing animals showed overt phenotypes, including sharply decreased viability. By electrophysiology, SL- and RQ,SL-expressing neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) exhibited enhanced evoked discharges, supernumerary discharges, and an increase in the amplitudes and frequencies of spontaneous events. Some spontaneous events were gigantic (10-40 mV), multi-quantal events. Gigantic spontaneous events were eliminated by application of TTX - or by lowered or chelated Ca2+ - suggesting that gigantic events were elicited by spontaneous nerve firing. A follow-up genetic approach revealed that some neuronal hyperexcitability phenotypes were reversed after knockdown or mutation of Drosophila homologs of phospholipase C{beta} (PLC{beta}), IP3 receptor, or ryanodine receptor (RyR) - all factors known to mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological inhibitors of intracellular Ca2+ store release produced similar effects. Interestingly, however, the decreased viability phenotype was not reversed by genetic impairment of intracellular Ca2+ release factors. On a cellular level, our data suggest inhibition of signaling that triggers intracellular Ca2+ release could counteract hyperexcitability induced by gains of CaV2.1 function.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPrior research has demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations in a gene important for neurotransmission (CACNA1A) are known to cause migraine in humans. We attempted to mimic some of those gain-of-function mutations in a simple genetic model organism and to examine neurotransmission by electrophysiology. Our findings yield potential clues as to how particular migraine-causing mutations may impact neurophysiology on a cellular level. We used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and its model synapse, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to perform our studies. We document three main advances: 1) characterization of fruit fly models harboring gain-of-function calcium channel alterations known to cause human familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1); 2) characterization of hyperactive neurotransmission caused by one of these alterations; and 3) an ability to quell hyperactive neurotransmission by impairing intracellular Ca2+ store release, through both genetic and pharmacological means. Our work contributes to a broader understanding of how pathological mutations could impact cellular physiology. More generally, the utilization of genetic model organisms promises to uncover potential ways to reverse those impacts.",

    "abstract": "Extinction threatens many species, yet few factors predict this risk across the plant Tree of Life (ToL). Taxon age is one factor that may associate with extinction if occupancy of geographic and adaptive zones varies with time, but evidence for such an association has been equivocal. Age-dependent occupancy can also influence diversification rates and thus extinction risk where new taxa have small range and population sizes. Here we analysed 509 well-sampled genera from across the plant ToL. We found that a greater proportion of species were threatened by extinction in younger and faster-diversifying genera. Repeating our analyses in two large, well-sampled groups, we found that extinction risk increased with evolutionary age in conifer species but not palms. Potential range size decreased in older, non-threatened conifers more strongly than in threatened taxa, suggesting that range size dynamics may explain differing patterns of extinction risk across the ToL with consequences for biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLarge copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome are strongly associated with common neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Using Hi-C analysis of long-range chromosome interactions and ChIP-Seq analysis of regulatory histone marks we studied the epigenomic effects of the prominent large deletion CNV on chromosome 22q11.2 and also replicated a subset of the findings for the large deletion CNV on chromosome 1q21.1.\\n\\nResultsWe found that, in addition to local and global gene expression changes, there are pronounced and multilayered effects on chromatin states, chromosome folding and topological domains of the chromatin, that emanate from the large CNV locus. Regulatory histone marks are altered in the deletion proximal regions, and in opposing directions for activating and repressing marks. There are also significant changes of histone marks elsewhere along chromosome 22q and genome wide. Chromosome interaction patterns are weakened within the deletion boundaries and strengthened between the deletion proximal regions. We detected a change in the manner in which chromosome 22q folds onto itself, namely by increasing the long-range contacts between the telomeric end and the deletion proximal region. Further, the large CNV affects the topological domain that is spanning its genomic region. Finally, there is a widespread and complex effect on chromosome interactions genome-wide, i.e. involving all other autosomes, with some of the effect directly tied to the deletion region on 22q11.2.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings suggest novel principles of how such large genomic deletions can alter nuclear organization and affect genomic molecular activity.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

Hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with a well characterized internal complexity, but development of its distinct subregions in humans has remained poorly described. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large longitudinal sample (270 participants, 678 scans) using an automated segmentation tool and mixed models to delineate the development of hippocampal subregion volumes from childhood to adulthood. We also examined sex differences in subregion volumes and their development, and associations between hippocampal subregions and general cognitive ability. Nonlinear developmental trajectories with early volume increases were observed for subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA) 1, molecular layer (ML) and fimbria. In contrast, parasubiculum, presubiculum, CA2/3, CA4 and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG) showed linear volume decreases. No sex differences were found in hippocampal subregion development. Finally, general cognitive ability was positively associated with CA2/3 and CA4 volumes, as well as with ML development. In conclusion, hippocampal subregions appear to develop in diversified ways across adolescence, and specific subregions may link to general cognitive level.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIHippocampal subregions develop in differential ways from childhood to adulthood\\nC_LIO_LISubiculum, CA1, ML and fimbria showed nonlinear trajectories with initial increases\\nC_LIO_LIParasubiculum, presubiculum, CA2/3, CA4 and GC-DG showed linear volume decreases\\nC_LIO_LIThere were no sex differences in hippocampal subregion development\\nC_LIO_LIGeneral cognitive ability associated with CA2/3 and CA4 volumes and ML development\\nC_LI",

Because their structures are difficult to resolve, cxSVs have been largely excluded from genome analysis and population-scale association studies. To permit large-scale detection of cxSVs from paired-end whole-genome sequencing, we developed Automated Reconstruction of Complex Variants (ARC-SV) using a novel probabilistic algorithm and a machine learning approach that leverages the new Human Pangenome Reference Consortium diploid assemblies. Using ARC-SV, we resolved, across 4,262 human genomes spanning all continental super-populations, 8,493 cxSVs belonging to 12 subclasses. Some cxSVs with population-specific signatures are shared with Neanderthals. Overall cxSVs are significantly enriched in regions prone to recombination and germline de novo mutations. Many cxSVs mark phenotypic hotspots (each significantly associated with [&ge;] 20 traits) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and 46.4% of all significant GWAS-SNPs catalogued to date reside within {+/-}125 kb of at least one cxSV locus. Common SNPs near cxSVs show significant trait heritability enrichment. Genomic regions affected by cxSVs are enriched for bivalent chromatin states. Rare cxSVs are enriched in neural genes and loci undergoing rapid or accelerated evolution and recently evolved cis-regulatory regions for human corticogenesis. We also identified 41 fixed loci where divergence from our most recent common ancestor is via localized cxSV. Our method and analysis framework allow for the accurate, efficient, and automatic identification of cxSVs for future population-scale studies of human disease and genome biology.",

    "abstract": "Life on Earth was dominated by bacteria for billions of years1. About 600 million years ago, animal life emerged and micro-organisms played a crucial role in shaping animal development, physiology and evolution2-4. The two partners committed to a symbiotic relationship that persists in nearly all animals today. Such beneficial interactions are pervasive throughout nature and have been extensively characterized5,6. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that drive the emergence and evolution of the symbiont benefits to their animal hosts remain largely elusive. Here we show that the host nutritional environment, instead of the host, is a predominant driving force in this evolutionary process and we identify a mechanism resulting from the bacterial adaptation to the diet, which confers improved functional benefit to the host. By applying experimental evolution to a model of host-bacteria beneficial symbiosis: Drosophila melanogaster associated with Lactobacillus plantarum, one of its growth promoting symbiotic bacteria7,8, we found that the de novo mutations in the same acetate kinase (ackA) locus invariably emerge first, rapidly become fixed, and such evolution occurs with or without the host. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ackA mutations trigger the increased production of N-acetyl-glutamine, which is sufficient to confer improved host growth capabilities to the evolved bacterial strains. Our study therefore identifies a specific mechanism by which a symbiotic bacterium increases its benefit to its animal host and reveals that adaptation to the host diet is a foremost step in the determination of the evolutionary course of symbiosis between an animal and its gut microbes.",

    "abstract": "A user ready, portable, documented software package, NFTsim, is presented to facilitate numerical simulations of a wide range of brain systems using continuum neural field modeling. NFTsim enables users to simulate key aspects of brain activity at multiple scales. At the microscopic scale, it incorporates characteristics of local interactions between cells, neurotransmitter effects, synaptodendritic delays and feedbacks. At the mesoscopic scale, it incorporates information about medium to large scale axonal ranges of fibers, which are essential to model dissipative wave transmission and to produce synchronous oscillations and associated cross-correlation patterns as observed in local field potential recordings of active tissue. At the scale of the whole brain, NFTsim allows for the inclusion of long range pathways, such as thalamocortical projections, when generating macroscopic activity fields. The multiscale nature of the neural activity produced by NFTsim has the potential to enable the modeling of resulting quantities measurable via various neuroimaging techniques. In this work, we give a comprehensive description of the design and implementation of the software. Due to its modularity and flexibility, NFTsim enables the systematic study of an unlimited number of neural systems with multiple neural populations under a unified framework and allows for direct comparison with analytic and experimental predictions. The code is written in C++ and bundled with Matlab routines for a rapid quantitative analysis and visualization of the outputs. The output of NFTsim is stored in plain text file enabling users to select from a broad range of tools for offline analysis.

Dynein-2 comprises a heterodimer of two non-identical intermediate chains, WDR34 and WDR60. Here, we use knockout cell lines to demonstrate that each intermediate chain has a distinct role in cilia function. Both proteins are required to maintain a functional transition zone and for efficient bidirectional intraflagellar transport, only WDR34 is essential for axoneme extension. In contrast, only WDR60 is essential for co-assembly of the other subunits. Furthermore, WDR60 cannot compensate for loss of WDR34 or vice versa. This work defines a functional asymmetry to match the subunit asymmetry within the dynein-2 motor. Analysis of causative point mutations in WDR34 and WDR60 can partially restore function to knockout cells. Our data show that Jeune syndrome is caused by defects in transition zone architecture as well as intraflagellar transport.\\n\\nSUMMARYHere, Vuolo and colleagues use engineered knockout human cell lines to define roles for dynein-2 intermediate chains.

Dormant cuttings of Vitis vinifera, V. aestivalis, V. amurensis, and V. riparia were examined to determine the relationship between chilling requirement and temperature on rate of deacclimation (kdeacc). Differential thermal analysis was used to determine kdeacc using mean low temperature exotherms. Effect of chill was evaluated as the deacclimation potential ({psi}deacc), which was the change in kdeacc due to chill accumulation. Budbreak was also evaluated in fully chilled buds at different temperatures. Results indicate that {psi}deacc varies dependent on dormancy state, following a logarithmic response to chill accumulation. The effect of temperature on kdeacc was exponential at low and logarithmic at high temperatures. The combination of {psi}deacc and kdeacc resulted in good prediction of deacclimation. Budbreak phenology was also explained by differences in kdeacc. Deacclimation rates can be used as a quantitative determinant of dormancy transition and budbreak, and to refine models predicting effects of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia is the second-most prevalent mental disorder, with no sufficient treatment available. Despite a substantial role of genetic factors, only a handful of genes have been implicated and insight into the associated neurobiological pathways remains limited. Here, we use an unprecedented large genetic association sample (N=1,331,010) to allow detection of a substantial number of genetic variants and gain insight into biological functions, cell types and tissues involved in insomnia complaints. We identify 202 genome-wide significant loci implicating 956 genes through positional, eQTL and chromatin interaction mapping. We show involvement of the axonal part of neurons, of specific cortical and subcortical tissues, and of two specific cell-types in insomnia: striatal medium spiny neurons and hypothalamic neurons. These cell-types have been implicated previously in the regulation of reward processing, sleep and arousal in animal studies, but have never been genetically linked to insomnia in humans. We found weak genetic correlations with other sleep-related traits, but strong genetic correlations with psychiatric and metabolic traits. Mendelian randomization identified causal effects of insomnia on specific psychiatric and metabolic traits. Our findings reveal key brain areas and cells implicated in the neurobiology of insomnia and its related disorders, and provide novel targets for treatment.",

In a genomic screen of 331 unrelated Japanese patients, we identify a disruptive Alu insertion and a nonsense variant (p.Arg1933*) in the ciliary gene RP1, neither of which are rare alleles in Japan. p.Arg1933* is almost polymorphic (frequency = 0.6%, amongst 12,000 individuals), does not cause disease in homozygosis or heterozygosis, and yet is significantly enriched in HRD patients (frequency = 2.1%, i.e. a 3.5-fold enrichment; p-value = 9.2x10-5). Familial co-segregation and association analyses show that p.Arg1933* can act as a Mendelian mutation, in trans with the Alu insertion, but might also cause disease in association with two alleles in the EYS gene in a non-Mendelian pattern of heredity. Our results suggest that rare conditions such as HRDs can be paradoxically determined by relatively common variants, following a quasi-Mendelian model linking monogenic and complex inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Members of the KLF family of transcription factors can exert both positive and negative effects on axon regeneration in the central nervous system, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. KLF6 and -7 share nearly identical DNA binding domains and stand out as the only known growth-promoting family members. Here we confirm that similar to KLF7, expression of KLF6 declines during postnatal cortical development and that forced re-expression of KLF6 in corticospinal tract neurons of adult female mice enhances axon regeneration after cervical spinal injury. Unlike KLF7, however, these effects were achieved with wildtype KLF6, as opposed constitutively active mutants, thus simplifying the interpretation of mechanistic studies. To clarify the molecular basis of growth promotion, RNA sequencing identified 454 genes whose expression changed upon forced KLF6 expression in cortical neurons. Network analysis of these genes revealed sub-networks of downregulated genes that were highly enriched for synaptic functions, and sub-networks of upregulated genes with functions relevant to axon extension including cytoskeleton remodeling, lipid synthesis and transport, and bioenergetics. The promoter regions of KLF6-sensitive genes showed enrichment for the binding sequence of STAT3, a previously identified regeneration-associated gene. Notably, co-expression of constitutively active STAT3 along with KLF6 in cortical neurons produced synergistic increases in neurite length. Finally, genome-wide ATAC-seq footprinting detected frequent co-binding by the two factors in pro-growth gene networks, indicating co-occupancy as an underlying mechanism for the observed synergy. These findings advance understanding of KLF-stimulated axon growth and indicate functional synergy of KLF6 transcriptional effects with those of STAT3.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe failure of axon regeneration in the CNS limits recovery from damage and disease. These findings show the transcription factor KLF6 to be a potent promoter of axon growth after spinal injury, and more importantly clarify the underlying transcriptional changes. In addition, bioinformatics analysis predicted a functional interaction between KLF6 and a second transcription factor, STAT3, and genome-wide footprinting confirmed frequent co-occupancy. Co-expression of the two factors yielded synergistic elevation of neurite growth in primary neurons. These data point the way toward novel transcriptional interventions to promote CNS regeneration.",

We tested whether ancient Earth conditions (low O2, high Fe2+, high Mn2+) can revert the ribosome to a functional ancestral state. First, SHAPE (Selective 2 Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) was used to compare the effect of Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ on the tertiary structure of rRNA. Then, we used in vitro translation reactions to test whether Fe2+ or Mn2+ could mediate protein production, and quantified ribosomal metal content. We found that: (i) Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ had strikingly similar effects on rRNA folding; (ii) Fe2+ and Mn2+ can replace Mg2+ as the dominant divalent cation during translation of mRNA to functional protein; (iii) Fe and Mn associate extensively with the ribosome.

Systematic analyses on diverse known factors of HIV integration further validated the biological relevance of the prediction result. More importantly, in-depth analyses of the attention values output by DeepHINT revealed intriguing mechanistic implications in the selection of HIV integration sites, including potential roles of several basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and zinc-finger proteins.

    "abstract": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are valuable tools to estimate species distributions, but are vulnerable to biases in the probability of a species being observed. One such bias is habitat loss, which has affected a substantial and increasing proportion of the Earth. In regions of severe habitat loss, data on a species occurrence may represent a small, non-random subset of sites it once occupied. This could cause distorted reconstructions of species distributions, and misleading inferences of evolutionary and ecological processes. We present a statistical approach for quantifying the influence on SDMs of habitat loss, and generating distribution predictions that are robust to these biases. We explored some of the effects of accounting for habitat loss on inferences from common downstream biogeographic and ecological analysis methods.\\n\\nWe used herbarium record data to model the distribution of 325 plant species in the genera Banksia and Hakea across Australia, using point process models. We accounted for biases in the models by including a proxy variable representing habitat loss, and compared the fit of models without this variable to those with it. We explored the influence of habitat loss by mapping biodiversity patterns predicted with and without accounting for it.\\n\\nGenerally, accounting for habitat loss in SDMs led to increases in the mean area of modelled species distributions of ~10% for Banksia and ~12% for Hakea across Australia (in some cases, up to several 100,000 km2 increases in predicted range), with somewhat greater average increases (11% and 15%) for species in the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Accounting for habitat loss leads to an increase in predicted species richness (Alpha and Gamma diversity), but a decrease in compositional turnover (Beta diversity), across most of Australia. Accounting for habitat loss in SDMs had minimal influence on a downstream macroevolutionary analysis (Age-Range Correlation) that utilizes species distributions, seemingly because exposure to habitat loss did not show a phylogenetic pattern in this taxonomic group.\\n\\nThe influence of habitat loss on species distributions estimated with SDM is likely to be context-dependent and difficult to generalize, but will tend to cause underestimates of range sizes. This may have consequences for mapping spatial patterns of diversity and for some downstream analyses of biogeographic, evolutionary, or ecological processes, based on species distributions, as well as conservation measures that rely on accurate species mapping.",

While binocular summation of contrast signals affords the observer increased sensitivity, binocular summation of spatial cues related to changes in depth is associated with decreased sensitivity to the corresponding retinal image displacements. Perceptual models of contrast and motion-in-depth sensitivity have explained this divergence in sensitivity by proposing that probabilistic neural noise limits summing and differencing operations on small signals. Because these models do not scale well for highly suprathreshold visual signals typical of the natural environment, we approached the question of how dynamic binocular image differences are coded using direct neural measurements. Here we use Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials in human participants to show that inter-ocular differences in retinal image motion that produce elevated perceptual thresholds generate strongly suppressed evoked response amplitudes compared to motion that is matched between the two eyes. This suppression is strongly dependent on the availability of well-defined spatial references in the image and is highly immature in 5-month-old infants. Because the suppression is of equal strength for horizontal and vertical directions of motion, it is not specific to the perception of motion in depth. Relational image cues play a critical role in early to intermediate perceptual processing stages, and these results suggest that a succession of spatial and inter-ocular differencing operations condition the visual signal representation, prior to the extraction of motion-in-depth.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe present work underscores the importance of relational spatial cues in both the motion and disparity domains for binocular visual coding. Relative motion and relative disparity cues not only support fine-grain displacement sensitivity but strongly influence suprathreshold responsiveness. Extraction of these cues supports a powerful binocular interaction within the motion pathway that is suppressive in nature and poorly developed in infants. This suppressive interaction is present for both horizontal and vertical directions of motion and is thus not specific to motion-in-depth, as previously believed, but is rather hypothesized to be a pre-processing step, with motion-in-depth being computed at a later or separate stage.",

    "abstract": "Molecular competition is ubiquitous, essential and multifunctional throughout diverse biological processes. Competition brings about trade-offs of shared limited resources among the cellular components, and it thus introduce a hidden layer of regulatory mechanism by connecting components even without direct physical interactions. By abstracting the analogous competition mechanism behind diverse molecular systems, we built a unified coarse-grained competition motif model to systematically compare experimental evidences in these processes and analyzed general properties shared behind them. We could predict in what molecular environments competition would reveal threshold behavior or display a negative linear dependence. We quantified how competition can shape regulator-target dose-response curve, modulate dynamic response speed, control target expression noise, and introduce correlated fluctuations between targets. This work uncovered the complexity and generality of molecular competition effect, which might act as a hidden regulatory mechanism with multiple functions throughout biological networks in both natural and synthetic systems.",

    "abstract": "While tandem mass spectrometry can now detect post-translational modifications (PTM) at the proteome scale, reported modification sites are often incomplete and include false positives. Computational approaches can complement these datasets by additional predictions, but most available tools are tailored for single modifications and each tool uses different features for prediction. We developed an R package called PTMscape which predicts modifications sites across the proteome based on a unified and comprehensive set of descriptors of the physico-chemical microenvironment of modified sites, with additional downstream analysis modules to test enrichment of individual or pairs of modifications in functional protein regions. PTMscape is generic in the ability to process any major modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, while achieving the sensitivity and specificity comparable to single-PTM methods and outperforming other multi-PTM tools. Maintaining generalizability of the framework, we expanded proteome-wide coverage of five major modifications affecting different residues by prediction and performed combinatorial analysis for spatial co-occurrence of pairs of those modifications. This analysis revealed potential modification hotspots and crosstalk among multiple PTMs in key protein domains such as histone, protein kinase, and RNA recognition motifs, spanning various biological processes such as RNA processing, DNA damage response, signal transduction, and regulation of cell cycle. These results provide a proteome-scale analysis of crosstalk among major PTMs and can be easily extended to other modifications.\\n\\nContactall correspondence should be addressed to hwchoi@nus.edu.sg.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic meiosis, generation of haploid gametes depends on the formation of inter-homolog crossovers, which enable the pairing, physical linkage, and eventual segregation of homologs in the meiosis I division. A class of conserved meiosis-specific proteins, collectively termed ZMMs, are required for formation and spatial control of crossovers throughout eukaryotes. Here, we show that three S. cerevisiae ZMM proteins - Zip2, Zip4, and Spo16 - interact with one another and form a DNA-binding complex critical for crossover formation and control. We determined the crystal structure of a Zip2:Spo16 subcomplex, revealing a heterodimer structurally related to the XPF:ERCC1 endonuclease complex. Zip2:Spo16 lacks an endonuclease active site, but binds specific DNA structures found in early meiotic recombination intermediates. Mutations in multiple DNA-binding surfaces on the Zip2:Spo16 complex severely compromise DNA binding, supporting a model in which the complexs central and HhH domains cooperate to bind DNA. Overall, our data support a model in which the Zip2:Zip4:Spo16 complex binds and stabilizes early meiotic recombination intermediates, then coordinates additional factors to promote crossover formation and license downstream events including synaptonemal complex assembly.",

APC negatively regulates the pro-proliferative Wnt signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of {beta}-catenin, but the extent to which APC exerts Wnt/{beta}-catenin-independent tumor suppressive activity is unclear. To identify interaction partners and {beta}-catenin-independent targets of endogenous, full-length APC, we applied label-free and multiplexed TMT mass spectrometry. Affinity enrichment-mass spectrometry revealed over 150 previously unidentified APC interaction partners. Moreover, our global proteomic analysis revealed that roughly half of the protein expression changes that occur in response to APC loss are independent of {beta}-catenin. By combining these two analyses, we identified Misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) as a putative substrate of an alternative APC-containing destruction complex and provide evidence for the potential contribution of MINK1 to APC mutant phenotypes. Collectively, our results highlight the extent and importance of Wnt-independent APC functions in epithelial biology and disease.",

We developed a mixture distribution model to detect monoallelically expressed loci in a genome-wide manner without the need for genotyping data, and applied the methodology on TCGA breast tissue RNA-seq data. We identified 35 putatively imprinted genes in healthy breast. In breast cancer however, HM13 was featured by significant loss of imprinting and expression upregulation, which could be linked to DNA demethylation. Other imprinted genes (25 out of 35) demonstrated consistent expression downregulation in breast cancer, which often correlated with loss of imprinting. A breast imprinted gene network, deregulated in cancer, might hence be present. In summary, our novel methodology highlights the massive deregulation of imprinting in breast cancer.",

Acetylation and phosphorylation of HMGB1 are implicated in the regulation of its nucleocytoplasmic translocation for secretion, although inflammatory stimuli are also known to induce H2O2 production. Here we show that H2O2-induced oxidation of HMGB1 that results in formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond between Cys23 and Cys45 is necessary and sufficient for its nucleocytoplasmic translocation and secretion. The oxidation is catalysed by peroxiredoxin I (PrxI) and PrxII, which are first oxidized by H2O2 and then transfer their disulphide oxidation state to HMGB1. The disulphide form of HMGB1 showed a higher affinity for the nuclear exportin CRM1 compared with the reduced form. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced HMGB1 secretion was greatly attenuated in macrophages derived from PrxI or PrxII knockout mice, as was the LPS-induced increase in serum HMGB1 levels in these mice.",

    "abstract": "Female parenting is obligate in mammals, but fathering behavior among mammals is rare. Only 3-5% of mammalian species exhibit biparental care, including humans, and mechanisms of fathering behavior remain sparsely studied. However, in species where it does exist, paternal care is often crucial to the survivorship of offspring. The present study is the first to identify new gene targets linked to the experience of fathering behavior in a biparental species using RNA sequencing. In order to determine the pattern of gene expression within the medial preoptic area that is specifically associated with fathering behavior, we identified differentially expressed genes in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) that experienced one of three social conditions: virgin males, pair bonded males, and males with fathering experience. Differentially expressed genes from each comparison (i.e., Virgin vs Paired, Virgin vs Fathers, and Paired vs Fathers) were evaluated using the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, and Kegg pathways analysis to reveal metabolic pathways associated with specific differentially expressed genes. Using these tools, we identified a group of genes that are differentially expressed in voles with different amounts of social experience. These genes are involved in a variety of processes, with particular enrichment in genes associated with immune function, metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and the remodeling of dendritic spines. The identification of these genes and processes will lead to novel insights into the biological basis of fathering behavior.",

We then assessed the accuracy of TF binding models from five different methods on these high-confidence measurements, finding that deep learning methods were best performing yet still have room for improvement. Importantly, machine learning methods were consistently better than the venerable position weight matrix (PWM). Finally, predictions for certain TFs were consistently poor, and our investigation supports efforts to use features beyond sequence, such as methylation, DNA shape, and post-translational modifications.

    "abstract": "Pathway reconstruction has proven to be an indispensable tool for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction underlying cell function. Nested effects models (NEMs) are a class of probabilistic graphical models designed to reconstruct signalling pathways from high-dimensional observations resulting from perturbation experiments, such as RNA interference (RNAi). NEMs assume that the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed to knockdown specific genes are always on-target. However, it has been shown that most siRNAs exhibit strong off-target effects, which further confound the data, resulting in unreliable reconstruction of networks by NEMs. Here, we present an extension of NEMs called probabilistic combinatorial nested effects models (pc-NEMs), which capitalize on the ancillary siRNA off-target effects for network reconstruction from combinatorial gene knockdown data. Our model employs an adaptive simulated annealing search algorithm for simultaneous inference of network structure and error rates inherent to the data. Evaluation of pc-NEMs on simulated data with varying number of phenotypic effects and noise levels demonstrates improved reconstruction compared to classical NEMs. Application to Bartonella henselae infection RNAi screening data yielded an eight node network largely in agreement with previous works, and revealed novel binary interactions of direct impact between established components.\\n\\nAvailability: The software used for the analysis is freely available as an R package at https://github.com/cbg-ethz/pcNEM.git\\n\\nContact: niko.beerenwinkel@bsse.ethz.ch",

    "abstract": "We establish a biophysical model for the dynamics of lipid vesicles exposed to surfactants. The solubilization of the lipid membrane due to the insertion of surfactant molecules induces a reduction of membrane surface area at almost constant vesicle volume. This results in a rate-dependent increase of membrane tension and leads to the opening of a micron-sized pore. We show that solubilization kinetics due to surfactants can determine the regimes of pore dynamics: either the pores open and reseal within a second (short-lived pore), or the pore stays open up to a few minutes (long-lived pore). First, we validate our model with previously published experimental measurements of pore dynamics. Then, we investigate how the solubilization kinetics and membrane properties affect the dynamics of the pore and construct a phase diagram for short and long-lived pores. Finally, we examine the dynamics of sequential pore openings and show that cyclic short-lived pores occur at a period inversely proportional to the solubilization rate. By deriving a theoretical expression for the cycle period, we provide an analytic tool to measure the solubilization rate of lipid vesicles by surfactants. Our findings shed light on some fundamental biophysical mechanisms that allow simple cell-like structures to sustain their integrity against environmental stresses, and have the potential to aid the design of vesicle-based drug delivery systems.",

We then developed in cell click selective crosslinking with RNA sequence profiling (icCL-Seq) to map binding sites for these tetracyclines on key human rRNA substructures at nucleotide resolution. Importantly, we found that structurally and phenotypically variant tetracycline analogs could chemically discriminate these rRNA binding sites. We also found that tetracyclines both subtly modify human ribosomal translation and selectively activate the cellular integrated stress response (ISR). Together, the data reveal that targeting of specific rRNA substructures, activation of the ISR, and inhibition of translation are correlated with the anti-proliferative properties of tetracyclines in human cancer cell lines.",

ErbB signaling is crucial for the proliferative response during lung regeneration, likely through the ErbB2:ErbB4 receptor heterodimer.

    "abstract": "Maternal transmission of intracellular microbes is pivotal in establishing long-term, intimate symbioses. For germline microbes that exert negative reproductive effects on their hosts, selection can theoretically favor the spread of host genes that counteract the microbes harmful effects. Here, we leverage a major difference in bacterial (Wolbachia pipientis) titers between closely-related wasp species with forward genetic, transcriptomic, and cytological approaches to map two quantitative trait loci that suppress bacterial titers via a maternal effect. Fine mapping and knockdown experiments identify the gene Wolbachia density suppressor (Wds), which dominantly suppresses bacterial transmission from mother to embryo. Wds evolved by lineage-specific non-synonymous changes driven by positive selection. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a genetically simple change arose by Darwinian selection in less than a million years to regulate maternally transmitted bacteria via a dominant, maternal effect gene.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCigarette smokers are at increased risk of poor sleep behaviours. However, it is largely unknown whether these associations are due to shared (genetic) risk factors and/or causal effects (which may be bi-directional).\\n\\nMethodsWe obtained summary-level data of genome-wide association studies of smoking (smoking initiation (n=74,035), cigarettes per day (n=38,181) and smoking cessation (n=41,278)) and sleep behaviours (sleep duration and chronotype, or  morningness) (n=128,266) and insomnia (n=113,006)). Using LD score regression, we calculated genetic correlations between smoking and sleep behaviours. To investigate causal effects, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR), both with summary-level data and individual level data (n=333,581 UK Biobank participants). For MR with summary-level data, individual genetic variants were combined with inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression and MR Egger regression methods.\\n\\nResultsWe found positive genetic correlations between insomnia and smoking initiation (rg=0.27, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49) and insomnia and cigarettes per day (rg=0.15, 0.01 to 0.28), and negative genetic correlations between sleep duration and smoking initiation (rg=-0.14, -0.26 to -0.01) and chronotype and smoking cessation (rg=-0.18, -0.31 to -0.06). MR analyses provided strong evidence that smoking more cigarettes per day causally decreases the odds of being a morning person, and weak evidence that insomnia causally increases smoking heaviness and decreases smoking cessation odds.\\n\\nConclusionsSmoking and sleep behaviours show moderate genetic correlation. Heavier smoking seems to causally affect circadian rhythm and there is some indication that insomnia increases smoking heaviness and hampers cessation. Our findings point to sleep as a potentially interesting smoking treatment target.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKnowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the genome is necessary to understand how gene expression is regulated. Recent experimental techniques such as Hi-C or ChIA-PET measure long-range interactions genome-wide but are experimentally elaborate and have limited resolution. Here, we present Computational Chromosome Conformation Capture by Correlation of ChIP-seq at CTCF motifs (7C).\\n\\nResultsWhile ChIP-seq was not designed to detect contacts, the formaldehyde treatment in the ChIP-seq protocol cross-links proteins with each other and with DNA. Consequently, also regions that are not directly bound by the targeted TF but interact with the binding site via chromatin looping are co-immunoprecipitated and sequenced. This produces minor ChIP-seq signals at loop anchor regions close to the directly bound site. We use the position and shape of ChIP-seq signals around CTCF motif pairs to predict whether they interact or not.\\n\\nWe applied 7C to all CTCF motif pairs within 1 MB in the human genome and validated predicted interactions with high-resolution Hi-C and ChIA-PET. A single ChIP-seq experiment from known architectural proteins (CTCF, Rad21, Znf143) but also from other TFs (like TRIM22 or RUNX3) predicts loops accurately. Importantly, 7C predicts loops in cell types and for TF ChIP-seq datasets not used in training.\\n\\nConclusion7C predicts chromatin loops with base-pair resolution and can be used to associate TF binding sites to regulated genes in a condition-specific manner. Furthermore, profiling of hundreds of ChIP-seq datasets results in novel candidate factors functionally involved in chromatin looping.

    "abstract": "Mammalian DNA is replicated in a highly organized and regulated manner. Large, Mb-sized regions are replicated at defined times along S phase. DNA Replication Timing (RT) has been suggested to play an important role in shaping the mammalian genome by affecting mutation rates. Previous analyses relied on somatic DNA RT profiles, while to fully understand the influences of RT on the mammalian genome, germ cell RT information is necessary, as only germline mutations are passed to offspring and thus affect genomic composition. Using an improved RT mapping technique that allows mapping the RT from limited amounts of cells, we measured RT from two stages in the mouse germline - primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The germ cell RT profiles were distinct from those of both somatic and embryonic tissues. The correlations between RT and both mutation rate and recombination hotspots were not only confirmed in the germline tissues, but were shown to be stronger compared to correlations with RT of somatic tissues, emphasizing the importance of using RT profiles from the correct tissue of origin. Expanding the analysis to additional genetic features such as GC content, transposable elements (SINEs and LINEs) and gene density, also revealed a stronger correlation with the germ cell RT maps. GC content stratification along with multiple regression analysis revealed the independent contribution of RT to SINE, gene, mutation and recombination hotspot densities. Taken together, our results point to the centrality of RT in shaping multiple levels of mammalian genome composition.",

    "abstract": "Rice is an important cereal in the world, uncovering the genetic basis of agronomic traits in rice landraces genes associated with agronomically important traits is indispensable for both understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and efficient crop improvement. Gelatinization temperature, gel consistency and pericarp color are important indices of rice cooking and eating quality evaluation and potential nutritional importance, which attract wide attentions in the application of genetic and breeding. To dissect the genetic basis of gelatinization temperature (GT), gel consistency (GC) and pericarp color (PC), a total of 419 rice landraces core germplasm collections consisting of 330 indica lines, 78 japonica lines and 11 uncertain varieties were grown, collected, then GT, GC, PC were measured for two years, and sequenced using Specific Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF) technology. In this study, 261,385,070 clean reads and 56,768 polymorphic SLAF tags were obtained, which a total of 211,818 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered. With 208,993 SNPs meeting the criterion of minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05 and integrity> 0.5, the phylogenetic tree and population structure analysis were performed for all 419 rice landraces, and the whole panel mainly separated into six subpopulations based on population structure analysis. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out for the whole panel, indica subpanel and japonica subpanel with subset SNPs respectively. One quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 6 for GT was detected in the whole panel and indica subpanel, and one QTL associated with GC was located on chromosome 6 in the whole panel and indica subpanel. For the PC trait, 8 QTLs were detected in the whole panel on chromosome 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11, and 7 QTLs in the indica subpanel on chromosome 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11. The loci on chromosome 3, 8, 10 and 11 have not been identified previously, and they may be the candidate genes of pericarp color. For the three traits, no QTL was detected in japonica subpanel probably because of the polymorphism repartition between the subpanel, or small population size of japonica subpanel. This paper provides new gene resources and insights into the molecular mechanisms of important agricultural trait of rice phenotypic variation and genetic improvement of rice quality variety breeding.",

    "abstract": "Presenilin (PS), the catalytic subunit of {gamma}-secretase and its main substrate the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are mutated in a large majority of patients with familial Alzheimer disease. PS and APP interact with proteins of the neurotransmitter release machinery but the functional consequences of these interactions are unknown. Here we report that genetic deletion of presynaptic PS markedly decreases the axonal expression of the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), and impairs synaptic facilitation and replenishment of release-competent synaptic vesicles. These properties are fully restored by presynaptic re-expression of Syt7. The regulation of Syt7 expression occurs post-transcriptionally and depends on {gamma}-secretase activity. In the combined absence of both APP and PS1, the loss of Syt7 is prevented, indicating that the action of {gamma}-secretase on presynaptic mechanisms depends on its substrate APP. The molecular mechanism involves the substrate of PS, APP-{beta}Cterminal (APP-{beta}CTF), which interacts with Syt7 and accumulates in synaptic terminals under conditions of pharmacological or genetic inhibition of {gamma}-secretase. These results reveal a role of PS in presynaptic mechanisms through regulation of Syt7 by APP-dependent cleavage, and highlight aberrant synaptic vesicle processing as a possible new pathway in AD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the statistical structure of the environment is crucial for adaptive behavior. Humans and non-human decision-makers seem to track such structure through a process of probabilistic inference, which enables predictions about behaviorally relevant events. Deviations from such predictions cause surprise, which in turn helps improve the inference. Surprise about the timing of behaviorally relevant sensory events drives phasic responses of neuromodulatory brainstem systems, which project to the cerebral cortex. Here, we developed a computational model-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) approach for mapping the resulting cortical transients across space, time, and frequency, in the human brain. We used a Bayesian updating model to estimate the predicted timing of the next stimulus change in a simple visual detection task. This model yielded quantitative trial-by-trial estimates of temporal surprise. The model-based surprise variable predicted trial-by-trial variations in reaction time more strongly than the externally observable interval timings alone. Trial-by-trial variations in surprise were negatively correlated with the power of cortical population activity measured with MEG. This surprise-related power suppression occurred transiently around the behavioral response, specifically in the beta frequency band. It peaked in left lateral prefrontal as well as in frontal midline regions, and its cortical distribution was distinct from the movement-related suppression of beta power in motor cortex. Our results indicate that surprise about sensory event timing transiently suppresses ongoing beta-band oscillations in association cortex. This transient suppression of frontal beta-band oscillations might reflect an active reset triggered by surprise, and is in line with the idea that beta-oscillations help maintain cognitive sets.\\n\\nSignificance statementAgents continuously track the statistical structure of the environment, in order to make predictions about behaviorally relevant sensory events. Deviations from such predictions cause surprise, which in turn drives phasic responses of neuromodulatory brainstem systems that project to the cerebral cortex. We developed a computational model-based magnetoencephalography approach, which enabled us to map out transients changes in cortical population dynamics elicited by surprise about sensory event timing, across space, time, and frequency, in the human brain. The model-based estimates of surprise predicted behavior as well as a transient suppression of beta frequency-band oscillations in frontal cortical regions. Our results are in line with conceptual accounts that have linked neural oscillations in the beta-band to the maintenance of cognitive sets.",

Here we use a combination of forward genetics and proteomics to dissect the miP1a/b microProtein complex that acts to delay the floral transition in Arabidopsis.

We find that the JUMONJI14 (JMJ14) histone demethylase is part of this repressor complex that can initiate chromatin changes in FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, the direct target of CO. Plants with mutations in JMJ14 exhibit an early flowering phenotype that is largely dependent on the activity of CO, supporting a role for CO in this repressive complex. When mis-expressed at the shoot apex, CO can induce early flowering only in the jmj14 background. Our results indicate that the repressor acts in the shoot apical meristem to keep it in an undifferentiated state until the leaf-derived florigen signal induces the conversion into a floral meristem.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genome replication depends on thousands of DNA replication origins (ORIs) that constitute the originome. A major challenge is to learn ORI biology in multicellular organisms in the context of growing organs to understand their developmental plasticity. We have determined the originome and chromatin landscape of Arabidopsis thaliana at two stages of postembryonic development. ORIs associate with multiple chromatin signatures including TSS but also regulatory regions and heterochromatin, where ORIs colocalize with retrotransposons. In addition, quantitative analysis of ORI activity led us to conclude that strong ORIs have high GC content and clusters of GGN trinucleotides. Development primarily influences ORI firing strength rather than ORI location. ORIs that preferentially fire at early developmental stages colocalize with GC-rich heterochromatin whereas at later stages with transcribed genes, perhaps as a consequence of changes in chromatin features associated with developmental processes. Our study provides the originome of an organism at the postembryo stage that should allow us to study ORI biology in response to development, environment and mutations with a quantitative approach. In a wider scope, the computational strategies developed here can be transferred to other eukaryotic systems.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome-wide transcriptome sequencing applied to single cells (scRNA-seq) is rapidly becoming an assay of choice across many fields of biological and biomedical research. Scientific objectives often revolve around discovery or characterization of types or sub-types of cells, and therefore obtaining accurate cell-cell similarities from scRNA-seq data is critical step in many studies. While rapid advances are being made in the development of tools for scRNA-seq data analysis, few approaches exist that explicitly address this task. Furthermore, abundance and type of noise present in scRNA-seq datasets suggest that application of generic methods, or of methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data, is likely suboptimal.\\n\\nResultsHere we present RAFSIL, a random forest based approach to learn cell-cell similarities from scRNA-seq data. RAFSIL implements a two-step procedure, where feature construction geared towards scRNA-seq data is followed by similarity learning. It is designed to be adaptable and expandable, and RAFSIL similarities can be used for typical exploratory data analysis tasks like dimension reduction, visualization, and clustering. We show that our approach compares favorably with current methods across a diverse collection of datasets, and that it can be used to detect and highlight unwanted technical variation in scRNA-seq datasets in situations where other methods fail. Overall, RAFSIL implements a flexible approach yielding a useful tool that improves the analysis of scRNA-seq data.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe RAFSIL R package is available online at www.kostkalab.net/software.html",

    "abstract": "Chaperone networks are dysregulated with aging and neurodegenerative disease, but whether compromised Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone function directly contributes to neuronal degeneration is unknown. Stress-inducible phosphoprotein-1 (STI1; STIP1; HOP) is a co-chaperone that simultaneously interacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90, but whose function in vivo remains poorly understood. To investigate the requirement of STI1-mediated regulation of the chaperone machinery in aging we combined analysis of a mouse line with a hypomorphic Stip1 allele, with a neuronal cell line lacking STI1 and in-depth analyses of chaperone genes in human datasets. Loss of STI1 function severely disturbed the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery in vivo, and all client proteins tested and a subset of cochaperones presented decreased levels. Importantly, mice expressing a hypomorphic STI1 allele showed spontaneous age-dependent hippocampal neurodegeneration, with consequent spatial memory deficits. STI1 is a critical node for the chaperone network and it can contribute to age-dependent hippocampal neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-catenin-dependent WNT signal transduction governs normal development and adult tissue homeostasis. Inappropriate pathway activity mediates a vast array of human diseases, including bone density disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer. Although several WNT-directed therapeutics are in clinical trials, new targets, compounds and strategies are needed. We performed a gain-of-function screen of the human kinome to identify new druggable regulators of {beta}-catenin-dependent transcription. We found that over-expression of the AP2 Associated Kinase 1 (AAK1) strongly inhibited WNT signaling. Reciprocally, silencing of AAK1 expression or pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 kinase activity using a new, selective and potent small molecule inhibitor activated WNT signaling. This small molecule is a cell active dual AAK1/BMP2K inhibitor that represents the best available tool to study AAK1-dependent signaling pathways. We report that AAK1 and the WNT co-receptor LRP6 physically co-complex and that AAK1 promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis of LRP6. Collectively, our data support a WNT-induced negative feedback loop mediated by AAK1-driven, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of LRP6.\\n\\nSummary StatementA gain-of-function screen of the human kinome revealed AAK1 as a negative regulator of WNT signaling. We show that AAK1 promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis of LRP6, resulting in downregulation of WNT signaling.

    "abstract": "The establishment of relative size of organs and structures is paramount for attaining final form and function of an organism. Importantly, variation in the proportions of structures frequently underlies adaptive change in morphology in evolution and maybe a common mechanism underlying selection. However, the mechanism by which growth is integrated within tissues during development to achieve proper proportionality is poorly understood. We have shown that signaling by potassium channels mediates coordinated size regulation in zebrafish fins. Recently, calcineurin inhibitors were shown to elicit changes in zebrafish fin allometry as well. Here, we identify the potassium channel kcnk5b as a key player in integrating calcineurins growth effects, in part through regulation of the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the channel. We propose that the interaction between Kcnk5b and calcineurin acts as a signaling node to regulate allometric growth. Importantly, we find that this regulation is epistatic to inherent mechanisms instructing overall size as inhibition of calcineurin is able to bypass genetic instruction of size as seen in sof and wild-type fins, however, it is not sufficient to re-specify positional memory of size of the fin. These findings integrate classic signaling mediators such as calcineurin with ion channel function in the regulation of size and proportion during growth.",

We compared standard enrichment of bacterial and eukaryotic mRNA to targeted enrichment with Agilent SureSelect (AgSS) capture for Brugia malayi, Aspergillus fumigatus, and the Wolbachia endosymbiont of B. malayi (wBm). Without introducing significant systematic bias, the AgSS quantitatively enriched samples, resulting in more reads mapping to the target organism. The AgSS-enriched libraries consistently had a positive linear correlation with its unenriched counterpart (r2=0.559-0.867). Up to a 2,242-fold enrichment of RNA from the target organism was obtained following a power law (r2=0.90), with the greatest fold enrichment achieved in samples with the largest ratio difference between the major and minor members. While using a single total library for prokaryote and eukaryote in a single sample could be beneficial for samples where RNA is limiting, we observed a decrease in reads mapping to protein coding genes and an increase of multi-mapping reads to rRNAs in AgSS enrichments from eukaryotic total RNA libraries as opposed to eukaryotic poly(A)-enriched libraries. Our results support a recommendation of using Agilent SureSelect targeted enrichment on poly(A)-enriched libraries for eukaryotic captures and total RNA libraries for prokaryotic captures to increase the robustness of multi-species transcriptomic studies.",

Here, we tested this expectation by comparing the pattern of expression of transposable elements in their native and hybrid genomic context. For this, we sequenced the transcriptome of the Arabidopsis thaliana genotype Col-0, the A. lyrata genotype MN47 and their F1 hybrid. Contrary to expectations, we observe that the level of TE expression in the hybrid is strongly correlated to levels in the parental species. We detect that at most 1.1% of expressed transposable elements belonging to two specific subfamilies change their expression level upon hybridization. Most of these changes, however, are of small magnitude. We observe that the few hybrid-specific modifications in TE expression are more likely to occur when TE insertions are close to genes. In addition, changes in epigenetic histone marks H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 following hybridization do not coincide with TEs with changed expression. Finally, we further examined TE expression in parents and hybrids exposed to severe dehydration stress. Despite the major reorganization of gene and TE expression by stress, we observe that hybridization does not lead to increased disorganization of TE expression in the hybrid. We conclude that TE expression is globally robust to hybridization and that the term \\\"genomic shock\\\" is no longerappropriate to describe the anticipated consequences of merging divergent genomes in a hybrid.",

Type I interferons (TI-IFN) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) have been connected with the pathophysiology of this disease; however, their interplay in the modulation of diabetogenic T cells remains unknown. We have discovered that TI-IFN cause a selective inhibition of IL-10 signaling in effector and regulatory T cells, altering their responses. This correlates with diabetes development in NOD mice, where the inhibition is also spatially localized to T cells of pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes. IL-10 signaling inhibition is reversible and can be restored via blockade of TI-IFN/IFN-R interaction, paralleling with the resulting delay in diabetes onset and reduced severity. Overall, we propose a novel molecular link between TI-IFN and IL-10 signaling that helps better understand the complex dynamics of autoimmune diabetes development and reveals new strategies of intervention.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Recent evidence suggests that getting lost in new surroundings is one of the first impairments to emerge in AD. It is possible that getting lost in new surroundings represents a failure to use distal cues to get oriented in space. Therefore, we set out to look for impaired use of distal cues for spatial orientation in a mouse model of amyloidosis (3xTg-AD). To do this, we trained mice to shuttle to the end of a track and back to an enclosed start box to receive a water reward. Then, mice were trained to stop in an unmarked reward zone to receive a brain stimulation reward. The time required to remain in the zone for a reward was increased across training, and the track was positioned in a random start location for each trial. We found that 6-month female, but not male, 3xTg-AD mice were impaired. Male and female mice had only intracellular pathology and male mice had less pathology, particularly in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, AD may cause spatial disorientation as a result of impaired use of landmarks.",

For instance, the open-source software movement has led to new and valuable technologies being released publicly to facilitate broader collaboration and further innovation. What drives this behavior and under which conditions can it be beneficial for an individual? Using simulations in both static and dynamic environments, we show that sharing information can lead to individual benefits through the mechanisms of pseudo-reciprocity, whereby shared information leads to by-product benefits for an individual without the need for explicit reciprocation. Crucially, imitation with a certain level of innovation is required to avoid a tragedy of the commons, while the mechanism of a local visibility radius allows for the coordination of self-organizing collectives of agents. When these two mechanisms are present, we find robust evidence for the benefits of sharing--even when others do not reciprocate.",

Using a within-subject design, participants searched for both spatially and conceptually correlated rewards in multi-armed bandit tasks. We use a Gaussian Process model combining generalization with an optimistic sampling strategy to capture human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and to simulate human-level performance when specified with participant parameter estimates.

    "abstract": "Trial-and-error learning is a universal strategy for establishing which actions are beneficial or harmful in new environments. However, learning stimulus-response associations solely via trial-and-error is often suboptimal, as in many settings dependencies among stimuli and responses can be exploited to increase learning efficiency. Previous studies have shown that in settings featuring such dependencies, humans typically engage high-level cognitive processes and employ advanced learning strategies to improve their learning efficiency. Here we analyze in detail the initial learning phase of a sample of human subjects (N = 85) performing a trial-and-error learning task with deterministic feedback and hidden stimulus-response dependencies. Using computational modeling, we find that the standard Q-learning model cannot sufficiently explain human learning strategies in this setting. Instead, newly introduced deterministic response models, which are theoretically optimal and transform stimulus sequences unambiguously into response sequences, provide the best explanation for 50.6% of the subjects. Most of the remaining subjects either show a tendency towards generic optimal learning (21.2%) or at least partially exploit stimulus-response dependencies (22.3%), while a few subjects (5.9%) show no clear preference for any of the employed models. After the initial learning phase, asymptotic learning performance during the subsequent practice phase is best explained by the standard Q-learning model. Our results show that human learning strategies in trial-and-error learning go beyond merely associating stimuli and responses via incremental reinforcement. Specifically during initial learning, high-level cognitive processes support sophisticated learning strategies that increase learning efficiency while keeping memory demands and computational efforts bounded. The good asymptotic fit of the Q-learning model indicates that these cognitive processes are successively replaced by the formation of stimulus-response associations over the course of learning.",

We show that the C. elegans ortholog of Shugoshin, SGO-1, is required for checkpoint activity in meiotic prophase. This role in checkpoint function is similar to that of the meiotic chromosomal protein, HTP-3. Null sgo-1 mutants exhibit additional phenotypes similar to that of a partial loss of function allele of HTP-3: premature synaptonemal complex disassembly, the activation of alternate DNA repair pathways and an inability to recruit a conserved effector of the DNA damage pathway, HUS-1. SGO-1 localizes to pre-meiotic nuclei, when HTP-3 is present but not yet loaded onto chromosome axes, suggesting an early role in regulating meiotic chromosome metabolism. We propose that SGO-1 acts during pre-meiotic replication to ensure fully functional meiotic chromosome architecture, rendering these chromosomes competent for checkpoint activity and normal progression of meiotic recombination. Given that most research on Shugoshin has been focused on its regulation of sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis, this novel role may be conserved but previously uncharacterized in other organisms. Further, our findings expand the repertoire of Shugoshins functions beyond coordinating regulatory activities at the centromere.",

Here, we investigate the population genetic structure of the fire salamander Salamandra salamandra in peninsular Italy. Both mitochondrial and nuclear markers clearly identified two main population groups. However, nuclear and mitochondrial zones of geographic transition between groups were located 600 km from one another. The overall pattern of genetic variation, together with morphological and fossil data, suggest that a rampant mitochondrial introgression triggered the observed mitonuclear discordance, following a post-glacial secondary contact between lineages. Moreover, at a shallower level of population structure, we observed evidence of asymmetric introgression of nuclear genes between two sub-groups in southern Italy. Our results clearly show the major role played by reticulate evolution in shaping the structure of Salamandra salamandra populations and, together with similar findings in other regions of the species range, contribute to identify the fire salamander as a particularly intriguing case to investigate the complexity of mechanisms triggering patterns of mitonuclear discordance in animals.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing the genomes of individual cells enables the direct determination of genetic heterogeneity amongst cells within a population. We have developed an injection-moulded valveless microfluidic device in which single cells from colorectal cell (LS174T, LS180 and RKO) lines and fresh colorectal cancers are individually trapped, their genomes extracted and prepared for sequencing, using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Ninety nine percent of the DNA sequences obtained mapped to a reference human genome, indicating that there was effectively no contamination of these samples from non-human sources. In addition, most of the reads are correctly paired, with a low percentage of singletons (0.17 {+/-} 0.06 %) and we obtain genome coverages approaching 90%. To achieve this high quality, our device design and process shows that amplification can be conducted in microliter volumes as long as extraction is in sub-nanoliter volumes. Our data also demonstrates that high quality single cell sequencing can be achieved using a relatively simple, inexpensive and scalable device.",

    "abstract": "An inducible program of inflammatory gene expression is a hallmark of antimicrobial defenses. Herein, we identified Cellular nucleic acid binding protein (Cnbp) as a specific regulator of interleukin-12{beta} gene transcription and Th1 immunity. Cnbp resides in the cytosol of macrophages and translocates to the nucleus in response to a broad range of microbial ligands. Cnbp-deficient macrophages had a selective impairment in their ability to induce IL12{beta} gene transcription. Cnbp interacted with c-Rel, an NF{kappa}B/Rel family member that controls IL12{beta} gene transcription. c-Rel nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity were dependent on Cnbp. Furthermore, Cnbp itself bound the IL12{beta} promoter. Lastly, Cnbp-deficient mice were more susceptible to acute toxoplasmosis associated with reduced production of IL12{beta}, as well as a reduced Th1 cell IFN{gamma} response essential to control parasite replication. Collectively, these findings identify Cnbp as a key regulator of c-Rel dependent IL12{beta} gene transcription and Th1 immunity.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans surface-attached biofilms are sites of amplification of an infection through continuous discharge of cells capable of initiating new infectious foci. Yeast cells released from biofilms on intravenous catheters have direct access to the bloodstream. We previously reported that dispersed cells are largely lateral yeast cells that originate from the hyphal layers of the biofilm. Compared to their planktonic counterparts, these biofilm-dispersed yeast cells displayed enhanced virulence-associated gene expression and drug resistance. Little is known about the molecular properties of dispersed cells. We found that the inducer of dispersal, PES1, genetically interacts with the repressor of filamentation, NRG1, in a manner that supports a genetic definition of dispersed cells as yeast. We combined a flow biofilm model with RNA sequencing technology, to identify transcriptomic characteristics of freshly dispersed yeast cells versus biofilms or age-matched planktonic yeast cells growing in glucose-rich medium. Dispersed cells largely inherited a biofilm-like mRNA profile but with one stark difference: dispersed cells were transcriptionally reprogrammed to metabolize alternative carbon sources, while their sessile parents expressed glycolytic genes, despite exposure to the same nutritional signals. Our studies hence define dispersal cell production as an intrinsic step of biofilm development which generates propagules capable of colonizing distant host sites. This developmental step anticipates the need for virulence-associated gene expression before experiencing the associated external signals.",

    "abstract": "The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is becoming the method of choice for expression of many eukaryotic proteins and protein complexes for biochemical, structural and pharmaceutical studies. Significant technological advancement has made generation of recombinant baculoviruses easy, efficient and user-friendly. However, there is a tremendous variability in the amount of proteins made using the BEVS, including different batches of virus made to express the same proteins. Yet, what influences the overall production of proteins or protein complexes remains largely unclear. Many downstream applications, particularly protein structure determination, require purification of large quantities of proteins in a repetitive manner, calling for a reliable experimental set-up to obtain the protein or protein complexes of interest consistently. During our investigation of optimizing the expression of the Mediator Head module, we discovered that the  initial infectivity was an excellent indicator of overall production of protein complexes. Further, we show that this initial infectivity can be mathematically described as a function of multiplicity of infection (MOI), correlating recombinant protein yield and virus titer. All these findings led us to develop the Titer Estimation for Quality Control (TEQC) method, which enables researchers to estimate initial infectivity, titer/MOI values in a simple and affordable way, and to use these values to quantitatively optimize protein expressions utilizing BEVS in a highly reproducible fashion.",

    "abstract": "The central nervous system must determine which sensory events occur at the same time. Actively moving the head corresponds with large changes in the relationship between the observer and the environment, sensorimotor processing, and spatiotemporal perception. Numerous studies have shown that head movement onset must precede the onset of other sensory events in order to be perceived as simultaneous, indicating that head movement perception is slow. Active head movement perception has been shown to be slower than passive head movement perception and dependent on head movement velocity, where participants who move their head faster than other participants require the head to move even earlier than comparison stimuli to be perceived as simultaneous. These results suggest that head movement perception is slower (i.e., suppressed) when the head moves faster. The present study used a within-subjects design to measure the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) between active head movement speeds and a comparison sound stimulus. Our results clearly show that i) head movement perception is faster when the head moves faster within-subjects, ii) active head movement onset must still precede the onset of other sensory events (Average PSS: -123 to -52 ms) in order to be perceived as occurring simultaneously even at the fastest speeds (Average peak velocity: 76{degrees}/s to 257{degrees}/s). We conclude that head movement perception is slow, but that this delay is minimized with increased speed. While we do not provide evidence against sensory suppression, which requires active versus passive head movement comparison, our results do rule out velocity-based suppression.",

    "abstract": "Application-specific validation of antibodies is a critical prerequisite for their successful use. Here we introduce an automated framework for characterization and screening of antibodies against synaptic molecules for high-resolution immunofluorescence array tomography (AT). The proposed Synaptic Antibody Screening Tool (SACT), is designed to provide an automatic, robust, flexible, and efficient tool for antibody characterization at scale. By allowing the user to define the molecular composition and size of synapses expected to contain the antigen, the method detects and characterizes puncta and synapses, and outputs automatically computed characteristics such as synapse density and target specificity ratio, which reflect the sensitivity and specificity of immunolabeling with a given antibody. These measurements provide an objective way to characterize and compare the performance of different antibodies against the same target, and can be used to objectively select the antibodies best suited for AT and potentially for other immunolabeling applications.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative to mitigating bacterial infections in light of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. However, predicting, understanding, and controlling the antibacterial activity of AMPs remains a significant challenge. While peptide intramolecular interactions are known to modulate AMP antimi-crobial activity, peptide intermolecular interactions remain elusive in their impact on peptide bioactivity. Herein, we test the relationship between AMP intermolecular interactions and antibacterial efficacy by controlling AMP intermolecular hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations and Gibbs free energy calculations in concert with experimental assays show that increasing intermolecular interactions via inter-peptide aggregation increases the energy cost for the peptide to cross the bacterial cell membrane, which in turn decreases the AMP antibacterial activity. Our findings provide a route for predicting and controlling the antibacterial activity of AMPs against Gramnegative bacteria via reductions of intermolecular AMP interactions.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian kidney develops through repetitive and reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme to give rise to the entire collecting system and the nephrons, respectively. Most of our knowledge of the developmental regulators driving this process has been gained from the study of gene expression and functional genetics in mice and other animal models. In order to shed light on human kidney development, we have used singlecell transcriptomics to characterize gene expression in different cell population, and to study individual cell dynamics and lineage trajectories during development. Single cell transcriptome analyses of 3,865 cells identified 17 clusters of specific cell types as defined by their gene expression profile, including markers of ureteric bud tip- and metanephric mesenchyme-specific progenitors, as well as their intermediate and differentiated lineages including the mature collecting ducts, the renal vesicle and comma- and s-shaped bodies, immature and mature podocytes, proximal tubules, loops of Henle and distal tubules. Other lineages identified include mesangium and cortical and medullary interstitium, endothelial and immune cells as well as hematopoietic cells. Novel markers for these cell types were revealed in the analysis as well as components of key signaling pathways driving renal development in animal models. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive and dynamic gene expression array of the human developing kidney at the single-cell level.",
