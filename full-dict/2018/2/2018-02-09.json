    "abstract": "SummaryCryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a mainstream technique for determining the structures of complex biological systems. However, accurate integrative structural modeling has been hampered by the challenges in objectively weighing cryo-EM data against other sources of information due to the presence of random and systematic errors, as well as correlations, in the data. To address these challenges, we introduce a Bayesian scoring function that efficiently and accurately ranks alternative structural models of a macromolecular system based on their consistency with a cryo-EM density map and other experimental and prior information. The accuracy of this approach is benchmarked using complexes of known structure and illustrated in three applications: the structural determination of the GroEL/GroES, RNA polymerase II, and exosome complexes. The approach is implemented in the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (http://integrativemodeling.org), thus enabling integrative structure determination by combining cryo-EM data with other sources of information.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present a modeling approach to integrate cryo-EM data with other sources of information\\nC_LIO_LIWe benchmark our approach using synthetic data on 21 complexes of known structure\\nC_LIO_LIWe apply our approach to the GroEL/GroES, RNA polymerase II, and exosome complexes\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Previous work demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of the human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained on visual object recognition. We used DCNNs to investigate which frequency bands correlate with feature transformations of increasing complexity along the ventral visual pathway. By capitalizing on intracranial depth recordings from 100 patients and 11293 electrodes we assessed the alignment between the DCNN and signals at different frequency bands in different time windows. We found that gamma activity, especially in the low gamma-band (30 - 70 Hz), matched the increasing complexity of visual feature representations in the DCNN. These findings show that the activity of the DCNN captures the essential characteristics of biological object recognition not only in space and time, but also in the frequency domain. These results also demonstrate the potential that modern artificial intelligence algorithms have in advancing our understanding of the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have revealed principles about neural processing, in particular about vision. Previous works have demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), suggesting that DCNN is a good model of visual object recognition in primate brain. Studying intracranial depth recordings allowed us to extend previous works by assessing when and at which frequency bands the activity of the visual system corresponds to the DCNN. Our key finding is that signals in gamma frequencies along the ventral visual pathway are aligned with the layers of DCNN. Gamma frequencies play a major role in transforming visual input to coherent object representations.",

    "abstract": "Spike-timing patterns - crucial for synaptic plasticity and neural computation - are often modeled as Poisson-like random processes, log-normal distribution or gamma-distribution patterns, each with different underlying assumptions that may or may not be biologically true. However, it is not entirely clear whether (and how well) these different models would or would not capture spike-timing statistical patterns across different neurons, regions, animal species and cognitive states. Here, we examine statistical patterns of spike-timing irregularity in 13 different cortical and subcortical regions from mouse, hamster, cat and monkey brains. In contrast to the widely-assumed Poisson or log-normal distribution patterns, we show that spike-timing patterns of various projection neurons-including cortical excitatory principal cells, hippocampal pyramidal cells, inhibitory striatal medium spiny neurons and dopaminergic neurons, as well as fast-spiking interneurons - all invariantly conform to the gamma-distribution model. While higher regularity in spike-timing patterns are observed in a few cases, such as mouse DA neurons and monkey motor cortical neurons, there is no clear tendency in increased firing regularity from the sensory and subcortical neurons to prefrontal or motor cortices, as previously entertained. Moreover, gamma shapes of spike-timing patterns remain robust over various natural cognitive states, such as sleep, awake periods, or during fearful episodic experiences. Interestingly, ketamine-induced general anesthesia or unconsciousness is associated with the breakdown of forebrain spike patterns from a singular gamma distribution into two distinct subtypes of gamma distributions, suggesting the importance of this spike-timing pattern in supporting natural cognitive states. These results suggest that gamma-distribution patterns of spike timing reflect not only a fundamental property conserved across different neurons, regions and animal species, but also an operation crucial for supporting natural cognitive states. Such gamma-distribution-based spike-timing patterns can also have important implications for real-time neural coding and realistic neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "The onset of the headache phase during attacks of migraine with aura, which occur in about 30% of migraineurs, is believed to involve cortical spreading depression (CSD) and the ensuing activation and sensitization of primary afferent neurons that innervate the intracranial meninges, and their related large vessels. The mechanism by which CSD enhances the activity and mechanosensitivity of meningeal afferents remains poorly understood, but may involve cortical metabolic perturbations. We employed extracellular single-unit recording of meningeal afferent activity and monitored changes in cortical blood flow and tissue partial pressure of oxygen (tpO2) in anesthetized male rats to test whether the prolonged cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tissue oxygenation that occur in the wake of CSD contribute to meningeal nociception. Suppression of CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor naproxen blocked the reduction in cortical tpO2, but had no effect on the activation of meningeal afferents. Naproxen, however, distinctly prevented CSD-induced afferent mechanical sensitization. Counteracting the CSD-evoked persistent hypoperfusion and reduced tpO2 by preemptively increasing cortical blood flow using the K(ATP) channel opener levcromakalim did not inhibit the sensitization of meningeal afferents, but prevented their activation. Our data show that the cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tpO2 that occur in the wake of CSD can be dissociated from the activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferent responses suggesting that the metabolic changes do not contribute directly to these neuronal nociceptive responses.\\n\\nSignificance statementCSD-evoked activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents is thought to mediate the headache phase in migraine with aura. We report that blocking the CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion and reduced tpO2 by cyclooxygenase inhibition is associated with the inhibition of the afferent sensitization but not their activation. Normalization of these CSD-evoked metabolic perturbations by activating K(ATP) channels is, however, associated with the inhibition of afferent activation but not sensitization. These results question the contribution of cortical metabolic perturbations to the triggering mechanism underlying meningeal nociception and the ensuing headache in migraine with aura, further point to distinct mechanisms underlying the activation and sensitization of meningeal afferents in migraine and highlight the need to target both processes for an effective migraine therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cells in culture display diverse motility behaviors that may reflect differences in cell state and function, providing motivation to discriminate between different motility behaviors. Current methods to do so rely upon manual feature engineering. However, the types of features necessary to distinguish between motility behaviors can vary greatly depending on the biological context, and it is not always clear which features may be most predictive in each setting for distinguishing particular cell types or disease states. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are machine learning models allowing for relevant features to be learned directly from spatial data. Similarly, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of models capable of learning long term temporal dependencies. Given that cell motility is inherently spacio-temporal data, we present an approach utilizing both convolutional and long- short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network units to analyze cell motility data. These RNN models provide accurate classification of simulated motility and experimentally measured motility from multiple cell types, comparable to results achieved with hand-engineered features. The variety of cell motility differences we can detect suggests that the algorithm is generally applicable to additional cell types not analyzed here. RNN autoencoders based on the same architecture are capable of learning motility features in an unsupervised manner and capturing variation between myogenic cells in the latent space. Adapting these RNN models to motility prediction, RNNs are capable of predicting muscle stem cell motility from past tracking data with performance superior to standard motion prediction models. This advance in cell motility prediction may be of practical utility in cell tracking applications.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of bacterial genome sequencing has been performed using Illumina short reads. Because of the inherent difficulty of resolving repeated regions with short reads alone, only {approx}10% of sequencing projects have resulted in a closed genome. The most common repeated regions are those coding for ribosomal operons (rDNAs), which occur in a bacterial genome between 1 and 15 times, and are typically used as sequence markers to classify and identify bacteria. Here, we exploit conservation in the genomic context in which rDNAs occur across taxa to improve assembly of these regions relative to de novo sequencing by using the conserved nature of rDNAs across taxa and the uniqueness of their flanking regions within a genome. We describe a method to construct targeted pseudocontigs generated by iteratively assembling reads that map to a reference genomes rDNAs. These pseudocontigs are then used to more accurately assemble the newly-sequenced chromosome. We show that this method, implemented as riboSeed, correctly bridges across adjacent contigs in bacterial genome assembly and, when used in conjunction with other genome polishing tools, can assist in closure of a genome.",

    "abstract": "Genetically identical cells exhibit diverse phenotypes, even when experiencing the same environment. This phenomenon, in part, originates from cell-to-cell variability (noise) in protein expression. While various kinetic schemes of stochastic transcription initiation are known to affect gene expression noise, how post-transcription initiation events contribute to noise at the protein level remains incompletely understood. To address this question, we developed a stochastic simulation-based model of bacterial gene expression that integrates well-known dependencies between transcription initiation, transcription elongation dynamics, mRNA degradation and translation. We identified realistic conditions under which mRNA lifetime and transcriptional pauses modulate the protein expression noise initially introduced by the promoter architecture. For instance, we found that the short lifetime of bacterial mRNAs facilitates the production of protein bursts. Conversely, RNA polymerase (RNAP) pausing at specific sites during transcription elongation can attenuate protein bursts by fluidizing the RNAP traffic to the point of erasing the effect of a bursty promoter. Pause-prone sites, if located close to the promoter, can also affect noise indirectly by reducing both transcription and translation initiation due to RNAP and ribosome congestion. Our findings highlight how the interplay between transcription initiation, transcription elongation, translation and mRNA degradation shapes the distribution in protein numbers. They also have implications for our understanding of gene evolution and suggest combinatorial strategies for modulating phenotypic variability by genetic engineering.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor 4 (TCF4) locus is a robust association finding with schizophrenia (SZ), but little is known about the genes regulated by the encoded transcription factor. Therefore, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of TCF4 in neural-derived (SH-SY5Y) cells to identify genome-wide TCF4 binding sites, followed by data integration with SZ association findings. We identified 11,322 TCF4 binding sites overlapping in two ChIP-seq experiments. These sites are significantly enriched for the TCF4 Ebox binding motif (>85% having [&ge;]1 Ebox) and implicate a gene set enriched for genes down-regulated in TCF4 siRNA knockdown experiments, indicating the validity of our findings. The TCF4 gene set was also enriched among 1) Gene Ontology categories such as axon/neuronal development, 2) genes preferentially expressed in brain, in particular pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex, and 3) genes down-regulated in post-mortem brain tissue from SZ patients (OR=2.8, permutation p<4x10-5). Considering genomic alignments, TCF4 binding sites significantly overlapped those for neural DNA binding proteins such as FOXP2 and the SZ-associated EP300. TCF4 binding sites were modestly enriched among SZ risk loci from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (OR=1.56, p=0.03). In total, 130 TCF4 binding sites occurred in 39 of the 108 regions published in 2014. Thirteen genes within the 108 loci had both a TCF4 binding site {+/-}10kb and were differentially expressed in siRNA knockdown experiments of TCF4, suggesting direct TCF4 regulation. These findings confirm TCF4 as an important regulator of neural genes and point towards functional interactions with potential relevance for SZ.",

The method is used as a species specific survey tool for rare or invasive species across a broad range of ecosystems. Recently, eDNA and  metabarcoding have been combined to describe whole communities rather than focusing on single target species. However, whether metabarcoding is as sensitive as targeted approaches for rare species detection remains to be evaluated. The great crested newt Triturus cristatus is a flagship pond species of international conservation concern and the first UK species to be routinely monitored using eDNA. We evaluate whether eDNA metabarcoding has comparable sensitivity to targeted real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cristatus detection. Extracted eDNA samples (N = 532) were screened for T. cristatus by qPCR and analysed for all vertebrate species using High-Throughput Sequencing technology. With qPCR and a detection threshold of 1/12 positive qPCR replicates, newts were detected in 50% of ponds. Detection decreased to 32% when the threshold was increased to 4/12 positive qPCR replicates. With metabarcoding, newts were detected in 34% of ponds without a detection threshold, and in 28% of ponds when a threshold (0.028%) was applied. Therefore, qPCR provided greater detection than metabarcoding but metabarcoding detection with no threshold was equivalent to qPCR with a stringent detection threshold. The proportion of T. cristatus sequences in each sample was positively associated with the number of positive qPCR replicates (qPCR score) suggesting eDNA metabarcoding may be indicative of eDNA concentration. eDNA metabarcoding holds enormous potential for holistic biodiversity assessment and routine freshwater monitoring. We advocate this community approach to freshwater monitoring to guide management and conservation, whereby entire communities can be initially surveyed to best inform use of funding and time for species-specific surveys.",

    "abstract": "The gradual accumulation of sensory evidence is a crucial component of perceptual decision making, but its neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. Given the wide availability of genetic and optical tools for mice, they can be useful model organisms for the study of these phenomena; however, behavioral tools are largely lacking. Here, we describe a new evidence-accumulation task for head-fixed mice navigating in a virtual reality environment. As they navigate down the stem of a virtual T-maze, they see brief pulses of visual evidence on either side, and retrieve a reward on the arm with the highest number of pulses. The pulses occur randomly with Poisson statistics, yielding a diverse yet well-controlled stimulus set, making the data conducive to a variety of computational approaches. A large number of mice of different genotypes were able to learn and consistently perform the task, at levels similar to rats in analogous tasks. They are sensitive to side differences of a single pulse, and their memory of the cues is stable over time. Moreover, using non-parametric as well as modeling approaches, we show that the mice indeed accumulate evidence: they use multiple pulses of evidence from throughout the cue region of the maze to make their decision, albeit with a small overweighting of earlier cues, and their performance is affected by the magnitude but not the duration of evidence. Additionally, analysis of the mice's running patterns revealed that trajectories are fairly stereotyped yet modulated by the amount of sensory evidence, suggesting that the navigational component of this task may provide a continuous readout correlated to the underlying cognitive variables. Our task, which can be readily integrated with state-of-the-art techniques, is thus a valuable tool to study the circuit mechanisms and dynamics underlying perceptual decision making, particularly under more complex behavioral contexts.",

In persistent activity models, memories are represented in persistent or nearly persistent activity patterns across a population of neurons, whereas in sequential models, memories are represented dynamically by a sequential pattern of activity across the population. Experimental evidence for both types of model in the brain has been reported previously. However, it has been unclear under what conditions these two qualitatively different types of solutions emerge in neural circuits. Here, we address this question by training recurrent neural networks on several short-term memory tasks under a wide range of circuit and task manipulations. We show that sequential and nearly persistent solutions are both part of a spectrum that emerges naturally in trained networks under different conditions. Fixed delay durations, tasks with higher temporal complexity, strong network coupling, motion-related dynamic inputs and prior training in a different task favor more sequential solutions, whereas variable delay durations, tasks with low temporal complexity, weak network coupling and symmetric Hebbian short-term synaptic plasticity favor more persistent solutions. Our results help clarify some seemingly contradictory experimental results on the existence of sequential vs. persistent activity based memory mechanisms in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Invariant object recognition, which refers to the ability of precisely and rapidly recognizing objects in the presence of variations, has been a central question in human vision research. The general consensus is that the ventral and dorsal visual streams are the major processing pathways which undertake category and variation encoding in entangled layers. This overlooks the mounting evidence which support the role of peri-frontal areas in category encoding. These recent studies, however, have left open several aspects of visual processing in peri-frontal areas including whether these areas contributed only in active tasks, whether they interacted with peri-occipital areas or processed information independently and differently. To address these concerns, a passive EEG paradigm was designed in which subjects viewed a set of variation-controlled object images. Using multivariate pattern analysis, noticeable category and variation information were observed in occipital, parietal, temporal and prefrontal areas, supporting their contribution to visual processing. Using task specificity indices, phase and Granger causality analyses, three distinct stages of processing were identified which revealed transfer of information between peri-frontal and peri-occipital areas suggesting their parallel and interactive processing of visual information. A brain-plausible computational model supported the possibility of parallel processing mechanisms in peri-occipital and peri-frontal areas. These findings, while advocating previous results on the role of prefrontal areas in object recognition, extend their contribution from active recognition, in which peri-frontal to peri-occipital feedback mechanisms are activated, to the general case of object and variation processing, which is an integral part of visual processing and play role even during passive viewing.",

    "abstract": "2.Bud dormancy and cold hardiness are critical adaptations for surviving winter cold stress for temperate perennial plant species, with shifting temperature-based responses during the winter. The objective of this study was to uncover the relationship between dormancy transition (chilling requirement) and temperature on the loss of cold hardiness and budbreak. Dormant cuttings of Vitis vinifera, V. aestivalis, V. amurensis, and V. riparia were examined to determine the relationship between chilling requirement and temperature on rate of deacclimation (kdeacc). Differential thermal analysis was used to determine kdeacc using mean low temperature exotherms. Effect of chill was evaluated as the deacclimation potential ({psi}deacc), which was the change in kdeacc due to chill accumulation. Budbreak was also evaluated in fully chilled buds at different temperatures. Results indicate that {psi}deacc varies dependent on dormancy state, following a logarithmic response to chill accumulation. The effect of temperature on kdeacc was exponential at low and logarithmic at high temperatures. The combination of {psi}deacc and kdeacc resulted in good prediction of deacclimation. Budbreak phenology was also explained by differences in kdeacc. Deacclimation rates can be used as a quantitative determinant of dormancy transition and budbreak, and to refine models predicting effects of climate change.",

When latency and silent periods were taken into account, contralateral orientations 0{degrees}, 45{degrees}, 90{degrees}, and 315{degrees} were found to best elicit OO MEPs with a likely cortical origin. As expected, the largest FDI MEPs were recorded with an orientation of 45{degrees}, invoking a posterior-anterior (PA) current flow, from the contralateral location.\\n\\nConclusionOrientations traditionally used for FDI were also found suitable for eliciting OO MEPs. Individuals vary more in their optimal coil orientation for eliciting MEPs from OO than for FDI. It is recommended that researchers iteratively probe several orientations when eliciting MEPs from OO. Care must be taken however because several orientations likely induced direct activation of facial muscles.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) develops silently over decades. We cannot easily access and analyse pre-symptomatic brains, so the earliest molecular changes that initiate AD remain unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that the genes mutated in early-onset, dominantly-inherited familial forms of AD (fAD) are evolving particularly rapidly in mice and rats. Fortunately, some non-mammalian vertebrates such as the zebrafish preserve fAD-relevant transcript isoforms of the PRESENILIN (PSEN1 and PSEN2) genes that these rodents have lost. Zebrafish are powerful vertebrate genetic models for many human diseases, but no genetic model of fAD in zebrafish currently exists. We edited the zebrafish genome to model the unique, protein-truncating fAD mutation of human PSEN2, K115fs. Analysing the brain transcriptome and proteome of young (6-month-old) and aged, infertile (24-month-old) wild type and heterozygous fAD-like mutant female sibling zebrafish supports accelerated brain aging and increased glucocorticoid signalling in young fAD-like fish, leading to a transcriptional  inversion into glucocorticoid resistance and vast changes in biological pathways in aged, infertile fAD-like fish. Notably, one of these changes involving microglia-associated immune responses regulated by the ETS transcription factor family is preserved between our zebrafish fAD model and human early-onset AD. Importantly, these changes occur before obvious histopathology and likely in the absence of A{beta}. Our results support the contributions of early metabolic and oxidative stresses to immune and stress responses favouring AD pathogenesis and highlight the value of our fAD-like zebrafish genetic model for elucidating early changes in the brain that promote AD pathogenesis. The success of our approach has important implications for future modelling of AD.",

    "abstract": "In the face of an accelerating global antimicrobial resistance crisis, the determination of bacterial fitness following acquisition of resistance is an expanding area of research, and increased understanding of this process will be crucial to translate in vitro fitness data to successful therapies. Given that crucial clinical treatment situations are guided by in vitro diagnostic testing in an artificial environment far removed from human physiological niches, we used Escherichia coli and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) resistance as a model to understand how such environments could affect the emergence of resistance, associated fitness costs and the predictive value of this data when strains were grown in the more physiologically relevant environments of urine and urothelial organoids. Resistant E. coli isolates were selected for following 24-hour exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of AMC in either M9, ISO or LB broth, followed by growth on LB agar containing AMC. No resistant colonies emerged following growth in M9, whereas resistant isolates were detected from cultures grown in ISO and LB broth. We observed both within and between media-type variability in the levels of resistance and fitness of the resistant mutants grown in LB. MICs and fitness of these resistant strains in different media (M9, ISO, LB, human urine and urothelial organoids) showed considerable variation. Media can therefore have a direct effect on the isolation of mutants that confer resistance to AMC and these mutants can exhibit unpredictable MIC and fitness profiles under different growth conditions. This study highlights the risks in relying on a single culture protocol to predict the behaviour and treatment response of bacteria in vivo and highlights the importance of developing comprehensive experimental designs to ensure effective translation of diagnostic procedures to successful clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have identified the role of localized and distributed cognitive functionality by mapping either local task-related activity or distributed functional connectivity (FC). However, few studies have directly explored the relationship between a brain regions localized task activity and its distributed task FC. Here we systematically evaluated the differential contributions of task-related activity and FC changes to identify a relationship between localized and distributed processes across the cortical hierarchy. We found that across multiple tasks, the magnitude of regional task-evoked activity was high in unimodal areas, but low in transmodal areas. In contrast, we found that task-state FC was significantly reduced in unimodal areas relative to transmodal areas. This revealed a strong negative relationship between localized task activity and distributed FC across cortical regions that was associated with the previously reported principal gradient of macroscale organization. Moreover, this dissociation corresponded to hierarchical cortical differences in the intrinsic timescale estimated from resting-state fMRI and region myelin content estimated from structural MRI. Together, our results contribute to a growing literature illustrating the differential contributions of a hierarchical cortical gradient representing localized and distributed cognitive processes.\n\nHighlightsO_LITask activations and functional connectivity changes are negatively correlated across cortex\nC_LIO_LITask activation and connectivity dissociations reflect differences in localized and distributed processes in cortex\nC_LIO_LIDifferences in localized and distributed processes are associated with differences in intrinsic timescale organization\nC_LIO_LIDifferences in localized and distributed processes are associated with differences in cortical myelin content\nC_LIO_LICortical heterogeneity in localized and distributed processes revealed by activity flow mapping prediction error\nC_LI",

However, it was unknown if this RNA structure-dependent mechanism exists elsewhere and if so, whether a singular RNA fold is required. Here, we demonstrate the existence of authentic RNA structure-dependent xrRNAs in dianthoviruses, plant-infecting viruses unrelated to animal-infecting flaviviruses. These novel xrRNAs have no sequence similarity to known xrRNAs, thus we used a combination of biochemistry and virology to characterize their sequence requirements and mechanism of stopping exoribonucleases. By solving the structure of a dianthovirus xrRNAs by x-ray crystallography, we reveal a complex fold that is very different from the flavivirus xrRNAs. However, both versions of xrRNAs contain a unique topological feature that is created by a different set of intramolecular contacts; this may be a defining structural feature of xrRNAs. Remarkably, the dianthovirus xrRNA can use  co-degradational remodeling, exploiting the exoribonucleases degradation-linked helicase activity to help form their resistant structure; such a mechanism has not previously been reported. Convergent evolution has created RNA structure-dependent exoribonuclease resistance in different contexts, which establishes it as a general RNA maturation mechanism and defines xrRNAs as an authentic functional class of RNAs.",

    "abstract": "A study was undertaken to identify conserved proteins that are encoded either within, or directly adjacent to, cas gene cassettes of Type III CRISPR-Cas interference modules. These Type III modules are especially versatile functionally and have been shown to target and degrade dsDNA, ssDNA and ssRNA. In addition, the interference gene cassettes are frequently intertwined with other accessory genes, including genes encoding CARF domains, some of which are likely to be cofunctional. Using a comparative genomics approach, and defining a Type III association score accounting for coevolution and specificity of flanking genes, we identified and classified 39 new Type III associated gene families. Most archaeal and bacterial Type III modules were seen to be flanked by several accessory genes, around half of which did not encode CARF domains and remain of unknown function. Non-CARF accessory genes were found to be more diverse than their CARF counterparts, encoding nuclease, helicase, protease, ATPase, transporter and transmembrane domains and including a considerable fraction that encoded no known domains. The diversity of non-CARF Type III accessory genes found in this study suggests that additional families exist which remain undetected because of the limited number of annotated genomes currently available. The method employed is scalable for potential application on metagenomic data once automated pipelines for annotation of CRISPR-Cas systems have been developed. All accessory genes found in this study are presented online in a readily accessible and searchable format for researchers to audit their model organism of choice: http://accessory.crispr.dk.",

We used HTS to obtain ancient DNA from the little bush moa (Anomalopteryx didiformis), one of the iconic species of large, flightless birds that became extinct following human settlement of New Zealand in the 13 th century. In addition to a complete mitochondrial genome at 249.9X depth of coverage, we recover almost 900 Mb of the moa nuclear genome by mapping reads to a high quality reference genome for the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae). This first nuclear genome assembly for moa covers approximately 75% of the 1.2 Gb emu reference with sequence contiguity sufficient to identify more than 85% of bird universal single-copy orthologs. From this assembly, we isolate 40 polymorphic microsatellites to serve as a community resource for future population-level studies in moa. We also compile data for a suite of candidate genes associated with vertebrate limb development and show that the wingless moa phenotype is likely not attributable to gene loss or pseudogenization among this candidate set.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHigh throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionized the field of ancient DNA (aDNA) by facilitating recovery of nuclear DNA for greater inference of evolutionary processes in extinct species than is possible from mitochondrial DNA alone. We used HTS to obtain ancient DNA from the little bush moa (Anomalopteryx didiformis), one of the iconic species of large, flightless birds that became extinct following human settlement of New Zealand in the 13 th century. In addition to a complete mitochondrial genome at 249.9X depth of coverage, we recover almost 900 Mb of the moa nuclear genome by mapping reads to a high quality reference genome for the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae). This first nuclear genome assembly for moa covers approximately 75% of the 1.2 Gb emu reference with sequence contiguity sufficient to identify more than 85% of bird universal single-copy orthologs. From this assembly, we isolate 40 polymorphic microsatellites to serve as a community resource for future population-level studies in moa. We also compile data for a suite of candidate genes associated with vertebrate limb development and show that the wingless moa phenotype is likely not attributable to gene loss or pseudogenization among this candidate set. We also identify potential function-altering coding sequence variants in moa for future experimental assays.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for genome-wide analysis of gene expression requires shredding original transcripts into small fragments for short-read sequencing. In bacteria, the resulting fragmented information hides operon complexity. Additionally, in-vivo processing of transcripts confounds the accurate identification of the 5 and 3 ends of operons. Here we developed a novel methodology called SMRT-Cappable-seq that combines the isolation of unfragmented primary transcripts with single-molecule long read sequencing. Applied to E. coli, this technology results in an unprecedented definition of the transcriptome with 34% of the known operons being extended by at least one gene. Furthermore, 40% of transcription termination sites have read-through that alters the gene content of the operons. As a result, most of the bacterial genes are present in multiple operon variants reminiscent of eukaryotic splicing. By providing an unprecedented granularity in the operon structure, this study represents an important resource for the study of prokaryotic gene network and regulation.",

Whereas the binding profiles of multiple transcription factors (TFs) have been investigated, integrative analysis with the large body of public data available so as to provide an overview of the function of such noncoding regions has remained a challenge. Here we have fully integrated public ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data (n ~ 70,000), including those for 743 human transcription factors (TFs) with 97 million binding sites, and have devised a data- mining platform --designated ChIP-Atlas--to identify significant TF-genome, TF-gene, and TF-TF interactions. Using this platform, we found that TFs enriched at macrophage or T-cell enhancers also accumulated around risk loci for autoimmune diseases, whereas those enriched at hepatocyte or macrophage enhancers were preferentially detected at loci associated with HDL-cholesterol levels. Of note, we identified \\\"hotspots\\\" around such risk loci that accumulated multiple TFs and are therefore candidates for causal variants. Integrative analysis of public chromatin-profiling data is thus able to identify TFs and tissues associated with heritable disorders.",

Probable mutations occur at sites of frequent AID activity, while improbable mutations occur where AID activity is infrequent. One bottleneck for induction of bnAbs is the evolution of viral envelopes (Envs) that can select bnAb B cell receptors (BCR) with improbable mutations. Here we define the probability of bnAb mutations and demonstrate the functional significance of key improbable mutations in three bnAb B cell lineages. We show that bnAbs are enriched for improbable mutations, implying their elicitation will be critical for successful vaccine induction of potent bnAb B cell lineages. We outline a mutation-guided vaccine strategy for identification of Envs that can select B cells with BCRs with key improbable mutations required for bnAb development. Our analysis suggests that through generations of viral escape, Env trimers evolved to hide in low probability regions of antibody sequence space.",

    "abstract": "Diphthamide is a modified histidine residue which is uniquely present in archaeal and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2), an essential GTPase responsible for catalyzing the coordinated translocation of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome. In part due to the role of diphthamide in maintaining translational fidelity, it was previously assumed that diphthamide biosynthesis genes (dph) are conserved across all eukaryotes and archaea. Here, comparative analysis of new and existing genomes reveals that some archaea (i.e., members of the Asgard superphylum, Geoarchaea, and Korarchaeota) and eukaryotes (i.e., parabasalids) lack dph. In addition, while EF-2 was thought to exist as a single copy in archaea, many of these dph-lacking archaeal genomes encode a second EF-2 paralog missing key-residues required for diphthamide modification and for normal translocase function, perhaps suggesting functional divergence linked to loss of diphthamide biosynthesis. Interestingly, some Heimdallarchaeota previously suggested to be most closely related to the eukaryotic ancestor maintain dph genes and a single gene encoding canonical EF-2. Our findings reveal that the ability to produce diphthamide, once thought to be a universal feature in archaea and eukaryotes, has been lost multiple times during evolution, and suggest that anticipated compensatory mechanisms evolved independently.",

Decades of psychophysical measurements have quantified the nature of these comparative interactions on a coarse scale. How such findings generalize to a cellular scale remains unclear. To answer that question, we quantified the influence of surrounding light on the appearance of spots targeted to individual cones. The eyes aberrations were corrected with adaptive optics and retinal position was precisely tracked in real-time to compensate for natural movement. Subjects reported the color appearance of each spot. A majority of L-and M-cones consistently gave rise to the sensation of white, while a smaller group repeatedly elicited hue sensations. When blue sensations were reported they were more likely mediated by M- than L-cones. Blue sensations were elicited from M-cones against a short-wavelength light that preferentially elevated the quantal catch in surrounding S-cones, while stimulation of the same cones against a white background elicited green sensations. In one of two subjects, proximity to S-cones increased the probability of blue reports when M-cones were probed. We propose that M-cone increments excited both green and blue opponent pathways, but the relative activity of neighboring cones favored one pathway over the other.",

However, despite the predicted loss-of-function nature of some of these de novo mutations, the affected individuals are heterozygous carriers, which would suggest that most of these candidate genes are haploinsufficient and/or that these mutations lead to expression of dominant-negative forms of the protein. Here, we tested this hypothesis with the gene Nuak1, recently identified as a candidate ASD gene and that we previously identified for its role in the development of cortical connectivity. We report that Nuak1 is happloinsufficient in mice in regard to its function in cortical axon branching in vitro and in vivo. Nuak1+/- mice show a combination of abnormal behavioral traits ranging from defective memory consolidation in a spatial learning task, defects in social novelty (but not social preference) and abnormal sensorimotor gating and prepulse inhibition of the startle response. Overall, our results demonstrate that Nuak1 haploinsufficiency leads to defects in the development of cortical connectivity and a complex array of behavorial deficits compatible with ASD, intellectual disability and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Current myoelectric prostheses allow upper-limb amputees to regain voluntary motor control of their artificial limb by exploiting residual muscle function in the forearm1. However, the over-reliance on visual cues resulting from a lack of sensory feedback is a common complaint2,3. Recently, several groups have provided tactile feedback in upper-limb amputees by using implanted electrodes4,5,6,7,8, surface nerve stimulation9,10 or sensory substitution11,12. These approaches have led to improved function and prosthesis embodiment4,5,6,7,13,14. Nevertheless, the provided information remains limited to a subset of the rich sensory cues available to healthy individuals. More specifically, proprioception, the sense of limb position and movement, is predominantly absent from current systems. Here we show that sensory substitution based on intraneural stimulation can deliver position feedback in real-time and in conjunction with somatotopic tactile feedback. This approach allowed two trans-radial amputees to regain high and close-to-natural remapped proprioceptive acuity, with a median joint angle reproduction accuracy of 9.1{degrees} and a median threshold to detection of passive movements of 9.5{degrees}, which was compatible with results obtained in healthy subjects15,16,17. The simultaneous delivery of position information and somatotopic tactile feedback allowed both amputees to discriminate object size and compliance with high levels of accuracy (75.5%). These results demonstrate that touch information delivered via somatotopic neural stimulation and position information delivered via sensory substitution can be exploited simultaneously and efficiently by trans-radial amputees. This study paves the way towards more sophisticated bidirectional bionic limbs conveying rich, multimodal sensations.",

    "abstract": "At least two distinct processes have been identified by which motor commands are adapted according to movement-related feedback: reward based learning and sensory error based learning. In sensory error based learning, mappings between sensory targets and motor commands are recalibrated according to sensory error feedback. In reward based learning, motor commands are associated with subjective value, such that successful actions are reinforced. We designed two tasks to isolate reward and sensory error based motor adaptation, and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from humans to identify and dissociate the neural correlates of reward and sensory error processing. We designed a visuomotor rotation task to isolate sensory error based learning which was induced by altered visual feedback of hand position. In a reward learning task, we isolated reward based learning induced by binary reward feedback that was decoupled from the visual target. We found that a fronto-central event related potential called the feedback related negativity (FRN) was elicited specifically by reward feedback but not sensory error feedback. A more posterior component called the P300 was evoked by feedback in both tasks. In the visuomotor rotation task, P300 amplitude was increased by sensory error induced by perturbed visual feedback, and was correlated with learning rate. In the reward learning task, P300 amplitude was increased by reward relative to non reward and by surprise regardless of feedback valence. We propose that during motor adaptation, the FRN might specifically mark reward prediction error while the P300 might reflect processing which is modulated more generally by prediction error.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyWe studied the event related potentials evoked by feedback stimuli during motor adaptation tasks that isolate reward and sensory error learning mechanisms. We found that the feedback related negativity was specifically elicited by reward feedback, while the P300 was observed in both tasks. These results reveal neural processes associated with different learning mechanisms and elucidate which classes of errors, from a computational standpoint, elicit the FRN and P300.",

We find the loss of adhesion rapidly disorganizes the Golgi in mouse and human fibroblast cells, its integrity restored rapidly on re-adhesion to fibronectin (but not poly-l-lysine coated beads) along the microtubule network. Adhesion regulates the trans-Golgi more prominently than the cis /cis-medial Golgi, though they show no fallback into the ER making this reorganization distinct from known Golgi fragmentation. This is controlled by an adhesion-dependent drop and recovery of Arf1 activation, mediated through the Arf1 GEF BIG1/2 over GBF1. Constitutively active Arf1 disrupts this regulation and prevents Golgi disorganization in non-adherent cells. Adhesion regulates active Arf1 binding to the microtubule minus-end motor protein dynein to control Golgi reorganization, which ciliobrevin blocks. This regulation by adhesion controls Golgi function, promoting cell surface glycosylation on the loss of adhesion that constitutively active Arf1 blocks. This study hence identifies cell-matrix adhesion to be a novel regulator of Arf1 activation, controlling Golgi organization and function in anchorage-dependent cells.\\n\\nSummary StatementThis study identifies a role for cell-matrix adhesion in regulating organelle (Golgi) architecture and function which could have implications for multiple cellular pathways and function.",

    "abstract": "T cell receptor-Major histocompatibility complex (TCR-MHC) affinities span a wide range in a polyclonal T cell response, yet it is undefined how affinity shapes long-term properties of CD8 T cells during chronic infection with persistent antigen. Here, we investigate how the affinity of the TCR-MHC interaction shapes the phenotype of memory CD8 T cells in the chronically Toxoplasma gondii-infected brain. We employed CD8 T cells from three lines of transnuclear (TN) mice that harbour in their endogenous loci different T cell receptors specific for the same Toxoplasma antigenic epitope ROP7. The three TN CD8 T cell clones span a wide range of affinities to MHCI-ROP7. These three CD8 T cell clones have a distinct and fixed hierarchy in terms of effector function in response to the antigen measured as proliferation capacity, trafficking, T cell maintenance and memory formation. In particular, the T cell clone of lowest affinity does not home to the brain. The two higher affinity T cell clones show differences in establishing resident memory populations (CD103+) in the brain with the higher affinity clone persisting longer in the host during chronic infection. Transcriptional profiling of naive and activated ROP7-specific CD8 T cells revealed that Klf2 encoding a transcription factor that is known to be a negative marker for T cell trafficking is upregulated in the activated lowest affinity ROP7 clone. Our data thus suggest that TCR-MHC affinity dictates memory CD8 T cell fate at the site of infection.",

    "abstract": "The Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacytelase (NuRD) complex is a co-repressive complex involved in many pathological and physiological processes in the cell. Previous studies have identified one of its components, Mbd3, as a potent inhibitor for reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. Following OSKM induction, early and partial depletion of Mbd3 protein followed by applying naive ground-state pluripotency conditions, results in a highly efficient and near-deterministic generation of mouse iPS cells. Increasing evidence indicates that the NuRD complex assumes multiple mutually exclusive protein complexes, and it remains unclear whether the deterministic iPSC phenotype is the result of a specific NuRD sub complex. Since complete ablation of Mbd3 blocks somatic cell proliferation, here we aimed to identify alternative ways to block Mbd3-dependent NuRD activity by identifying additional functionally relevant components of the Mbd3/NuRD complex during early stages of reprogramming. We identified Gatad2a (also known as P66), a relatively uncharacterized NuRD-specific subunit, whose complete deletion does not impact somatic cell proliferation, yet specifically disrupts Mbd3/NuRD repressive activity on the pluripotency circuit during both stem cell differentiation and reprogramming to pluripotency. Complete ablation of Gatad2a in somatic cells, but not Gatad2b, results in a deterministic naive iPSC reprogramming where up to 100% of donor somatic cells successfully complete the process within 8 days. Genetic and biochemical analysis established a distinct sub-complex within the NuRD complex (Gatad2a-Chd4-Mbd3) as the functional and biochemical axis blocking reestablishment of murine naive pluripotency. Disassembly of this axis by depletion of Gatad2a, results in resistance to conditions promoting exit of naive pluripotency and delays differentiation. We further highlight context- and posttranslational dependent modifications of the NuRD complex affecting its interactions and assembly in different cell states. Collectively, our work unveils the distinct functionality, composition and interactions of Gatad2a-Chd4-Mbd3/NuRD subcomplex during the resolution and establishment of mouse naive pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "The GLP-1 class of peptide agonists has been shown to exert regulatory key roles in both diabetes, obesity and related complications. Given the short half-life of GLP-1 its use has been historically discouraged. We developed polymeric microparticles loaded with either human GLP-1 (7-37) or liraglutide peptides by double emulsion and solvent evaporation approach. The size distribution of all formulations was of about 30-50 m. The in vitro kinetic release assays showed a sustained release of the peptides extending up to 30 to 40 days with varying profiles. Morphologic analysis demonstrated a more regular particle surface for those comprising polymers PLA, PLA-PEG and PLGA. In vivo evaluation in Swiss male mice demonstrated a similar extension of effect of decreasing in body weight gain for up to 25 days after a single subcutaneous administration of either hGLP-1 or liraglutide peptide-loaded microparticles (200 g peptide / kg body weight) compared to controls. These demonstrate the effectiveness of hGLP-1 as a therapeutic agent in long-term, continuous release from peptide-load microparticles, and thus its plausibility as an unmodified therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "Modern microscopy modalities create a data deluge with gigabytes of data generated each second, and terabytes per day. Storing and processing these data is a severe bottleneck, not fully alleviated by data compression. We argue that this is because images are processed as regular grids of pixels. To address the root of the problem, we here propose a content-adaptive representation of fluorescence microscopy images called the Adaptive Particle Representation (APR). The APR replaces the regular grid of pixels with particles positioned according to image content. This overcomes storage bottlenecks, as data compression does, but additionally overcomes memory and processing bottlenecks, since the APR can directly be used in processing without going back to pixels. We present the ideas, concepts, and algorithms of the APR and validate them using noisy 3D image data. We show that the APR represents the content of an image while maintaining image quality. We then show that the adaptivity of the APR provides orders of magnitude benefits across a range of image processing tasks. Therefore, the APR provides a simple, extendable, and efficient content-aware representation of images that relaxes current data and processing bottlenecks.",

    "abstract": "Left-right laterality is an important aspect of human brain organization for which the genetic basis is poorly understood. Using RNA sequencing data we contrasted gene expression in left- and right-sided samples from several structures of the anterior central nervous systems of post mortem human embryos and fetuses. While few individual genes stood out as significantly lateralized, most structures showed evidence of laterality of their overall transcriptomic profiles. These left-right differences showed overlap with age-dependent changes in expression, indicating lateralized maturation rates, but not consistently in left-right orientation over all structures. Brain asymmetry may therefore originate in multiple locations, or if there is a single origin, it is earlier than 5 weeks post conception, with structure-specific lateralized processes already underway by this age. This pattern is broadly consistent with the weak correlations reported between various aspects of adult brain laterality, such as language dominance and handedness.",
