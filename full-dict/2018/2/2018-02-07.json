    "abstract": "HIV has a high mutation rate, which contributes to its ability to evolve quickly. However, we know little about the fitness costs of individual HIV mutations in vivo, their distribution and the different factors shaping the viral fitness landscape. We calculated the mean frequency of transition mutations at 870 sites of the pol gene in 160 patients, allowing us to determine the cost of these mutations. As expected, we found high costs for non-synonymous and nonsense mutations as compared to synonymous mutations. In addition, we found that non-synonymous mutations that lead to drastic amino acid changes are twice as costly as those that do not and mutations that create new CpG dinucleotides are also twice as costly as those that do not. We also found that G[-&gt;]A and C[-&gt;]T mutations are more costly than A[-&gt;]G mutations. We anticipate that our new in vivo frequency-based approach will provide insights into the fitness landscape and evolvability of not only HIV, but a variety of microbes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHIVs high mutation rate allows it to evolve quickly. However, most mutations probably reduce the virus ability to replicate - they are costly to the virus. Until now, the actual cost of mutations is not well understood. We used within-patient mutation frequencies to estimate the cost of 870 HIV mutations in vivo. As expected, we found high costs for non-synonymous and nonsense mutations. In addition, we found surprisingly high costs for mutations that lead to drastic amino acid changes, mutations that create new CpG sites (possibly because they trigger the hosts immune system), and G[-&gt;]A and C[-&gt;]T mutations. Our results demonstrate the power of analyzing mutant frequencies from in vivo viral populations to study costs of mutations. A better understanding of fitness costs will help to predict the evolution of HIV.",

    "abstract": "Over 90% of genetic variants associated with complex human traits map to non-coding regions, but little is understood about how they modulate gene regulation in health and disease. One possible mechanism is that genetic variants affect the activity of one or more cis-regulatory elements leading to gene expression variation in specific cell types. To identify such cases, we analyzed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq profiles from activated CD4+ T cells of up to 105 healthy donors. We found that regions of accessible chromatin (ATAC-peaks) are co-accessible at kilobase and megabase resolution, in patterns consistent with the 3D organization of chromosomes measured by in situ Hi-C in T cells. 15% of genetic variants located within ATAC-peaks affected the accessibility of the corresponding peak through disrupting binding sites for transcription factors important for T cell differentiation and activation. These ATAC quantitative trait nucleotides (ATAC-QTNs) have the largest effects on co-accessible peaks, are associated with gene expression from the same aliquot of cells, are rarely affecting core binding motifs, and are enriched for autoimmune disease variants. Our results provide insights into how natural genetic variants modulate cis- regulatory elements, in isolation or in concert, to influence gene expression in primary immune cells that play a key role in many human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors are thought to generate force and directional motion via nonequilibrium switching between energy surfaces. Because all enzymes can undergo such switching, we hypothesized that the ability to generate rotary motion and torque is not unique to highly adapted biological motor proteins, but is instead a common feature of enzymes. We used molecular dynamics simulations to compute energy surfaces for hundreds of torsions in three enzymes, adenosine kinase, protein kinase A, and HIV-1 protease, and used these energy surfaces within a kinetic model that accounts for intersurface switching and intrasurface probability flows. When substrate is out of equilibrium with product, we find computed torsion rotation rates up ~140 cycle s-1, with stall torques up to ~2 kcal mol-1 cycle-1, and power outputs up to ~50 kcal mol-1 s-1. We argue that these enzymes are instances of a general phenomenon of directional probability flows on asymmetric energy surfaces for systems out of equilibrium. Thus, we conjecture that cyclic probability fluxes, corresponding to rotations of torsions and higher-order collective variables, exist in any chiral molecule driven between states in a non-equilibrium manner; we call this the Asymmetry-Directionality conjecture. This is expected to apply as well to synthetic chiral molecules switched in a nonequilibrium manner between energy surfaces by light, redox chemistry, or catalysis.",

    "abstract": "A major problem in the design of synthetic genetic circuits is robustness to perturbations and uncertainty. Because of this, there have been significant efforts in recent years in finding approaches to implement integral control in genetic circuits. Integral controllers have the unique ability to make the output of a process adapt perfectly to disturbances. However, implementing an integral controller is challenging in living cells. This is because a key aspect of any integral controller is a \\\"memory\\\" element that stores the accumulation (integral) of the error between the output and its desired set-point. The ability to realize such a memory element in living cells is fundamentally challenged by the fact that all biomolecules dilute as cells grow, resulting in a \\\"leaky\\\" memory that gradually fades away. As a consequence, the adaptation property is lost. Here, we propose a general principle for designing integral controllers such that the performance is practically unaffected by dilution. In particular, we mathematically prove that if the reactions implementing the integral controller are all much faster than dilution, then the adaptation error due to integration leakiness becomes negligible. We exemplify this design principle with two synthetic genetic circuits aimed at reaching adaptation of gene expression to fluctuations in cellular resources. Our results provide concrete guidance on the biomolecular processes that are most appropriate for implementing integral controllers in living cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearch over the last 10 years highlights the increasing importance of hybridization between species as a major force structuring the evolution of genomes and potentially providing raw material for adaptation by natural and/or sexual selection. Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity dxy and Pattersons D. The resulting statistic, the Basic distance fraction (Bdf), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published fd and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on CRAN. The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework.\\n\\nConclusionWe present a new distance based statistic Bdf that avoids the pitfalls of Pattersons D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Student microbial ecology laboratory courses are often conducted as condensed courses in which theory and wet lab work are combined in a very intensive short time period. In last decades, the study of marine microbial ecology is increasingly reliant on molecular-based methods, and as a result many of the research projects conducted in such courses require sequencing that is often not available on site and may take more time than a typical course allows. In this work, we describe a protocol combining molecular and functional methods for analyzing proteorhodopsins (PRs), with visible results in only 4-5 days, that do not rely on sequencing. PRs were discovered in oceanic surface waters two decades ago, and have since been observed in different marine environments and diverse taxa, including the abundant alphaproteobacterial SAR11 group. PR subgroups are currently known to absorb green and blue light, and their distribution was previously explained by prevailing light conditions - green pigments at the surface and blue pigments in deeper waters, as blue light travels deeper in the water column. To detect PR in environmental samples, we created a chimeric plasmid suitable for direct expression of PRs using PCR amplification and functional analysis in Escherichia coli cells. Using this assay, we discovered several exceptional cases of PRs whose phenotypes differed from those predicted based on sequence only, including a previously undescribed yellow-light absorbing PRs. We applied this assay in two 10-days marine microbiology courses and found it to greatly enhance students laboratory experience, enabling them to gain rapid visual feedback and colorful reward for their work. Furthermore we expect this assay to promote the use of functional assays for the discovery of new rhodopsin variants.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiome composition and function are symbiotically linked with host health, and altered in metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Three recognized mechanisms exist by which the microbiome influences the gut-brain axis: modification of autonomic/sensorimotor connections, immune activation, and neuroendocrine pathway regulation. We hypothesized interactions between circulating gut-derived microbial metabolites and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also contribute to the gut-brain axis. Propionate, produced from dietary substrates by colonic bacteria, stimulates intestinal gluconeogenesis and is associated with reduced stress behaviours, but its potential endocrine role has not been addressed. After demonstrating expression of the propionate receptor FFAR3 on human brain endothelium, we examined the impact of a physiologically relevant propionate concentration (1 M) on BBB properties in vitro. Propionate inhibited pathways associated with non-specific microbial infections via a CD14-dependent mechanism, suppressed expression of LRP-1 and protected the BBB from oxidative stress via NRF2 (NFE2L2) signaling. Together, these results suggest gut-derived microbial metabolites interact with the BBB, representing a fourth facet of the gut-brain axis that warrants further attention.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of  big data frequently involves statistical comparison of millions of competing hypotheses to discover hidden processes underlying observed patterns of data, for example in the search for genetic determinants of disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) is considered the strongest protection against false positives, but makes it difficult to reach the multiple testing-corrected significance threshold. Here I introduce the harmonic mean p-value (HMP) which controls the FWER while greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the HMP easily combines information to detect statistically significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant hypotheses in examples of a human GWAS for neuroticism and a joint human-pathogen GWAS for hepatitis C viral load. The HMP simultaneously tests all combinations of hypotheses, allowing the smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be sought. The power of the HMP to detect significant hypothesis groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to detect significant hypotheses, even though the latter only controls the weaker false discovery rate (FDR). The HMP has broad implications for the analysis of large datasets because it enhances the potential for scientific discovery.",

Consequently, X and Y chromosomes initially have similar gene content, but ongoing Y degeneration leads to reduced Y gene expression and eventual Y gene loss. The resulting imbalance in gene expression between Y genes and the rest of the genome is expected to reduce male fitness, especially when protein networks have components from both autosomes and sex chromosomes. A diverse set of dosage compensating mechanisms that alleviates these negative effects has been described in animals2-4. However, the early steps in the evolution of dosage compensation remain unknown and dosage compensation is poorly understood in plants5. Here we show a novel dosage compensation mechanism in the evolutionarily young XY sex determination system of the plant Silene latifolia. Genomic imprinting results in higher expression from the maternal X chromosome in both males and females. This compensates for reduced Y expression in males but results in X overexpression in females and may be detrimental. It could represent a transient early stage in the evolution of dosage compensation. Our finding has striking resemblance to the first stage proposed by Ohno for the evolution of X inactivation in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular simulation models have provided immense, often general, insight into the complex behavior of condensed-phase systems, but suffer from a lost connection to the true dynamical properties of the underlying system. In general, the physics that is built into a model shapes the free-energy landscape, restricting the attainable static and kinetic properties. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into the property interrelationships resulting from these restrictions, for a representative system of the helix-coil transition. Inspired by high-throughput studies, we systematically vary force-field parameters and monitor their structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties. The focus of our investigation is a simple coarse-grained model, which accurately represents the underlying structural ensemble, i.e., effectively avoids sterically-forbidden configurations. As a result of this built-in physics, we observe a rather large restriction in the topology of the networks characterizing the simulation kinetics. When screening across force-field parameters, we find that structurally-accurate models also best reproduce the kinetics, suggesting structural-kinetic relationships for these models. Additionally, an investigation into thermodynamic properties reveals a link between the cooperativity of the transition and the network topology at a single reference temperature.",

    "abstract": "The development of chemotherapeutic resistance resulting in tumor relapse is largely the consequence of the mechanism of competitive release of pre-existing resistant tumor cells selected for regrowth after chemotherapeutic agents attack the previously dominant chemo-sensitive population. We introduce a prisoners dilemma mathematical model based on the replicator of three competing cell populations: healthy (cooperators), sensitive (defectors), and resistant (defectors) cells. The model is shown to recapitulate prostate-specific antigen measurement data from three clinical trials for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with 1) prednisone, 2) mitoxantrone and prednisone and 3) docetaxel and prednisone. Continuous maximum tolerated dose schedules reduce the sensitive cell population, initially shrinking tumor volume, but subsequently \\\"release\\\" the resistant cells to re-populate and re-grow the tumor in a resistant form. Importantly, a model fit of prostate data shows the emergence of a positive fitness cost associated with a majority of patients for each drug, without predetermining a cost in the model a priori. While the specific mechanism associated with this cost may be very different for each of the drugs, a measurable fitness cost emerges in each. The evolutionary model allows us to quantify responses to conventional therapeutic strategies as well as to design adaptive strategies.",

Any explanation concerning this major transition should involve mechanisms that can simultaneously explain the marvellous intricacies manifest in the aforementioned characteristics, and an account of the evolution of such traits. Here we propose a noise-driven differentiation (NDD) model. The reliance on noise, in place of a more mechanistic approach, makes the NDD model a more suitable approach to explain differentiation and self-organization. Furthermore, our model sheds some light on the possible evolutionary origins of these biological innovations. To test the NDD model, we utilize a model of cell aggregation.

    "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is regulated by kinases that phosphorylate the  subunit of translation initiation factor 2 and phosphatases that dephosphorylate it. Genetic and biochemical observations indicate that the eIF2P-directed holophosphatase - a therapeutic target in diseases of protein misfolding - is comprised of a regulatory, PPP1R15, and a catalytic, Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) subunit. In mammals, there are two isoforms of the regulatory subunit, PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B, with overlapping roles in promoting the essential function of eIF2P dephosphorylation. However, conflicting reports have appeared regarding the requirement for an additional co-factor, G-actin, in enabling substrate-specific de-phosphorylation by PPP1R15-containing PP1 holoenzymes. An additional concern relates to the sensitivity of the PPP1R15A-containing PP1 holoenzyme to the [(ochlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidines (Sephin1 or Guanabenz), small molecule proteostasis modulators. It has been suggested that the source and method of purification of the PP1 catalytic subunit and the presence or absence of an N-terminal repeat-containing region in the PPP1R15A regulatory subunit might influence both the requirement for G-actin by the eIF2P-directed holophosphatase and its sensitivity to inhibitors. Here we report that in the absence of G-actin, PPP1R15A regulatory subunits were unable to accelerate eIF2P dephosphorylation beyond that affected by a catalytic subunit alone, whether PPP1R15A regulatory subunit had or lacked the N-terminal repeat-containing region and whether paired with native PP1 purified from rabbit muscle, or recombinant PP1 expressed in and purified from bacteria. Furthermore, none of the PPP1R15A-containing PP1c holophosphatases were inhibited by Sephin1 or Guanabenz.",

While infant leukemias typically carry few somatic lesions, we identified a case with over 100 somatic point mutations per megabase and here report unique genomic-features of this case.\\n\\nResultsThe patient presented at 82 days of age, one of the earliest manifestations of cancer hypermutation recorded. The transcriptional profile showed global similarities to canonical cases. Coding lesions were predominantly clonal and almost entirely targeting alleles reported in human genetic variation databases with a notable exception in the mismatch repair gene, MSH2. There were no rare germline alleles or somatic mutations affecting proof-reading polymerase genes POLE or POLD1, however there was a predicted damaging mutation in the error prone replicative polymerase, POLK. The patients diagnostic leukemia transcriptome was depleted of rare and low-frequency germline alleles due to loss-of-heterozygosity, while somatic point mutations targeted low-frequency and common human alleles in proportions that offset this discrepancy. Somatic signatures of ultra-mutations were highly correlated with germline single nucleotide polymorphic sites indicating a common role for 5-methylcytosine deamination, DNA mismatch repair and DNA adducts.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest similar molecular processes shaping population-scale human genome variation also underlies the rapid evolution of an infant ultra-mutated leukemia.",

Although many metrics have been designed to evaluate the current normalization methods, the different metrics yield inconsistent results. In this study, we designed a new metric named Area Under normalized CV threshold Curve (AUCVC) and applied it with another metric mSCC to evaluate 14 commonly used normalization methods, achieving consistency in our evaluation results using both bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data from the same library construction protocol. This consistency has validated the underlying theory that a sucessiful normalization method simultaneously maximizes the number of uniform genes and minimizes the correlation between the expression profiles of gene pairs. This consistency can also be used to analyze the quality of gene expression data. The gene expression data, normalization methods and evaluation metrics used in this study have been included in an R package named NormExpression.

Competition brings about trade-offs of shared limited resources among the cellular components, and it thus introduce a hidden layer of regulatory mechanism by connecting components even without direct physical interactions. By abstracting the analogous competition mechanism behind diverse molecular systems, we built a unified coarse-grained competition motif model to systematically compare experimental evidences in these processes and analyzed general properties shared behind them. We could predict in what molecular environments competition would reveal threshold behavior or display a negative linear dependence. We quantified how competition can shape regulator-target dose-response curve, modulate dynamic response speed, control target expression noise, and introduce correlated fluctuations between targets. This work uncovered the complexity and generality of molecular competition effect, which might act as a hidden regulatory mechanism with multiple functions throughout biological networks in both natural and synthetic systems.",

These assemblies form the basis to compare the evolutionary dynamics of wheat genomes on a megabase-scale.\\n\\nResultsHere, we provide a comparative sequence analysis of the ~700-megabase chromosome 2D between two bread wheat genotypes - the old landrace Chinese Spring and the elite Swiss spring wheat line  CH Campala Lr22a. There was a high degree of sequence conservation between the two chromosomes. Analysis of large structural variations revealed four large insertions/deletions (InDels) of >100 kb. Based on the molecular signatures at the breakpoints, unequal crossing over and double-strand break repair were identified as the evolutionary mechanisms that caused these InDels. Three of the large InDels affected copy number of NLRs, a gene family involved in plant immunity. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density revealed three haploblocks of ~8 Mb, ~9 Mb and ~48 Mb with a 35-fold increased SNP density compared to the rest of the chromosome.\\n\\nConclusionsThis comparative analysis of two high-quality chromosome assemblies enabled a comprehensive assessment of large structural variations.

    "abstract": "The visual system can use conceptual information to search for targets even in the absence of clear featural signifiers1, and visual saccades are often directed at target objects defined by conceptual content2. These abilities are a core component of our facility with the visual world. Here, we evaluate whether contingent mechanisms of visual attention, known to trigger in response to target features such as motion, color or luminance3, are also triggered by visual patterns that match conceptually specified categories. These pre-registered experiments provide convergent behavioral and electrophysiological support that covert spatial attention is rapidly triggered by natural image exemplars from superordinate conceptually described target sets such as dinner food or four-legged animal, even when each target was viewed only once. In the behavioral experiment when two targets were presented with onsets separated by only 167ms, subjects reported the second target more often when it was in the same spatial location as the first. In the EEG experiment, images elicited clear N2pc and P3 components only when they matched the conceptually specified target set. The latency of the N2pc peaked at roughly 250ms, which is comparable to that commonly found in other N2pc studies for simpler stimulus types. These results suggest that vision quickly decodes conceptual information from natural images and selectively deploys spatial attention to locations containing information that matches current search goals.",

    "abstract": "Carboxy-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) occur in all three domains of life. In bacteria some of them have been associated with virulence. However, the precise roles of bacterial CTPs are poorly understood and few direct proteolytic substrates have been identified. One bacterial CTP is the CtpA protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is required for type III secretion system function, and for virulence in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. Here, we have investigated the function of CtpA in P. aeruginosa and identified some of the proteins it cleaves. We discovered that CtpA forms a complex with a previously uncharacterized protein, which we have named LbcA (lipoprotein binding partner of CtpA). LbcA is required for CtpA activity in vivo and promotes its activity in vitro. We have also identified four proteolytic substrates of CtpA, all of which are uncharacterized proteins predicted to cleave the peptide cross-links within peptidoglycan. Consistent with this, a ctpA null mutant was found to have fewer peptidoglycan cross-links than the wild type and grew slowly in salt-free medium. Intriguingly, the accumulation of just one of the CtpA substrates was required for some {Delta}ctpA mutant phenotypes, including the defective T3SS. We propose that LbcA*CtpA is a proteolytic complex in the P. aeruginosa cell envelope, which controls the activity of several peptidoglycan cross-link hydrolases by degrading them. Furthermore, based on these and other findings we suggest that many bacterial CTPs might be similarly controlled by partner proteins as part of a widespread mechanism to control peptidoglycan hydrolase activity.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacterial carboxy-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are widely conserved and have been associated with the virulence of several species. However, their roles are poorly understood and few direct substrates have been identified in any species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important human pathogen in which one CTP, known as CtpA, is required for type III secretion system function, and for virulence. This work provides an important advance by showing that CtpA works with a previously uncharacterized binding partner to degrade four substrates. These substrates are all predicted to hydrolyze peptidoglycan cross-links, suggesting that the CtpA complex is an important control mechanism for peptidoglycan hydrolysis. This is likely to emerge as a widespread mechanism used by diverse bacteria to control some of their peptidoglycan hydrolases. This is significant, given the links between CTPs and virulence in several pathogens, and the importance of peptidoglycan remodeling to almost all bacterial cells.",

Loss of this force balance results in cardiomyopathies that ultimately cause heart failure. How this force balance is first established during the assembly of myofibrils is poorly understood. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, we show coupling of focal adhesions to myofibrils during early steps of de novo myofibrillogenesis is essential for myofibril maturation. We also establish a key role for Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a known regulator of adhesion dynamics in non-muscle cells, in regulating focal adhesion dynamics in cardiomyocytes. Specifically, FAK inhibition increased the stability of vinculin in focal adhesions, allowing greater substrate coupling of assembling myofibrils. Furthermore, this coupling is critical for regulating myofibril tension and viscosity. Taken together, our findings uncover a fundamental mechanism regulating the maturation of myofibrils in human cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the recent advances in the field of chromatin architecture1,2, the formation mechanism of chromatin domains, TADs, the topologically associating domains, and LADs, the lamina associated domains, is still an open problem. While previous models only dealt with TADs and essentially relied on the architectural proteins CTCF and cohesin, the model presented here concerns both TADs and LADs and is primarily based on the corresponding DNA sequences, the GC-rich and GC-poor isochores, more specifically on their newly discovered 3-D structures. Indeed, the compositionally homogeneous GC-poor isochores were shown to be locally stiff because of the presence of interspersed oligo- Adenines4,5, whereas the compositionally heterogeneous GC-rich isochores were found to be peak-shaped and characterized by increasing gradients of GC and of interspersed oligo- Guanines. In LADs, oligo-Adenines induce local nucleosome depletions4,5 that are responsible for a wavy structure well adapted for interaction with the lamina. In TADs, the increasing GC levels and increasing oligo-Guanines of the isochore peaks are responsible for a decreasing nucleosome density5,6, a decreasing supercoiling7 and an increasing accessibility8. These factors mould the loops of \\\"primary TADs\\\", that lack self-interactions since they are CTCF/cohesin-free, yet transcriptionally functional structures9-11. This \\\"moulding step\\\" is followed by a second step, in which the cohesin rings bind to the tips of the \\\"primary TADs\\\" and slide down the loops. This process is very likely due to Scc2/Nipbl, an essential factor not only for loading cohesin, but also for stimulating its translocation12 and its ATPase activity13. This \\\"sliding step\\\" creates self-interactions in the loops and stops at the CTCF binding sites located at the base of the loops that are thus closed and insulated.",

    "abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA splicing generates functionally distinct transcripts from the same gene and is involved in the control of multiple cellular processes, with its dysregulation being associated with a variety of pathologies. The advent of next-generation sequencing has enabled global studies of alternative splicing in different physiological and disease contexts. However, current bioinformatics tools for alternative splicing analysis from RNA-seq data are not user-friendly, disregard available exon-exon junction quantification or have limited downstream analysis features. To overcome such limitations, we have developed psichomics, an R package with an intuitive graphical interface for alternative splicing quantification and downstream dimensionality reduction, differential splicing and gene expression and survival analyses based on The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and user-provided data. These integrative analyses can also incorporate clinical and molecular sample-associated features. We successfully used psichomics to reveal alternative splicing signatures specific to stage I breast cancer and associated novel putative prognostic factors.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in diverse biological processes. For example, they help to regulate gene expression and to shape the 3D organization of the cellular nucleus. However, their functions in these processes are not well known. Most of the ongoing research efforts regarding lncRNAs have focused on predicting their properties and their functions. Here, we aimed to extract the biological functions of lncRNAs referred in the biomedical literature. To this end, we performed gene enrichment tests for 417 verified gene names extracted from the scientific literature. We also succeeded in extracting biologically significant functions from 2455 single sentences of 2513 scientific abstracts retrieved from the PubMed digital library. These sentences had to be filtered to eliminate those that did not mention a biological function. They were also split into 2-3-grams and the meaningful function annotations based on Gene Ontology terms were extracted. The results provided by the gene enrichment test and the knowledge gained by automatic extraction of information from the scientific literature showed that lncRNAs play a critical role in all biological and cellular processes. Although simple natural language processing techniques fulfilled our purposes of extracting concepts concerning the biological functions of lncRNAs, in the future, we aim to use more sophisticated methods, such as grammatical rules, to extract more functions and to generate a full database for the biological functions related to lncRNAs.",

Here we demonstrate that up to 10 percent of lung progenitor cells derived from hESCs can be induced to form pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative normal precursors to small cell lung cancers (SCLCs), by inhibition of NOTCH signaling. By using small inhibitory RNAs in these cultures to reduce levels of retinoblastoma (RB) protein, the product of a gene commonly mutated in SCLCs, we can significantly expand the number of PNECs. Similarly reducing levels of TP53 protein, the product of another tumor suppressor gene commonly mutated in SCLCs, or expressing mutant KRAS or EGFR genes, did not induce or expand PNECs, consistent with lineage-specific sensitivity to loss of RB function. Tumors resembling early stage SCLC grew in immunodeficient mice after subcutaneous injection of PNEC-containing cultures in which expression of both RB and TP53 was blocked. Single-cell RNA profiles of PNECs are heterogeneous; when RB levels are reduced, the profiles show similarities to RNA profiles from early stage SCLC; when both RB and TP53 levels are reduced, the transcriptome is enriched with cell cycle-specific RNAs. Taken together, these findings suggest that genetic manipulation of hESC-derived pulmonary cells will enable studies of the initiation, progression, and treatment of this recalcitrant cancer.",

    "abstract": "Immediate early gene (IEG) transcription is rapidly activated by diverse stimuli without requiring new protein synthesis. This transcriptional regulation is assumed to involve constitutively expressed nuclear factors that are targets of signaling cascades initiated at the cell membrane. NF45 and its heterodimeric partner NF90 are chromatin-interacting proteins that are constitutively expressed and localized predominantly in the nucleus. Previously, NF90 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in K562 erythroleukemia cells revealed its enriched association with chromatin at active promoters and strong enhancers. NF90 specifically occupied the promoters of IEGs. Here, ChIP in serum-starved HEK293 cells demonstrated that NF45 and NF90 pre-exist and specifically occupy the promoters of IEG transcription factors EGR1, FOS and JUN. Cellular stimulation with phorbol myristyl acetate increased NF90 occupancy, while decreasing NF45 occupancy at promoters of EGR1, FOS and JUN. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible shRNA vectors targeting NF90 or NF45, doxycycline-mediated knockdown of NF90 or NF45 attenuated the inducible expression of EGR1, FOS, and JUN at the levels of mRNA and protein. NF90 and NF45 operate as constitutively-expressed transcriptional regulators of IEGs. Dynamic chromatin association of NF45 and NF90 at IEG promoters are observed upon stimulation, and NF45 and NF90 contribute to inducible expression of IEGs. NF45 and NF90 operate as chromatin regulators of the immediate early response.",

    "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) is the signaling cascade through which a cell recognizes DNA lesions, and promotes their resolution via the repair pathways of Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), or Homologous Recombination (HR). We recently demonstrated that DROSHA boosts DDR signaling by processing damage-induced long non-coding RNAs into smaller DNA damage response RNAs (DDRNAs). However, the location at which DROSHA exerts its DDR functions, relative to sites of DNA damage, remains unknown.\\n\\nTo investigate DROSHAs localization during DDR activation, we used the DiVA cellular system, which allows the controlled induction of several DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the human genome. Indeed, by genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing, we demonstrate that DROSHA associates with DSBs. In support of this, DSB-recruitment of DROSHA is detectable at the single-cell level by Proximity Ligation Assay between DROSHA and known DDR markers, and by DNA damage in situ ligation followed by Proximity Ligation Assay (DI-PLA), which demonstrates proximity of DROSHA to DNA ends. DROSHA recruitment occurs at both genic and inter-genic DSBs, suggesting that its recruitment is independent from ongoing transcription preceding damage generation. DROSHAs recruitment to DNA lesions occurs throughout the cell cycle, and with a preference for NHEJ-prone DSBs. Consistently, inhibition of the HR pathway increases DROSHA recruitment, and DROSHA knock down strongly impairs NHEJ efficiency in a GFP-reporter cellular system for monitoring NHEJ DNA repair. Overall, these results demonstrate that DROSHA acts locally at sites of DNA damage to promote NHEJ DNA repair.",

Simulations of near-continuous movement paths guided by empirical data offer new avenues of investigation into disease transmission. Here, we simulate the spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of anthrax, the acute disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a pathogen transmitted primarily via environmental reservoirs. We explore how calculations of the probabilities of contact between a host and infectious reservoirs are affected by the scale and method of analysis. At both the landscape and individual scales, empirical movement tracks offer previously unattainable estimates of impacts of movement decisions on contact rate metrics. However, the analytical method selected for the calculation of the probability of contact has notable impacts on the resulting estimates, with convex polygons virtually canceling out variation, and unions of local convex hulls (LoCoH methods) and space-time prisms reflecting reasonable variation, but differing in the magnitude of their estimates. The explicit consideration of behavioral states along movement pathways also impacts evaluations of exposure risk, though its effects differ across methods of analysis. Ultimately, simulations demonstrate that the incorporation of movement data into pathogen transmission analyses helps clarify the role of movement processes underlying the observed dynamics of infectious disease.",

    "abstract": "International sustainable development goals for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health problem by 2030 highlight the pressing need to optimize strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Selected or transmitted resistance associated mutations (RAMs) and vaccine escape mutations (VEMs) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) may reduce the success of existing treatment and prevention strategies. These issues are particularly pertinent for many settings in Africa where there is high HBV prevalence and co-endemic HIV infection, but lack of robust epidemiological data and limited education, diagnostics and clinical care. The prevalence, distribution and impact of RAMs and VEMs in these populations are neglected in the current literature. We therefore set out to assimilate data for sub-Saharan Africa through a systematic literature review and analysis of published sequence data, and present these in an on-line database (https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/1510659619-3Xkoe2NKkKJ7Drg/). The majority of the data were from HIV/HBV coinfected cohorts. The commonest RAM was rtM204I/V, either alone or in combination with compensatory mutations, and identified in both reportedly treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults. We also identified the suite of mutations rtM204V/I + rtL180M + rtV173L, that has been associated with vaccine escape, in over 1/3 of cohorts. Although tenofovir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, it is of concern that emerging data suggest polymorphisms that may be associated with resistance, although the precise clinical impact of these is unknown. Overall, there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic screening, enhanced laboratory assessment of HBV before and during therapy, and sustained roll out of tenofovir in preference to lamivudine alone. Further data are needed in order to inform population and individual approaches to HBV diagnosis, monitoring and therapy in these highly vulnerable settings.\\n\\nAuthors summaryThe Global Hepatitis Health Sector Strategy is aiming for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. However, mutations associated with drug resistance and vaccine escape may reduce the success of existing treatment and prevention strategies. In the current literature, the prevalence, distribution and impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations in many settings in Africa are neglected, despite the high prevalence of HBV and co-endemic HIV infection. This systematic review describes the frequency, prevalence and co-occurrence of mutations associated with HBV drug resistance and vaccine escape mutations in Africa. The findings suggest a high prevalence of these mutations in some populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Scarce resources have contributed to the lack of HBV diagnostic screening, inconsistent supply of drugs, and poor access to clinical monitoring, all of which contribute to drug and vaccine resistance. Sustainable long-term investment is required to expand consistent drug and vaccine supply, to provide screening to diagnose infection and to detect drug resistance, and to provide appropriate targeted clinical monitoring for treated patients.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common mental illness associated with increased substance misuse and risk of suicide. Potential risk factors for depression include sex and depressive symptoms in early life, however the mechanisms responsible are not yet understood. Research has focused on late childhood and adolescence as this developmental period may be a modifiable risk factor that prevents or reduces depression at a later stage. It is also important to establish at what ages the level of depression is changing as this will help identify critical points to intervene with treatment. We used multilevel growth-curve models to explore adolescent trajectories of depressive symptoms in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK based pregnancy cohort. Using data from 9301 individuals, trajectories of depressive symptoms were constructed for males and females between 10.6 and 22.8 years old. We calculated the age of peak velocity for depressive symptoms (the age at which depressive symptoms increases most rapidly) and the age of maximum depressive symptoms. Adjusted results suggested that being female was associated with a steeper trajectory compared to being male (per 1 year increase in relation to depressive symptoms: 0.128, SE = 0.035, [95% CI: 0.059, 0.198]; p <0.001). We found evidence suggesting that females had an earlier age of peak velocity of depressive symptoms (females 13.7 years old, SE = 0.321, [95% CI: 12.9, 14.4] and males 16.4 years old, SE = 0.096, [95% CI: 16.2, 16.6]; p <0.001), but weak evidence of an earlier age of maximum depressive symptoms (p = 0.125). Possible mechanisms that underlie this sex difference include the roles of pubertal development and timing. Using multilevel growth curve models to estimate the age of peak velocity and maximum depressive symptoms for different population subgroups may provide useful knowledge for treating and preventing later depression.",

Cyanophages of the Myoviridae family are of great interest since they include generalist viruses capable of infection of a wide range of hosts including those from different cyanobacterial genera. While the influence of phages on host evolution has been studied previously, it is not known how the infection of distinct hosts influences the evolution of cyanophage populations. In marine systems this question is of special interest as the abundance of different Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus hosts constantly changes, temporally and spatially. Here, using an experimental evolution approach, we investigated the adaptation of multiple cyanophage populations to three distinct cyanobacterial hosts. We show that when infecting an \\\"optimal\\\" host, whose infection is the most efficient, phage populations accumulated only a few mutations. However, when infecting \\\"sub-optimal\\\" hosts, different, largely host-specific sets of mutations, spread in the phage populations, leading to rapid diversification into distinct subpopulations. The mutations included insertions, deletions, SNPs and codon adaptations. Most of the mutations were found in genes encoding for proteins responsible for host recognition, attachment and infection, regardless of their evolutionary conservation. Based on our results, we propose a model demonstrating how shifts in bacterial abundance, which lead to infection of \\\"sub-optimal\\\" hosts, act as a driver for rapid diversification of phage populations.",

    "abstract": "Self-incompatibility (SI) is a genetically based recognition system that functions to prevent self-fertilization and mating among related plants. An enduring puzzle in SI is how the high diversity observed in nature arises and is maintained. Based on the underlying recognition mechanism, SI can be classified into two main groups: self- and non-self recognition. Most work has focused on diversification within self-recognition systems despite expected differences between the two groups in the evolutionary pathways and outcomes of diversification. Here, we use a deterministic population genetic model and stochastic simulations to investigate how novel S-haplotypes evolve in a gametophytic non-self recognition (SRNase/S Locus F-box (SLF)) SI system. For this model the pathways for diversification involve either the maintenance or breakdown of SI and can vary in the order of mutations of the female (SRNase) and male (SLF) components. We show analytically that diversification can occur with high inbreeding depression and self-pollination, but this varies with evolutionary pathway and level of completeness (which determines the number of potential mating partners in the population), and in general is more likely for lower haplotype number. The conditions for diversification are broader in stochastic simulations of finite population size. However, the number of haplotypes observed under high inbreeding and moderate to high self-pollination is less than that commonly observed in nature. Diversification was observed through pathways that maintain SI as well as through self-compatible intermediates. Yet the lifespan of diversified haplotypes was sensitive to their level of completeness. By examining diversification in a non-self recognition SI system, this model extends our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of haplotype diversity observed in a recognition system common in flowering plants.",

We present Dystruct (Dynamic Structure), a framework and toolbox for inference of shared ancestry from data that include ancient DNA. By explicitly modeling population history and genetic drift as a time-series, Dystruct more accurately and realistically discovers shared ancestry from ancient and contemporary samples. Formally, we use a normal approximation of drift, which allows a novel, efficient algorithm for optimizing model parameters using stochastic variational inference. We show that Dystruct outperforms the state of the art when individuals are sampled over time, as is common in ancient DNA datasets. We further demonstrate the utility of our method on a dataset of 92 ancient samples alongside 1941 modern ones genotyped at 222755 loci. Our model tends to present modern samples as the mixtures of ancestral populations they really are, rather than the artifactual converse of presenting ancestral samples as mixtures of contemporary groups.\\n\\nAvailabilityDystruct is implemented in C++, open-source, and available at https://github.com/tyjo/dystruct.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid breeding has dramatically boosted yield and its stability in rice. Genomic prediction further benefits rice breeding by increasing selection intensity and accelerating breeding cycles. With the rapid advancement of technology, other omic data, such as metabolomic data and transcriptomic data, are readily available for predicting genetic values (or breeding values) for agronomically important traits. In the current study, we searched for the best prediction strategy for four traits (yield, 1000 grain weight, number of grains per panicle and number of tillers per plant) of hybrid rice by evaluating all possible combinations of omic datasets with different prediction methods. We conclude that, in rice, the predictions using the combination of genomic and metabolomic data generally produce better results than single-omics predictions or predictions based on other combined omic data. Inclusion of transcriptomic data does not improve predictability possibly because transcriptome does not provide more information for the trait than the sum of genome and metabolome; rather, the computational complexity is substantially increased if transcriptomic data is included in the models. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) appears to be the most efficient prediction method compared to the other commonly used approaches, including LASSO, SSVS, SVM-RBF, SVP-POLY and PLS. Our study has provided a guideline for selection of hybrid rice in terms of which types of omic datasets and which method should be used to achieve higher trait predictability.",

In this work, liquid and solid fractions of grass biomass were used separately for semicontinuous batch methanation using sewage sludge as seed sludge. During 6 months of incubation, the amount of input COD was increased gradually, and the underlying methanogenic microbiome was assessed by means of microscopy-based automated cell counting and full-length 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. In this sense, we prove for the first time the suitability of the ONTMinION platform as a monitoring tool for anaerobic digestion systems. According to our results, solid-fed batches were highly unstable at higher COD input concentrations, and kept Methanosaeta spp. typically associated to sewage sludge-as the majoritary methanogenic archaea. In contrast, liquid-fed batches developed a more stable microbiome, proved enriched in Methanosarcina spp, and resulted in higher methanogenic yield. This work demonstrates the high repowering potential of microbiomes from sewage sludge digesters, and highlight the effectiveness of liquefied substrates for increasing biogas productivity in anaerobic digestions.",

The length of tRNASer was 67 base pairs (bp). Two haplotypes were detected in the five sequences analyzed. The L. longipalpis tRNASer showed 7 intrachain pairing in the acceptor arm, 3 in the DHU arm, 4 in the anticodon arm and 5 in the T{psi}C. The size of the loops corresponded to 5 nucleotides in the DHU, 7 in the anticodon, 4 in the variable and 7 in the T{psi}C.

It has been previously demonstrated that higher-order statistical moments of luminance distributions influence perception of static surfaces and textures. Here, we tested whether the brain also represents higher-order moments of dynamic stimuli. We constructed random dot kinematograms where dots moved according to probability distributions that selectively differed in terms of their mean, variance, skewness, or kurtosis. When viewing these stimuli, human observers were sensitive to the mean direction of coherent motion and to the variance of the individual dot displacement angles, but they were insensitive to skewness and kurtosis. Observer behavior accorded with a model of directional motion energy, suggesting that information about higher-order moments is discarded early in the visual processing hierarchy. These results demonstrate that use of higher-order moments is not a general property of visual perception.",

    "abstract": "1Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is currently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracellular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.\\n\\n2 Author summaryMany pathological conditions, such as epilepsy and cortical spreading depression, are linked to abnormal extracellular ion concentrations in the brain. Understanding the underlying principles of such conditions may prove important in developing treatments for these illnesses, which incur societal costs of tens of billions annually. In order to investigate the role of ion-concentration dynamics in the pathological conditions, one must measure the spatial distribution of all ion concentrations over time. This remains challenging experimentally, which makes computational modeling an attractive tool. We have previously introduced the Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck framework, an efficient framework for modeling electrodiffusion. In this study, we introduce a 3-dimensional version of this framework and use it to model the electrodiffusion of ions surrounding a morphologically detailed neuron. The simulation covered a 1 mm3 cylinder of tissue for over a minute and was performed in less than a day on a standard desktop computer, demonstrating the frameworks efficiency. We believe this to be an important step on the way to understanding phenomena involving ion concentration shifts at the tissue level.",

Here, we tested the utility of a dynamical system perspective to approach this problem. In a dynamical system whose state is determined by interactions among neurons, computations can be rapidly and flexibly reconfigured by controlling the system s inputs and initial conditions. To investigate whether the brain employs such control strategies, we recorded from the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) of monkeys trained to measure time intervals and subsequently produce timed motor responses according to multiple context-specific stimulus-response rules. Analysis of the geometry of neural states revealed a control mechanism that relied on the system s inputs and initial conditions. A tonic input specified by the behavioral context adjusted firing rates throughout each trial, while the dynamics in the measurement epoch allowed the system to establish initial conditions for the ensuing production epoch. This initial condition in turn set the speed of neural dynamics in the production epoch allowing the animal to aim for the target interval. These results provide evidence that the language of dynamical systems can be used to parsimoniously link brain activity to sensorimotor computations.",

    "abstract": "Excitotoxicity, caused by exaggerated neuronal stimulation by Glutamate (Glu), is a major cause of neurodegeneration in brain ischemia. While we know that neurodegeneration is triggered by overstimulation of Glu-Receptors (GluRs), the subsequent mechanisms that lead to cellular demise remain controversial. Surprisingly, signaling downstream of GluRs can also activate neuroprotective pathways. The strongest evidence involves activation of the transcription factor cAMP Response Element Binding-protein (CREB), widely recognized for its importance in synaptic plasticity. Canonical views describe CREB as a phosphorylation-triggered transcription factor, where transcriptional activation involves CREB phosphorylation and association with CREB Binding Protein (CBP). However, given CREBs ubiquitous cross-tissue expression, the multitude of cascades leading to CREB phosphorylation, and its ability to regulate thousands of genes, it remains unclear how CREB exerts closely-tailored, differential neuroprotective responses in excitotoxicity. A non-canonical, alternative cascade for activation of CREB-mediated transcription involves the CREB co-factor cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator (CRTC), and may be independent of CREB phosphorylation. To identify cascades that activate CREB in excitotoxicity we use a C. elegans model of neurodegeneration by excitotoxic necrosis. We demonstrate that CREBs neuroprotective effect is conserved, and seems most effective in neurons with moderate Glu exposure. We find that factors mediating canonical CREB activation are not involved. Instead, phosphorylation-independent CREB activation in nematode excitotoxic necrosis hinges on CRTC. CREB-mediated transcription that depends on CRTC, but not on CREB phosphorylation, might lead to expression of a specific subset of neuroprotective genes. Elucidating conserved mechanisms of excitotoxicity-specific CREB activation can help us focus on core neuroprotective programs in excitotoxicity.",

Methods: Liver injury was induced in male wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats using 4 or 12 weeks carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) intoxication and 4 or 8 weeks methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet. Liver MRI was performed using a 7.0 Tesla small animal scanner at baseline and specified timepoints after liver injury. Multiparametric liver MRI parameters (T1 mapping, T2* mapping and proton density fat fraction (PDFF)) were correlated with gold standard histopathological measures, assessed by a blinded expert adjudicator. One-way analysis of variance with Tukeys post-hoc test was used to assess differences between groups and Spearmans rank-order correlation to examine associations.\\n\\nResultsMean hepatic T1 increased significantly in rats treated with CCl4 for 12 weeks compared to controls (1122{+/-}78 ms vs. 959{+/-}114 ms; d=162.7, 95% CI (11.92, 313.4), P=0.038) and correlated strongly with histological collagen content (rs=0.717, P=0.037).

The biochemical tools used by Varroa to detect semiochemicals produced by the host are still largely unknown. We have performed proteomic analysis on chemosensory organs of this species in order to identify putative soluble carriers for pheromones and other olfactory cues emitted by the host. In particular, we have analysed forelegs, mouthparts (palps, chelicera and hypostome) and the second pair of legs (as control tissue) in reproductive and phoretic stages of the Varroa life cycle. We identified 958 Varroa proteins, most of them common to organs and stages. Sequence analysis shows that four proteins can be assigned to the odorant-binding protein (OBP)-like class, which bear some similarity to insect OBPs, but so far are only reported in some Chelicerata. In addition, we have detected the presence of two proteins belonging to the Niemann-Pick family, type C2 (NPC2), which have been suggested to act as semiochemical carriers.

However, the molecular basis of these adaptations is unknown. Here we show that lungless salamanders express in the skin and buccal cavity--the principal sites of respiratory gas exchange in these species--a novel paralog of the gene Surfactant-Associated Protein C (SFTPC), which is a critical component of pulmonary surfactant expressed exclusively in the lung in other vertebrates. The paralogous gene appears to be found only in salamanders, but, similar to SFTPC, in lunged salamanders it is expressed only in the lung. This heterotopic gene expression, combined with predictions from structural modeling and respiratory tissue ultrastructure, suggest that lungless salamanders produce pulmonary surfactant-like secretions outside the lungs and that the novel paralog of SFTPC might facilitate extrapulmonary respiration in the absence of lungs. Heterotopic expression of the SFTPC paralog may have contributed to the remarkable evolutionary radiation of lungless salamanders, which account for more than two thirds of urodele species alive today.",

    "abstract": "The human immune system consists of many specialized cell subsets that simultaneously carry out a diverse range of functions using overlapping pathways and signals. Subset-specific immune profiling can resolve immune activity in autoimmune disease, cancer immunity, and infectious disease that may not be discoverable or detectable in analyses of crude blood samples. The activity of specific subsets may help predict the course of disease and response to therapy in certain patient populations. Here, we present a low-input microfluidic system for sorting immune cells into subsets and profiling their cellular states by gene expression analysis using full-length RNA-seq. Our system is robust and has the potential to make multiplexed subset-specific analysis routine in many research laboratories and clinical settings. We validate the devices technical performance by benchmarking its subset enrichment and genomic profiling performance against standard protocols. We make the added value of subset-resolved profiling over crude samples clear through ex vivo experiments that show subset-specific stimulated responses. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our device by profiling four immune cell subsets in blood from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and matched controls enrolled in a clinical study. The results from our initial cohort confirm the role of type I interferons in lupus pathogenesis and further show that the canonical interferon signature for SLE is prominent in B cells, demonstrating the ability of our integrated analytical platform to identify cell-specific disease signatures.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania is a widespread trypanosomatid protozoan parasite causing significant morbidity and mortality in humans. The endobiont dsRNA virus Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) chronically infects some strains, where it increases parasite numbers and virulence in murine leishmaniasis models, and correlates with increased treatment failure in human disease. Previously, we reported that 2-C-methyladenosine (2CMA) potently inhibited LRV1 in Leishmania guyanensis (Lgy) and L. braziliensis, leading to viral eradication at concentrations above 10 {micro}M. Here we probed the cellular mechanisms of 2CMA inhibition, involving metabolism, accumulation and inhibition of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). Activation to 2CMA triphosphate (2CMATP) was required, as 2CMA showed no inhibition of RDRP activity from virions purified on cesium chloride gradients. In contrast, 2CMA-TP showed IC50s ranging from 150 to 910 {micro}M, depending on the CsCl density of the virion (empty, ssRNA- and dsRNA-containing). Lgy parasites incubated in vitro with 10 {micro}M 2CMA accumulated 2CMA-TP to 410 {micro}M, greater than the most sensitive RDRP IC50 measured. Quantitative modeling showed good agreement between the degree of LRV1 RDRP inhibition and LRV1 levels. These results establish that 2CMA activity is due to its conversion to 2CMA-TP, which accumulates to levels that inhibit RDRP and cause LRV1 loss. This attests to the impact of the Leishmania purine uptake and metabolism pathways, which allow even a weak RDRP inhibitor to effectively eradicate LRV1 at micromolar concentrations. Future RDRP inhibitors with increased potency may have potential therapeutic applications for ameliorating the increased Leishmania pathogenicity conferred by LRV1.",

    "abstract": "Although the amygdalas role in shaping social behavior is especially important during early post-natal development, very little is known of human amygdala functional development before childhood. To address this important gap, this study used resting-state fMRI to examine early functional network development of the amygdala and its subregions in 80 participants from 3-months to 5-years of age. Whole brain functional connectivity with the whole amygdala and its laterobasal and superficial nuclear groups were largely similar to those seen in older children and adults, and functional distinctions between subregion networks exist already. These patterns suggest many amygdala functional circuits are intact from infancy, especially those that are part of larger motor, visual, auditory and subcortical (basal ganglia especially) networks. Notably, these observed robust amygdala functional networks in infancy precede reports to date of elicited amygdala reactivity in development. Developmental changes in connectivity were observed between the laterobasal nucleus and bilateral ventral temporal and motor cortex as well as between the superficial nuclei and medial thalamus, occipital cortex and a different region of motor cortex. These results show amygdala-subcortical and sensory-cortex connectivity begins refinement prior to childhood, though connectivity changes with associative and frontal cortical areas, seen after early childhood, were not evident in this age range. These findings represent early steps in understanding amygdala network dynamics across infancy through early childhood, an important period of emotional and cognitive development.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect regularities in sound (i.e., recurring structure) is critical for effective perception, enabling, for example, change detection and prediction. Two seemingly unconnected lines of research concern the neural operations involved in processing regularities: one investigates how neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularities (e.g., frequency modulation; FM) in sounds, whereas the other focuses on increases in sustained activity during stimulation with repeating tone-frequency patterns. In three electroencephalography studies with male and female human participants, we investigated whether neural synchronization and sustained neural activity are dissociable, or whether they are functionally interdependent. Experiment I demonstrated that neural activity synchronizes with temporal regularity (FM) in sounds, and that sustained activity increases concomitantly. In Experiment II, phase coherence of FM in sounds was parametrically varied. Although neural synchronization was more sensitive to changes in FM coherence, such changes led to a systematic modulation of both neural synchronization and sustained activity, with magnitude increasing as coherence increased. In Experiment III, participants either performed a duration categorization task on the sounds, or a visual object tracking task to distract attention. Neural synchronization was observed irrespective of task, whereas the sustained response was observed only when attention was on the auditory task, not under (visual) distraction. The results suggest that neural synchronization and sustained activity levels are functionally linked: both are sensitive to regularities in sounds. However, neural synchronization might reflect a more sensory-driven response to regularity, compared with sustained activity which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.\\n\\nSignificance statementOptimal perception requires that the auditory system detects regularities in sounds. Synchronized neural activity and increases in sustained neural activity both appear to index the detection of a regularity, but the functional interrelation of these two neural signatures is unknown. In three electroencephalography experiments, we measured both signatures concomitantly while listeners were presented with sounds containing frequency modulations that differed in their regularity. We observed that both neural signatures are sensitive to temporal regularity in sounds, although they functionally decouple when a listener is distracted by a demanding visual task. Our data suggest that neural synchronization reflects a more automatic response to regularity, compared with sustained activity which may be influenced by attentional, contextual, or other experiential factors.",

    "abstract": "Electron microscopy (EM) offers unparalleled power to study cell substructures at the nanoscale. Cryofixation by high-pressure freezing offers optimal morphological preservation, as it captures cellular structures instantaneously in their near-native states. However, the applicability of cryofixation is limited by its incompatibilities with diaminobenzidine labeling using genetic EM tags and the high-contrast en bloc staining required for serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM). In addition, it is challenging to perform correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM) with cryofixed samples. Consequently, these powerful methods cannot be applied to address questions requiring optimal morphological preservation and high temporal resolution. Here we developed an approach that overcomes these limitations; it enables genetically labeled, cryofixed samples to be characterized with SBEM and 3D CLEM. Our approach is broadly applicable, as demonstrated in cultured cells, Drosophila olfactory organ and mouse brain. This optimization exploits the potential of cryofixation, allowing quality ultrastructural preservation for diverse EM applications.",

In toto live imaging and lineage tracing of drl-based reporters captured the dynamic LPM emergence as lineage-restricted mesendoderm field. The drl pan-LPM enhancer responds to the transcription factors EomesoderminA, FoxH1, and MixL1 that combined with Smad activity drive LPM emergence. We uncovered specific drl reporter activity in LPM-corresponding territories of several chordates including chicken, axolotl, lamprey, Ciona, and amphioxus, revealing a universal upstream LPM program.

The mechanisms for making piRNAs have been proposed to differ among cell types, tissues, and animals. Our data instead suggest a single model that explains piRNA production in most animals. piRNAs initiate piRNA production by guiding PIWI proteins to slice precursor transcripts. Next, PIWI proteins direct the stepwise fragmentation of the sliced precursor transcripts, yielding tail-to-head strings of phased pre-piRNAs. Our analyses detect evidence for this piRNA biogenesis strategy across an evolutionarily broad range of animals including humans. Thus, PIWI proteins initiate and sustain piRNA biogenesis by the same mechanism in species whose last common ancestor predates the branching of most animal lineages. The unified model places PIWI-clade Argonautes at the center of piRNA biology and suggests that the ancestral animal--the Urmetazoan--used PIWI proteins both to generate piRNA guides and to execute piRNA function.",

    "abstract": "Stress is known to exert its detrimental effects not only by enhancing fear, but also by impairing its extinction. However, in earlier studies stress exposure invariably preceded both processes. Thus, compared to unstressed animals, stressed animals had to extinguish fear memories from higher levels of freezing caused by prior exposure to stress. Here we decouple the two processes to examine if stress specifically impairs fear extinction. Strikingly, when fear memories were formed before stress exposure, thereby allowing animals to initiate extinction from comparable levels of fear, recall of fear extinction was unaffected. Despite this we observed a persistent increase in theta activity in the BLA. Theta activity in the mPFC, by contrast, was normal. Stress also disrupted mPFC-BLA theta-frequency synchrony and directional coupling. Thus, in the absence of the fear-enhancing effects of stress, the expression of fear reflects normal regulation of mPFC activity, not stress-induced hyperactivity in the amygdala.",

    "abstract": "The neural control of insect locomotion is distributed among various body segments. Local pattern-generating circuits at the thoracic ganglia interact with incoming sensory signals and central descending commands from the head ganglia. The evidence from different insect preparations suggests that the subesophageal ganglion (SEG) may play an important role in locomotion-related tasks. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the locust SEG modulates the coupling pattern between segmental leg CPGs in the absence of sensory feedback. Here, we investigated its role in processing and transmitting sensory information to the leg motor centers, and mapped the major related neural pathways. Specifically, the intra- and inter-segmental transfer of leg-feedback were studied by simultaneously monitoring motor responses and descending signals from the SEG. Our findings reveal a crucial role of the SEG in the transfer of intersegmental, but not intrasegmental, signals. Additional lesion experiments, in which the intersegmental connectives were cut at different locations, together with double nerve staining, indicated that sensory signals are mainly transferred to the SEG via the connective contralateral to the stimulated leg. We therefore suggest that, similar to data reported for vertebrates, insect leg sensory-motor loops comprise contralateral ascending pathways to the head and ipsilateral descending ones.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memories are rich in sensory information and often contain integrated information from different sensory modalities. For instance, we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and effectively binding the different modalities together in memory. However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation for multisensory events. To address this question we presented movies and sounds with their luminance and volume modulated at theta (4 Hz), with a phase offset at 0{degrees} or 180{degrees} with respect to each other. This allowed us to entrain the visual and auditory cortex in a synchronous (0{degrees}) or asynchronous manner (180{degrees}). Participants were asked to remember the association between a movie and a sound while having their EEG activity recorded. Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the synchronous (0{degrees}) compared to the asynchronous (180{degrees}) condition. Source-level analysis demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the episodic memory system: Binding the contents of different modalities into coherent memory episodes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHow multi-sensory experiences are bound to form a coherent episodic memory representation is one of the fundamental questions in human episodic memory research. Evidence from animal literature suggests that the relative timing between an input and theta oscillations in the hippocampus is crucial for memory formation. We precisely controlled the timing between visual and auditory stimuli and the neural oscillations at 4 Hz using a multisensory entrainment paradigm. Human associative memory formation depends on coincident timing between sensory streams processed by the corresponding brain regions. We provide evidence for a significant role of relative timing of neural theta activity in human episodic memory on a single trial level, which reveals a crucial mechanism underlying human episodic memory.",

Diuraphis noxia is a specialist aphid, feeding only on selected grasses that include wheat, barley, and oats.

From wheat harboring the Dn1 resistance gene, we have identified a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene containing two integrated domains (IDs). These are three C-terminus ankyrin repeat-domains and an N-terminus WRKY domain. The NLR core of the gene can be traced through speciation events within the grass family, with a recent WRKY domain integration that is Triticum specific. Virus induced gene silencing of the gene in resistant wheat lines resulted in the abolishment of localized cell death. Silenced plants supported a higher number of aphids similar to the susceptible NIL and the intrinsic rate of increase of the aphids matched that of aphids feeding on the susceptible NIL. The presence of the gene is necessary for Dn1 resistance and we have named the gene Associated with Dn resistance 1 (Adr1) to reflect this function.",

In natura, hosts are often infected by multiple pathogens. However, most of the current studies have been performed under laboratory controlled conditions and by taking into account the interaction between a single commensal species and a single pathogenic species. The next step is therefore to explore the relationships between host-microbial communities (microbiota) and microbial members with potential pathogenic behavior (pathobiota) in a realistic ecological context. In the present study, we investigated such relationships within root and leaf associated bacterial communities of 163 ecologically contrasted Arabidopsis thaliana populations sampled across two seasons in South-West of France. In agreement with the theory of the invasion paradox, we observed a significant humped-back relationship between microbiota and pathobiota -diversity that was robust between both seasons and plant organs. In most populations, we also observed a strong dynamics of microbiota composition between seasons. Accordingly, the potential pathobiota composition was explained by combinations of season-specific microbiota OTUs. This result suggests that the potential biomarkers controlling pathogens invasion are highly dynamic.",

Analysis of loss-of-function mice reveals that lack of MyHC-embryonic leads to mis-regulation of other MyHCs, alterations in fiber size, fiber number and fiber type at neonatal stages. We also find that loss of MyHC-embryonic leads to mis-regulation of genes involved in muscle differentiation. A broad theme from these studies is that loss of MyHC-embryonic has distinct effects on different muscles, possibly reflecting the unique fiber type composition of different muscles. Most significantly, our results indicate that MyHC-embryonic is required during embryonic and fetal myogenesis to regulate myogenic progenitor and myoblast differentiation in a non-cell autonomous manner via Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPKinase) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling. Thus, our results signify that MyHC-embryonic is a key regulator of myogenic differentiation during embryonic, fetal and neonatal myogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The inflammasome is a critical immune complex that activates IL-1 driven inflammation in response to pathogen- and danger-associated signals. Nod-like receptor protein-1 (NLRP1) is a widely expressed inflammasome sensor. Inherited gain-of-function mutations in NLRP1 cause a spectrum of human Mendelian diseases, including systemic autoimmunity and skin cancer susceptibility. However, its endogenous regulation and its cognate ligands are still unknown. Here we apply a proteomics screen to identify dipeptidyl dipeptidase, DPP9 as a novel interacting partner and a specific endogenous inhibitor of NLRP1 inflammasome in diverse primary cell types from human and mice. DPP9 inhibition via small molecule drugs, targeted mutations in its catalytic site and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion potently and specifically activate the NLRP1 inflammasome leading to pyroptosis and IL-1 processing via ASC and caspase-1. Mechanistically, DPP9 maintains NLRP1 in its monomeric, inactive state by binding to the auto-cleaving FIIND domain. NLRP1-FIIND is a self-sufficient DPP9 binding module and its disruption by a single missense mutation abrogates DPP9 binding and explains the aberrant inflammasome activation in NAIAD patients with arthritis and dyskeratosis. These findings uncover a unique peptidase enzyme-based mechanism of inflammasome regulation, and suggest that the DPP9-NLRP1 complex could be broadly involved in human inflammatory disorders.",

Although there have long been calls for computational algorithms for the identification of moonlighting proteins, research on approaches to identify moonlighting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has never been undertaken. Here, we introduce a methodology, MoonFinder, for the identification of moonlighting lncRNAs. MoonFinder is a statistical algorithm identifying moonlighting lncRNAs without a priori knowledge through the integration of protein interactome, RNA-protein interactions, and functional annotation of proteins. We identify 155 moonlighting lncRNA candidates and uncover that they are a distinct class of lncRNAs characterized by specific sequence and cellular localization features. The non-coding genes that transcript moonlighting lncRNAs tend to have shorter but more exons and the moonlighting lncRNAs have a localization tendency of residing in the cytoplasmic compartment in comparison with the nuclear compartment. Moreover, moonlighting lncRNAs and moonlighting proteins are rather mutually exclusive in terms of both their direct interactions and interacting partners. Our results also shed light on how the moonlighting candidates and their interacting proteins implicated in the formation and development of cancers and other diseases.",

In this study, amino acid mutations in DsbA signal sequence (ss) and its effect on translocation of recombinant Ovine growth hormone (rOGH) was observed. Eight constructs were designed on the basis of increased hydrophobicity and showed that hydrophobicity and specificity of amino acid plays a crucial role in translocation of rOGH. Two DsbAss with the same hydropathy (1.539), one had alteration at -13 and second at -11 position; alanine (Ala) to isoleucine respectively were designed. The former DsbAss translocated rOGH from membrane to cytoplasmic fraction in E. coli as confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and molecular modelling analysis. MD simulations and binding free energy calculations evidenced that, altering Ala changed the orientation of signal peptide in the Ffh-M domain binding groove and hampered the process of translocation while change at position -11 pointed it outward.

    "abstract": "Cell differentiation is mediated by synchronized waves of coordinated expression for hundreds to thousands of genes, and must be an exquisitely regulated process to produce complex tissues and phenotypes. For many animal species, sexual selection has driven the development of elaborate male ornaments, requiring sex-specific differentiation pathways. One such male ornament is the pheromone-producing mental gland of the red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani). Mental gland development follows an annual cycle of extreme hypertrophy, production of pheromones for the ~2 month mating season, and then complete resorption before repeating the process in the following year. At the peak of the mating season, the transcriptional and translational machinery of the mental gland are almost exclusively redirected to synthesis of many rapidly evolving pheromones. Of these pheromones, Plethodontid Modulating Factor (PMF) has experienced an unusual history of disjunctive evolution: following gene duplication, positive sexual selection has diversified the protein coding region while the untranslated regions have been conserved by purifying selection. However, the molecular underpinnings that bridge the processes of gland hypertrophy, pheromone synthesis, and disjunctive evolution remain to be determined and are the focus of the present investigation. Using Illumina sequencing, we prepared a de novo transcriptome of the mental gland at six stages of development. Differential expression analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that the mental gland initially adopts a highly proliferative, almost tumor-like phenotype, followed by a rapid increase in pheromone mRNA and protein levels. One likely player in this transition is Cold Inducible RNA Binding Protein (CIRBP), which selectively and cooperatively binds the highly conserved PMF 3' UTR. CIRBP, along with other stress response proteins, have seemingly been co-opted to aid in mental gland development by helping to regulate pheromone synthesis. The P. shermani mental gland utilizes a complex system of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation to facilitate its hypertrophication and pheromone synthesis. The data support the evolutionary interplay of both coding and noncoding segments in rapid gene evolution, and necessitate study of the co-evolution of pheromone gene products along with their transcriptional and translational regulators. Additionally, the mental gland could be a powerful emerging model of regulated proliferation and subsequent resorption of a tissue, within the dermis, thus having potential links to skin cancer biology.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPerceptual choices depend not only on the current sensory input, but also on the behavioral context. An important contextual factor is the history of ones own choices. Choice history often strongly biases perceptual decisions, and leaves traces in the activity of brain regions involved in decision processing. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. Models of perceptual choice construe decision formation as the accumulation of sensory evidence towards decision bounds. In this framework, it is commonly assumed that choice history signals shift the starting point of accumulation towards the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit bounded-accumulation decision models to behavioral data from perceptual choice tasks, and estimated bias parameters that depended on observers previous choices. Across multiple task protocols and sensory modalities, individual history biases in overt behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to bias the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention towards (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.",

    "abstract": "The use of screen electronic devices (SED) in the evening negatively affects sleep. Yet, sleep is known to be essential for brain maturation and a key factor for good academic performance, and thus is particularly critical during childhood and adolescence. While previous studies reported correlations between SED use and sleep impairments, the causal relationship between SED use and sleep in adolescents remains unclear. Using actigraphy and daily questionnaires in a large sample of students (12 to 19 years old), we assessed SED use and sleep habits over one month, including a two-week baseline phase and a two-week interventional phase, where participants were asked to stop screen use after 9 pm during pre-school nights. During the interventional phase, we found that reduction in time spent on SED after 9 pm correlated with earlier sleep onset time and increased total sleep duration. The latter led to improved daytime vigilance. We also observed that the beneficial impact of the intervention on sleep was influenced by catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism, which is implicated in the dopaminergic modulation of human behaviors, including wake and sleep regulation. These findings provide evidence that restricting SED use in the evening represents a valid and promising approach for improving sleep duration in adolescents, with potential implications for daytime functioning and health.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWith the emergence of smartphones and other connected devices, adolescents spend a lot of time on screen electronic devices (SED), especially during the evening. We report that time spent on SED after 9 pm negatively correlates with sleep onset time, sleep duration as well as mood, body weight, and academic performance. Such observable correlations urge for educational strategies to address the chronic lack of sleep observed in todays adolescent populations. Here we also show that limiting the use of SED after 9 pm improves sleep duration and daytime vigilance in most adolescents. This simple education recommendation pertaining to sleep hygiene can be implemented by every household, yielding direct positive effects on sleep, and presumed benefits for health and daytime functioning.",

Here we have imaged glutamate to investigate how hair cells encode information in the lateral line of zebrafish. Half the hair cells signalled cupula motion in either direction from rest, achieving maximum sensitivity for deflections of ~40 nm in the preferred direction. The remainder rectified completely and were less sensitive, extending the operating range of the neuromast beyond 1m. Adaptation was also heterogeneous, with some hair cells generating sustained synaptic outputs and others transient. A unique signal encoded a return to rest: a transient burst from hair cells unresponsive to the initial stimulus. A mixed population of hair cells with these various transfer characteristics will allow a neuromast to encode weak stimuli as well as the amplitude and duration of stronger deflections.",

Enterocytes, which constitute the most abundant cell type, perform the diverse tasks of absorbing a wide range of nutrients while protecting the body from the harsh bacterial-rich environment. It is unknown if these tasks are equally performed by all enterocytes or whether they are spatially zonated along the villus axis3. Here, we performed whole-transcriptome measurements of laser-capture-microdissected villus segments to extract a large panel of landmark genes, expressed in a zonated manner. We used these genes to localize single sequenced enterocytes along the villus axis, thus reconstructing a global spatial expression map. We found that most enterocyte genes were zonated. Enterocytes at villi bottoms expressed an anti-bacterial Reg gene program in a microbiome-dependent manner, potentially reducing the crypt pathogen exposure. Translation, splicing and respiration genes steadily decreased in expression towards the villi tops, whereas distinct mid-top villus zones sub-specialized in the absorption of carbohydrates, peptides and fat. Enterocytes at the villi tips exhibited a unique gene-expression signature consisting of Klf4, Egfr, Neat1, Malat1, cell adhesion and purine metabolism genes. Our study exposes broad spatial heterogeneity of enterocytes, which could be important for achieving their diverse tasks.",

In mice, these axial progenitors initially reside in the epiblast, from where they form the trunk; and later relocate to the chordo-neural hinge of the tail bud to form the tail. Among them, a small group of bipotent neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are thought to generate the spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm to the end of axis elongation. The study of these progenitors, however, has proven challenging in vivo due to their small numbers and dynamic nature, and the lack of a unique molecular marker to identify them. Here, we report the generation of the Nkx1.2CreERT2 transgenic mouse line in which the endogenous Nkx1.2 promoter drives tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase. We show that Nkx1.2CreERT2 targets axial progenitors, including NMPs and early neural and mesodermal progenitors. Using a YFP reporter, we demonstrate that Nkx1.2-expressing epiblast cells contribute to all three germ layers, mostly neuroectoderm and mesoderm excluding notochord; and continue contributing neural and paraxial mesoderm tissues from the tail bud. This study identifies the Nkx1.2-expressing cell population as the source of most trunk and tail tissues in the mouse; and provides a key tool to genetically label and manipulate this progenitor population in vivo.",

We used linked data sets to examine GP and secondary care activity following calls to NHS 111, adjusting for the patient characteristics, signs and symptoms recorded during the NHS 111 call.\\n\\nSettingOut-of-hours care in three areas of North West London that have an integrated approach to delivering NHS 111 and out-of-hours GP care.\\n\\nParticipantsNHS 111 calls for children and young people aged 15 years or under. We excluded calls that were diverted to the emergency ( 999) service or where patients were advised to go to an emergency department. This left callers who were either referred to a GP or advised to manage their health needs at home.\\n\\nPrimary and secondary outcome measuresThe percentage of callers attending any emergency departments, major emergency department, or minor injury unit within ten hours of the NHS 111 call, and the percentage admitted to hospital following visits to emergency departments.\\n\\nResultsOf the 10,356 callers, 2,898 (28.0%) were advised by NHS 111 to manage their health needs at home, with an appointment with an out-of-hours GP made for the remaining 7,458 (72.0%). 14.9% (432/2,898) of the callers who were advised by NHS 111 to manage their health needs at home attended an emergency department with ten hours, compared with 16% (1,207/7,458) of callers who had an out-of-hours appointment with an out-of-hours GP. After adjusting for patient characteristics, GP out-of-hours appointment was associated with lower rates of emergency department attendance (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86, 95% CI, 0.75-0.99),). When we subset emergency department types, a GP out-of-hours appointment was associated with lower rates of minor injury unit attendance (adjusted odds ratio, 0.32, 95% CI, 0.23 - 0.44) but not major emergency department attendance (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.90-1.24). There was no association with hospital admission. Review by an NHS 111 clinical supervisor was associated with fewer emergency department attendances (adjusted OR 0.77, 95% CI, 0.62-0.97).\\n\\nConclusionsClinical input during or following out-of-hours calls to NHS 111 was associated with lower rates of emergency department utilisation for children and young people, though the reduction may be concentrated in lower intensity care settings. Thus, there may be potential to reduce the use of emergency care by providing access to clinical advice or out-of-hour services in other settings through the NHS 111 telephone service.",

But in studies of non-model organisms or ancient human samples, such data is not always available. Motivated by this, we present a new method for pairwise relatedness inference, which requires neither allele frequency information nor information on genomic position. Furthermore, it can be applied to both genotype data and to low-depth sequencing data where genotypes cannot be accurately called. We evaluate it using data from SNP arrays and low-depth sequencing from a range of human populations and show that it can be used to infer close familial relationships with a similar accuracy as a widely used method that relies on population allele frequencies.

Here we present analytical methods to efficiently fit spiking circuit models to single-trial spike trains. Using derived likelihood functions, we statistically infer the mean and variance of hidden inputs, neuronal adaptation properties and connectivity for coupled integrate-and-fire neurons. Comprehensive evaluations on synthetic data, validations using ground truth in-vitro and in-vivo recordings, and comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate that parameter estimation is very accurate and efficient, even for highly subsampled networks. Our methods bridge statistical, data-driven and theoretical, model-based neurosciences at the level of spiking circuits, for the purpose of a quantitative, mechanistic interpretation of recorded neuronal population activity.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian models of behavior have advanced the idea that humans combine prior beliefs and sensory observations to minimize uncertainty. How the brain implements Bayes-optimal inference, however, remains poorly understood. Simple behavioral tasks suggest that the brain can flexibly represent and manipulate probability distributions. An alternative view is that brain relies on simple algorithms that can implement Bayes-optimal behavior only when the computational demands are low. To distinguish between these alternatives, we devised a task in which Bayes-optimal performance could not be matched by simple algorithms. We asked subjects to estimate and reproduce a time interval by combining prior information with one or two sequential measurements. In the domain of time, measurement noise increases with duration. This property makes the integration of multiple measurements beyond the reach of simple algorithms. We found that subjects were able to update their estimates using the second measurement but their performance was suboptimal, suggesting that they were unable to update full probability distributions. Instead, subjects behavior was consistent with an algorithm that predicts upcoming sensory signals, and applies a nonlinear function to errors in prediction to update estimates. These results indicate that inference strategies humans deploy may deviate from Bayes-optimal integration when the computational demands are high.",

    "abstract": "To probe the limits of CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance, we inserted the model peptide SIINFEKL into influenza A virus (IAV) negative strand gene segments. Although IAV genomic RNA is widely considered as non-coding, there is a conserved, relatively long open reading frame present in the genomic strand of segment eight, encoding a potential protein termed NEG8. The biosynthesis of NEG8 from IAV has yet to be demonstrated. While we failed to detect NEG8 protein expression in IAV infected cells, cell surface Kb-SIINFEKL complexes are generated when SIINFEKL is genetically appended to the predicted COOH-terminus of NEG8, as shown by activation of OT-I T cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, recombinant IAV encoding SIINFEKL embedded in the negative strand of the NA-stalk coding sequence also activates OT-I T cells in vivo. Together, our findings demonstrate both the translation of sequences on the negative strand of a single stranded RNA virus and its relevance anti-viral immunosurveillance.\\n\\nSignificanceEvery gene encodes complementary information on the opposite strand that can potentially be used for immunosurveillance. In this study, we show that the influenza A virus \\\"non-coding\\\" strand translated into polypeptides during a viral infection of either cultured cells or mice that can be recognized by CD8+ T cells. Our findings raise the possibility that influenza virus uses its negative strand to generate proteins useful to the virus. More generally, it adds to a growing literature showing that immunosurveillance extends to gene sequences generally thought not to be converted into proteins. The relevance of translating this \\\"dark\\\" information extends from viral immunity to cancer immunotherapy and autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "The highly conserved habenular nuclei in the vertebrate epithalamus function as an integrating center that relaying information between the forebrain and the brain stem. These nuclei play crucial roles in modulating a broad variety of cognitive behaviors. Moreover, habenular nuclei has also attracted interest as a model for brain asymmetry, since many vertebrates exhibit left-right differences in habenular size and neural circuitry. Left-right (L/R) asymmetry is a shared feature of the central nervous system in vertebrates. Despite its prevalence and functional significance, few studies have addressed the molecular bases for the generation of the asymmetric brain structure, perhaps due to the absence of genetically accessible model animals showing robust brain asymmetry. Previous studies on zebrafish epithalamus demonstrated that Nodal signaling directs the habenular asymmetry during the early stages of development by biasing the neurogenesis on the left-side. Here, we discover a novel regulatory module involving asymmetric activation of FGF signaling that determines the timing of habenular neurogenesis by regulating cell-cycle progression of neuronal progenitors, which seamlessly integrates the L/R patterning driven by Nodal and the spatiotemporal patterning of habenular neurons.",

    "abstract": "Short AbstractUsing simple animations, mathematical formulations, and computational implementation in Matlab, we present a newly devised embryonic patterning mechanism: the Speed Regulation model, and its molecular realization: the Gradual Enhancer Switching model. We show how our models shed light on the phenomenology of insect development and evolution.\\n\\nLong AbstractPartitioning an initially homogeneous group of cells into different fates is a common problem in development. A curious case is the anterior-posterior (AP) fate specification during early embryogenesis in insects. The AP fates of most insects are specified in two different phases: (i) the blastoderm, where the AP axis does not undergo any axial elongation, and (ii) the germband, where the AP axis undergoes gradual axis elongation. Throughout evolution, insects show remarkable flexibility in the number of fates specified in the blastoderm vs germband. This hints that AP specification in insects relies on a flexible mechanism that can pattern both non-elongating embryonic structures (like the blastoderm) and elongating tissues (like the germband). Here we describe the  Speed Regulation model, a recently suggested patterning mechanism, that can pattern both elongating and non-elongating tissues and ensures the evolvability between them. The model is successful in reproducing the phenomenology of AP axis specification and evolution in insects. In addition, it explains the temporal-based patterning of other embryonic structures like the AP axis of vertebrates and the dorsoventral axis of vertebrate neural tube. The Speed Regulation model is phenomenological in its formulation, in the sense that it does not specify a particular molecular realization. We then present the  Gradual Enhancer Switching model, in which we describe a specific molecular implementation of the Speed Gradient model that incorporates a novel scheme of cis-regulation within gene regulatory networks.

    "abstract": "piRNAs (Piwi-interacting small RNAs) engage Piwi Argonautes to silence transposons and promote fertility in animal germlines. Genetic and computational studies have suggested that C. elegans piRNAs tolerate mismatched pairing and in principle could target every transcript. Here we employ in vivo cross-linking to identify transcriptome-wide interactions between piRNAs and target RNAs. We show that piRNAs engage all germline mRNAs and that piRNA binding follows microRNA-like pairing rules. Targeting correlates better with binding energy than with piRNA abundance, suggesting that piRNA concentration does not limit targeting. In mRNAs silenced by piRNAs, secondary small RNAs accumulate at the center and ends of piRNA binding sites. In germline-expressed mRNAs, however, targeting by the CSR-1 Argonaute correlates with reduced piRNA binding density and suppression of piRNA-associated secondary small RNAs. Our findings reveal physiologically important and nuanced regulation of individual piRNA targets and provide evidence for a comprehensive post transcriptional regulatory step in germline gene expression.",

How corticostriatal topography differs across cortical areas and cell types to support these distinct functions is unclear. This study contrasted corticostriatal projections from two layer 5 cell types, intratelencephalic (IT-type) and pyramidal tract (PT-type) neurons, using viral vectors expressing fluorescent reporters in Cre-driver mice. Long-range corticostriatal projections from sensory and motor cortex are somatotopic, with a decreasing somatotopic specificity as injections move from sensory to motor and frontal areas. Somatotopic organization differs between IT-type and PT-type neurons, including injections in the same site, with IT-type neurons having higher somatotopic stereotypy than PT-type neurons. Furthermore, IT-type projections from interconnected cortical areas have stronger correlations in corticostriatal targeting than PT-type projections do. Thus, as predicted by a long-standing basal ganglia model, corticostriatal projections of interconnected cortical areas form parallel circuits in basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex loops.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides commonly signal by metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In some mollusks and cnidarians, RFamide neuropeptides mediate fast ionotropic signaling by peptide-gated ion channels that belong to the DEG/ENaC family. Here we describe a neuropeptide system with a dual mode of signaling by both a peptide-gated channel and a GPCR. We identified and characterised a peptide-gated channel in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii that is specifically activated by Wamide myoinhibitory peptides derived from the same proneuropeptide. The myoinhibitory peptide-gated ion channel (MGIC) belongs to the DEG/ENaC family and is paralogous to RFamide-gated channels. Platynereis myoinhibitory peptides also activate a previously described GPCR, MAG. We measured the potency of all Wamides on both MGIC and MAG and identified peptides that preferentially activate one or the other receptor. Analysis of a single-cell transcriptome resource indicates that MGIC and MAG signal to distinct target neurons. The identification of a Wamide-gated channel suggests that peptide-gated channels are more diverse and widespread in animals than previously appreciated. The possibility of neuropeptide signaling by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to different target cells in the same organism highlights an additional level of complexity in peptidergic signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "Nerve injury often causes neuronal loss and glial proliferation, disrupting the delicate balance between neurons and glial cells in the brain. Recently, we have developed an innovative technology to convert internal reactive glial cells into functional neurons inside the mouse brain. Here, we further demonstrate that such glia-to-neuron conversion can rebalance neuron-glia ratio and reverse glial scar back to neural tissue. Specifically, using a severe stab injury model in the mouse cortex, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes significantly reduced glial reactivity and transformed toxic A1 astrocytes into less harmful astrocytes before neuronal conversion. Importantly, astrocytes were not depleted after neuronal conversion but rather repopulated due to its intrinsic proliferation capability. Remarkably, converting reactive astrocytes into neurons also significantly reduced microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Moreover, accompanying regeneration of new neurons together with repopulation of new astrocytes, blood-brain-barrier was restored and synaptic density was rescued in the injury sites. Together, these results demonstrate that glial scar can be reversed back to neural tissue through rebalancing neuron:glia ratio after glia-to-neuron conversion.",

    "abstract": "We use optical tweezers microrheology and fluorescence microscopy to characterize the nonlinear mesoscale mechanics and mobility of in vitro co-entangled actin-microtubule composites. We create a suite of randomly-oriented, well-mixed networks of actin and microtubules by co-polymerizing varying ratios of actin and tubulin in situ. To perturb each composite far from equilibrium, we use optical tweezers to displace an embedded microsphere a distance greater than the lengths of the filaments at a speed much faster than their intrinsic relaxation rates. We simultaneously measure the resistive force the filaments exert and the subsequent force relaxation. We find that the presence of a large fraction of microtubules (>0.7) is needed to substantially increase the resistive force, which is accompanied by large heterogeneities in force response. Actin minimizes these heterogeneities by reducing the mesh size of the composites and supporting microtubules against buckling. Composites also undergo a sharp transition from stress-softening to stiffening when the fraction of microtubules ({phi}T) exceeds 0.5, by microtubules suppressing actin bending fluctuations. The induced force following strain relaxes via two time-dependent power-law decays. The first decay phase, with scaling exponents that increase proportionally with the fraction of actin, signifies actin bending fluctuations. Alternatively, the second phase, with a{phi} T-independent scaling exponent of ~0.4, is indicative of filaments reptating out of deformed entanglement constraints. Corresponding mobility measurements of steady-state actin and microtubules show that both filaments are more mobile in equimolar composites ({phi}T=0.5) compared to networks of primarily actin or microtubules. This non-monotonic dependence of mobility on{phi} T, which further demonstrates the important role mesh size plays in composites, highlights the surprising emergent properties that can arise in composites.",
