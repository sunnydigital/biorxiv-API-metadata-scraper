    "abstract": "BackgroundHaplotype assembly is the process of assigning the different alleles of the variants covered by mapped sequencing reads to the two haplotypes of the genome of a human individual. Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages.\\n\\nResultsHere, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.\\n\\nAvailabilityHapCHAT is available at http://hapchat.algolab.eu under the GPL license.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of research utilizing microphysiological systems (MPSs), the need for tools that enable the physiological mimicking of the relevant cellular environment is vital. The limited ability to reproduce crucial features of the microenvironment, such as surrounding fluid flow and dynamic changes in biochemical stimuli, severely limits the types of experiments that can be carried out. Current equipment to achieve this, such as syringe and peristaltic pumps, is expensive, large, difficult to program and has limited potential for scalability. Here, we present a new pumping platform that is open-source, low-cost, modular, scalable, fully-programmable and easy to assemble that can be incorporated into cell culture systems to better recapitulate physiological environments. By controlling two commercially available piezoelectric pumps using a Raspberry Pi Zero microcontroller, the system is capable of producing arbitrary dynamic flow profiles with reliable flow rates ranging from 1 to 3,000 {micro}L/min as specified by an easily programmable Python-based script. We validated the accuracy of the flow rates, the use of time-varying profiles, and the practicality of the system by creating repeatable dynamic concentration profiles using a 3D-printed static micromixer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer is a complex, multiscale dynamical system, with interactions between tumor cells and non-cancerous host systems. Therapies act on this combined cancer-host system, sometimes with unexpected results. Systematic investigation of mechanistic computational models can augment traditional laboratory and clinical studies, helping identify the factors driving a treatments success or failure. However, given the uncertainties regarding the underlying biology, these multiscale computational models can take many potential forms, in addition to encompassing high-dimensional parameter spaces. Therefore, the exploration of these models is computationally challenging. We propose that integrating two existing technologies--one to aid the construction of multiscale agent-based models, the other developed to enhance model exploration and optimization--can provide a computational means for high-throughput hypothesis testing, and eventually, optimization.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce a high throughput computing (HTC) framework that integrates a mechanistic 3-D multicellular simulator (PhysiCell) with an extreme-scale model exploration platform (EMEWS) to investigate high-dimensional parameter spaces. We show early results in applying PhysiCell-EMEWS to 3-D cancer immunotherapy and show insights on therapeutic failure. We describe a generalized PhysiCell-EMEWS workflow for high-throughput cancer hypothesis testing, where hundreds or thousands of mechanistic simulations are compared against data-driven error metrics to perform hypothesis optimization.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile key notational and computational challenges remain, mechanistic agent-based models and high-throughput model exploration environments can be combined to systematically and rapidly explore key problems in cancer. These high-throughput computational experiments can improve our understanding of the underlying biology, drive future experiments, and ultimately inform clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The study of brain communication based on fMRI data is often limited because such measurements are a mixture of session-to-session variability with subject- and condition-related information. Disentangling these contributions is crucial for real-life applications, in particular when only a few recording sessions are available. The present study aims to define a reliable standard for the extraction of multiple signatures from fMRI data, while verifying that they do not mix information about the different modalities. In particular, condition-specific signature should not be contaminated by subject-related information. Practically, signatures correspond to subnetworks of directed interactions between brain regions (typically 100 covering the whole brain) supporting the subject and condition identification for single fMRI sessions. The key for robust prediction is using effective connectivity instead of functional connectivity. Our method demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities for subject identification in two datasets, using only a few sessions per subject as reference. Using another dataset with resting state and movie viewing, we show that the two signatures related to subjects and tasks correspond to distinct subnetworks, which are thus topologically orthogonal. Our results set solid foundations for applications tailored to individual subjects, such as clinical diagnostic.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed that solving complex reasoning problems, a key indicator of fluid intelligence, involves the same cognitive processes as solving working memory tasks. This proposal is supported by an overlap of the functional brain activations associated with the two types of tasks and by high correlations between inter-individual differences in performance. We replicated these findings in fifty-three older subjects but also showed that solving reasoning and working memory problems benefits from different configurations of the functional connectome and that this dissimilarity increases with higher difficulty load. Specifically, superior performance in a typical working memory paradigm (n-back) was associated with up-regulation of modularity (increased between-network segregation), whereas performance in the reasoning task was associated with effective down-regulation of modularity. We also showed that working memory training promotes task-invariant increases in modularity. Since superior reasoning performance is associated with down-regulation of modular dynamics, training may thus have fostered an inefficient way of solving the reasoning tasks. This could help explain why working memory training does little to promote complex reasoning performance. The study concludes that complex reasoning abilities cannot be reduced to working memory and suggests the need to reconsider the feasibility of using working memory training interventions to attempt to achieve effects that transfer to broader cognition.",

    "abstract": "Susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infection is primarily associated with previous exposure to antibiotics, which compromise the structure and function of the gut bacterial community. Specific antibiotic classes correlate more strongly with recurrent or persistent C. difficile infection. As such, we utilized a mouse model of infection to explore the effect of distinct antibiotic classes on the impact that infection has on community-level transcription and metabolic signatures shortly following pathogen colonization and how those changes may associate with persistence of C. difficile. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that C. difficile infection had significantly larger impacts on the metabolic environment across cefoperazone and streptomycin-pretreated mice, which become persistently colonized compared to clindamycin-pretreated mice where infection quickly became undetectable. Through metagenome-enabled metatranscriptomics we observed that transcripts for genes associated with carbon and energy acquisition were greatly reduced in infected animals, suggesting those niches were instead occupied by C. difficile. Furthermore, the largest changes in transcription were seen in the least abundant species indicating that C. difficile may \\\"attack the loser\\\" in gut environments where sustained infection occurs more readily. Overall, our results suggest that C. difficile is able to restructure the nutrient-niche landscape in the gut to promote persistent infection.",

    "abstract": "Primates--including humans--can typically recognize objects in visual images at a glance even in the face of naturally occurring identity-preserving image transformations (e.g. changes in viewpoint). A primary neuroscience goal is to uncover neuron-level mechanistic models that quantitatively explain this behavior by predicting primate performance for each and every image. Here, we applied this stringent behavioral prediction test to the leading mechanistic models of primate vision (specifically, deep, convolutional, artificial neural networks; ANNs) by directly comparing their behavioral signatures against those of humans and rhesus macaque monkeys. Using high-throughput data collection systems for human and monkey psychophysics, we collected over one million behavioral trials for 2400 images over 276 binary object discrimination tasks. Consistent with previous work, we observed that state-of-the-art deep, feed-forward convolutional ANNs trained for visual categorization (termed DCNNIC models) accurately predicted primate patterns of object-level confusion. However, when we examined behavioral performance for individual images within each object discrimination task, we found that all tested DCNNIC models were significantly non-predictive of primate performance, and that this prediction failure was not accounted for by simple image attributes, nor rescued by simple model modifications. These results show that current DCNNIC models cannot account for the image-level behavioral patterns of primates, and that new ANN models are needed to more precisely capture the neural mechanisms underlying primate object vision. To this end, large-scale, high-resolution primate behavioral benchmarks--such as those obtained here--could serve as direct guides for discovering such models.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecently, specific feed-forward deep convolutional artificial neural networks (ANNs) models have dramatically advanced our quantitative understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying primate core object recognition. In this work, we tested the limits of those ANNs by systematically comparing the behavioral responses of these models with the behavioral responses of humans and monkeys, at the resolution of individual images. Using these high-resolution metrics, we found that all tested ANN models significantly diverged from primate behavior. Going forward, these high-resolution, large-scale primate behavioral benchmarks could serve as direct guides for discovering better ANN models of the primate visual system.",

    "abstract": "Conrad H. Waddington discovered the phenomenon of genetic assimilation through a series of experiments on fruit flies. In those experiments, artificially exerted environmental stress induced plastic phe-notypic changes in the fruit flies, but after some generations the same phenotypic variant started to appear without the environmental stress. Both the initial state (where the phenotypic changes were environmentally induced and plastic) and the final state (where the phenotypic changes were genetically fixed and constitutive) are experimental facts. However, it remains unclear how the environmentally induced phenotypic change in the first generation becomes genetically fixed in the central process of genetic assimilation itself. We have argued that the key to understanding the mechanism of genetic assimilation lies in epigenetics, and proposed the \\\"cooperative model\\\" in which the evolutionary process depends on both genetic and epigenetic factors. Evolutionary simulations based on the cooperative model reproduced the process of genetic assimilation. Detailed analysis of the trajectories has revealed genetic assimilation is a process in which epigenetically induced phe-notypic changes are incrementally and statistically replaced with multiple minor genetic mutations through natural selection. In this scenario, epigenetic and genetic changes may be considered as mutually independent but equivalent in terms of their effects on phenotypic changes. This finding rejects the common (and confused) hypothesis that epigenetically induced phe-notypic changes depend on genetic mutations. Furthermore, we argue that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is not required for evolution by genetic assimilation.",

    "abstract": "During development, cell fate decisions are often highly stochastic, but with the frequency of the different possible fates tightly controlled. To understand how signaling networks control the cell fate frequency of such random decisions, we studied the stochastic decision of the Caenorhabditis elegans P3.p cell to either fuse to the hypodermis or assume vulva precursor cell fate. Using time-lapse microscopy to measure the single-cell dynamics of two key inhibitors of cell fusion, the Hox gene LIN-39 and Wnt signaling through the {beta}-catenin BAR-1, we uncovered significant variability in the dynamics of LIN-39 and BAR-1 levels. Most strikingly, we observed that BAR-1 accumulated in a single, 1-4 hour pulse at the time of the P3.p cell fate decision, with strong variability both in pulse slope and time of pulse onset. We found that the time of BAR-1 pulse onset was delayed relative to the time of cell fusion in mutants with low cell fusion frequency, linking BAR-1 pulse timing to cell fate outcome. Overall, a model emerged where animal-to-animal variability in LIN-39 levels and BAR-1 pulse dynamics biases cell fate by modulating their absolute level at the time cell fusion is induced. Our results highlight that timing of cell signaling dynamics, rather than its average level or amplitude, could play an instructive role in determining cell fate.\\n\\nArticle summaryWe studied the stochastic decision of the Caenorhabditis elegans P3.p cell to either fuse to the hypodermis or assume vulva precursor cell fate.

One unique characteristic of cetaceans, contributing to this adaptive success, is efficient lipid utilization. Here we report comparative genetic analysis of aquatic and terrestrial Cetartiodactyla using 144 genes associated with lipid metabolism. We analyzed mutation rate, amino acid substitution, and metabolic pathways using genetic data publicly available. Our test detected 18 positively selected genes in Cetacea compared to 13 in Bovidae with little overlap between the lineages. We identified lineage-specific patterns of amino acid substitutions and functional domain that were mutually exclusive between cetaceans and bovids, supporting divergent evolution of lipid metabolism since the divergence of these taxa from a common ancestor. Moreover, a pathway analysis showed that the identified genes in cetaceans were associated with lipid digestion, lipid storage, and energy producing pathways. This study emphasizes the evolutionary context of lipid metabolism modification of cetaceans and provides a foundation for future studies of elucidating the adapted biological mechanisms of cetacean lipid metabolism and a framework for incorporating ecological context into studies aimed at investigating adaptive evolution.",

By applying this novel method to a perceptual template-matching task, we tracked representational brain states associated with the cascade of neural processing, from early sensory areas to higher-order areas that are involved in integration and decision-making. We address a major limitation of the traditional decoding approach: that it relies on consistent timing of these processes over trials. Using a temporally unconstrained decoding analysis approach, we found that the timing of the cognitive processes involved in perceptual judgements can vary considerably over trials. This revealed that the sequence of processing states was consistent for all subjects and trials, even when the timing of these states varied. Furthermore, we found that the specific timing of states on each trial was related to the quality of performance over trials.",

    "abstract": "Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into NE pathogenesis, microbiome relationships, and host responses. Here we reported that the metabolic byproduct of microbial metabolism of bile acids to deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 M, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenge strongly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and lamina propria immune cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into villi without significantly altering the bacterial luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA reduced inflammatory mediators of Inf{gamma}, Litaf (Tnf), Il1{beta}, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanically, C. perfringens induced elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines of Inf{gamma}, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (COX-2 gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin attenuated INF{gamma}- or TNFa-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistently, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet resisted against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and villus apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through curbing inflammatory response. These novel findings could serve as a stepping-stone for developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.",

    "abstract": "NDP52 and TAX1BP1, two SKICH domain-containing autophagy recetpors, play crucial roles in selective autophagy. The autophagic functions of NDP52 and TAX1BP1 are regulated by TBK1, which can indirectly associate with them through the adaptor protein NAP1. However, the molecular mechanism governing the interactions of NAP1 with NDP52 and TAX1BP1 as well as the effects induced by TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of NDP52 and TAX1BP1 remain elusive. Here, we reported the first atomic structures of the SKICH regions of NDP52 and TAX1BP1 in complex with NAP1, which not only uncover the mechanismtic basis underpinning the specific interactions of NAP1 with NDP52 and TAX1BP1, but also reveal the first binding mode of a SKICH domain. Moreover, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation of TAX1BP1 SKICH mediated by TBK1 may regulate the interaction between TAX1BP1 and NAP1. In all, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the NAP1-mediated recruitments of TBK1 to NDP52 and TAX1BP1, and are valuable for further understanding the functions of these proteins in selective autophagy.",

Standard association analyses were performed supplemented by a framework of sensitivity analyses. Variants in PDE4B showed consistent association with ASRD across a wide range of our analyses. In mice models, alternations in PDE4B expression were observed in those mice displaying anxious behavior after exposure to chronic stress. We also showed that 28% of the variance in ASRD was accounted for by common variants and that the genetic signature of ASRD overlapped with psychiatric traits, educational outcomes, obesity-related phenotypes, smoking, and reproductive success.",

However, the effect of heat shock in the stem cells is not fully understood. Oct4 is a tightly regulated master regulator of pluripotency maintenance in stem cells and during early embryonic development. We report here that Oct4 protein level was significantly reduced under heat shock in mouse blastocysts and embryonic stem cells. The reduction in Oct4 in the mouse embryonic stem cells under heat shock was mediated by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that was dependent on the activity of death- associated protein kinase 1 (Dapk1) to phosphorylate its substrate, Pin1. Our results imply that the depletion of Oct4 via brief heat shock, such as a high fever, during early pregnancy might severely impair the growth of the mammalian embryo or even cause its death.",

Decoupling the two effects and studying various alterations to the membranes mechanical parameters is important for understanding cholesterols role in cellular response to stress. By mapping membrane height fluctuations in single cells, we report that M{beta}CD treatment reduces temporal fluctuations and flattens out the membrane - but does not supress activity-driven fluctuations. We find that membrane tension increase contributes most to the altered fluctuations, among the multiple mechanical parameters computed. Maps also reveal an enhanced long-range heterogeneity within single cells, both in amplitude of fluctuations and membrane tension on cholesterol depletion. To check if this alters the tenacity of membrane to mechanical stress we use hypo-osmotic shock. We find that on M{beta}CD treatment, cells are more prone to rupture than control cells, and this is not hindered by actomyosin perturbations. We report increased rupture sizes on cholesterol depletion and argue that, together, this indicates decreased lysis and line tension. Therefore, we show that cholesterol depletion directly affects cell membranes not only by enhancing membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, but also by increasing membrane tension while reducing lysis tension - hence making cells prone to rupture.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidy is comparatively prevalent in amphibians and fishes, but is infrequent in animals because of lethality after implantation. On the contrary, tetraploid embryos normally develop into blastocysts, and embryonic stem cells can be established from tetraploid blastocysts in mice. Thus, polyploidization does not seem to be so harmful during preimplantation development. However, the mechanisms by which early mammalian development accepts polyploidization are still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effect of polyploidization on early mammalian development and to further comprehend its tolerability using hyperpolyploid embryos produced by artificial, repetitive whole genome duplication. Therefore, we successfully established several types of polyploid embryos (tetraploid, octaploid, and hexadecaploid), produced using repeated electrofusion of two-cell embryos in mice, and studied their developmental potential in vitro. We demonstrated that all types of these polyploid embryos maintained the ability to develop to the blastocyst stage, which implies that mammalian cells might have basic cellular functions in implanted embryos, despite polyploidization. However, the inner cell mass was absent in the hexadecaploid blastocysts. To complement the total cells in blastocysts, a fused hexadecaploid embryo was produced by aggregating a number of hexadecaploid embryos. The results indicated that the fused hexadecaploid embryo finally recovered pluripotent cells in blastocysts. Thus, our findings suggested that early mammalian embryos may have the tolerability and higher plasticity to adapt to hyperpolyploidization for blastocyst formation, despite intense alteration of the genome volume.",

For mechanisms, we review models that capture the effects of losing dopamine on basal ganglia function; for dynamics, we discuss models that have transformed our understanding of how beta-band (15-30 Hz) oscillations arise in the parkinsonian basal ganglia. For treatments, we touch on the breadth of computational modelling work trying to understand the therapeutic actions of deep brain stimulation. Collectively, models from across all levels of description are providing a compelling account of the causes, symptoms, and treatments for Parkinsons disease.",

Here we show that FtsZ, central element of the division ring in most bacteria, forms condensates when in complex with SlmA, the protein preventing septal ring assembly nearby the chromosome in E. coli. The formation of condensates is promoted by crowding and enhanced by sequence-specific binding of SlmA to DNA. These structures are dynamic and FtsZ within them remains active for GTP-triggered fiber formation. Their location is sensitive to compartmentalization and to the presence of a membrane boundary in microfluidics-based cell mimetic systems, likely affecting their reactivity. We propose that reversible condensation may play a role in the modulation of FtsZ assembly and/or location by SlmA and, hence, in the regulation of ring stability, constituting a singular example of a prokaryotic nucleoprotein complex exhibiting this kind of phase transition.",

In growing leaf tissue of plants exposed to mannitol-induced stress, a highly-interconnected gene regulatory network is induced. However, early signaling and associated protein phosphorylation events that likely precede part of these transcriptional changes are largely unknown. Here, we performed a full proteome and phosphoproteome analysis on growing leaf tissue of Arabidopsis plants exposed to mild mannitol-induced stress and captured the fast (within the first half hour) events associated with this stress. Based on this in-depth data analysis, 167 and 172 differentially regulated proteins and phosphorylated sites were found back, respectively.

Here, we propose that phenomenology in the visual periphery can be characterized by an inflated sense of perceptual capacity, as observers overestimate the quality of their perceptual inputs. Distinct from the well-known perceptual phenomenon of \\\"filling-in\\\" where perceptual content is generated or completed endogenously, inflation can be characterized by incorrect introspection at the subjective level. The perceptual content itself may be absent or weak (i.e., not necessarily filled-in), and yet such content is mistakenly regarded by the system as rich. Behaviorally, this can be reflected by metacognitive deficits in the degree to which confidence judgments track task accuracy, and decisional biases for observers to think particular items are present, even when they are not. In two experiments using paradigms which exploit unique attributes of peripheral vision (crowding and summary statistics), we provide evidence that both types of deficits are present in peripheral vision, as observers reports are marked by overconfidence in discrimination judgments and high numbers of false alarms in detection judgments. We discuss potential mechanisms which may be the cause of inflation and propose future experiments to further explore this unique sensory phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) were initially associated with transcriptional control through their methylation of histones and other nuclear proteins, but have since been found to regulate many other cellular activities. The apical complex lysine (K) methyltransferase (AKMT) of the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii was recently shown to play a critical role in regulating cellular motility. Here we report a 2.1-[A] resolution crystal structure of the conserved and functional C-terminal portion (aa289-709) of T. gondii AKMT. AKMT dimerizes via a unique intermolecular interface mediated by the C-terminal TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat)-like domain together with a specific zinc-binding motif that is absent from all other KMTs. Disruption of AKMT dimerization impaired both its enzyme activity and parasite egress from infected host cells in vivo. Structural comparisons reveal that AKMT is related to the KMTs in the SMYD family, with, however, a number of distinct structural features in addition to the unusual dimerization interface. These features are conserved among the apicomplexan parasites and their free-living relatives, but not found in any known KMTs in animals. AKMT therefore is the founding member of a new subclass of KMT that has important implications for the evolution of the apicomplexans.",

    "abstract": "Plants are valuable resources for a variety of products in modern societies. Plant species identification is an integral part of research and practical application on plants. In parallel with high-throughput sequencing technology, the high-throughput screening of species is in high demand. Highly accurate and efficient DNA-based marker identification is essential for the effective analysis of plant species or biological constituents of a mixture of plants as well. Therefore, it is of general interests and significance to generate a comprehensive and accurate DNA-based marker sequence resource, as well as to build efficient sequence search engines, for the accurate and fast identification of plant species.\\n\\nIn this work, we have firstly established a high-quality ITS2 sequence database of plant species containing more than 150,000 entries, through the systematical collection and manually collation of the published ITS2 sequencing data of plant species, data quality control, as well as representative sequence refinement based on clustering method. Secondly, an accurate and efficient plant species identification system based on ITS2 sequence was constructed, which is the proper combination of sequence search algorithms including BLAST and Kraken. Through the deployment of high-performance and frequently updated web service, its expected to serve for a wide range of researchers involving the taxonomy classification of plant species, as well as for deciphering of plant mixed systems including herbal materials in TCM preparations.\\n\\nThe Holmes-ITS2 web service is freely accessible at: http://its2.tcm.microbioinformatics.org/. The input of this web service could be multiple sequences in a single fasta format, to search for matching ITS2 biomarker sequences already annotated in the database. This sequence-based search is based on two engines: BLAST, and k-mer based Kraken. Alternatively, users can directly search for species name for the corresponding ITS2 biomarker sequences. The web service has been put to the test by more than 50 experts from China, Denmark and US, and the average running time for the search ranges from 3-30 seconds for up to 100 sequences as a batch query.",

    "abstract": "Tumour purity is defined as the proportion of cancer cells in the tumour tissue. The impact of tumour purity on colon cancer (CC) prognosis, genetic profile and microenvironment has not been thoroughly accessed. Therefore, clinical and transcriptomic data from three public datasets, GSE17536/17537, GSE39582, and TCGA were retrospectively collected (n = 1248). Tumour purity of each sample was inferred by a computational method based on transcriptomic data. Stage III and MMR-deficient (dMMR) CC patients showed a significantly lower tumour purity. Low purity CC conferred worse survival and tumour purity was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, high tumour purity CC patients benefited more from adjuvant chemotherapy. Subsequent genomic analysis found that the mutation burden was negatively associated with tumour purity with only APC and KRAS significantly more mutated in high purity CC. However, no somatic copy number alteration event was correlated with tumour purity. Furthermore, immune-related pathways and immunotherapy-associated markers (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIM-3) were highly enriched in low purity samples. Notably, the relative proportion of M2 macrophages and neutrophils, which indicated worse survival in CC, was negatively associated with tumour purity. Therefore, tumour purity exhibited potential value for CC prognostic stratification as well as adjuvant chemotherapy benefit prediction. The relative worse survival in low purity CC may attribute to higher mutation frequency in key pathways and purity related microenvironmental changing.\\n\\nSummaryLow purity colon cancer patients conferred worse survival and benefited less from adjuvant chemotherapy. The mutation burden was negatively associated with tumour purity. Low purity samples exhibited intense immune phenotype with more M2 macrophages and neutrophils infiltration.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila key developmental transitions are governed by the steroid hormone ecdysone. A number of neuropeptide-activated signalling pathways control ecdysone production in response to environmental signals, including the insulin signalling pathway, which regulates ecdysone production in response to nutrition. Here, we find that the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin-like protein Torso-like, best characterised for its role in activating the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase in early embryo patterning, also regulates the insulin signalling pathway in Drosophila. We previously reported that the small body size and developmental delay phenotypes of torso-like null mutants resemble those observed when insulin signalling is reduced. Here we report that, in addition to growth defects, torso-like mutants also display metabolic and nutritional plasticity phenotypes characteristic of mutants with impaired insulin signalling. We further find that in the absence of torso-like the expression of insulin-like peptides is increased, as is their accumulation in the insulin-producing cells. Finally, we show that Torso-like is a component of the hemolymph and that it is required in the prothoracic gland to control developmental timing and body size. Taken together, our data suggest that the secretion of Torso-like from the prothoracic gland influences the activity of insulin signalling throughout the body in Drosophila.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYIn many animals distinct developmental transitions are crucial for the coordinated progression from the juvenile stage to adulthood. In Drosophila, the transition from an immature larva into a reproductively mature adult is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone. Several neuropeptide-activated signalling pathways, including the insulin signalling pathway, regulate ecdysone production in response to environmental cues. Here we find that the perforin-like protein Torso-like regulates the insulin signalling pathway. We show that Torso-like is secreted into circulation where it acts to influence insulin-like peptide activity, revealing a novel mechanism for the regulation of insulin signalling in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial species use the MecA/ClpCP proteolytic system to block entry into genetic competence. In Streptococcus mutans, MecA/ClpCP degrades ComX (also called SigX), an alternative sigma factor for the comY operon and other late competence genes. Although the mechanism of MecA/ClpCP has been studied in multiple Streptococcus species, its role within noisy competence pathways is poorly understood. S. mutans competence can be triggered by two different peptides, CSP and XIP, but it is not known whether MecA/ClpCP acts similarly for both stimuli, how it affects competence heterogeneity, and how its regulation is overcome. We have studied the effect of MecA/ClpCP on the activation of comY in individual S. mutans cells. Our data show that MecA/ClpCP is active under both XIP and CSP stimulation, that it provides threshold control of comY, and that it adds noise in comY expression. Our data agree quantitatively with a model in which MecA/ClpCP prevents adventitious entry into competence by sequestering or intercepting low levels of ComX. Competence is permitted when ComX levels exceed a threshold, but cell-to-cell heterogeneity in MecA levels creates variability in that threshold. Therefore MecA/ClpCP provides a stochastic switch, located downstream of the already noisy comX, that enhances phenotypic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Oscillatory neural activity is a fundamental characteristic of the mammalian brain spanning multiple levels of spatial and temporal scale. Current theories of neural oscillations and analysis techniques employed to investigate their functional significance are based on an often implicit assumption: In the absence of experimental manipulation, the spectral content of any given EEG- or MEG-recorded neural oscillator remains approximately stationary over the course of a typical experimental session (~1 hour), spontaneously fluctuating only around its dominant frequency. Here, we examined this assumption for ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha-band (8:13 Hz). We found that alpha peak frequency systematically decreased over time, while alpha-power increased. Intriguingly, these systematic changes showed partial independence of each other: Statistical source separation (independent component analysis) revealed that while some alpha components displayed concomitant power increases and peak frequency decreases, other components showed either unique power increases or frequency decreases. Interestingly, we also found these components to differ in frequency. Components that showed mixed frequency/power changes oscillated primarily in the lower alpha-band (~8-10Hz), while components with unique changes oscillated primarily in the higher alpha-band (~9-13Hz). Our findings provide novel clues on the time-varying intrinsic properties of large-scale neural networks as measured by M/EEG, with implications for the analysis and interpretation of studies that aim at identifying functionally relevant oscillatory networks or at driving them through external stimulation.",

    "abstract": "While extra-personal space is often erroneously considered as a unique entity, early neuropsychological studies report a dissociation between near and far space processing both in humans and in monkeys. Here, we use functional MRI in a naturalistic 3D environment to describe the non-human primate near and far space cortical networks. We describe the co-occurrence of two extended functional networks respectively dedicated to near and far space processing. Specifically, far space processing involves occipital, temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate as well as orbitofrontal regions not activated by near space, possibly subserving the processing of the shape and identity of objects. In contrast, near space processing involves temporal, parietal and prefrontal regions not activated by far space, possibly subserving the preparation of an arm/hand mediated action in this proximal space. Interestingly, this network also involves somatosensory regions, suggesting a cross-modal anticipation of touch by a nearby object. Last, we also describe cortical regions that process both far and near space with a preference for one or the other. This suggests a continuous encoding of relative distance to the body, in the form of a far-to-near gradient. We propose that these cortical gradients in space representation subserve the physically delineable peripersonal spaces described in numerous psychology and psychophysics studies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LINear space processing involves temporal, parietal and prefrontal regions.\\nC_LIO_LIFar space activates occipital, temporal, parietal, cingulate & orbitofrontal areas.\\nC_LIO_LIMost regions process both far & near space, with a preference for one or the other.\\nC_LIO_LIFar-to-near gradient may subserve behavioral changes in peripersonal space size.\\nC_LI",

Oscillatory activity has been suggested to play a role in neural binding, and more recently in the maintenance of information in working memory. This latter work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a \"code\" in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role in essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics may play a critical role in facilitating properties of working memory, including transitions between different memory states and a multi-item working memory capacity. We also show these oscillatory dynamics may facilitate and provide an underlying mechanism to enable a range of different types of binding in the context of working memory.",

Here we report a novel analysis tool for high-resolution, non-invasive measurement of sleep pressure and depth from movement data. Probability of transitioning to an active state, P(Wake), measures sleep depth while probability of transitioning to an inactive state, P(Doze), measures sleep pressure. In vivo and computational analyses show that P(Wake) and P(Doze) are independent and control the amount of total sleep. Importantly, we demonstrate that these probabilities are tied to specific biological processes. Genetic and environmental perturbations demonstrate that a given amount of sleep can be produced by many combinations of underlying P(Wake) and P(Doze). We show that measuring sleep pressure and depth continuously, without disturbing on-going behavior, provides greater mechanistic insight into behavior than measuring the amount of sleep alone.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels provide a universal mechanism for sensing and responding to increased membrane tension. MscS-Like(MSL)10 is a relatively well-studied MS ion channel from Arabidopsis thaliana that is implicated in cell death signaling. The relationship between the amino acid sequence of MSL10 and its conductance, gating tension, and opening and closing kinetics remain unstudied. Here we identify several nonpolar residues in the presumptive pore-lining transmembrane helix of MSL10 (TM6) that contribute to these basic channel properties. F553 and I554 are essential for wild type channel conductance and the stability of the open state. G556, a glycine residue located at a predicted kink in TM6, is essential for channel conductance. The increased tension sensitivity of MSL10 compared to close homolog MSL8 may be attributed to F563, but other channel characteristics appear to be dictated by more global differences in structure. Finally, MSL10 F553V and MSL10 G556V provided the necessary tools to establish that MSL10s ability to trigger cell death is independent of its ion channel function.",

    "abstract": "The field of evidence synthesis is growing rapidly, with a corresponding increase in the number of software tools and workflows to support the construction of systematic reviews, systematic maps, and meta-analyses. Despite much progress, however, a number of problems remain including slow integration of new statistical or methodological approaches into user-friendly software, low prevalence of open-source software, and poor integration among distinct software tools. These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the research community. Here I present revtools, an R package to support article screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import and de-duplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further methods to support article screening to be added over time. Revtools provides free access to novel methods in an open-source environment, and represents a valuable step in expanding the capacity of R to support evidence synthesis projects.",

This fundamental cognitive property has been evidenced in different multicellular species, from cephalopods to Humans, but never in individual cells. Here, following Pavlovs experiments with dogs that founded the principles of classical conditioning, we have observed the development of an associative memory in Amoeba proteus, which corresponds to the emergence of a new systemic motility pattern. In our cellular version of this conditioning behavior, we have used a controlled direct current electric field as the conditioned stimulus and a specific chemotactic peptide as the non-conditioned stimulus. Our study allowed us to demonstrate that Amoeba proteus are capable of linking two independent past events, and the induced associative memory can be recorded for up to at least four hours. For the first time, it has been observed that a systemic response to a specific stimulus can be modified by learning in unicellular organisms. This finding opens up a new framework in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the complex systemic behavior involved in the cellular migration and the adaptive capacity of cells to the external medium.",

For example, while we know that the rich mental phenomena of humans and other animals are mediated by complex systems of neural circuits in the brain, the mechanistic links between these biological networks and the functions that they mediate are poorly understood. Here we present a novel class of methods, termed multivariate directed connectivity analysis, to investigate network dynamics via patterns of directed interactions between network nodes. We validate these methods using simulated data and apply them to three real-world datasets, two neuroscientific and one investigating the 2016 US presidential candidates influence on the social media service Twitter.

    "abstract": "Models describing the process of stem-cell differentiation are plentiful, and may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms and experimentally observed behaviour. Waddingtons epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes-- change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signalling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.",

To help address this problem, we have performed proof-of-principle studies with generative adversarial networks, a form of artificial intelligence, to denoise individual particles. This approach effectively recovers global structural information for both synthetic and real cryo-EM data, facilitating per-particle assessment from noisy raw images.

    "abstract": "MotivationThe explosive increase of biomedical literature has made information extraction an increasingly important tool for biomedical research. A fundamental task is the recognition of biomedical named entities in text (BNER) such as genes/proteins, diseases, and species. Recently, a domain-independent method based on deep learning and statistical word embeddings, called long short-term memory network-conditional random field (LSTM-CRF), has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art entity-specific BNER tools. However, this method is dependent on gold-standard corpora (GSCs) consisting of hand-labeled entities, which tend to be small but highly reliable. An alternative to GSCs are silver-standard corpora (SSCs), which are generated by harmonizing the annotations made by several automatic annotation systems. SSCs typically contain more noise than GSCs but have the advantage of containing many more training examples. Ideally, these corpora could be combined to achieve the benefits of both, which is an opportunity for transfer learning. In this work, we analyze to what extent transfer learning improves upon state-of-the-art results for BNER.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate that transferring a deep neural network (DNN) trained on a large, noisy SSC to a smaller, but more reliable GSC significantly improves upon state-of-the-art results for BNER. Compared to a state-of-the-art baseline evaluated on 23 GSCs covering four different entity classes, transfer learning results in an average reduction in error of approximately 11%. We found transfer learning to be especially beneficial for target data sets with a small number of labels (approximately 6000 or less).\\n\\nAvailability and implementationSource code for the LSTM-CRF is available at https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/NeuroNER/ and links to the corpora are available at https://github.com/BaderLab/Transfer-Learning-BNER-Bioinformatics-2018/.\\n\\nContactjohn.giorgi@utoronto.ca\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the secondary structure of an RNA sequence with speed and accuracy is useful in many applications such as drug design. The state-of-the-art predictors have a fundamental limitation: they have a run time that scales cubically with the length of the input sequence, which is slow for longer RNAs and limits the use of secondary structure prediction in genome-wide applications. To address this bottleneck, we designed the first linear-time algorithm for this problem. which can be used with both thermodynamic and machine-learned scoring functions. Our algorithm, like previous work, is based on dynamic programming (DP), but with two crucial differences: (a) we incrementally process the sequence in a left-to-right rather than in a bottom-up fashion, and (b) because of this incremental processing, we can further employ beam search pruning to ensure linear run time in practice (with the cost of exact search). Even though our search is approximate, surprisingly, it results in even higher overall accuracy on a diverse database of sequences with known structures. More interestingly, it leads to significantly more accurate predictions on the longest sequence families in that database (16S and 23S Ribosomal RNAs), as well as improved accuracies for long-range base pairs (500+ nucleotides apart).",

While the dynamics of frequent variants are affected by the fitness of each variant, the rare variants cloud is affected by more complex genetic factors, including context dependent mutations. It serves as a spearhead for the viral populations movement within the adaptive landscape. We here use an experimental evolution system to show that the genetic cloud surrounding the Coxsackie virus master sequence slowly, but steadily, evolves over hundreds of generations. The evolution of the rare variants cloud often precedes the appearance of high frequency variants. The rare variants clouds evolution is driven by a combination of a context-dependent mutation pattern and selection for and against specific nucleotide compositions.This combination affects the mutated dinucleotide distribution, and eventually leads to a non-uniform dinucleotide distribution in the main viral sequence. We then tested these conclusions on other RNA viruses with similar conclusions.",

We developed a protocol for family-based analysis, annotation, filtering, visualization of WGS based CNV calls, and deployed this across a clinical cohort of 79 rare and undiagnosed cases.\\n\\nResultsWe found that CNV calls from WGS are at least as sensitive as those from microarrays, while only creating a modest increase in the number of variants interpreted (~10 CNVs per case). We identified clinically significant CNVs in 15% of the first 79 cases analyzed. This pipeline also enabled identification of cases of uniparental disomy (UPD) and a 50% mosaic trisomy 14. Directed analysis of some CNVs enabled break-point level resolution of genomic rearrangements and phasing of de-novo CNVs.\\n\\nConclusionRobust identification of CNVs by WGS is possible within a clinical testing environment, and further developments will bring improvements in resolution of smaller and more complex CNVs.",

    "abstract": "The most commonly employed mammalian model organism is the laboratory mouse. A wide variety of genetically diverse inbred mouse strains, representing distinct physiological states, disease susceptibilities, and biological mechanisms have been developed over the last century. We report full length draft de novo genome assemblies for 16 of the most widely used inbred strains and reveal for the first time extensive strain-specific haplotype variation. We identify and characterise 2,567 regions on the current Genome Reference Consortium mouse reference genome exhibiting the greatest sequence diversity between strains. These regions are enriched for genes involved in defence and immunity, and exhibit enrichment of transposable elements and signatures of recent retrotransposition events. Combinations of alleles and genes unique to an individual strain are commonly observed at these loci, reflecting distinct strain phenotypes. Several immune related loci, some in previously identified QTLs for disease response have novel haplotypes not present in the reference that may explain the phenotype. We used these genomes to improve the mouse reference genome resulting in the completion of 10 new gene structures, and 62 new coding loci were added to the reference genome annotation. Notably this high quality collection of genomes revealed a previously unannotated gene (Efcab3-like) encoding 5,874 amino acids, one of the largest known in the rodent lineage. Interestingly, Efcab3-like-/- mice exhibit severe size anomalies in four regions of the brain suggesting a mechanism of Efcab3-like regulating brain development.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal salience processing has been suggested to contribute to the formation of positive psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and related conditions. Previous research utilising reward learning or anticipation paradigms has demonstrated cortical and subcortical abnormalities in people with psychosis, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum. In these paradigms, reward prediction errors attribute motivational salience to stimuli. However, little is known about possible abnormalities across different forms of salience processing in psychosis patients, and whether any such abnormalities involve the dopaminergic midbrain. The aim of our study was, therefore, to investigate possible alterations in psychosis in neural activity in response to various forms of salience: novelty, negative emotion, targetness (task-driven salience) and rareness/deviance. We studied 14 antipsychotic naive participants with first episode psychosis, and 37 healthy volunteers. During fMRI scanning, participants performed a visual oddball task containing these four forms of salience. Psychosis patients showed abnormally reduced signalling in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) for novelty, negative emotional salience and targetness; reduced striatal and occipital (lingual gyrus) signalling to novelty and negative emotional salience, reduced signalling in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex and parahippocamal gyrus to negative emotional salience, and reduced cerebellar signalling to novelty and negative emotional salience. Our results indicate alterations of several forms of salience processing in patients with psychosis in the midbrain SN/VTA, with additional subcortical and cortical regions also showing alterations in salience signalling, the exact pattern of alterations depending on the form of salience in question.",

    "abstract": "Spreading depression or depolarization is a large-scale pathological brain phenomenon related to migraine, stroke, hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. Once initiated, spreading depression propagates across gray matter extruding potassium and other active molecules, collapsing the resting membrane electro-chemical gradient of cells leading to spike inactivation and cellular swelling, and propagates independently of synaptic transmission. We demonstrate the modulation, suppression and prevention of spreading depression utilizing applied transcortical DC electric fields in brain slices, measured with intrinsic optical imaging and potassium dye epifluorescence. We experimentally observe a surface-positive electric field induced forcing of spreading depression propagation to locations in cortex deeper than the unmodulated propagation path, whereby further propagation is confined and arrested even after field termination. The opposite surface-negative electric field polarity produces an increase in propagation velocity and a confinement of the wave to more superficial layers of cortex than the unmodulated propagation path. These field polarities are of opposite sign to the polarity that blocks neuronal spiking and seizures, and are consistent with biophysical models of spreading depression. The results demonstrate the potential feasibility of electrical control and prevention of spreading depression.",

    "abstract": "In speech, linguistic information is conveyed redundantly by many simultaneously present acoustic dimensions, such as fundamental frequency, duration and amplitude. Listeners show stable tendencies to prioritize these acoustic dimensions differently, relative to one another, which suggests individualized speech perception  strategies. However, it is unclear what drives these strategies, and more importantly, what impact they have on diverse aspects of communication. Here we show that such individualized perceptual strategies can be related to individual differences in perceptual ability. In a cue weighting experiment, we first demonstrate that individuals with a severe pitch perception deficit (congenital amusics) categorize linguistic stimuli similarly to controls when their deficit is unrelated to the main distinguishing cue for that category (in this case, durational or temporal cues). In contrast, in a prosodic task where pitch-related cues are typically more informative, amusics place less importance on this pitch-related information when categorizing speech. Instead, they relied more on duration information. Crucially, these differences in perceptual weights were observed even when pitch-related differences were large enough to be perceptually distinct to amusic listeners. In a second set of experiments involving musical and prosodic phrase interpretation, we found that this reliance on duration information allowed amusics to overcome their perceptual deficits and perceive both speech and music successfully. These results suggest that successful speech - and potentially music - comprehension is achieved through multiple perceptual strategies whose underlying weights may in part reflect individuals perceptual abilities.",

Conclusions References Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have an increasing age-related prevalence of Alzheimers disease (AD). In DS, the triplication of amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21 contributes to a life-long accumulation of brain amyloid (A{beta}) [1]. Dyshomeostasis of A{beta} has emerged as one of the most well-validated factors in the pathogenesis of AD [2]. By age 40 years, virtually all individuals with DS have amyloid plaques and tau tangles, hallmark pathologies that are characteristic of sporadic AD in the general population [3]. Dementia, while not inevitable in DS, increases significantly in prevalence with age to over 75% after age 65 years. [ ...",

    "abstract": "A network is one of the most convenient way to represent interactions between biological entities in systems biology. A network of molecular interactions is a graph in which the vertices are biological component and the edges correspond to the interactions between them. Many notions and approaches for network analysis came to systems biology from the theory of graphs - a field of mathematics that study graphs. We focused on the study of the shortest path approach in this work. We investigated whether this approach yields valid molecular paths. To perform this, the shortest paths in the human interactome (derived from HPRD and HIPPIE databases) were found between all relevant combinations of proteins taken from eight well-studied highly conserved signaling pathways from the KEGG database (NF-kappa B, MAPK, Jak-STAT, mTOR, ErbB, Wnt, TGF-beta and the signaling part of the apoptotic process). Canonical paths were systematically compared with the shortest counterparts and centrality of vertices and paths in subnetworks induced by the shortest paths were analyzed. We found that the sets of the shortest paths contain the canonical counterparts only for very short canonical paths (length 2-3 interactions). We also found that high centrality vertices tend to belong to canonical counterparts, to less extent this can also be said about high centrality paths.",

    "abstract": "Molecular tension sensors have contributed to a growing understanding of mechanobiology. However, the limited dynamic range and inability to specify the mechanical sensitivity of these sensors has hindered their widespread use in diverse contexts. Here, we systematically examine the components of tension sensors that can be altered to improve their functionality. Guided by the development of a first principles model describing the mechanical behavior of these sensors, we create a collection of sensors that exhibit predictable sensitivities and significantly improved performance in cellulo. Utilized in the context of vinculin mechanobiology, a trio of these new biosensors with distinct force- and extension- sensitivities reveal that an extension-based control paradigm regulates vinculin loading. To enable the rational design of molecular tension sensors appropriate for diverse applications, we predict the mechanical behavior, in terms of force and extension, of additional 1020 distinct designs.",

    "abstract": "In meiosis, crossovers between homologous chromosomes link them together. This enables them to attach to microtubules of the meiotic spindle as a unit, such that the homologs will be pulled away from one another at anaphase I. Homologous pairs can sometimes fail to become linked by crossovers. In some organisms, these non-exchange partners are still able segregate properly. In several organisms, associations between the centromeres of non-exchange partners occur in meiotic prophase. These associations have been proposed to promote segregation in meiosis I. But how centromere pairing could promote subsequent proper segregation is unclear. Here we report that meiotic centromere pairing if chromosomes in mouse spermatocytes allows the formation of an association between chromosome pairs. We find that peri-centromeric heterochromatin connections tether the centromeres of chromosome pairs after dissolution of centromere paring. Our results suggest that, in mouse spermatocytes, heterochromatin maintains the association of chromosome centromeres in the absence crossing-over.",
